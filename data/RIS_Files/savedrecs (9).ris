AB  - In 2002, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted a decision "to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss." Comprehensive assessment of the progress toward this "significant reduction" is rare at the national level. We therefore developed national indicators and time-series data sets to evaluate whether China had made progress toward the 2010 biodiversity target, and found that considerable progress has been made: Forest resources have increased stably since 1989, the integrity of marine ecosystems has improved since 1997, water quality has remained stable, and desertified land is less extensive than it used to be as a result of various conservation initiatives. However, trends toward the loss of grasslands, threatened species, and genetic resources were not effectively checked. It is imperative that China undertake a more active and integrated strategy for biodiversity conservation to stem projected increases in wastewater discharges, nutrient loading, invasive alien species, and climate change.

AB  - This paper discusses the current SEA procedures and assessment methodologies, aiming to propose strategies that can lead to effective improvement in a newly industrialized Asian country, Taiwan. Institutional and practical problems with regard to the regulations and tools of SEA in Taiwan are compared to those in other countries. According to the research results, it is suggested that extra evaluation processes should be incorporated into the current assessment procedures to improve their scientific validity and integrity. Moreover, it is also suggested that the sustainability appraisal approaches be included in the SEA framework. In this phase, revised evaluation indicators associated with corresponding targets can be the first attempt for modifying the SEA system. It is believed that these can promote the operability in practice and also lead the whole assessment procedures to a direction closer to sustainable development. The trails that Taiwan has followed can help other countries that are going to adopt SEA to find a more effective and efficient way to follow. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A basic premise of ecological economics is that the world economy is embedded in and dependent upon Earth's ecosystem. Because land is a basic source of mass and energy throughput in all terrestrial ecosystems, land use and cover represents an integrating element in ecological economics. We have developed a global model that captures this concept. We illustrate this concept's usefulness by showing how global changes in climate, human populations, and international trade policies might affect tropical forests. Results from our scenarios indicate that such changes would likely have adverse effects on the health and integrity of tropical forest ecosystems. Results from our scenarios also indicate that forest depletion in Southeast Asia can be correlated with numerous economic indicators. Whether the correlation with a particular economic variable is positive or negative depends on the global change scenario. This merely reflects the fact that interactions between economic and ecological phenomena are complex. Modeling capabilities can be expanded by adding economic and ecological detail, including more material on throughput, and developing methods for simulating dynamic analyses.

AB  - Using the new Energy-Transport-Reaction Model, the nitrogen-cycle is presented in relation to energy flow in a system. This model is applied exemplary to three degraded inland water bodies. The increase in the density of energy flow in a spatially limited system provides the framework for this model. By this model the N-cycle can be observed in relation to other abiotic and metabolic processes.  The N-cycle proves to be an important indicator, sensitive to disturbances in the hydrologic cycle. A poorly managed hydrologic cycle will increase resource losses from the watershed, and simulate the formation of loss processes. The model allows an evaluation of a catchment's management according to its ion losses related to its nitrogen losses. Based on a longterm sustainable function of a catchment the integrity of the system is measured by its degree of closure of material cycles and lack of losses. Moreover, loss-minimizing management practices can be derived from the model. Planning and management can be directed towards this goal of minimizing losses and evaluated accordingly.

AB  - Complex physiological traits, such as routine aerobic metabolic rate or exercise performance, are indicators of the functional integrity of fish that can reveal sub-lethal toxicological effects of aquatic pollutants. These traits have proved valuable in laboratory investigations of the sub-lethal effects of heavy metals, ammonia and various xenobiotics. It is not known, however, whether they can also function as biomarkers of the complex potential range of effects upon overall functional integrity caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals in polluted natural environments. The current study used portable swimming respirometers to compare exercise performance and respiratory metabolism of fish exposed in cages for three weeks to either clean or polluted sites on three urban European river systems: the river Lambro, Milan, Italy; the rivers Blythe, Cole and Tame, Birmingham, UK; and the river Amstel, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The UK and Italian rivers were variously polluted with high levels of both bioavailable heavymetals and organics, and the Amstel by mixtures of bioavailable organics at high concentrations. In both the UK and Italy, indigenous chub (Leuciscus cephalus) exposed to clean or polluted sites swam equally well in an initial performance test, but the chub from polluted sites could not repeat this performance after a brief recovery interval. These animals were unable to raise the metabolic rate and allocate oxygen towards exercise in the second trial, an effect confirmed in successive campaigns in Italy. Swimming performance was therefore a biomarker indicator of pollutant exposure in chub exposed at these sites. Exposure to polluted sites on the river Amstel did not affect the repeat swimming performance of cultured cloned carp ( Cyprinus carpio), indicating either a species-specific tolerance or relative absence of heavy metals. However, measurements of oxygen uptake during swimming revealed increased rates of routine aerobic metabolism in both chub and carp at polluted sites in all of the rivers studied, indicating a sub-lethal metabolic loading effect. Therefore, the physiological traits of exercise performance and metabolic rate have potential as biomarkers of the overall sub-lethal toxic effects of exposure to complex mixtures of pollutants in rivers, and may also provide insight into why fish do not colonize some polluted environments.

AB  - Ballast water is essential in maintaining the balance and structural integrity of ships during voyage. However, it has created biological invasion threats to the ocean environment. An innovative electrochemical technology was developed in this study. The microorganisms regulated by the International Maritime Organization (D2) were used as the target organisms. It was found that the required energy to meet the D2 was below 0.006 kWh/m(3). The size of disinfector (m(3)) was about 0.5% of treatment flow rate (m(3)/h). The complete disappearance of chlorine in seawater was achieved after three days. The ballast tank corrosion was not worsened due to the application of technology. The ecotoxicity studies showed no toxic effect on fish, invertebrate, and algae. Finally, the environmental risk assessment showed the treated water did not pose threats to the environment. It can therefore be concluded that the technology provides a cost-effective and environmental friendly solution to ballast water management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As one of the world's prime megadiverse countries, Brazil holds an immense number of terrestrial invertebrates. Current knowledge of this biota is very heterogeneous. Several taxa are sufficiently well known to be used as indicators of ecological integrity or of endemism. The current Brazilian national and regional red lists include 130 terrestrial invertebrate species, of which 42% are butterflies. These lists are contingent on available knowledge, and many taxa that are omitted certainly include species at risk. Knowledge of various biomes and habitats is also quite irregular, with the Caatinga and Pantanal in need of more study, compared with the Atlantic Forest, the Amazon, and Cerrado. Canopy, host-associated, and soil faunas also need further intensive study. Invertebrate conservation will be promoted more effectively by habitat preservation and management rather than single-species initiatives. To this end, better geographic surveys of entire taxonomic or functional assemblages are needed. An improved understanding of the invertebrate role in ecosystem processes will strengthen enormously the case for their conservation.

AB  - The development of sentinel species in aquatic ecosystems is mostly based on benthic organisms; however, organisms living in water column such as zooplankton have received less attention, except for some cladocerans. In this paper, a new ecological indicator based on simple measurements of the size and fecundity of egg-bearing calanoid copepods is developed. The well-studied estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis is used to illustrate this new framework. A large database obtained from laboratory experiments developed under different conditions is used to define a reference regression line between clutch size (CS) and prosome length (PL). The same database allowed one to confirm that the coefficient of variation (CV) of CS is an adequate estimator of the accumulated stress at population level. The CV of PL shows very little variability in all experimental and field conditions. The values of CS and PL obtained from the Seine, Loire, Gironde, Scheldt and Elbe estuaries in Europe are compared to the reference regression line. A quality index (QI) is calculated as a percentage of difference between the observed and the predicted CS. The QI classified 19 samples collected in the Seine estuary between 2004 and 2010 into four classes according to the physiological condition of the copepod female. A single sampling from June 2004 (5.26%) showed a very good condition, whereas 57.9% of the sampling dates confirmed good conditions. On the other hand, four sampling dates were associated to very bad conditions and three sampling dates indicated bad conditions. Seven additional samples obtained from other European estuaries between 2006 and 2009 were also used. Females showing poor conditions were observed in the early spring of 2005 and 2008 as well as during the month of November. These years were characterized by very strong climatic anomalies with a very cold late winter in 2005 and a warm winter in 2008. Therefore, it seems that the QI perfectly reflected the strong stress caused by the sudden change in hydro-climatic conditions that have certainly affected the physiology of copepod females and probably the availability of food. The new indicator is very simple to calculate and can be generalised to several aquatic ecosystems (fresh water and brackish water) by targeting the dominating egg-bearing calanoid copepods. As in the case of E. affinis, the development of sentinel species based on copepods or cladocerans can enrich ecological and ecotoxicological studies given their capacity to integrate the variability of their habitats' quality at the individual and population levels.

AB  - BackgroundAll living organisms experience physiological changes regulated by endogenous circadian rhythms. The main factor controlling the circadian clock is the duration of daylight. The aim of this research was to identify the impact of various lighting conditions on physiological parameters and gut microbiota composition in rats. 3 groups of outbred rats were subjected to normal light-dark cycles, darkness and constant lighting.ResultsAfter 1 and 3months we studied urinary catecholamine levels in rats; indicators of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant activity in the blood; protein levels of BMAL1, CLOCK and THRA in the hypothalamus; composition and functional activity of the gut microbiota. Subjecting the rats to conditions promoting desynchronosis for 3months caused disruptions in homeostasis.ConclusionsChanging the lighting conditions led to changes in almost all the physiological parameters that we studied. Catecholamines can be regarded as a synchronization super system of split-level circadian oscillators. We established a correlation between hypothalamic levels of Bmal1 and urinary catecholamine concentrations. The magnitude of changes in the GM taxonomic composition was different for LL/LD and DD/LD but the direction of these changes was similar. As for the predicted functional properties of the GM which characterize its metabolic activity, they didn't change as dramatically as the taxonomic composition. All differences may be viewed as a compensatory reaction to new environmental conditions and the organism has adapted to those conditions.

AB  - Survival and mortality of extensive hill ewes are important commercial factors and valuable indicators of welfare, but difficult to study. Body condition scoring is a tried-and-tested management and monitoring tool which has been defined as a good predictor of fitness in ewes and is easily measured under hill farm conditions. This paper presents the results of a study on ewe survival rates in hill conditions in Scotland. Ewe performance and survival rates were measured in two contrasting hill flocks over a five-year period. Statistical analysis showed that mid-pregnancy body condition score was the most reliable indicator of subsequent ewe survival, followed closely by age of the ewe and environmental and management conditions. This study confirms that there are considerable welfare issues related to hill flocks and that improved winter nutritional management is a key component to good welfare and productivity. It also reinforces the view that body condition score is a good quantitative predictor of animal welfare and that poor mid-winter score indicates high risk of mortality, both at the flock and individual ewe level.

AB  - Most passerines use nests as the exclusive place to lay and incubate eggs and bring nestlings up to fledging. Nests of secondary cavity nesters, like tits, provide a moist, warm and protected habitat for reproduction of blood parasites. Offspring fitness depends on interactions between parental care and environmental constraints. Life-history theory suggests that macro-and micro-parasites may generate selection pressures by affecting host health. In the present study, we replaced natural great tit Parus major nests in two, structurally and floristically contrasting sites (an urban parkland and a rich deciduous forest, located 10 km apart in Lodz, central Poland), with fresh, sterilized, artificial moss-cotton wool nests, twice, on the fifth and tenth day of nestlings life. We then examined haematological condition indicators (haemoglobin and glucose concentrations) of about 14-day-old nestlings. Nestlings that were developing in treated nests improved their health status in comparison with control nestlings. The mean haemoglobin and glucose concentrations (treated and control) also varied between both study areas. Our study confirms that the level of haemoglobin and especially the level of glucose may be treated as reliable indicator of environmental characteristics in great tits.

AB  - Species, particularly foliovores, at the trailing edge of their geographical range are likely to be most vulnerable to climate change as they respond to physiological stress and the decline in the nutrient richness of their food source. We investigate the effect of environmental conditions on diet composition, resource use, and physiological stress of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in the semi-arid landscapes of southwest Queensland, Australia, across three different biogeographic regions. Fresh faecal pellets were collected to measure cortisol metabolites and assess diet. Regression analyses were used to relate the diet composition and physiological stress of wild koalas to environmental variables. The impact of drought was apparent, with higher faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) levels recorded during drought conditions compared with post-flood conditions. Diet composition also changed between drought and post-flood conditions, with diets during drought being mainly composed of species with high leaf-moisture content. Low minimum temperatures increased FCM concentrations, and these effects were greater during drought conditions. The results demonstrate the importance of integrating physiological assessments into ecological studies to identify stressors that have the potential to compromise the long-term survival of threatened species, as well as the need to identify the resources required for their continued survival.

AB  - Over the past few decades, Ponto-Caspian gammarids Pontogammarus robustoides, Obesogammarus crassus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes have colonized the European inland and coastal brackish waters. Previous experimental studies of P. robustoides, O. crassus and D. haemobaphes indicated that the salinity optimum for the species is about 7 PSU. We examined whether salinities below 5 PSU in the Vistula estuary - the Vistula Lagoon and the Vistula Delta, create a favorable environment and have a positive effect on Ponto-Caspian gammarids. The objective of this work was to determine the population parameters (size structure) and biological indicators (condition) of the studied gammarid species at a low salinity level. Length-weight relationships can be considered as their body condition in the environment. These relationships were calculated for each gammarid species according to the exponential equation y = ax(b), where: y - wet weight, x - total length, a - intercept, b - slope. The results clearly show responses of Ponto-Caspian gammarids to the low salinity habitat and indicate that such environment provides excellent conditions. The results of analysis show that the condition of gammarids is good. The optimal strategy of the examined alien gammarids may help them to maintain a strong competitive position in the environment and affect the colonization process in non-native waters with low salinity.

AB  - (Anthocyanins and tannins: is the urban air pollution an elicitor factor?) In order to survive in highly adverse conditions, plants have evolved a genetic capacity for compensating drastic environmental changes, by producing antioxidants that neutralize the effects of stress, such as those caused by oxidant pollutants. One example is Psidium guajava cv. Paluma (guava), which is described as an efficient bio-indicator of tropospheric ozone, by displaying typical foliar injury, characterized by reddening on the adaxial surface. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in phenolic compounds content (anthocyanins and tannins) in P. guajava on a field condition of atmospheric pollutants at Sao Paulo city. Four field exposure assays were performed to investigate the alterations on phenolic contents under pollution stress and under seasonal variations. Principal components and regression analysis indicated that the concentrations of ozone and phenolic compounds accumulation can be highly correlated. Accumulated precipitation during the field exposures showed significant correlations with tannin contents. Contents of foliar proanthocyanidins were correlated to precipitation, global solar radiation, and leaf injury. On a field condition, many factors can elicit response on phenolic contents, e. g., presence of other pollutants, climatic conditions, and biotic factors. Urban air pollution seems to be an elicitor factor to the production of phenolic compounds on P. guajava, specially anthocyanins and tannins, but the weather conditions are crucial to determine this pollution influence.

AB  - The aquatic environment represents the final repository for many human-generated pollutants associated with anthropogenic activities. The quality of natural freshwater systems is easily disrupted by the introduction of pollutants from urban, industrial and agricultural processes. To assess the extent of chemical perturbation and associated environmental degradation, physico-chemical parameters have been monitored in conjunction with biota in numerous biological monitoring protocols. Most studies incorporating organisms into such approaches have focussed on fish and macroinvertebrates. More recently, interest in the ecology of parasites in relation to environmental monitoring has indicated that these organisms are sensitive towards the quality of the macroenvironment. Variable responses towards exposure to pollution have been identified at the population and component community level of a number of parasites. Furthermore, such responses have been found to differ with the type of pollutant and the lifestyle of the parasite. Generally, endoparasite infection levels have been shown to become elevated in relation to poorer water quality conditions, while ectoparasites are more sensitive, and exposure to contaminated environments resulted in a decline in ectoparasite infections. Furthermore, endoparasites have been found to be suitable accumulation indicators for monitoring levels of several trace elements and metals in the environment. The ability of these organisms to accumulate metals has further been observed to be of benefit to the host, resulting in decreased somatic metal levels in infected hosts. These trends have similarly been found for host-parasite models in African freshwater environments, but such analyses are comparatively sparse compared to other countries. Recently, studies on diplozoids from two freshwater systems have indicated that exposure to poorer water quality resulted in decreased infections. In the Vaal River, the poor water quality resulted in the extinction of the parasite from a site below the Vaal River Barrage. Laboratory exposures have further indicated that oncomiracidia of Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon are sensitive to exposure to dissolved aluminium. Overall, parasites from African freshwater and marine ecosystems have merit as effect and accumulation indicators; however, more research is required to detail the effects of exposure on sensitive biological processes within these organisms.

AB  - Global degradation of aquatic ecosystems has initiated widespread use of biomonitoring to inform management. Current biomonitoring programs typically apply biomarkers (e.g., vitellogenin) and (or) measurements of community composition (e.g., algae or benthic macroinvertebrates) as indicators to assess ecosystem condition. However, independently these indicators may fail to provide either ecologically significant ( a limitation of biomarkers) or early warning (a limitation of population and community measures) information to aquatic managers. Environmental metabolomics studies the relationship between an organism's environment and its metabolome (i.e., description of the state of molecules produced or consumed during an organism's metabolic processes, e.g., amino acids). Shifts in the metabolome occur because of stress-driven changes in resource allocation and are often indicative of changes in organism fitness. The metabolome of target species may thus be an effective bioindicator; however, it has not been evaluated for use in aquatic biomonitoring. Our objectives were threefold: introduce and describe metabolomics, evaluate the metabolome as a bioindicator, and provide recommendations for integration of metabolomics into biomonitoring. We conclude that the metabolome meets many bioindicator criteria and the potential to meet the remaining criteria following further research. Specifically, we concluded the metabolome is grounded in sound ecological theory while also having the potential to be a priori predictive and to assess ecological functions. Although the reliability of the metabolome to detect change needs further study, there is growing evidence that the metabolome can detect changes in human impact and discriminate between stressors. We provide an example of this capability with a case study assessment of municipal wastewater. Practically, the metabolome can be readily integrated into existing biomonitoring protocols. However, the ability of agencies to adopt metabolomics-based biomonitoring may be impeded by a lack of understanding of metabolomics within institutions and difficulty of communication with stakeholders. We suggest training or hiring of appropriate personnel and the generation of a common metabolomics language as mechanisms for overcoming this impediment. We conclude that background knowledge for metabolomics-based monitoring is sufficient for agency-based pilot projects aimed at assessing ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. However, continued development may ultimately provide early warning and diagnostic assessments of aquatic impacts.

AB  - Biological soil crusts serve as a vanguard for improving the ecological environment in arid, semi-arid desertification areas. It is a good indicator of the level of improvement which the local ecological environment is undertaking. In desert areas, water condition is a key factor of improving the ecological environment. As a first layer protection, biological crusts play an important role in local vegetation succession due to their abilities to conserve and maintain moisture. Using Maowusu desert in Yanchi of Ningxia province as an example, after three years of research, this paper chooses three kinds of biological crusts including lichen, moss and cyanobacterial which are under the cover of Artemisia ordosica as research objects. The results of this study indicate that, the closer biological crusts are to Artemisia ordosica vegetation, the thicker they become. In the same position of Artemisia ordosica vegetation, the thickness of moss crusts is the highest, followed by lichen crusts, and the thickness of cyanobacterial crusts is the lowest. Biological soil crusts coverage protects the natural water content of soil layers from 0 to 5 cm. Also, it effects falling water to infiltrate deeper, and cannot prevent the surface water content from evaporating effectively. The effect of biological crusts blocking water infiltration decreases with the increase of rainfall. At the same rainfall level, moss crusts provide the strongest water infiltration blockage, followed by lichen crusts and cyanobacterial crusts. With the increase of rainfall, the depth of water infiltration increases. At the same rainfall level, the relationship of water infiltration depth is as follows: cyanobacterial crusts > lichen crusts > moss crusts. With the increase of biological crusts thickness, they blocking water infiltration capacity is stronger, and the depth of water infiltration is smaller. Analysis on the characteristic of simulated rainfall process on biological crusts shows that sandy land can be fixed by applying appropriate artificial biological crusts to build a sustainable forest protection system and to create a stable ecosystem in desertification area.

AB  - Anji, located in the northwest of Zhejiang Province, was chosen as the first eco-county in China in 2006, as it met the requirements of the ecological assessment criteria enacted by the Ministry of Environmental Protection P.R. China. Soil quality, however, is not included in the environmental criteria of the eco-county assessment. In 2009, a field survey was conducted to evaluate the soil quality in the built-up area of Anji. We investigated the soil pH, bulk density, nutrient content and the concentrations of Cr and Pb in the four main green space types, namely park green (PARK), street green (STREET), attached green space (ATTACH) and protective green (PROT). We believe that this soil quality information will provide a sound basis for eco-county selection in the future. The pH was alkaline, and the bulk density was much higher, in these four green space types than in the local natural soils. Although the soils were fertilized with NPK fertilizer, the amount of soil organic matter, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) fell into low, moderate to low or extremely low categories in the four green space types. The amount of organic matter is important to restore the soil structure. The TN and TP concentrations were correlated with the concentrations of organic matter (P < 0.01). In the PARK and PROT sites, soil organic matter and TN concentrations were higher than in the STREET and ATTACH sites (P < 0.05), most likely because the amount of tree coverage was at least 20% in the PARK and PROT. The content of organic matter should be in line with the site conditions. Owing to past use of leaded petrol, the soils of the four green space types have been polluted by Pb in Anji, especially in the STREET and PROT sites. As an eco-county, Anji needs to adapt a soil replacement method and a biological treatment technology to reduce soil Pb pollution to create a favorable environment for the residents of the area. We suggest that soil quality indicators should be brought into the assessment criteria for eco-country establishment in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

AB  - Urbanization causes the loss of large amounts of habitat and produces significant changes in environmental conditions with consequences in the individual's behavior, morphology, and physiology in natural populations. The urbanization can impact in the individual's development instability (DI) that may be measured with the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) level making it an environmental quality bioindicator. In addition, the FA of each trait should be interpreted considering the trait functional importance, morphogenesis and history of selection pressures. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of two decades of increasing urbanization levels over a population of the pampean scorpion Bothriurus bonariensis. We analyze the FA level in somatic and genital traits in adult individuals of both sexes, collected every similar to 10 years (1997, 2008, 2018). Interestingly, in this study the somatic traits (pedipalp chelae) would be under directional selection and are shaped throughout the individual's growth. In contrast, the genital traits (male's hemispermatophore) are involved in the sperm transfer process and could be under stabilizing selection. Also, hemispermatophores are affected for less time by environmental stressors since they are formed once the individual has reached sexual maturity. Our results showed a significant increase in the FA levels in somatic traits of males and females, according to the increase of urbanization along years. In contrast, genital traits showed no changes in the level of FA in females, and only a few male genital traits presented an increase in the FA level. This work shows evidence that the measured scorpion traits (under different selective pressures and morphogenesis) might present differences in their susceptibility to environmental stress. We discuss these results in a context of DI of individuals caused by urbanization. We support the idea that the level of FA can be useful as an index to evaluate the effects of environmental stress on invertebrate populations. Furthermore, our paper presents the scorpions as a good model that could be used as an indicator group for studying the impact of the anthropogenic disturbance factors on natural ecosystems.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, the specific influence of soil resources on stand productivity is difficult to assess because many other ecological variables also affect tree growth. In this study, we took advantage of a natural soil gradient, from shallow calcic soil to deep acidic soil, all with similar climate, atmospheric depositions, species composition and management, to determine the relationship between soil nutritive resources and the growth and mineral nutrition of a beech (Fagus sylvatica) mature forest of Northeastern France. Soil resources were assessed through the quantification of the stocks of available water and mineral nutrients (Ca, Mg, K and P2O5). Beech stand growth and mineral nutrition were determined through the use of several indicators, i.e., standing aboveground biomass and annual biomass production, potential growth index (prediction of the height of dominant trees at 100 years) and foliar nutrient content. We observed a gradient of nutritive resources in soils as well as a gradient of stand growth on the study site: the current aboveground biomass was highest on the calci-brunisol which presented the highest water and nutrient stocks while it was lowest on the rendisol, characterized by a very low water holding capacity and a very low stock of available K. However, the growth of beech trees on the rendisol was equivalent to the highest growth classes of beech trees in France, and K nutrition was optimal. Observations on the study site suggest that, in favorable climate conditions, some biological adaptation processes, such as an efficient root colonization as well as an efficient nutrient cycling may allow to maintain stand growth and nutrition on soils with low water and nutrient reserves. The fertility of forest soils has thus to be assessed in a dynamic way by integrating nutrient fluxes as well as the adaptations of trees to environmental constraints. The biological processes become an increasingly important part in the conservation of soil fertility, notably in the perspective of global changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban streams and ecosystems are highly affected by the intense development of cities and an increase of impervious surfaces. If these environments are close to their pristine state, they can be considered a nature-based solution promoting the integration of both green and blue elements in the cities, while providing a wide range of services (e.g. better aesthetics, air quality, leisure areas, and mitigation of climatic changes). In view of this, the current study aimed to develop a holistic assessment tool for urban streams that can be used to highlight their importance and support decision makers in the elaboration of measures to recover urban streams. The tool called Urban stream Assessment system (UsAs) includes the assessment of (1) biodiversity, (2) ecological functions and habitat that are inherent components of the ecosystems, and (3) provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, following The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). The tool includes 89 indicators belonging to 17 divisions (services and functions) selected from studies on urban areas and fluvial ecosystems. In addition, the tool introduces a method for the measurement of an indicator, rationale for the used indicator, positive and negative scope of the indicator, and reference to the proposed method. The tool incorporates also a step-by-step scoring system, which results in a global quality classification of streams. The UsAs tool was tested with a case study stream located in the city of Coimbra, Central Portugal. The final classification attributed to this stream was moderate, which is slightly higher than the ecological status, highlighting its potential ecosystem services (ES). However, the UsAs clearly showed a poor biodiversity (namely of aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, fish, aquatic mammals, and terrestrial insects), habitat conditions and the most compromised services that could be improved: water supply, air quality, health and well-being. The use of this novel tool supports also new research and knowledge on aquatic ecosystems and particularly urban streams by generating relevant data to answer and test important ecological questions, such as the influence of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning and services. Further investigation should focus more on tests in different types of urban streams, regions, and climates.

AB  - The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) attempts to restore hydrology in the Northern and Southern Estuaries of Florida. Reefs of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a dominant feature of the estuaries along the Southwest Florida coast. Oysters are benthic, sessile, filter-feeding organisms that provide ecosystem services by filtering the water column and providing food, shelter and habitat for associated organisms. As such, the species is an excellent sentinel organism for examining the impacts of restoration on estuarine ecosystems. The implementation of CERP attempts to improve: the hydrology and spatial and structural characteristics of oyster reefs, the recruitment and survivorship of C. virginica, and the reef-associated communities of organisms.
   This project links biological responses and environmental conditions relative to hydrological changes as a means of assessing positive or negative trends in oyster responses and population trends. Using oyster responses, we have developed a communication tool (i.e., Stoplight Report Card) based on CERP performance measures that can distinguish between responses to restoration and natural patterns. The Stoplight Report Card system is a communication tool that uses Monitoring and Assessment Program (MAP) performance measures to grade an estuary's response to changes brought about by anthropogenic input or restoration activities. The Stoplight Report Card consists of both a suitability index score for each organism metric as well as a trend score (- decreasing trend, +/- no change in trend, and + increasing trend). Based on these two measures, a component score (e.g., living density) is calculated by averaging the suitability index score and the trend score. The final index score is obtained by taking the geometric score of each component, which is then translated into a stoplight color for success (green), caution (yellow), or failure (red).
   Based on the data available for oyster populations and the responses of oysters in the Caloosahatchee Estuary, the system is currently at stage "caution." This communication tool instantly conveys the status of the indicator and the suitability, while trend curves provide information on progress towards reaching a target. Furthermore, the tool has the advantage of being able to be applied regionally, by species, and collectively, in concert with other species, system-wide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil biota drive fundamental ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and maintenance of soil structure. They are especially active in grassland ecosystems such as the tallgrass prairie, where much of the net primary productivity is allocated belowground and ultimately processed by heterotrophic soil organisms. Because both soil microbes and soil fauna display perturbation responses that integrate the physical, chemical, and biological changes to their environment, the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities is used widely as an indication of the ecological status of soils. To investigate the effects of military training on tallgrass prairie soil communities, a replicated small-plot study of tracked vehicle disturbance effects was initiated at Fort Riley, Kansas in 2003. This article reports subsequent rates of recovery for soil microbial and invertebrate communities over a range of disturbances encompassing different soil types (silty clay loam and silt loam soils), environmental conditions (wet vs. dry traffic events), traffic intensities (single vs. repeated traffic), and track areas (curve vs. straightaway). Microbial biomass in wet silty clay loam soil treatments and on curve areas in silt loam soil was suppressed for 1-2 years following disturbance but increased to levels greater than undisturbed plots in all treatments by the fourth year. Nematode abundance, family richness, trophic composition, and community structure also displayed maximum disturbance for wet treatments and curve areas. Trophic composition and community structure continued to exhibit disturbance effects throughout the 4-year study period, even after recovery of nematode abundance. Earthworm abundance displayed the most severe reductions (78% across soil types, treatments and areas) immediately following tank traffic but, like microbial biomass, subsequently increased to levels greater than undisturbed plots. Nematode community structure provided a reliable and comprehensive assessment of the status of the soil food web and was an effective bioindicator of ecosystem recovery following traffic disturbance. In addition, given the dominant role of earthworms in ecosystem processes and their extreme sensitivity to tracked vehicle disturbance, it is recommended that this group be included in monitoring protocols for military training land managers.

AB  - Analysis of ecosystem functioning is essential to describe the ecological status of ecosystems and is therefore directly requested in international directives. There is a lack of knowledge regarding functional aspects of benthic communities and their environmental and anthropogenic driving forces in the southern North Sea. This study linked functional composition of epibenthic communities to environmental conditions and fishing effort and investigated spatial correlations between habitat characteristics to gain insight into potential synergistic and/or cumulative effects. Functional composition of epifauna was assessed by using biological trait analysis (BTA), which considered 15 ecological traits of 54 species. Functional composition was related to ten predictor variables derived from sediment composition, bottom temperature and salinity, hydrodynamics, annual primary production and fishing effort. Our results revealed significantly different functional composition between the Dogger Bank, the Oyster Ground, the West and North Frisian coast. Mobility, feeding type, size and adult longevity were the most important traits differentiating the communities. A high proportion of trait modalities related to an opportunistic life mode were obvious in coastal areas especially at the West Frisian coast and in the area of the Frisian Front indicating disturbed communities. In contrast, functional composition in the Dogger Bank area indicated undisturbed communities with prevalence of large, long-lived and permanently attached species being sensitive towards disturbance such as fishing. Tidal stress, mud content of sediments, salinity, stratification and fishing effort were found to be the most important habitat characteristics shaping functional composition. Strong correlations were found between variables, especially between those which changed gradually from the coast to offshore areas including fishing effort. Unfavourable extremes of these factors in coastal areas resulted in disturbed epibenthic communities, while the relative influence of a single factor on functional composition cannot be quantified. Coastal communities seemed to be well adapted to disturbance and the prevalence of opportunistic trait modalities not necessarily revealed a poor ecological status according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The integration of functional aspects into the assessment of ecosystem health is recommended, since widely used structural measures failed in naturally disturbed habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three coastal and three lagoonal sites located in Greece (Eastern Mediterranean) were selected to test and intercalibrate classification methods developed for benthic invertebrates ecological quality assessments. These methods were developed for the purposes of the European Water Framework Directive which is a European legislation adopted for the protection and improvement of the coastal and transitional waters. However, through testing these methods, this work addresses in general the issue of determining and comparing the ecological status of the coastal and transitional macrobenthic communities in Eastern Mediterranean ecosystems. Among methods tested were the biotic indices AMBI and BENTIX, the multivariate method M-AMBI and the biomass size structure index ISD in lagoonal sites only. ISD index is a rather new method developed especially for transitional ecosystems and in this contribution its performance is inter-calibrated with the other benthic classification metrics. Comparison and intercalibration of the indices results in assessing the ecological quality status (EQS) are presented graphically and statistically performing the Kappa analysis. Results of the comparison and the indices' performance are evaluated based on the knowledge of the sites' environmental condition and baseline studies. Based on an extended dataset of coastal and transitional ecosystems benthic invertebrates, an evaluation of each index performance and effectiveness is attempted through an insight and comparative analysis of each methods' structure and design.
   Results showed that in these Eastern Mediterranean coastal sites the BENTIX index seems to give a more biologically relevant classification and gives a higher confidence level regarding the classification compared to the other indices. In the coastal areas AMBI showed a tendency for the "good" class classification, while the factorial M-AMBI gave more consistent results with the BENTIX. In the lagoonal sites the biotic indices tested were not proved efficient enough and the biomass based ISD index proved more appropriate for these ecosystems. AMBI showed the highest agreement with the ISD which is due to the better performance of this index in the slightly and moderately polluted lagoons, compared to the other indices. However, AMBI failed to classify the polluted lagoon, in which case the BENTIX gave a more relevant classification. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbiological degradation of the racemic mixture, the enantiopure R- and S-fipronil was examined under both aerobic and flooded conditions in three Chinese paddy soils. The degradation kinectics and enantiomer fraction (EF) were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with chiral Chiralcel OD-H column, while desulfinyl, sulfone and sulfide derivatives were monitored by reversed phase HPLC with diode array detection (DAD). The degradation/transformation of enantiomers of fipronil in the three live soils under aerobic and flooded conditions generally complied with the first-order kinetics (R-2 >= 0.94). The calculated t(1/2) values of the enantiomers of fipronil ranged between 21 and 34 days for aerobic incubation experiments and between 8 and 19 days under flooded conditions incubation, respectively. The calculated EF values of fipronil during the incubation time were all close to 0.5, indicating that the degradation/transformation of fipronil was almost nonenantioselective. The main metabolites of fipronil formed in the incubation experiments were sulfone and sulfide derivatives by oxidative and reductive processes, respectively. The oxidative pathway seemed more active. Under flooded conditions, S-fipronil was preferentially degraded in the three soil samples used. The main metabolite was determined as fipronil sulfide. In control experiments, almost no removal of enantiomers of fipronil was observed indicating that the degradation of fipronil in the paddy soil used was attributed to microbial mediated processes under both aerobic and flooded conditions. In addition, no enantiomerization of fipronil was observed in the soil samples examined under both aerobic and flooded conditions. These results for major differences in the degradation of the enantiomers as well as the formation of toxic metabolites may have some implications for better environmental and ecological risks assessment for chiral pesticides.

AB  - To properly manage our natural and managed landscapes, and to restore or repair degraded areas, it is important to know the changes that have taken place over time, particularly with respect to land use and its cumulative effect on ecological function. In common with many places in the world, where the industrial revolution resulted in profound changes to land use and management, Australia's landscapes have been transformed in the last 200 years. Initially the VAST (Vegetation Assets, States and Transitions) system was developed to describe and map changes in vegetation over time through a series of condition states or classes; here we describe an enhancement to the VAST method which will enable identification of the factors contributing to those changes in state as a result of changes in management practice. The 'VAST-2' system provides a structure in which to compile, interpret and sequence a range of data about past management practices, their effect on site and vegetation condition. Alongside a systematic chronology of land use and management, a hierarchy of indices is used to build a picture of the condition of the vegetation through time: 22 indicators within ten criteria representing three components of vegetation condition-regenerative capacity, vegetation structure and species composition-are scored using information from a variety of sources. These indicators are assessed relative to a pre-European reference state, either actual or synthetic. Each component is weighted proportionally to its contribution to the whole, determined through expert opinion. These weighted condition components are used to produce an aggregated transformation score for the vegetation. The application of this system to a range of sites selected across Australia's tropical, sub-tropical and temperate bioregions is presented, illustrating the utility of the system. Notably, the method accommodates a range of different types of information to be aggregated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies of predator prey demographic responses and the physical drivers of such relationships are rare, yet essential for predicting future changes in the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems. Here, we hypothesize that predator prey relationships vary spatially in association with underlying physical ocean conditions, leading to observable changes in demographic rates, such as reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we quantified spatio-temporal variability in hydrographic conditions, krill, and forage fish to model predator (seabird) demographic responses over 18 years (1990-2007). We used principal component analysis and spatial correlation maps to assess coherence among ocean conditions, krill, and forage fish, and generalized additive models to quantify interannual variability in seabird breeding success relative to prey abundance. The first principal component of four hydrographic measurements yielded an index that partitioned "warm/weak upwelling" and "cool/strong upwelling" years. Partitioning of krill and forage fish time series among shelf and oceanic regions yielded spatially explicit indicators of prey availability. Krill abundance within the oceanic region was remarkably consistent between years, whereas krill over the shelf showed marked interannual fluctuations in relation to ocean conditions. Anchovy abundance varied on the shelf, and was greater in years of strong stratification, weak upwelling and warmer temperatures. Spatio-temporal variability of juvenile forage fish co-varied strongly with each other and with krill, but was weakly correlated with hydrographic conditions. Demographic responses between seabirds and prey availability revealed spatially variable associations indicative of the dynamic nature of "predator habitat" relationships. Quantification of spatially explicit demographic responses, and their variability through time, demonstrate the possibility of delineating specific critical areas where the implementation of protective measures could maintain functions and productivity of central place foraging predators.

AB  - Background: Pseudomonas putida is a model organism for bioremediation because of its remarkable metabolic versatility, extensive biodegradative functions, and ubiquity in contaminated soil environments. To further the understanding of molecular pathways responding to the heavy metal chromium(VI) [Cr(VI)], the proteome of aerobically grown, Cr(VI)-stressed P. putida strain F1 was characterized within the context of two disparate nutritional environments: rich (LB) media and minimal (M9L) media containing lactate as the sole carbon source.
   Results: Growth studies demonstrated that F1 sensitivity to Cr(VI) was impacted substantially by nutrient conditions, with a carbon-source-dependent hierarchy (lactate > glucose >> acetate) observed in minimal media. Two-dimensional HPLC-MS/MS was employed to identify differential proteome profiles generated in response to 1 mM chromate under LB and M9L growth conditions. The immediate response to Cr(VI) in LB-grown cells was up-regulation of proteins involved in inorganic ion transport, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and catabolism, and amino acid metabolism. By contrast, the chromate-responsive proteome derived under defined minimal growth conditions was characterized predominantly by up-regulated proteins related to cell envelope biogenesis, inorganic ion transport, and motility. TonB-dependent siderophore receptors involved in ferric iron acquisition and amino acid adenylation domains characterized up-regulated systems under LB-Cr(VI) conditions, while DNA repair proteins and systems scavenging sulfur from alternative sources (e. g., aliphatic sulfonates) tended to predominate the up-regulated proteome profile obtained under M9L-Cr(VI) conditions.
   Conclusions: Comparative analysis indicated that the core molecular response to chromate, irrespective of the nutritional conditions tested, comprised seven up-regulated proteins belonging to six different functional categories including transcription, inorganic ion transport/metabolism, and amino acid transport/ metabolism. These proteins might potentially serve as indicators of chromate stress in natural microbial communities.

AB  - The spurge hawkmoth Hyles euphorbiae L. (Sphingidae) comprises a remarkable species complex with still not fully resolved taxonomy. Its extensive natural distribution range covers diverse climatic zones. This predestinates particular populations to cope with different local seasonally unfavorable environmental conditions. The ability of the pupae to overcome outer frosty conditions is well known. However, the differences between two main ecotypes ('euphorbiae' and 'tithymali') in terms of the inherent degree of frost tolerance, its corresponding survival strategy, and underlying mechanism have not been studied in detail so far. The main aim of our study was to test the phenotypic exhibition of pupae (as the relevant life cycle stadia to outlast unfavorable conditions) in response to combined effects of exogenous stimuli, such as daylight length and cooling regime. Namely, we tested the turnout of subitan (with fast development, unadapted to unfavorable conditions) or diapause (paused development, adapted to unfavorable external influences and increased resistance) pupae under different conditions, as well as their mortality, and we measured the super cooling point (SCP) of whole pupae (in vivo) and pupal hemolymph (in vitro) as phenotypic indicators of cold acclimation. Our results show higher cold sensitivity in 'tithymali' populations, exhibiting rather opportunistic and short-termed cold hardiness, while 'euphorbiae' produces a phenotype of seasonal cold-hardy diapause pupae under a combined effect of short daylight length and continuous cold treatment. Further differences include the variability in duration and mortality of diapause pupae. This suggests different pre-adaptations to seasonal environmental conditions in each ecotype and may indicate a state of incipient speciation within the H. euphorbiae complex.

AB  - Perennial vegetation is one of the most valuable ecological components when forming healthy living environments, natural and cultural landscape values, and general ecological stability, especially in protected areas. In various countries, increasing attention is being paid to research into biodiversity of meadow phytocenoses. Research in Western Lithuanian meadows was conducted from 2003 to 2006 with the aim to determine how the regime of management and different ecological conditions over several years influences floristic composition, frequency, and stability of meadow sward. Field sampling plots were set up on two semi-natural floodplain meadows in protected areas: in the meadow of the Minija mid-river banks (used for agricultural activities - grazing and cutting), and in the VeivirZas landscape reserve in the flood-meadow land (with no farming activities for the last ten years). The article discusses the relevance of the dominant species on the stability of phytocenoses. Each habitat was estimated for ecological conditions, i.e. soil moisture and vascular plant species indicating soil acidity.

AB  - The amount of water required to support a river ecosystem in proper condition are of particular importance in the areas of high natural value. The hydrological threats for the protected areas are region-specific and vary from region to region. The local hydrological conditions depend largely on the temporal and spatial variations of the hydrologic cycle, of the main components and physiographic conditions on site. Future climate change is projected to have a significant impact on the hydrological regime, water resources and their quality in many parts of the world. The water-dependent ecosystems are exposed to the risk of climate change through altered precipitation and evaporation. Investigating the current climate changes and their hydrological consequences are very important for hydrological issues. This analysis may be a very important foundation for determining the causes observed in the recent period of anomalous growth - both hydrological and climatic. The aim of the research is to assess the effect of projected climate change on water resources in lowland catchment the Narew River in Poland. The hydrological reaction to climate warming and wetter conditions includes changes in flow and water level. This paper describes the directions of changes climatic and hydrological conditions and the impact of climate change on the Narew River. The data such as: daily air temperature, precipitation obtained from the Bialystok climate station located within the Narew river and hydrological data such as water flows and water states observed in water gauges were used for the analysis of climate variability and their hydrological consequences. The results show a significant decrease in winter outflows in river, as well as a delayed increase in the spring melt flow. It has also been observed that this is the initial phase of changes in maximum water levels and maximum flows.

AB  - Coastal upwelling ecosystems provide the bulk of the world's fishery yields, but the biochemical ecology of the species that make up these fisheries has, surprisingly, been ignored. Biochemical indicators can provide a mechanistic, ecosystem-based link between population and ecosystem dynamics. Here we investigated long-term, inter-annual changes in the proximate composition and energetic condition of European sardine Sardina pilchardus and its relationship with oceanographic conditions in the Western Iberian Upwelling Ecosystem. Energy density (ED) ranged between 4.0 and 14.2 kJ g(-1), and the seasonal cycle largely determined temporal variability, explaining >80% of the observed variation. ED variations were also closely linked with water (total R-2 = 99.0% in whole body; total R-2 = 95.0% in muscle) and lipid dynamics (total R-2 = 99.6% in whole body; total R-2 = 92.5% in muscle). After adjusting for seasonality (rED) and restricting the temporal analysis to the end of the feeding period (August to October), spring/early-summer oceanographic conditions explained 67% of the late-summer energetic peak. Interestingly, the sardine rED peak in year (t) explained >54.4% of the variation in the annual catches of year (t + 1), indicating that adult energetic condition during spawning is partially translated into the fishery through parental effects in recruitment strength. Our results support earlier findings indicating that sardine population dynamics seem to be controlled by bottom-up effects, but the linkages between population dynamics and patterns in environmental variability via physiological condition seem to have previously been overlooked. We also provide empirical evidence that biochemical assessments during critical periods of the life-cycle of fish are essential in understanding the population dynamics of coastal upwelling ecosystems and in developing a more solid basis for stock management and conservation.

AB  - Studies using stable-isotope analysis documented an enrichment in delta(15)N values in nutritionally stressed animals. Investigators suggested that changes in delta(15)N values measured in urine, hair, and blood may be a good indicator of lean-tissue losses. During our investigations into the effects of population density on body condition and reproduction of female Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii plesius) near Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada, we examined the relations between body condition and delta(15)N values. Data obtained from 20 livetrapped female ground squirrels suggested that reproductive females from a population with moderate density and low food availability experienced a reduction in body condition, as indicated by mass loss and changes in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose concentrations. In contrast, those from a population that failed to reproduce successfully and had high density and low food availability experienced no nutritional stress. Similarly, those females from a high-density population with high food availability (i.e., supplemented food) that reproduced successfully suffered no noticeable nutritional stress. In contrast to our prediction, delta(15)N values did not show a decline with increasing body mass, and animals in poor and excellent body condition had similar delta(15)N values. In addition, female ground squirrels from the same group with access to similar types of food (natural or supplemented) and with similar body masses, BUN, and blood glucose concentrations showed a difference of up to 1.8% in delta(15)N values. Thus, our results suggest that the ecological process (i.e., diet selection) may have obscured the physiological one (i.e., recycling of nitrogen). Therefore, we recommend that field ecologists studying animal diets using stable-isotope analysis use alternative techniques when attempting to evaluate the body condition of their subjects.

AB  - Resilience assessment allows targeted management, and many low Pacific island atolls have no baseline condition data or monitoring, and are threatened by sea-level rise. Ecological resilience is a useful management concept where an ecosystem risks losing its ability to recover, potentially driving itself to an undesirable state, which for atoll shorelines is beach erosion without recovery, and mangrove dieback. This study used spatial change analysis to assess resilience condition indicators for lagoon shore habitats of an atoll protected area, methods developed in the region to facilitate improved community based assessment and management decision making. The lagoon shore was the focus, being potentially more vulnerable to human impacts owing to higher population densities, and potentially more vulnerable to relative sea level rise owing low gradients and elevations. Results showed mangrove vegetation to be in healthy condition, and spatial analysis of coastal change found that the mangrove area expanded 1998-2013, increasing by 17%, at a rate of 604 m(2) per year. Results from the southern beach coast showed littoral vegetation to be in poor condition, with profile evidence of recent erosion, confirmed by spatial analysis results of loss of a previous progradation trend. Spatial analysis results therefore confirmed the veracity of community methods for assessing mangrove and beach condition, allowing confidence in their use in assessment of resilience state and rehabilitation needs. Sediment supply is helpful to coastal resilience, and analysis of beach sand found it to be 99.9% carbonate, derived from foraminifera and fragmented shell and coral, and continued supply is essential to maintain resilience. Beach sediment from such biogenic sources is derived from offshore reefs, making resilience assessment and monitoring of those habitats a further priority. Suitable timeframes are needed for managers to assess resilience, necessitating a need for longer term monitoring projects in the region. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To properly manage our natural and managed landscapes, and to restore or repair degraded areas, it is important to know the changes that have taken place over time, particularly with respect to land use and its cumulative effect on ecological function. In common with many places in the world, where the industrial revolution resulted in profound changes to land use and management, Australia's landscapes have been transformed in the last 200 years. Initially the VAST (Vegetation Assets, States and Transitions) system was developed to describe and map changes in vegetation over time through a series of condition states or classes; here we describe an enhancement to the VAST method which will enable identification of the factors contributing to those changes in state as a result of changes in management practice. The 'VAST-2' system provides a structure in which to compile, interpret and sequence a range of data about past management practices, their effect on site and vegetation condition. Alongside a systematic chronology of land use and management, a hierarchy of indices is used to build a picture of the condition of the vegetation through time: 22 indicators within ten criteria representing three components of vegetation condition-regenerative capacity, vegetation structure and species composition-are scored using information from a variety of sources. These indicators are assessed relative to a pre-European reference state, either actual or synthetic. Each component is weighted proportionally to its contribution to the whole, determined through expert opinion. These weighted condition components are used to produce an aggregated transformation score for the vegetation. The application of this system to a range of sites selected across Australia's tropical, sub-tropical and temperate bioregions is presented, illustrating the utility of the system. Notably, the method accommodates a range of different types of information to be aggregated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Forest Damage has now been running since 1984. Its main objective has been monitoring the boreal forest conditions in relation to air pollution. Surveys of forests are performed on plots in a nation-wide representative grid network, in a network of local countywise plots, and in a network of intensively monitored plots within the framework of the internationally co-ordinated UN/ECE ICP Forests. At intensively monitored plots, a number of measurements were performed, for example tree crown-condition assessments, foliar chemistry, air pollution, precipitation chemistry (open area and stand throughfall), soil and soil-water chemistry. Vitality criteria have shown a declining trend, expressed as reduced crown density and more of discoloured trees, particularly in spruce forests. These results are similar to findings in other Scandinavian countries and coincide with the general trend in Europe. Forest yield has increased in later years in most parts of Norway. Tree mortality in excess of normal is not recorded.
   Considering these results, it is reasonable to presume that most Norwegian forest ecosystems are generally in a good condition. Areas in the south-eastern part of the country, however, may have shown indications of a slightly reduced crown condition. These areas are located in a region with a relatively high load of air pollution and low buffering capacity against acidification. Although forest conditions generally depend on soil, tree age, climate, pests and diseases, and other natural stressors; air pollution loads add to, or may interact with, these factors. Most likely inciting factors (e.g. summer drought) have occurred and produced visual symptoms. The actual effect of the air pollution component is, therefore, difficult to estimate; however, its importance is not discounted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land degradation in the agricultural domains of South Africa has attained a scale that requires scientific intervention. To devise an appropriate control measure, we investigated the contribution of vegetation condition and soil properties to observed land degradation conditions. Twenty three degraded sites were identified and classified using a land degradation index derived from six physical degradation indicators, using multidimensional analysis techniques. A veldt condition assessment was also conducted on the sites. Soil samples from the sites were analyzed for soil degradation indicators viz., particle size fractions, aggregate stability, organic C, pH, EC, total and exchangeable Na, Mg, K and Ca. The veldt condition score ranged from 26.3 - 50%, which implied that the veldt condition has diminished by up to 50 - 77% of its standard condition. Most of the degraded sites are poorly covered; the percentage basal cover ranged from 12 - 39% with average distance of 0.8 - 30.7cm between plants. The degraded lands consisted of high (69 - 100%) proportion of increaser's species which was caused by selective grazing of palatable species by wildlife herbivores. The stable soil aggregate size ranged from 0.8 - 1.4 mm across the mechanical disaggregation, fast wetting and slow wetting tests. Soils of the degraded sites (poorly, moderately and highly degraded) have low organic carbon content < 13.0 mgkg(-1). Higher quantities of Na and Ca were observed in the highly degraded sites, indicating the effects of increased solidification and calcification on the breakdown and erosion of soil aggregates. Soil erosion was the major end occurrence in land degradation episodes at Tsolwana game reserve, which was a result of the integrated effects of the vegetation and soil variables. It is recommended that land degradation control measures should be focused on the alteration of cause-variables rather than the effects variable (soil erosion).

AB  - Discussion on the impact of climate change on various aspects of life is of increasing concern to the scientific community. Providing food for the growing population in adverse climatic conditions is a major challenge. This includes the provision of high-quality animal feed. Applying environmental approaches in this direction is key to restoring ecological balance. In this study, we investigated the effect of novel biostimulants on the synthesis of amino acids in alfalfa. Green mass and alfalfa hay are high in protein and essential amino acids, the main indicators that determine the quality of the biomass produced. The use of biostimulants in this study leads to an improvement in the biological value of proteins - the total amount of essential amino acids is increased and the ratio of essential amino acids to the other proteinogenic amino acids is changed in favor of the essential and increased the nutritional value of feed. The results obtained are crucial for the successful implementation of green practices in agriculture.

AB  - New York City's extensive municipal park system is home to forests, wetlands, and grasslands that provide important ecological and social benefits to the city's population. While efforts and programs exist to restore and protect these spaces, management recommendations are complex due to variable conditions in urban natural areas. To advance the management of urban natural areas, the first comprehensive ecological assessment was conducted through a collaborative effort across 4000 ha of natural areas within New York City parkland. Field and spatial data were collected and analyzed to identify the extent of forests, the types of forests, and their conditions. This approach will help guide decision-making and prioritization of natural area management at the regional level by developing unique quantitative targets for urban forests. This project serves as an example of collaboration between private and public institutions advancing the governance of urban natural areas to achieve citywide conservation and policy goals.

AB  - Ecological restoration programs often attempt to maintain or enhance ecosystem services (ES), but fine-scale maps of multiple ES are rarely available to support prioritization among potential projects. Here we use agency reports, citizen science, and social media as data sources to quantify the spatial distribution of five recreational elements of cultural ES (CES) - sport fishing, recreational boating, birding, beach use, and park visitation across North America's Laurentian Great Lakes, where current restoration investments exceed US$1.5 billion. These recreational CES are widely yet unevenly distributed, and spatial correlations among all except park visitation indicate that many locations support multiple CES benefits. Collectively, these five service metrics cor-relate with tourism gross domestic product, indicating that local economies benefit from ecosystem conditions that support CES. However, locations of high recreational CES delivery are often severely affected by environmental stressors, suggesting that either ecosystem condition or human enjoyment of these recreational CES is resilient even to substantial levels of stress. Our analyses show that spatial assessments of recreational CES are an informative complement to ecosystem stress assessments for guiding large-scale restoration efforts.

AB  - Development of integrated ecological indicators for assessment of the condition of altered watersheds is fundamental to sound policy and decision making in water resource management. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for developing and integrating a set of hydrological and biologic indicators that can show the modified spatial and temporal distributions of hydrological and biological conditions which result from land use/cover changes across the study watersheds by using Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, multiple physical and biological databases, and simulation models. Effects of management practices and programs can be evaluated by comparing the temporal distributions of these indicators over a certain period. The paper further outlines steps needed to bridge the gaps between the largely physical and structural aspects of research on watershed indicators and the work on biological processes and indicators of ecosystems for integrating these indicators into watershed planning and management processes.

AB  - We analyzed pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), calcareous microfossils, plant macrofossils, diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, opal phytoliths and organic matter content in a 123-cm sediment sequence from Nahuel Ruca Lake, a shallow, freshwater system in the southeastern Pampa grasslands, Argentina. Three stages in the lake evolution were identified. Before 3,680 cal year BP, only pollen, NPPs (dinoflagellate cysts and acritarchs) and ostracods were recovered, suggesting brackish/saline conditions in the lake and nearby areas. Freshwater conditions are, however, indicated by Myriophyllum, Pediastrum and Zygnemataceae. The brackish/saline conditions could have been caused by marine influence during a Holocene sea level high stand that affected the area ca. 6,000 year BP. Between 3,680 and 390 cal year BP, macrophyte pollen and plant macrofossils indicate increasingly freshwater conditions in the lake and the adjacent area. Diatom and ostracod assemblages, however, suggest brackish and oligotrophic conditions, giving way to freshwater and meso-eutrophic conditions toward the end of this period. The relationship between submersed macrophytes (Myriophyllum, Potamogeton, Ceratophyllum, Chara) and planktonic algae (Chlorophyta and diatoms), suggests a shift in the lake from a clear to a turbid state. This turbid state is more evident after 390 cal year BP. High values of Pediastrum, Scenedesmus and diatoms (Cyclotella meneghiniana, Aulacoseira granulata, A. muzzanensis) observed during this stage could have reduced light penetration, with consequent loss of submersed plants. Pollen and plant macrofossils in the uppermost 20 cm indicate a shallow, freshwater lake similar to present, though an increase in brackish/freshwater diatoms suggests an increase in salinity, perhaps related to periodic droughts. Opal phytoliths yield a regional paleoclimatic reconstruction that agrees closely with inferences made using pollen, mammals and sediment characteristics.

AB  - Holocene palaeolimnological conditions were reconstructed by analysing fossil diatom assemblages within a lacustrine sediment core from Lake Sokoch, southern Kamchatka (Russia). Sediments of this proglacial lake cover the past 9400 years and hence represent almost the whole Holocene history. The biosiliceous muddy sample material was analysed for several geochemical and biological parameters, such as the total organic carbon and biogenic silica content, and the diatom community (quantitative and qualitative changes). Based on changes in the relative abundances of the most frequent species Aulacoseira subarctica, Staurosira martyi and Stephanodiscus alpinus and a depth-constrained cluster analyses (CONISS), five diatom assemblage zones could be identified. The oldest stage recovered lies between 9400 and 9000 cal. a BP and reflects the initial lake stage after the retreat of local glaciers, with a high detrital sediment supply, shallow-water conditions and a high diatom diversity. The next zone (9000-6200 cal. a BP) shows a more mature lake system with accumulating biogenic remains and higher water levels during climate amelioration. This is followed by the most obvious change in the diatom assemblage, delineated by an occurrence of S.alpinus, between 6200 and 2700 cal. a BP. Wet conditions in spring probably led to an enhanced fluvial runoff and eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions. The end of this period might reflect climate deterioration related to the Neoglacial epoch of the Holocene. Between 2700 and 1600 cal. a BP the sediments of Lake Sokoch reveal oligotrophic water conditions in a windy high-energy environment. The youngest interval, between 1600 cal. a BP and the Present, indicates shallow-water conditions and a very short growing season, which might reflect the Little Ice Age. The results may offer a baseline for the interpretation of Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes in Kamchatka and their relation to regional climate change from a palaeoecological perspective.

AB  - The increasing diversity and complexity of contaminants released in the environment continuously lead to new challenges when applying ecotoxicity assays. This paper comprises a review concerning exposure assessment and highlights important variables that should be taken into account when investigating aquatic media toxicity under both laboratory or field conditions. Thus, to reflect as much as possible what occurs in nature, ecotoxicity assays must carefully consider these variables in their experimental design. This includes contaminant properties, the selected bioindicators and biomarkers, the dose mode/regime, concentration vs. load, exposure to single vs. multiple contaminants and exposure of single vs. multiple species. Many of these, however, are not usually taken into account, leading to critical knowledge gaps in this area, discussed in detail herein.

AB  - Guanabara Bay, the second largest bay on the Brazilian coast, has tropical to subtropical, hypereutrophic water conditions. A survey of the macroalgae flora conducted over the past 200 years (1800-2013) yielded a list of 245 species, which represents 15.7% of the total macroalgae recorded in the Tropical Western Atlantic, while comprehends 29.9% and 50.2% of the marine flora in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. When evaluating the macroalgal list throughout different periods, it is noticeable the gradual loss of biodiversity as anthropization increased over the last two centuries. The use of phytogeographic indexes and beta diversity confirmed the negative changes in macroalgae assemblages as a response to increasing environmental degradation. The use of floristic surveys to establish the reference conditions employing historical data and/or regionally referenced prove to be an efficient tool using macroalgae as an ecological indicator for water quality.

AB  - Increase in human population and development causes adverse impact on ecosystems. Planktons are sensitive to different environmental conditions and good indicators of water quality. Study was carried out on phytoplankton and some physicochemical properties of Narikulam water reservoir during summer 2011. In the present study, phytoplankton density, diversity, compositions were considered for ecological monitoring and water quality assessment. Samples were collected from 12 different locations on two consecutive days. The identifications, compositions and diversity index analyses were carried out in the laboratory. Five phytoplankton groups were identified in the water samples comprising 48 genera. Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae were found in the decreasing abundance. Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (SWI) values varied from 1.97 to 3.78, with one outlier indicating moderate to good levels of phytoplankton diversity. No remarkable organic pollution was indicated by Palmer's Pollution Index (2-12) in reservoir. The study revealed that Narikulam water reservoir was apparently unpolluted and free from adverse environmental conditions; therefore, water was suitable for domestic use and irrigation.

AB  - Protected area management involves balancing environmental and social objectives. This is particularly difficult at high-use/high-impact recreation sites, because resource protection objectives may require substantial site management or visitor regulation. This study examined visitors' reactions to both of these types of actions at Annapolis Rocks, Maryland, a popular Appalachian Trail camping area. We surveyed visitors before and after implementation of camping policies that included shifting camping to designated newly constructed campsites and prohibiting campfires. Survey results reveal that visitors were more satisfied with all social and environmental indicators after the changes were enacted. An Importance-Performance analysis also determined that management actions improved conditions for factors of greatest concern to campers prior to the changes. Posttreatment visitors were least satisfied with factors related to reduced freedom and to some characteristics of the constructed campsites. Although there was evidence of visitor displacement, the camping changes met management goals by protecting the camping area's natural resources and improving social conditions.

AB  - Recycled water is important for maintaining river flow in semi-arid regions. However, it has ecological risk, as suggested by comparison of habitat and white and red blood cell count in two wild fish species (Barbus meridionalis and Squalius laietanus) before and after an input of recycled water in Ripoll River (NE Spain) in 2009. Due to the lack of normal ranges for blood variables in wild fish, we surveyed seasonally the same river reaches in 2013 to test if blood alterations from 2009 compromised the viability of the fish populations. By examining other indicators of river health in baseline and polluted sites (fish abundance, mass-length relationships, and community indices in fish, diatoms and invertebrates), we tested for the superior utility of blood tests in biomonitoring. The comparison of water quality and scores of diatoms and invertebrate indices between polluted and reference sites showed that polluted sites improved from 2009 to 2013. The abundance of B. meridionalis also increased in polluted sites, but that of S. laietanus declined in 2013 compared to 2009. These results contrast with results of blood analyses in 2009, which suggested that B. meridionalis was more seriously affected by pollution than S. laietanus. The fish index did not reveal the risk of recycled water to fish health, whereas fish mass-length relationships suggested that S. laietanus individuals in 2013 had a better body condition in polluted than in reference sites. Given that the two fish species had opposite results in reference sites, and that the physical habitat was more suitable for B. meridionalis in polluted sites in 2013 than was for S. laietanus, trends in population size are not only explained by pollution. The role of phenology is suggested by peaks in blood disorders during the breeding season. However, more long-term studies combining indicators of river health at the individual and community scales are needed to fully assess the ecological risk of recycled water in this river. These studies will also help to develop blood tests as reliable health indicators in wild fish populations.

AB  - Monitoring of indicators of the ecological condition of bays, tidal rivers, and estuaries within the Virginian Biogeographic Province (Cape God, Massachusetts to Cape Henry, Virginia) was conducted annually by the U.S. EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) during the summer months of 1990 to 1993. Data were collected at 425 probability-based stations within the Province. Indicators monitored included water quality (temperature, salinity, water clarity, and dissolved oxygen concentration), sediment contamination, sediment toxicity, benthic community structure, fish community structure, and fish gross external pathology. Data were used to estimate the current status of the ecological condition of Virginian Province estuarine resources, and provide a baseline for identifying possible future changes. Estimates, with 95% confidence limits, of the areal extent of impacted resources within the Province are provided. Data are also presented by estuarine class (large estuaries, small estuarine systems, and large tidal rivers). Results show that, overall, approximately half of the estuarine waters of the Virginian Province can be classified as impacted based on multiple indicators, with hypoxia being the major stressor.

AB  - The benthic foraminiferal diversity index was computed from Beypore estuary sediments. The abundance and diversity of Quinqueloculina lata, Textularia agglutinans, Haplophagmoides canariensis, and Quinqueloculina stelligera were dominated by stress-tolerant taxa such as Ammonia tepida, A.parkinsoniana, Nonion grateloupi, and N. scaphum in the estuary. The small-size foraminifera probably perished in a juvenile stage because of the high temperature and low salinity that prevailed in the ecosystem. The dominance of stress tolerant benthic foraminifera and absence of Elphidium species in the estuary suggest the prevalence of hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions. The consistent low-diversity index of foraminifera indicates that the ecosystem is moderate to highly stressed ecologically in the Beypore estuary. The application of benthic foraminifera as a bioindicator for assessing the environmental stress in the Beypore estuary is key in monitoring these fragile coastal ecosystems.

AB  - EFSA requested its Scientific Committee to prepare a guidance document providing generic issues and criteria to consider biological relevance, particularly when deciding on whether an observed effect is of biological relevance, i.e. is adverse (or shows a beneficial health effect) or not. The guidance document provides a general framework for establishing the biological relevance of observations at various stages of the assessment. Biological relevance is considered at three main stages related to the process of dealing with evidence: Development of the assessment strategy. In this context, specification of agents, effects, subjects and conditions in relation to the assessment question(s): Collection and extraction of data; Appraisal and integration of the relevance of the agents, subjects, effects and conditions, i.e. reviewing dimensions of biological relevance for each data set. A decision tree is developed to assist in the collection, identification and appraisal of relevant data for a given specific assessment question to be answered.

AB  - Grasses are of great importance for sustainable food production in different ecosystems. Leaf anatomical studies of grasses are the indicator for adaptation of grasses in different areas of the world. The present research study was conducted to evaluate the diversity of leaf anatomical adaptations in different grass species from Faisalabad region in Pakistan. Thicker epidermis in Paspaledium flavidium, Setaria pumila and Eleusine indica is the adaptation to survive under water stressed environments such as drought and salinity. Larger cortical cell area in Setaria verticillate, Digitaria sanguinalis and Eleusine indica is a sign of their wide distribution in a variety of environmental conditions. Eragrostis tenella and Desmostachya bipinnata with significantly larger vascular bundle is the better adaption to a variety of environments. Different species of grasses showed variable responses in their anatomical characters. These variations help to evaluate the adaptation of grasses in varying climatic conditions and their ability to tolerate abiotic stress (i.e., drought and salinity) which are common in this region in natural habitats of grasses.

AB  - In the scientific literature, few valuations of biodiversity and ecosystem services following the impacts of toxicity are available, hampered by the lack of ecotoxicological documentation. Here, tributyltin is used to conduct a contingent valuation study as well as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of measures for improving the environmental status in Swedish coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Benefits considering different dimensions when assessing environmental status are highlighted and a quantitative environmental assessment framework based on available technology, ecological conditions, and economic valuation methodology is developed. Two scenarios are used in the valuation study: (a) achieving good environmental status by 2020 in accordance with EU legislation (USD 119 household(-1) year(-1)) and (b) achieving visible improvements by 2100 due to natural degradation (USD 108 household(-1) year(-1)) during 8 years. The later scenario was used to illustrate an application of the assessment framework. The CBA results indicate that both scenarios might generate a welfare improvement.

AB  - Structural physical habitat attributes include indices of stream size, channel gradient, substrate size, habitat complexity, and riparian vegetation cover and structure. The Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) is designed to assess the status and trends of ecological resources at different scales. High-resolution remote sensing provides unique capabilities in detecting a variety of features and indicators of environmental health and condition. LIDAR is an airborne scanning laser system that provides data on topography, channel dimensions (width, depth), slope, channel complexity (residual pools, volume, morphometric complexity, hydraulic roughness), riparian vegetation (height and density), dimensions of riparian zone, anthropogenic alterations and disturbances, and channel and riparian interaction. Hyperspectral aerial imagery offers the advantage of high spectral and spatial resolution allowing for the detection and identification of riparian vegetation and natural and anthropogenic features at a resolution not possible with satellite imagery. When combined, or fused, these technologies comprise a powerful geospatial data set for assessing and monitoring lentic and lotic environmental characteristics and condition.

AB  - Analysis of subfossil remains of larval Chironomidae in 38 surface-sediment samples from between 53 and 189 m depth in Lake Tanganyika (East Africa) yielded 77 different morphotypes, including 7 Tanypodinae, 19 Orthocladiinae, and 51 Chironominae. Character-state differences between these morphotypes resemble differences at the species level in the better-known Holarctic fauna, hence we consider most of our Lake Tanganyika morphotypes equivalent to morphological species. Individual morphotypes were identified to species, genus, or tribe level depending on current alpha-taxonomic knowledge on the larvae of the group concerned, and the taxonomic resolution of preserved diagnostic features. This paper presents taxon diagnoses and an illustrated key to the Tanypodinae and Orthocladiinae in this Lake Tanganyika collection, with the aim to promote consistency of identification in studies using African Chironomidae as biological indicators of natural and anthropogenic environmental change in lacustrine ecosystems.

AB  - This article investigates the impact of environmental production conditions on smallholder farmers' technical efficiency in Ethiopia for wheat, maize, and sorghum farming. We use a household panel data set with annual and cropping season environmental production conditions to estimate the technical efficiency scores. The results show that including environmental production conditions in the stochastic frontier has a significant impact on farmers' technical efficiency scores. Technical efficiency scores improve when environmental production conditions are incorporated in the stochastic frontier. Thus, accounting for environmental production conditions reduces the inefficiencies that otherwise may be attributed to the characteristics of smallholder farmers.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study, by an in toto immunohistochemical technique, the expression pattern of the heat shock protein, Hsp70, in the widely used bioindicator species Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus 1761) (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae), living in a motorway retention pond. All sampling and measurements have been performed from March 2002 to March 2003. The water physicochemical analyses have revealed a large increase in Na+ and Cl- concentrations after the de-icing road surface in winter related to motorway maintenance that correspond to an osmotic shock (from 3.1 to 105.7 mg L-1 for Na+ and from 3.5 to 193.9 mg L-1 for Cl-). An expression of Hsp70 was observed in the chloride cells only during the osmotic shock. In contrast, the gill insertions were Hsp70 immunoreactive in specimens collected all along the year. For comparison, the expression of Hsp70 was investigated in specimens collected in a temporary pond. C. dipterum larvae living in this pond, not submitted to such osmotic shock, do not express Hsp70 neither in chloride cells nor in gill insertions. Likewise, the expression of Hsp70 was not detected in these structures during the drying period when the abiotic conditions become progressively stressful (elevation of temperature and anoxia). As chloride cells play a key role in osmoregulation, their functional integrity is crucial for the survival of the mayfly larvae in occasionally salty freshwaters. According to the well known protective role of the Hsp70 stress proteins, it is likely that the induction of Hsp70 may protect the chloride cells from osmotic shock injuries resulting from the increase in salinity. So, the Hsp70 induction in chloride cells is designed as a useful biomarker of osmotic shock. The in toto immunohistochemical detection of Hsp70 allows to characterize both the exposure situation and biological effects in target cells induced by stresses. This method could be used as a complementary qualitative approach in the biomarker actual concept. Finally, this investigation that combines this osmotic shock biomarker and this kind of bioindicator species would be a helpful tool for the monitoring of freshwater ecological systems.

AB  - Purpose To understand the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by Cyperus malaccensis (CM) and Spartina alterniflora (SA) in a typical subtropical estuary (Min River) of Southeast China, the concentrations of five metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni) in plants and sediments of CM and SA marshes were determined.
   Materials and methods Two experimental plots (no flooding plot and flooding plot) were established in the intertidal zone of the Min River estuary in July 2015, and, in each plot, in situ sampling was conducted in CM and SA marshes, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.
   Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.
   Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.

AB  - P>Predicting regime shifts - drastic changes in dynamic behaviour - is a key challenge in ecology and other fields. Here we show that the class of ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our results offer a cautionary note about the generality of forecasting sudden changes in ecosystems.

AB  - Sediment samples from a Continuous 4.6 in profile in the dry bed of Lake Ngami in NW Botswana were analysed for geochemistry and dated using both C-14 and TL methods. Certain units in the profile were found to be diatom rich and these, with the geochemical results, were used as indicators of high and low lake levels within the basin. The Lake Ngami sediments contain a high proportion of SiO2 (51-92.5 wt%, avg. 72.4 wt%) and variable levels of Al2O3 (2.04-17.2 wt%, avg. 8.88 wt%). Based on elevated Al2O3 and organic matter (LOIorgC) results, lacustrine conditions occurred at ca. 42 ka until 40 ka and diatom results suggest that relatively deep but brackish conditions prevailed. At 40 ka, the lacustrine sedimentary record was terminated abruptly, possibly by tectonic activity. At ca. 19 ka, shallow, aerobic, turbulent conditions were prevalent, but lake levels were at this time increasing to deeper water conditions up until ca. 17ka. This period coincides with the Late Glacial Maximum, a period of increased aridity in the central Southern Africa region. Generally, increasing Sr/Ca ratios and decreasing LOIorgC and Al2O3, from ca. 16 to 5 ka, suggest decreasing inflow into the basin and declining lake levels. Based on the enrichment of LREE results, Slightly alkaline conditions prevailed at ca. 12 ka. Diatom results also Support shallow alkaline conditions around this time. These lake conditions were maintained primarily by local rainfall input as the region experienced a warmer, wetter phase between 16 and 11 ka. Lake levels rose rapidly by 4 ka, probably in response to enhanced rainfall in the Angolan catchment. These results indicate that lake levels in the Lake Ngami basin are responding to rainfall changes in the Angolan catchment area and local rainfall. The results confirm that the present-day anti-phase rainfall relationship between southern Africa and regions of equatorial Africa was extant during the late Quaternary over the Angolan highlands and NW Botswana.

AB  - Better mitigation of anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems is urgently needed to address increasing biodiversity losses worldwide. We explore opportunities for stressor mitigation using whole-of-systems modelling of ecological resilience, accounting for complex interactions between stressors, their timing and duration, background environmental conditions and biological processes. We then search for ecological windows, times when stressors minimally impact ecological resilience, defined here as risk, recovery and resistance. We show for 28 globally distributed seagrass meadows that stressor scheduling that exploits ecological windows for dredging campaigns can achieve up to a fourfold reduction in recovery time and 35% reduction in extinction risk. Although the timing and length of windows vary among sites to some degree, global trends indicate favourable windows in autumn and winter. Our results demonstrate that resilience is dynamic with respect to space, time and stressors, varying most strongly with: (i) the life history of the seagrass genus and (ii) the duration and timing of the impacting stress.

AB  - The UNECE Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys measure and spatially predict environmental concentration (PEC) of metals in mosses for ecotoxicological risk assessments. Up to now, no statistical sound investigation was dedicated to those boundary conditions which, aside from the atmospheric depositions of metals from the atmosphere down to the land surface, might influence the bioaccumulation of metals. Thus, the article focuses on the integrative analysis of the data on the bioaccumulation of metals in Germany 1990, 1995 and 2000 on the one hand and of data on conceivable boundary conditions on the other hand. To this end Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were used because CART is a very powerful statistical technique that enables to uncover structures in large data sets containing categorical and continuous data without any transformation of scale dignity. Within the framework of the Metals in Mosses Surveys, moss samples were taken at 592 sites in 1990, at 1026 sites in 1995 and at 1028 sites in 2000 in Germany. At each of them mosses were sampled and the concentrations of up to 40 metals were measured. The sampling, the ecological characteristics of the sampling sites, and the chemical analysis were documented in a metadata base. An ecoregionalisation of Germany was calculated with data on natural vegetation, altitude, soil texture and climate by means of CART. The ecoregions were mapped by GIS and intersected with multi-metal bioaccumulation indices calculated from the monitoring data 1990, 1995 and 2000. These indices were calculated by percentile statistics and the concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, V and Zn were integrated. To reach an integrative exposure assessment, for each survey a CART-model was computed encompassing the multi-metal bioaccumulation indices, the metadata and the ecoregionalization. The models describe the multivariate correlations of metal bioaccumulation with site-specific and ecoregional characteristics in a comprehensive and holistic manner over time, space and metal species. This is of crucial importance for the next step in ecological risk assessment, i.e. the interpretation of the exposure data with regard to predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) and the sensitivity of ecosystems.

AB  - In bacterial populations, subtle expressional differences may promote ecological specialization through the formation of distinct ecotypes. In a barrier-free habitat, this process most likely precedes population divergence and may predict speciation events. To examine this, we used four sequenced strains of the bacterium Shewanella baltica, OS155, OS185, OS195, and OS223, as models to assess transcriptional variation and ecotype formation within a prokaryotic population. All strains were isolated from different depths throughout a water column of the Baltic Sea, occupying different ecological niches characterized by various abiotic parameters. Although the genome sequences are nearly 100% conserved, when grown in the laboratory under standardized conditions, all strains exhibited different growth rates, suggesting significant expressional variation. Using the Ecotype Simulation algorithm, all strains were considered to be discrete ecotypes when compared to 32 other S. baltica strains isolated from the same water column, suggesting ecological divergence. Next, we employed custom microarray slides containing oligonucleotide probes representing the core genome of OS155, OS185, OS195, and OS223 to detect natural transcriptional variation among strains grown under identical conditions. Significant transcriptional variation was noticed among all four strains. Differentially expressed gene profiles seemed to coincide with the metabolic signatures of the environment at the original isolation depth. Transcriptional pattern variations such as the ones highlighted here may be used as indicators of short-term evolution emerging from the formation of bacterial ecotypes.
   IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic studies have shown considerable transcriptional variation among individuals from the same population. It has been suggested that natural variation in eukaryotic gene expression may have significant evolutionary consequences and may explain large-scale phenotypic divergence of closely related species, such as humans and chimpanzees (M.-C. King and A. C. Wilson, Science 188: 107116, 1975, http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science. 1090005; M. F. Oleksiak, G. A. Churchill, and D. L. Crawford, Nat Genet 32: 261-266, 2002, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng983). However, natural variation in gene expression is much less well understood in prokaryotic organisms. In this study, we used four sequenced strains of the marine bacterium Shewanella baltica to better understand the natural transcriptional divergence of a stratified prokaryotic population. We found substantial low-magnitude expressional variation among the four S. baltica strains cultivated under identical laboratory conditions. Collectively, our results indicate that transcriptional variation is an important factor for ecological speciation.

AB  - Hunting sustainability in Amazonian ecosystems is a key challenge for modern stakeholders. Predictive models have evolved from first mostly biological data-based to more recent modeling including human behavior. We analyze here the hunting data collected in French Guiana through a panel of indices aiming at drawing the puzzle of parameters influencing hunting activity and impact in various socio ecological conditions across the country. Data were collected from five different study sites differing in cultural origins and remoteness from market economy, and over a 10 years period. Most indices show an impact on wildlife populations, and using a full set of indicators allowed us to better understand some underlying mechanisms that lead to a community's hunting profile. The results showed that there are noticeable differences between the study sites in the practices and the ways hunters face the changes in environment and resources availability.

AB  - The feeding diversity of macroinvertebrates from the estuary of Mondego was estimated with Shannon-Wiener complementary evenness following the methodology presented in Gamito and Furtado (2009. Ecological Indicators. 9,1009-1019). Results were compared with those from BAT (Benthic Assessment Tool; Teixeira et al., 2009. Marine Pollution Bulletin. 58,1477-1786) applied to the same data set, obtained from sampling carried out in 14 estuarine subtidal stations in Spring of 1990, 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2002. The BAT is a multimetric methodology based on three indices, the Shannon-Wiener and Margalef diversity indices, applied in conjunction with AMBI (AZTI Marine Biotic Index). To determinate the feeding diversity, each invertebrate was assigned to a feeding group. Six trophic groups were considered: surface deposit feeders, subsurface deposit feeders, herbivores or grazers. suspension feeders and suspension/deposit feeders. The carnivorous, omnivorous and scavengers were ill grouped together, forming the sixth group.
   The results obtained with both tools pointed out, in general, to the same tendencies. However, in few occasions the feeding diversity pointed out to a high or a bad ecological quality condition whereas the BAT indicated a moderate condition. Occasionally, in stations with average species richness, all individuals were assigned to only one to three feeding groups, and the feeding diversity was low. Even if these taxa were included in the first two or three AMBI sensitive groups, with their presence indicating a possible good ecological condition, they all perform the same ecological function, for example, they are all omnivorous. In these cases the trophic functioning of the system is reduced and the lower trophic levels are missing, such as the suspension-feeders and the decomposers or deposit-feeders. On the contrary, a highly diverse trophic assemblage might be found, but composed of taxa assigned to AMBI ecological groups of species indifferent or tolerant to organic enrichment, and of second-order opportunistic species, indicating a moderate ecological condition, while the feeding diversity will be high. The feeding diversity is, therefore, useful as a complementary information index, measuring other aspects of the community organization, which are not required for ecological quality assessment by the WFD, and so not included in metrics such as BAT.

AB  - The Cappadocia Region of Central Anatolia having a very distinct culture is one of the attractive touristic sites of Turkey due to its spectacular and unique landforms and historical heritages. In this region, the structures carved into thick to massive tuffs survived and kept their original integrity for a number of centuries. Environmental and anthropological factors at the Cappadocia Region have been the main reasons for extensive subsurface and multi-purpose use in the past and present. In addition, thermal insulation properties of the tuffs make these rocks suitable for use in underground openings. The Kayakapi Neighborhood, located in the town of Urgup, is one of the famous historical sites. This site is situated within the "Goreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia" which was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1985. In order to develop the tourism potential of this abandoned site while preserving its cultural and natural values, a natural environmental conservation and revitalization project was initiated. As an integral part of this project, in this study, environmental and engineering geological problems, including rock fall potential and stability of about 1,200 rock-hewn structures, were investigated and an inventory was prepared for the possible re-use of the underground openings and other structures at the site, and remedial measures were recommended. The assessments based on observations and experimental studies indicated that the tuffs do not show significant changes both perpendicular and parallel to layering, and discontinuities and rock weathering seem to be more important factors controlling the stability of rock-hewn structures. The major stability problems threatening the re-use of the openings are structurally-controlled block instabilities, overbreaks, and erosion and shearing of the pillars made of tuff. On the other hand, the area at the entrance of the site requires some protection measures such as the construction of a retaining wall, systematic bolting of rock slabs and removal of some blocks having rock fall potential. The inventory for the openings suggests that there are a number of openings that can be re-used after necessary remedial measures.

AB  - Large benthic foraminifera are major carbonate components in tropical carbonate platforms, important carbonate producers, stratigraphic tools and powerful bioindicators (proxies) of environmental change. The application of large benthic foraminifera in tropical coral reef environments has gained considerable momentum in recent years. These modern ecological assessments are often carried out by micropalaeontologists or ecologists with expertise in the identification of foraminifera. However, large benthic foraminifera have been under-represented in favour of macro reef-builders, for example, corals and calcareous algae. Large benthic foraminifera contribute about 5% to modern reef-scale carbonate sediment production. Their substantial size and abundance are reflected by their symbiotic association with the living algae inside their tests. When the foraminiferal holobiont (the combination between the large benthic foraminifera host and the microalgal photosymbiont) dies, the remaining calcareous test renourishes sediment supply, which maintains and stabilizes shorelines and low-lying islands. Geological records reveal episodes (i.e. late Palaeocene and early Eocene epochs) of prolific carbonate production in warmer oceans than today, and in the absence of corals. This begs for deeper consideration of how large benthic foraminifera will respond under future climatic scenarios of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and to warmer oceans. In addition, studies highlighting the complex evolutionary associations between large benthic foraminifera hosts and their algal photosymbionts, as well as to associated habitats, suggest the potential for increased tolerance to a wide range of conditions. However, the full range of environments where large benthic foraminifera currently dwell is not well-understood in terms of present and future carbonate production, and impact of stressors. The evidence for acclimatization, at least by a few species of well-studied large benthic foraminifera, under intensifying climate change and within degrading reef ecosystems, is a prelude to future host-symbiont resilience under different climatic regimes and habitats than today. This review also highlights knowledge gaps in current understanding of large benthic foraminifera as prolific calcium carbonate producers across shallow carbonate shelf and slope environments under changing ocean conditions.

AB  - 1. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of five non-glacial intermittent high altitude headwater streams (above 1400 m - Serra da Estrela, Portugal), with dry periods of different lengths (0-3 months), were investigated in nearly undisturbed conditions to (i) examine spatial differences and identify environmental variables responsible for the observed invertebrate patterns, (ii) assess the association of dry period length with invertebrate community structure and (iii) determine the influence of using different taxonomic identification levels (order, family and genus) to assess invertebrate community patterns.
   2. More than 100 macroinvertebrate genera were identified. Insects clearly dominated these communities with more than 95% of total captures and around 95% of the total richness. Diptera were the most rich and abundant group with chironomid occurrences comprising over 70% of macroinvertebrate captures.
   3. The highest taxon richness, diversity, EPT (Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata + Coleoptera + Heteroptera) genus richness, the greatest number of exclusive and characteristic taxa identified by the Indicator Value (IndVal), and a distinct community structure shown by Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA), were found in the only stream that was never totally dry, with pools lasting over summer. Environmental gradients that spatially structured the macroinvertebrate communities were always related to flow variations.
   4. Over time, the highest abundances found in these systems were also related to flow variations and maximum genus richness occurred in the connected pools or in isolated pools. Streams with longer dry periods presented a distinct recolonization phase, with higher abundance of the stonefly larvae Nemoura sp. and the presence of the chironomid larvae Krenosmittia sp., possibly arriving from the hyporheos.
   5. Taxonomic level of invertebrate identification was vital for recognizing the characteristic taxa (IndVal) of streams yet was not critical for identifying streams with the highest macroinvertebrate richness/diversity or structuring environmental gradients.
   6. Overall, this study emphasizes the variability of high altitude intermittent streams macroinvertebrate communities, despite spatial proximity. This variability was probably related to flow intermittency and hydrologic permanence, different vegetation covers and riverbed substrata. Consequently, the establishment of reference conditions should involve long-term data collections and more detailed physical characterization. Also, these findings have significant implications for accurately predicting the ecological consequences of future climate change in high altitude scenarios.

AB  - Chironomids are a formidable indicator taxon, as they are globally ubiquitous, can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, and can occur in high numbers in anthropogenically impaired environments where other indicator taxa are not encountered. Biomonitoring is frequently performed through analyzing species composition, abundance and morphology. However, these traditional approaches may be problematic, since indicator taxon morphology is often cryptic, and inadequately assigned species complexes may lead to generalized ecological tolerances. We argue that the use of chironomids in freshwater biomonitoring could be much improved if physiological responses to a given pollutant were measured in conjunction with precisely determined species, aided by molecular approaches such as is already done for some well known mesophilic and extremophile species in certain regions of the world. We explore molecular biological approaches that may prove useful for this purpose.

AB  - The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) dominates vast acreages of rangeland in the western USA, leading to increased fire frequency and ecosystem degradation that is often irreversible. Episodic regeneration failure ("die-off") has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events.
   We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985-2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (kappa = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years' lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence('die-off hotspots').
   Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas.

AB  - Natural ecosystems provide an attractive focus for tourism on small islands. However, at the same time tourism and other human actions can be detrimental to these ecosystems especially because governance of the ecosystem may be difficult due to the limited resilience of small island ecosystems. In this paper, we focus on the conditions under which self-governance will be the appropriate governance mechanism of ecosystem services on small islands. We apply Ostrom's (2009) framework for common-pool resources in a social ecological system, and select the relevant indicators for small islands. We scored these indicators for three cases (environmental issues) in St. Eustatius, a Caribbean island under Dutch rule. These cases show that self-organization of ecosystem services is not an outcome easily achieved. The unevenly distributed benefits of potential measures are found to decrease community support of measures that could reinforce these ecosystem services.

AB  - The Early Cambrian is a key interval in the global development of biological evolution, in which occurred many important environmental events and organic-rich sedimentary layers were deposited, which formed important hydrocarbon source rocks. The Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation is one of the most important marine sedimentary layers in the Yangtze region, South China, and it records abundant important geological information that can be used for the reconstruction of the Lower Cambrian paleo-climates and paleo-environments.
   Nitrogen isotope compositions record and reflect variations in the original sedimentary environment and the redox conditions of marine ecosystems. Trace elements are also reliable indicators of sedimentary environments. In this study, we collected samples from the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation shale in the upper-middle Yangtze region of South China and measured the nitrogen isotope values of bulk sediments (delta N-15(bulk)), as well as their organic carbon isotope values (delta C-13(org)), total organic carbon (TOC) contents, total nitrogen (TN) contents and trace element concentrations. The delta N-15(bulk) values of the Niutitang shale range from 0.6 parts per thousand to 2.8 parts per thousand, they show a certain positive excursion from bottom to top in the longitudinal direction, and they exhibit a significant correlation with the longitudinal variations in trace elements. These trace element characteristics suggest that the lower section of the Niutitang Formation existed in a strongly reduced sedimentary environment and was located in a hydrothermally active layer. During the deposition of the lower section of black shale, the nitrogen cycle was dominated by anaerobic nitrogen fixation; thus, its nitrogen isotope values are relatively lighter. In contrast, during the deposition of the upper section of the Niutitang Formation, the redox conditions of water column were unstable, the oxygen contents increased, and oxygenated reactions were intermittent or localized; thus producing relatively strong isotopic fractionation and causing the delta N-15(bulk) values in the upper section of black shale to exhibit a positive excursion. We conclude that the sedimentary environment is the key factor affecting nitrogen isotopes and that the redox conditions of the water column exhibit a significant correlation with the nitrogen isotope values.

AB  - Soil diagnoses and monitoring of distressed forests are now main topics of soil ecological investigations. On way to study deposition effects on forest ecosystems is the investigation of the soil mesofauna. The soil faunas, especially the collembolan, react very sensitively to acids, excessive nitrogen and heavy metals in soil.
   In this study the use of two collembolan species as active indicators is examined and discussed. Fertility, growth, development and decomposition activity of Folsomia candida and Heteromurus nitidus are established to describe soil conditions and changes of soil properties caused by acidification and heavy metal enrichment. It is especially remarkable that pH-value, population density and decompositon rate are correlated in an almost completely parallel way. These above mentioned biological data are very well suitable as biological criterions for soil diagnosis.

AB  - Vegetation change in the American West has been a subject of concern throughout the twentieth century. Although many of the changes have been recorded qualitatively through the use of comparative photography and historical reports, little quantitative information has been available on the regional or watershed scale. It is currently possible to measure change over large areas and determine trends in ecological and hydrological condition using advanced space-based technologies. Specifically, this process is being tested in a community-based watershed in southeast Arizona and northeast Sonora, Mexico using a system of landscape pattern measurements derived from satellite remote sensing, spatial statistics, process modeling, and geographic information systems technology. These technologies provide the basis for developing landscape composition and pattern indicators as sensitive measures of large-scale environmental change and thus may provide an effective and economical method for evaluating watershed condition related to disturbance from human and natural stresses. The project utilizes the database from the North American Landscape Characterization (NALC) project which incorporates triplicate Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) imagery from the early 1970s, mid 1980s, and the 1990s. Landscape composition and pattern metrics have been generated from digital land cover maps derived from the NALC images and compared across a nearly 20-year period. Results about changes in land cover for the study period indicate that extensive, highly connected grassland and desertscrub areas are the most vulnerable ecosystems to fragmentation and actual loss due to encroachment of xerophytic mesquite woodland. In the study period, grasslands and desertscrub not only decreased in extent but also became more fragmented. That is, the number of grassland and desertscrub patches increased and their average patch sizes decreased. In stark contrast, the mesquite woodland patches increased in size, number, and connectivity. These changes have important impact for the hydrology of the region, since the energy and water balance characteristics for these cover types are significantly different. The process demonstrates a simple procedure to document changes and determine ecosystem vulnerabilities through the use of change detection and indicator development, especially in regard to traditional degradation processes that have occurred throughout the western rangelands involving changes of vegetative cover and acceleration of water and wind erosion.

AB  - Using preference testing, we investigated the effect of a brush and a peer's face picture on the welfare of breeding beef cows. Four cows were used in experiment 1 and another four cows were used in experiment 2. An experimental barn consisted of two 3.5 square-meter pens, and a corridor measuring 1.6 m wide and 1.3 m long. During the experiment, either side of the pens were treated. In experiment 1, straw bedding was placed in a treated pen (condition B) in the first two trials, a brush was added in the treated pen (condition BB) in the next two trials, and a peer's face picture was displayed in the treated pen (condition BBF) in the last two trials. In experiment 2, condition B was applied for the first two trials, a peer's face picture was displayed in the treated pen (condition BF) in the next two trials, and condition BBF was applied for the last two trials. Each cow was housed alone from 09.00 hour to 15.00 h in the experimental barn during the six trials. The cows stayed in the treatment pen longer than in the non-treatment pen under all conditions in experiments 1 and 2. In experiment 1, the mean total time spent in the treatment pen was longer under condition BBF than under conditions B and BB. In experiment 2, the mean total time spent in the treatment pen was shorter under condition B than under conditions BF and BBF. The mean percentage of time spent ruminating was greater under condition BBF than under condition B. It is concluded that the cows preferred the peer's face picture in the isolated condition of preference testing in this study.

AB  - Conducting a thermodynamic analysis of a plant community can be an approach to macro-ecology that emphasizes not only the diversity and abundances of plant species but also the exchange of matter and energy among species within the community and that with its physical and biological environment. The experimental data used for the test were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a manganese tailing site. The relations derived from the maximal discrete entropy theorem show that the maximum entropy will increase with increase in the total number of species N, suggesting that N has an upper limit Nm at a habitat subject to its heterogeneity in physical conditions and species resource in its surrounding areas. As an important macroscopic property of an ecosystem, N is the number of species that are present at a habitat while its upper limit Nm is the potential number of species that have been or can be adapted to the physical conditions of the habitat, and can thus possibly be present at the habitat. As a function of the maximum entropy, ln(N) is applied as a biodiversity index. As an upper limit of ln(N), ln(Nm) can be regarded as a biodiversity potential index as it takes into account the available number of species distributed in the surrounding areas of the habitat, showing the potential limit for further increase in its biodiversity. Following the thermodynamic laws, given that there is no further change in system enthalpy H, increment H = 0, the equilibrium number of species Neq can be found at the point increment N = 0 and Nm can be determined by Nm = Neq2 . The restoration of the investigated plant community was shown to be an irreversible process characterized by spontaneous increases in its total biomass and total number of plant species associated with increases in its enthalpy, Gibbs free energy and entropy. The analytical results gave support to the argument that the internal energy factors of a plant community are functions of its productivity and biodiversity and the difference between ln(N) and ln(Nm) determines its internal energy distribution.

AB  - AMBI and Bentix are widely used benthic indices for guiding remediation decisions under two major pieces of environmental legislation in Europe-the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). These indices usually incorporate all living marine benthic invertebrates in a sample. Some recent studies, however, have applied these benthic indices to only mollusk species due to the ease of identifying a single taxonomic group to the species level and because death assemblages (accumulated dead mollusk shells in sediments) may be valuable sources of data for assessing baseline conditions. Although they found that ecological status differences can be detected by applying AMBI and Bentix to mollusks, these studies did not test whether mollusk-only index values, and the ecological statuses indicated by them, are equivalent to those calculated from the whole benthic community. To test this assumption, we performed a meta-analysis of data from 12 European benthic community studies comparing mollusk-only index values with whole-community values. Using five mollusk-only data sets, we also assessed whether application of AMBI and Bentix to molluscan death assemblages can be used to detect changes in ecological status over time. We show that the application of AMBI and Bentix to only the molluscan taxa in benthic communities is a viable method for determining the ecological status of water bodies. Our results also suggest that the application of benthic indices to molluscan death assemblages has great potential to (1) establish baseline conditions for assessing ecological status under the WFD and (2) estimate the natural range of variation of ecosystem attributes for defining sustainability thresholds under the MSFD. We outline three recommendations for the future use of mollusk-only AMBI and Bentix based on our results: (1) mollusk-only index values should be adjusted to facilitate comparisons with whole-community studies; (2) if possible, local ecological group assignments should be used; and (3) we encourage collaboration between paleoecologists and benthic ecologists to facilitate interpretations of index values from death assemblages. We conclude that mollusk-only benthic index assessments of molluscan death assemblages have the potential to be a powerful tool for guiding management decisions under the WFD and MSFD.

AB  - The latest international climate documents emphasize the great importance of protective forest stands in ensuring the sustainable development of agriculture, and the main requirement is the use of the forest-forming factor by landowners in the interests of improving the environment. In Russia, until recently, the ecological significance of forest plantations was underestimated, which created the ground for discussions about their effectiveness. In this regard, a new approach is proposed that emphasizes the positive impact of forests, including sustainable development, environmental security of the agricultural sector and reducing the degradation of agricultural land. The purpose of the work was an economic assessment and regularities of the dynamics of humus-regulating and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK)-regulating efficiency of protective forest plantations on lands with deflation-hazardous soils. By means of a system analysis, the change in the soil cover of land use due to the influence of forest plantations on the balance of soil fertility elements in forested cells is comprehensively analyzed. The different spatial placement of trees from each other under different degrees of deflation in semiarid conditions is modeled. These models are used to determine the nature of the dynamics of soil nutrients in forested areas: in protection zones and outside protection. It is established that the anti-deflationary effect of agroforestry depends on the indicator of the protective forest cover of the land, the level of deflationary danger, and the operational life of the plantings. In semiarid conditions, it increases in proportion to the increase in the protection of land and amounts to EUR 376-EUR 4222 ha(-1). With an increase in the intensity of deflation to the level of dust storms, the prevented damage from the loss of soil nutrients increases almost four times. In systems of plantings from early-maturing fast-growing rocks, the anti-deflationary effect is 6-7% higher on an average annual basis than in systems of plantings from long-lasting, slow-growing rocks. The greatest efficiency of forest reclamation in ensuring a positive balance of humus and NPK substances in the soil (EUR 1002-EUR 4222 ha(-1)) is achieved when placing plantings after 15 H. The study will confirm the need to subsidize the integration of trees into farm systems.</p>

AB  - Rapidly increasing population, industrialisation, and unsustainable consumption have resulted in deterioration of water quantity and quality, thus affecting the health of the river. One of the essential components for ensuring river health is environmental flow. Nevertheless, the environmental flow is neglected or not appropriately accounted in most of the water management assessments. The objective of this study was to better quantify and assess the environmental flow requirements and developing management practices for ensuring the ecological health of the river. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) coupled with a finite element groundwater model, was used for hydrological modelling. The environmental flow regime was evaluated using an index 'Flow Health Score' (FHS), based on a Flow Health Tool. The model was simulated for three conditions - Virgin condition, Managed condition, and Modified condition for Upper and Lower Son separately. Virgin condition assumed no hydraulic interventions, while managed condition incorporated the existing management practices, and modified condition corresponded to the management practices modified in this study for ensuring environmental flow. This approach was demonstrated for the Son River in the Ganga basin. The modelled streamflow agreed with the observed discharge data (R-2 = 0.78-0.85). Further, SWAT-FEM coupled model better estimated the low flows than the SWAT model, thus demonstrating the importance of accounting for surface water - groundwater interaction in such environmental flow assessments. Flow health assessment indicated that reservoirs and irrigation diversions have severely affected the high flows in the Upper Son (high flow and highest monthly flow index less than 0.2), and low flows in the Lower Son (low flow index less than 0.2). The model simulation with the modified management practices increased the Flow Health Score (FHS) from 0.4 to 0.6 in Upper Son, and 0.4 to 0.7 in Lower Son. This study showed that coupled SWAT-FEM model, along with the flow health tool, could be effectively used for assessing the in-stream flow requirements and for designing alternative management plans to meet the in-stream flow requirements.

AB  - Coffee farming is an important practice in the tropics, but studies addressing its effect on streams, especially at high elevations in high productivity regions, are limited. We evaluated streams draining the high-elevation coffee farming region of Tarrazu, Costa Rica, in terms of water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates over the course of a year. We compared our observations to regulatory benchmarks to determine overall condition, and compared our sites in terms of riparian vegetation (i.e., canopy cover, and riparian width) to determine the role of this management practice. Overall, we found that most streams fell within recommended water quality criteria and supported high proportion of pollution-sensitive taxa. Nevertheless, we found high levels of conductivity during the drier period of the year, which may signal agrochemical pollution. Also during the drier period, we found significantly higher diversity, % scrapers, and % predators, which suggests a boost in basal food sources associated to the observed high conductivity levels. We found that riparian buffer widths were not associated to improvements in water quality indicators or bio-integrity parameters on our sites. However, canopy cover was positively correlated to % shredders and family diversity, and negatively correlated to certain tolerant taxa. Our findings help to better characterize a system that is of great economic importance in the tropics, but that remains relatively under studied. It also helps inform management practices to enhance the potential of coffee agroforestry systems in promoting tropical biodiversity conservation within aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Developing indicators of ecosystem condition is a priority in the Great Lakes, but little is known about appropriate spatial scales to characterize disturbance or response for most indicators. We surveyed birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wetland vegetation, and diatoms at 276 coastal wetland locations throughout the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region during 2002-2004. We assessed the responsiveness of 66 candidate indicators to human disturbance (agriculture, urban development, and point source contaminants) characterized at multiple spatial scales (100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000 m buffers and whole watersheds) using classification and regression tree analysis (CART). Non-stressor covariables (lake, ecosection, watershed, and wetland area) accounted for a greater proportion of variance than disturbance variables. Row-crop agriculture and urban development, especially at larger spatial scales, were about equally influential and were more explanatory than a contaminant stress index (CSI). The CSI was an important predictor for diatom indicators only. Stephanodiscoid diatoms and nest-guarding fish were identified as two of the most promising indicators of row-crop agriculture, while Ambloplites rupestris (fish) and Aeshna (dragonflies) were two of the strongest indicators of urban development. Across all groups of taxa and spatial scales, fish indicators were most responsive to the combined influence of row-crop and urban development. Our results suggest it will be critical to account for the influence of potentially important non-stressor covariables before assessing the strength of indicator responses to disturbance. Moreover, identifying the appropriate scale to characterize disturbance will be necessary for many indicators, especially when urban development is the primary disturbance.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems, which have important functions such as coastal protection and blue carbon sequestration, are threatened by anthropogenic pressure including climate change. Long-term data series from seagrass sedimentary archives (mats) can be used to understand natural cycles of environmental change and answer key questions related to contemporary management. A 7500 yr sediment record from Posidonia australis meadows in Oyster Harbour (Albany, SW Australia) was subjected to multiproxy reconstruction by means of pigment analysis (UHPLC), analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS), carbonate content, delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope ratios, organic C (C-org) content, C-org/N ratio and glomalin-related soil proteins (GASP). The study revealed a brackish lagoon (7500-7000 cal yr BP) that was transformed in an open marine environment (7000-4100 cal yr BP) due to Holocene transgression. Earliest evidence of seagrass establishment was detected around 4500 cal yr BP, and meadow extension accelerated between 4100 and 3700 cal yr BP. The meadow environment was surprisingly resistant against environmental perturbations, as the mat, composed of P. australis seagrass fibres embedded within a siliciclastic mineral matrix containing biogenic carbonates, continued to develop steadily until 190 cal yr BP (1830 CE). Then, shifts in several proxies (pigments, GASP) showed evidence of terrestrial runofftriggered eutrophication/turbidity (likely driven by forest clearance and agricultural activities after European settlement), but the seagrass showed resilience (no decline of the proportion of seagrass-derived C-org). By contrast, since similar to 1930 CE seagrass retreat is evident in the biogeochemical record: lighter delta C-13 values, lower lignin abundance and shifts in pigment abundance and types, affecting the balance between seagrass inputs and alternative sources, as was observed in previous studies of the area. The findings show that pigment proxies are useful early indicators of shifts in seagrass ecosystem condition, while lignocellulose and other pyrolysis products are useful proxies of more profound ecosystem alterations that influence seagrass abundance. The record indicates that the climax seagrass ecosystem condition, which prevailed for several millennia, had been impacted over the last century. Management of seagrass and coastal ecosystems should aim to avoid crossing ecological thresholds and diminish local impacts aggravating those of global change.

AB  - Age-related cognitive decline presents serious lifestyle challenges, and anatomical changes to the hippocampus are often implicated in clinical conditions later in life. However, relatively little is known about how hippocampal physiology is altered in the transition to middle-age, when early detection may offer the best opportunity for successful treatment. High-yield extracellular recording is a powerful tool for understanding brain function in freely moving animals at single-cell resolution and with millisecond precision. We used this technique to characterize changes to hippocampal physiology associated with maturation in 35-week-old rats. Combining a series of behavioral tasks with recordings of large numbers of neurons, local field potentials (LFP), and network patterns of activation, we were able to generate a comprehensive picture based on more than 25 different assays for each subject. Notable changes associated with aging included increased firing rates in interneurons, reduced LFP power but increased frequency in the 412 Hz theta band, and impairment in hippocampal pattern-separation for different environments. General properties of pyramidal cell firing and spatial map integrity were preserved. There was no impairment in theta phase-precession, experience-dependent place field expansion, or sleep reactivation of waking network patterns. There were however changes in foraging strategy and behavioral responses to the introduction of a novel environment. Taken together the results reveal a diverse pattern of changes which are of increasing relevance in an aging population. They also highlight areas where high-yield electrophysiological assays can be used to provide the sensitivity and throughput required for pre-clinical drug-discovery programs.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity between coastal lagoons and marine water plays a major role in ecosystem health. Natural brackish habitats show an intrinsic spatial dispersion of benthic fauna when free water exchange is guaranteed. Habitat alteration caused by frequent and long-lasting floodgate closing is one of the major reasons for the decline in biological diversity and increased eutrophication of water. This type of disturbance, being a substantial stress (e.g. change in salinity, nutrient concentrations, and water cycle) for benthic macroinvertebrates, is presented on the example of the Jamno Lagoon (coastal lake), which is located in the middle part of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (54 degrees 17'N/16 degrees 08'E). Floodgate closing is not itself a stressor for macrofauna, but if it occurs, it can be recognized as a specific trigger for the changes inhabitat conditions. An assessment of changes in benthic fauna species richness, community composition, density and biomasson the background of modified habitat conditions was performed between two different stages: (1) free water exchange (FF) and (2) separation from the sea (NF). Disturbance in the sea water inflow induced profound changes in the macrozoobenthic structure, decreasing its biomass by 60% and its density by 50%. Only the Shannon alpha-diversity index (H') did not show significant changes between the stages. The most significant decreases were in the spatial distribution of Oligochaeta and Chironomus f.l. plumosus L (Diptera) descriptors. The results showed significant differences in the physiochemical parameters of water between the FF and NF phases. Soon after the inflow of seawater was blocked, a distinct decrease in Cl- and Na+ concentrations was accompanied by an increase in total dissolved solids (TDS), Chl-a and NH4+. Apart from influence of seawater (concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions), the qualitative and quantitative structure of macrobenthic invertebrates was also driven by Chl-a, pH, and salinity. The obtained results justify the role of benthic fauna as a good indicator of anthropogenic disturbance and a plausible component of a decision support system in the proper management of coastal aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the diversity and abundance of benthic invertebrates in high Andean lagoons of Peru and determine their possible use as biological indicators. A total of 16 lagoons were sampled, 4 in the Rimac river basin and 12 in the Mantaro basin during the dry season (June-October 2015). We determined 34 families Phylum Arthropoda obtained the highest relative richness and relative abundance of organisms (72.3% and 89.1%, respectively), followed by Phylum Annelida (12.8% and 4.3%, respectively), Mollusca (6.4% and 5.4%, respectively) and Platyhelminthes (8.5% and 1.2%, respectively). Of the 34 families, the Insecta Class predominated with 24 families distributed in 6 orders, within which the order Diptera was more representative with 7 families, followed by the Coleoptera Order with 5 families. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that at a spatial level there are significant differences between the studied lagoons (R = 0.4845 and p = 0.0001). The Percentage Similarity Analysis (SIMPER) found dissimilarities at spatial and temporal level, where the families Corixidae (Hemiptera), Chironomidae (Diptera) and Hyalellidae (Amphipoda) are the ones that influence the structure of the community The Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) reported a higher correlation of insects, bivalves, gastropods and oligochaetes with respect to high values of conductivity, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. (Past version 2.17, p = 0.0001). Of the total variance, the abundance of taxa was due to the first 2 axes, the species-environmental correlations were of 53.86% for the first and 29.91% for the second axis respectively, explaining an environmental species relationship of 83.78%. The non-parametric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis obtained a stress of 2D = 0.12, showing that the Canchis and Churuca lagoons tend to be separated from the rest. The families Chironomidae, Cyprididae, Corixidae and Hyalellidae were resistant to environmental conditions altered by organic matter and heavy metals. According to the ABI values of the 16 lagoons sampled, the lagoons Marca, Huaroncocha, Ticticocha, Yananyacu and Huacracocha presented the highest value, considered moderate ecological status, while the Huascocha, Canchis and Churuca lakes were considered to be in poor condition, and the remaining nine as bad.

AB  - Microorganisms, lower and higher plants, and animals (as single individuals, populations or as more or less complex communities) may in manifold ways, serve as indicators of natural and/or anthropogenic alterations of the environment, next to tests of most important physical and chemical factors of air, water and soil. Due to their far-reaching relationships animals are more depending than autotrophic plants on the conditions of habitat, including food and other living compounds of ecosystems. Therefore they are also responding to influences which cause alterations on other organisms. - Further, animals are generally very mobile; metazoans possess sense organs and nervous systems and all of them display behaviour. By this, they register not only alterations of air, water, soil, and food, but also of optic, acoustic, olfactoric, and - partly - of electromagnetic patterns of stimulations of their surroundings. They respond to manipulations of the structure and function of landscape, on the decrease of their living space, on noise molestations etc. For animals with special demands on space and structure of their habitat changes of vital conditions will cause a decrease of fertility and/or an increase of emigration, and result in both, a decline of population density, and after all a decline of species numbers. - Substantial pollutions, caused not only by industry and traffic, but also by agriculture and forestry, e.g. by excessive use of fertilizers or lime-depositing, and pesticides, will have the same effect. Toxic substances are often accumulated within food chains. This causes grave damages of health and even death, particulary in vertebrates. - Thus animals will respond to a lot of influences and alterations esp. made by mankind. This is of fundamental interest. However for indication of a single stress factor less specialized responses are of rather considerable disadvantage. Investigations in full details are necessary in order to reach certain conclusions. In a rising manner this has already been done with marine, fresh-water and terrestrial animal species of various systematic and trophic groups.
   In a short survey the suitability of bioindication by animals is represented. Thereby it was differentiated at first between sensitive (or reactive) and accumulative bioindicators and secondly between aquatic and terrestrial species (or communities) or rather between indicators of toxic elements and dangerous organic substances.

AB  - Grassland heterogeneity, defined by its components of spatial pattern, vertical structure, and species composition, is one of the most important indicators of prairie habitat. Maintaining grassland under conservation without disturbance may result in homogeneity at multiple spatial scales that could reduce wildlife diversity as a consequence. Therefore, monitoring grassland conditions that contribute to diversity can be critical for wildlife habitat and ecological integrity. Remote sensing, with multi-spatial, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal resolutions plus newly developed analytical techniques, provides a potential tool for measuring grassland heterogeneity under different management regimes quickly, efficiently, and at low cost. The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate the heterogeneity of grassland under grazing and conservation management practices spatially and vertically. and 2) to investigate the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to measure grassland heterogeneity. The study area was Grasslands National Park of Canada and its surrounding pastures. Field data were collected in the 1999 growing season by measuring the grassland vertical profile in a fixed spatial array. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image was acquired for the same year. A grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis was applied to the Landsat ETM+ imagery to compare the grasslands under grazing and those under the conservation practice. The results derived from field measurement show that the variation of vertical structures of grasslands differ significantly under grazing and conservation management regimes. Optical remote sensing data could detect the spatial variation of grasslands under these two management practices. Texture analysis is effective at 15 in resolution, which confirmed other studies that grassland heterogeneity is at about 15 meter.

AB  - Rivers have many service functions, and play an important role in people's living and agricultural production. During the last decades, intensive human activities have been threatening river ecosystem. For shipping, hydraulic engineering facilities (e.g. spur dikes) have been built along river bank to increase water depth. However, natural habitat conditions (i.e. substrate, flow regime, water physico-chemical properties) are accordingly altered. Therefore, it is necessary to select representative organisms as indicators to assess the aquatic ecological status of different habitat conditions, furthermore, management strategies are to be put forward. Macroinvertebrates are often considered as good indicators of long-term changes in environments due to their confinement to the bottom, long life cycles and limited abilities of movement. In this study, field investigations of macroinvertebrates in the West River were conducted in November 2009 (at low water level) and May 2010 (at high water level). Altogether 70 taxa of macroinvertebrates belonging to 30 families and 59 genera were identified. Among them were 16 annelids, 21 mollusks, 32 arthropods and 1 miscellaneous animal. The average density and biomass of total macroinvertebrates were 140 ind m(-2) and 0.23 g dry weight m(-2), respectively. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that major factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages were flow velocity (U), water depth (Z), conductivity (Cond), total nitrogen (TN) and substrates (clay, silt, cobbles and bedrock). Density and diversity of macroinvertebrates peaked in the cobbles, while biomass reached the maximum in the bedrock. It is indicated that stable and heterogeneous habitats were beneficial to development of benthic assemblages. To conserve these habitats, type and construction position of spur dikes should receive enough attentions. Thus, it is suggested that as few spur dikes as possible can be constructed in the riverbed covered with cobbles and bedrocks. Otherwise, the angle between spur dike and river bank need be analyzed to generate the appropriate flow regime which can prevent the stable substrates from being buried by sands. Some advice about length and separation distance of spur dikes is also presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatio-temporal patterns of temperature in mountain environments are complex due to both regional synoptic-scale and landscape-scale physiographic controls in these systems. Understanding the nature and magnitude of these physiographic effects has practical and theoretical implications for the development of temperature datasets used in ecosystem assessment and climate change impact studies in regions of complex terrain. This study attempts to quantify the absolute and relative influence of landscape-scale physiographic factors in mediating regional temperatures and assess how these influences vary in time. Our approach was to decompose the variance in in situ temperature measurements into components associated with regional free-air temperature estimates and local physiographic effects. Near-surface air temperature data, collected between 1995 and 2006 from 16 meteorological stations in the Lake Tahoe region of California, USA were regressed against free-air temperature (North American Regional Reanalysis dataset) for the same period. Residuals from this fit represent spatial deviations from the regional mean and were modeled as a function of physiographic position on the landscape using variables derived from terrain analysis techniques. Linear models relating temperature residuals to physiographic variables explained roughly 10-90% of the variance in temperature residuals and had root mean squared error of 1.2-2.0 degrees C, depending upon the type of measurement and time of year. Results demonstrate that: (I) regional temperature patterns were the principle driver of surface temperatures explaining roughly 70-80% of the variance in in situ measurements; (2) the remaining variance was largely explained by spatial variability in land-scapescale physiographic variables; (3) the influence of physiographic drivers varied seasonally and was influenced by regional conditions. Periods of well-mixed atmospheric conditions lend themselves to the use of simple elevation-based lapse rate models for temperature estimation whereas other physiographic effects become more prominent during periods of enhanced atmospheric stability; and lastly (4) small differences in temperature due to landscape position, when integrated over time, can have a prominent effect on water balance and thus hydrologic and ecologic processes.

AB  - The disruption of the natural post-disturbance recovery process, either by changes in disturbance regime or by another disturbance, can trigger transitions to alternative degraded states. In a scenario of high disturbance pressure on ecological systems, it is essential to detect recovery indicators to define the period when the system needs more protection as well as the period when the system supports certain use pressure without affecting its resilience. Recovery indicators can be identified by non-linear changes in structural and functional variables. Fire largely modulates the dynamic and stability of plant communities worldwide, and is this the case in northwestern (NW) Patagonia. The ultimate goal of this study is to propose a structural-functional approach based on a reference system (i.e. chronosequence) as a tool to detect post-disturbance recovery indicators in forests from NW Patagonia. In NW Patagonia (40-42 degrees S), we sampled 25 Austrocedrus chilensis and Nothofagus spp. communities differing in post-fire age (0.3-180 years). In each community we recorded structural (woody species cover and height, solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity) and functional (annual recruitment of woody and tree species) attributes. We modeled these attributes in function of post-fire age and analized the relationship between a functional attribute and a Structural Recovery Index (SRI). Communities varying in time-since-last-fire were structurally and functionally different. Moreover, response variables showed non-linear changes along the chronosequence, allowing the selection of recovery indicators. We suggest to use vegetation variables instead of environmental variables as structural recovery indicators. Horizontal and Vertical Vegetation Heterogeneity indices provided the information necessary to describe vegetation spatial reorganization after fire. Tree species annual recruitment was a good indicator of the functional recovery of forest communities. The relationship between a functional attribute and SRI allowed us to detect phases with high- and low-risk of degradation during post-fire succession. High-risk phases (<36 years old) had the highest horizontal vegetation heterogeneity and scarce tree seedling density (<7000 seedlings ha(-1) year(-1)). Whereas, low-risk phases (>36 years old) had the highest vertical vegetation heterogeneity and tree species seedling density (>10,000 seedlings ha(-1) year(-1)). Due to the low structural-functional levels, communities at high-risk phases would be more vulnerable to antropic pressure (e.g. livestock raising, logging) than communities at low-risk phases. The proposed approach contributes to the sustainable management of forest communities because it allows to estimate the minimum structural-functional levels from which forest communities could be harvested.

AB  - Natural marine biofilms provide signatures of the events that occur over a period of time and can be used as bioindicators of environmental changes. Hence, the effects of temperature (30 and 34 degrees C), pCO(2) (400 and 1500 mu atm) and nutrients (unenriched and enriched f/2 media) on the marine biofilm were evaluated using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. In unenriched condition, acidification significantly increased the abundance of phytoperiphytes whereas reduced that of bacteria and it was vice versa in the enriched condition. Warming had significant negative effect on the abundance of both phytoperiphytes and bacteria, except in unenriched condition wherein it favoured bacterial growth. Synergistically, acidification and warming had deleterious effects resulting in further reduction in the abundance of both phytoperiphytes and bacteria, except in enriched condition wherein bacterial abundance increased. Such changes in biofilm communities in response to warming and acidification can have cascading effect on the subsequent build-up of macrofouling community. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are common features of the Dougherty Plain physiographic region in southwestern Georgia. Due to lack of protection at the state and federal levels, these wetlands are threatened by intensive agricultural and silvicultural land uses common in the region. Recently, the ecological condition of such GIWs was assessed for the southeastern United States using the Landscape Development Intensity Index (LDI), a practical assessment tool that relies on remotely sensed land use and land cover (LULC) data surrounding isolated wetlands to rapidly predict wetland condition. However, no assessments have been attempted for GIWs in the Dougherty Plain specifically. Our goal was to develop a framework to guide and refine remote assessment of wetland condition within this agriculturally intense region of the southeastern USA. In this study, we characterized human disturbances associated with isolated wetlands in the Dougherty Plain, and paired the rapid assessment of GIWs using LDI with an intensive assessment of wetland plant communities. Specifically, we: (1) examined how macrophyte assemblages and vegetation metrics vary across a human disturbance gradient in the Dougherty Plain; (2) compared multiple condition assessment outcomes using variations of the LDI method that differed in spatial extent and resolution of LULC categories; and (3) determined the predicted condition of GIWs in the Dougherty Plain as indexed by LDI and compared with region-wide assessments of GIWs of the southeastern USA. Generally, the relationship between wetland plant communities and surrounding land use supported the assumptions of the LDI index in that wetlands surrounded by agricultural land use classes featured distinct plant communities relative to those surrounded by forested land use classes. Our results indicated that finer spatial resolution of LULC data improved the predictive ability of LDI. However, based on incongruence between wetland vegetation composition and LDI scores in some forested landscapes, this study identified limitations of the LDI assessment method, particularly when applied in regions in which prescribed fire is an important ecological driver of vegetation and habitat. Thus, we conclude that LDI may be biased toward an overestimation of reference condition GIWs, even though the habitat may be functionally degraded by the absence of natural processes such as fire. Regardless, relative to the assessment of the entire southeastern US, a greater proportion of total GIWs of the Dougherty Plain were identified as impaired due to the intensity of irrigated agricultural land use.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is increasingly influential for making land management decisions, for directing conservation policy, and for research. But, the basic ecological properties and limitations of its metrics are ill defined and not well understood-especially those related to sample methods and scale. Nested plot data from a remnant tallgrass prairie sampled annually over a 12-year period, were used to investigate FQA properties associated with species detection rates, species misidentification rates, sample year, and sample grain/area. Plot size had no apparent effect on Mean C (an area's average Floristic Quality level), nor did species detection levels above 65% detection. Simulated species misidentifications only affected Mean C values at greater than 10% in large plots, when the replaced species were randomly drawn from the broader county-wide species pool. Finally, FQA values were stable over the 12-year study, meaning that there was no evidence that the metrics exhibit year effects. The FQA metric Mean C is demonstrated to be robust to varied sample methodologies related to sample intensity (plot size, species detection rate), as well as sample year. These results will make FQA measures even more appealing for informing land-use decisions, policy, and research for two reasons: 1) The sampling effort needed to generate accurate and consistent site assessments with FQA measures is shown to be far lower than what has previously been assumed, and 2) the stable properties and consistent performance of metrics with respect to sample methods will allow for a remarkable level of comparability of FQA values from different sites and datasets compared to other commonly used ecological metrics.

AB  - To develop indicator-based management tools that can facilitate sustainable natural resource management by non-specialists, meaningful participation of stakeholders is essential. A participatory framework is proposed for the identification, evaluation and selection of rangeland condition indicators. This framework is applied to the assessment of rangeland degradation processes and sustainable natural resource management with pastoralists in the southern Kalahari, Botswana. Farmer knowledge focused on vegetation and livestock, with soil, wild animal and socio-economic indicators playing a lesser role. Most were indicators of current rangeland condition; however 'early warning' indicators were also identified by some key informants. This demonstrates that some local knowledge is process-based. Such knowledge could be used to improve indicator-based management tools and extension advice on the livelihood adaptations necessary to prevent or reduce ecological change, capable of threatening livelihood sustainability. There is evidence that social background influences indicator use. Communal farmers rely most heavily on vegetation and livestock indicators, whilst syndicate and landowning pastoralists cite wild animal and soil-based indicators most frequently. These factors must be considered if indicator-based management tools are to meet the requirements of a diverse community.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are an emerging contaminant, currently considered to be a significant potential risk to the coastal environment. To further test potential risk, and to determine effect concentrations and sensitive response parameters, toxic effects of environmentally relevant AgNP concentrations on the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa were evaluated. Alterations of the cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, ultrastructure, photosystem II function, oxidative stress markers, cell viability, and leaf, rhizome and root elongation in C. nodosa exposed to AgNP concentrations (0.0002-0.2 mg L-1) under laboratory conditions for 8 days were examined. An increase in H(2)O(2 )level, indicating oxidative stress, occurred after the 4th day even at 0.0002 mg L-1. Increased antioxidant enzyme activity, potentially contributing to H2O2 level decline at the end of the experiment, and reduced protein content were also observed. Actin filaments started to diminish on the 6th day at 0.02 mg L-1; microtubule, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplast and mitochondrion disturbance appeared after 8 days at 0.02 mg L-1, while toxic effects were generally more acute at 0.2 mg L-1. A dose-dependent leaf elongation inhibition was also observed; as for juvenile leaves, toxicity index increased from 2.8 to 40.7% with concentration. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) overproduction and actin filament disruption appeared to be the most sensitive response parameters, and thus could be utilized as early warning indicators of risk to seagrass meadows. A risk quotient of 1.33 was calculated, confirming previous findings, that AgNPs may pose a significant risk to the coastal environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A multimetric water quality standards (WQS) attainment indicator (MMI) was created to assess the habitat quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries. The indicator uses metrics of dissolved oxygen concentrations, water clarity assessments, underwater bay grass acreages, and season-specific chlorophyll a distributions. This suite of metrics is recognized as symptomatic of eutrophication and responsive to nutrient and sediment management actions. Habitat criteria for these metrics were established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to protect the survival, growth, and reproduction of tidal bay living resources. The criteria were adopted into state WQS used to define outcome targets of the regulatory 2010 Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). Direct accounting of monitoring results compared with state standards would be the most direct measure of water quality status related to achieving habitat health goal conditions under the TMDL. However, the Chesapeake Bay Program long-term water quality monitoring program that supports Clean Water Act 303d water quality impairment assessments does not provide sufficient measurement resolution across all temporal scales represented in these TMDL-related WQS. Recognizing data and analysis gaps, we developed the indicator to provide estimates of WQS attainment for the Chesapeake Bay. The structure of the indicator uses metrics that have been measured consistently with the historical Chesapeake Bay tidal water quality data collections since 1985. The ability to compute scores on contemporary and historical data will provide for bay-wide and spatially explicit long-term trend evaluations of habitat quality.

AB  - Measurement of total polar compounds (TPC) is recognised as one of the objective indicators to gauge oil resistance against high temperature. Dependency to TPC measurement alone in arbitrating the quality and safety of oils can be misleading especially for those oils that are rich with significant amount of natural diacylglycerols (DAG). In fact, the results generated could be at the higher side when the analysis protocol involves excessive drying. Method modification has been established to isolate and quantify the individual polar compound fractions without the involvement of drying stage to protect the integrity of samples and therefore produce credible results. Performance of the established method is validated with the DAG quantified from the acylglycerols analysis. A series of vegetable oils, ie. palm olein (POo), soybean oil (SBO), canola oil (CAN) and sunflower oil (SFO), were subjected to 9 days of intermittent frying, 8 h day(-1) and 144 frying cycles. The transient of TPC across frying time was coincided with polymerised triacylglycerols (PTAG) following the linear model with coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 91% while DAG and oxidised triacylglycerols (OxTAG) showed good regression with the quadratic model (R-2 > 0.97). Oils with equal amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were found to have similar rate of combined PTAG and OxTAG. Whilst liquid oils have similar OxTAG contents with POo, they were much distressed with polymeric reaction given that their PTAG levels were 1.6-2.4 folds higher than POo. Blending liquid oils with POo has been proven to moderate the level of PTAG when similar frying conditions were applied.

AB  - Each year, growing demand for silver nanoparticles (AgNP) contributes to the search for alternative methods of their production. Stable AgNP with antibacterial properties, low toxicity to the environment and living organisms are especially valued. In the study presented here, an attempt was made to assess the toxicity of two AgNP solutions produced using the HVAD method to the Chinchilla lanigera genome. The AgNO3 solution was the indicator and reference for the harmfulness of AgNP. The study was carried out in vitro on bone marrow cells isolated from Chinchilla lanigera bones. The genotoxicity was assessed by comet assay, following the treatment of cells with three silver solutions: unstable and sodium citrate-stabilized silver nanoparticles, as well as silver nitrate at three concentrations (5, 10 and 20 mu g/L), after 3, 6 and 24 h. Based on the percentage of the DNA content in the comet tail and the tail moment, an increase in cell DNA integrity disruption was demonstrated in all tested variants: of solution, exposure time and concentration, compared to the control sample. A statistically significant correlation was determined between the level of induced DNA breaks and the concentration of the active solutions and the duration of their activity. A solution of silver nanoparticles stabilized with sodium citrate was shown to have the most harmful effect on bone marrow cells. Silver nitrate demonstrated a level of toxicity similar to these particles. Further studies are necessary to directly compare the genotoxic properties of AgNP produced using the HVAD method and the chemical method under the same conditions.

AB  - The subgenus Rhoicosphenula Lange-Bert. has a unique character combination that differentiates it from Gomphosphenia subgen. Gomphosphenia Lange-Bert. In particular, Rhoicosphenula has striae/areola features that are similar to Gomphosphenia, but is differentiated from that genus by also having pseudosepta present on both poles of the valves, copulae with septa at one of the poles, and frustules almost rectangular in girdle view. Together, this character combination strongly supports it as an independent genus following modern diatom-taxonomy criteria. Moreover, the only species of Rhoicosphenula known so far was collected from a peculiar acidic and dystrophic habitat, whilst most Gomphosphenia s.s. species colonize medium-conductivity, alkaline inland waters. On the basis of LM and SEM studies, we also propose a species of Gomphosphenia (G. patrickiana Cantonati, Lange-Bert., Kociolek & A.A.Saber, sp. nov.) as new to science. The new species is mainly defined by its valve outline and dimensions, length to breadth ratio, striation density, and geographical distribution. It was found in several samples of two streams in Puerto Rico, sometimes with high relative abundance. Gomphosphenia patrickiana Cantonati, LangeBert., Kociolek & A.A.Saber, sp. nov. was much more abundant in the stream with lower nutrient (in particular P) concentrations, and higher ecological integrity. The new species seems to prefer moderately alkaline freshwater habitats with medium-high conductivity and oligo- to mesotrophic conditions, with moderate tolerance to N enrichment. Also noteworthy is the occurrence of the new species in streams with above-average magnesium concentrations (due to the local geology). This Neotropical, warm-water species might be a potential indicator of global warming effects.

AB  - Measuring soil loss is costly, must cover a range of field situations, is not standardized, and is season dependent. In addition, use of sparse soil loss data (from other studies) compromises the integrity of many erosion models. Easily assessable soil erosion indicators to monitor the cumulative effect of erosion between tillage/weeding and harvesting called eroding clods, flow surfaces, pre-rills, and rills were surveyed directly after the 1995 rainy season in the Taita Taveta district of Kenya, to assessed the utility of each indicator. Their incidences were modeled using CPA. In the area, 70 maize plots in 11 map units, having considerable variation in altitude, land cover, rainfall, and geomorphology, were surveyed. Soil loss was considered variable between plots due to differences in surface soil, land cover, infrastructure (trash lines, grass strips, and Fanya-juu), crop management, slope, and map unit. The eroding clods indicator proved of little significance because the initial clods cover was unknown; the indicator probably relates better to soil erodibility then to soil loss. Flow surfaces, formed during erosive showers, were less present on fields with a higher ground and canopy cover, if the area of eroding clods was high, and if the topsoil had no loam which reduces chances of sealing; no impact of infrastructure, tillage, and weeding were detected. Fewer pre-rills were present where the fraction of groundcover was high, where Pigeon Peas were not grown (they cause micro-relief and concentrated flows), where weeding ended late (time effect), where more flow surfaces occurred, where Fanya-juu was constructed (less steep slopes), where the top-soil contained little sand (less sediment entrainment), and where maize was intercropped with vegetables (positive canopy cover effects). The model was not map unit specific and had an Adjusted R-2 of 67%. The log-linear relationship indicates that combined positive conditions exponentially reduce the occurrence of pre-rills. The "pre-rill" indicator related best to management-affected site conditions and seems to reflect best the cumulative effects of soil loss over time. Rills were found at 18 sites located in drier areas on sandy-clay soils. The model suggested more rills if the topsoil contains no silt; this makes the soil susceptible to compaction, peptisation when wet, and rill formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The flood may cause serious loss of life and property. The evaluation of flood events is necessary for the planning and design of engineering projects. In a dam, flood problems should be considered for both upstream and downstream conditions. The characteristics of flood problems can be derived from observation of dam sites. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of flood hazards from spillway based on downstream conditions after dam construction. Also, the paper discusses downstream flood problems depending on stream characteristics in an example dam site. In results, three reasons are determined for downstream floods problems: control problems of spillway gates, the naturally developing vegetation through channel flow line and incompetence of stream cross-section for carrying of flood flows. Therefore, downstream conditions should be investigated before dam construction. This investigation can be considered in the planning phase. In addition, the cross-section and longitudinal profile of stream should be controlled via maintenance of stream after dam construction. In stream cross-section problems (such as vegetation, incompetence and irregularities), some modifications (e.g. straighten, deepen, and widen) can be applied with engineering works.

AB  - Recently, oat (Avena sativa L.) plants are cultivated as worldwide functional food. The aim of this study was to analyse the response of photosynthetic apparatus of naked and hulled oat cultivars grown under different nitrogen fertilization dosage as well as different weather and soil conditions (different locations). Our analysis showed a significant influence of all studied experimental factors i.e. location, year, nitrogen dosage, cultivar/strain, leaf position on some selected chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) parameters and grain yield. Soil and climatic conditions/environments had the largest and statistically significant contribution to the variability of the analysed ChlF parameters, while the genotype (cultivar/strain) effect was the highest for grain yield. For other effects, the values were much smaller. Our results suggest that chlorophyll fluorescence measurements should be used in oat field experiments as a trustable and useful tool to study the reactions of plants photosynthetic apparatus under natural environments and to predict its yielding. Moreover, it can help to establish the optimal growth conditions for individual cultivars, including fertilizers' dosing.

AB  - Biomarkers are valuable tools in clinical practice. In 2001, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) standardized the definition of a biomarker as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. A biomarker has clinical relevance when it presents precision, standardization and reproducibility, suitability to the patient, straightforward interpretation by clinicians, and high sensitivity and/or specificity by the parameter it proposes to identify. Thus, serum biomarkers should have advantages related to the simplicity of the procedures and to the fact that venous blood collection is commonplace in clinical practice. We described the potentiality of cfDNA as a general clinical biomarker and focused on endothelial dysfunction. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) refers to extracellular DNA present in body fluid that may be derived from both normal and diseased cells. An increasing number of studies demonstrate the potential use of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker to determine physiologic and pathologic conditions. However, although still scarce, increasing evidence has been reported regarding using cfDNA in cardiovascular diseases. Here, we have reviewed the history of cfDNA, its source, molecular features, and release mechanism. We also show recent studies that have investigated cfDNA as a possible marker of endothelial damage in clinical settings. In the cardiovascular system, the studies are quite new, and although interesting, stronger evidence is still needed. However, some drawbacks in cfDNA methodologies should be overcome before its recommendation as a biomarker in the clinical setting.

AB  - Resilience and redundancy are important for long-term conservation since both can indicate the condition and integrity of ecosystems. The goal of this research was to define, develop and demonstrate methods to measure resilience and redundancy in a spatially explicit manner in the San Pedro Watershed, Arizona. Species were categorized to one of several functional groups based on body mass and diet. We calculated metrics of resilience and redundancy for each functional group. Functional groups with smaller-bodied animals had more species than groups with larger-bodied animals suggesting increased resiliency and redundancy for those small-bodied groups. Small-bodied groups were the only body mass groups to include species representing all diet categories (i.e., carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, insectivores, granivores, nectarivores, and piscivores). The insectivore functional group was highly redundant; 154 of 283 (54%) bird species and 23 of 85 (27%) mammal species were insectivores. Carnivorous bird species (37 of 283; 13%) and omnivorous mammal species (23 of 85; 27%) also showed high redundancy relative to other dietary functional groups. Spatial analysis identified the northern portion of the watershed with low mean redundancy for most functional groups across both birds and mammals. Results highlight the importance of large carnivores and small mammals within ecosystems. Results also highlight current ecosystem services provided by insectivorous and nectarivorous species in the American Southwest. This process can be used to measure resilience and redundancy in a spatially explicit manner providing managers information for conservation in the face of climate change when using limited dollars to plan for future changes.

AB  - Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a crucial step in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Altered expression of such proteins in response to stress conditions is a key factor for the maintenance of cellular integrity and survival. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) are critical indicators of environmental exposure to hypoxia. The current study was aimed to analyse the expression pattern of HO-1, p-ERK, HIF-1 alpha and CYP1A2 in hepatocytes of Mugil cephalus inhabiting Kovalam (unpolluted site) and Ennore (polluted site) estuaries. The impact of stress on hepatocytes was assessed by measuring the level of lipid hydroperoxides (LHP) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in hepatocytes of M. cephalus inhabiting these estuaries. The expression of HO-1, p-ERK, HIF1 alpha and CYP1A2 was analysed by ELISA and immunoblot analysis, respectively. There was significant decrease of GSH (19 %) and CYP1A2 (34 %) along with significant increase of LHP (31 %), HO-1 (96 %), p-ERK (p< 0.01) and HIF-1 alpha (41 %) in hepatocytes of M. cephalus inhabiting Ennore estuary than Kovalam estuary. The present study shows that increased synthesis of HO-1 mainly regulated by p-ERK and HIF-1 alpha may significantly contribute to the environmental adaptation processes of grey mullet, by protecting the cells from oxidative stress and stress-induced degenerative changes.

AB  - Fire is an important natural disturbance in the Okefenokee Swamp. From April-June 2007, wildfire burned 75% of the wetland area. With the existence of extensive pre-fire data sets on community structure and total mercury of invertebrates, the fire presented an opportunity to assess impacts of wildfire on invertebrates. Post-fire collection of samples occurred in September, December, and May, 2007-2009. Sample sites included 13 burned and 8 non-burned (reference) sites. Comparisons of data among pre-fire, post-fire reference, and post-fire burned sites revealed that the major difference between pre-fire communities and post-fire communities was a decrease in the number of water mites. We also found a decrease in mercury concentrations in amphipods, odonates, and crayfish post-fire. The differences between pre-fire and post-fire samples may be confounded by drought conditions during the baseline study. NMDS ordinations and ANOSIM tests suggested that habitat was an important factor; communities in burned cypress differed from reference cypress. Unexpectedly, burned sites had lower mercury concentrations in odonates and crayfish, with variation again being greatest in cypress stands. These findings and others suggest mercury levels do not follow a predictable pattern but can vary with pre-fire concentrations, variation in water levels, and burn intensity. We found that wildfire in the Okefenokee had little impact on invertebrates in prairies and scrub-shrub thickets, but can affect indicator organisms (Oecetis, Ischnura, and Sigara) in cypress stands. Our study suggests that vegetation type and burn intensity may have impacts on the invertebrate communities and mercury concentrations of organisms.

AB  - Occupational accidents have a major impact upon human integrity, but they also bring about high costs for a country's social security system. This situation has incidence on the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises, which in Portugal are mostly micro- and smallsized ones. The main goal of this study was to examine the accidents (that were officially recorded) in the decade 1992-2001 in work environments, and working conditions pertaining to the workforce-in attempts to build a picture of the working life situation in that country. Because of incompatibility among data, index numbers by time and by indicator were calculated. The number of occupational accidents decreased from 1992 to 1995, but tended thereafter to stabilize at a still high level; the rate and causes of occupational accidents in Portugal should thus be thoroughly and comprehensively studied, in order to design and implement effective prevention programs. Construction and manufacturing were the most important economic activities in terms of occupational accidents. After 1996, fatal accidents occurred at the highest rates in Lisbon and Tejo Valley's region, whereas the highest rates of non-fatal ones took place in the north region of Portugal. As expected, the highest numbers of fatal accidents were observed in the 25-44 year group throughout the decade, because this is the age range in which the highest percentage of employment exists. Increasing labor flexibility and overtime working during this decade led to a significant increase of fatal accidents on Saturday and Monday, with a higher incidence in the 12-16 h working schedule. Traumatism with contusion was the major type of injury recorded, and multiple sites was the most frequent description of bodily part injured. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method is based on the conservative assumption that a few anchor bolts within the skirt's inner-wall may fail in a random nature. Under the assumption, the maximum axial forces in the intact bolts are estimated. To reflect the uncertainty, random numbers are generated to simulate the possible failed bolts among a total of 60 bolts, which are circumferentially arranged along the inner side of the wall. Then the outcome of failed bolts together with their locations for every 60 bolts is defined as an experiment of a sample. The locations of failed bolt can significantly affect the stress analysis and its random outcomes require an efficient calculation scheme. In this paper we propose a rapid calculation algorithm, thus the direction of bending moment that causes the worst scenario in the stress analysis of bolts for each experiment can be rapidly found. Taking into consideration of design loads, the finite element method is further employed to calculate the maximum axial bolt force of each experiment. After statistical analysis of maximum axial forces from all experiments, the average maximum axial-force interval that the remaining bolts can withstand under a given random condition is estimated with a 95% confidence level. This interval can be used in conjunction with various results of structural integrity assessment to ensure the structural safety and reliability of a nuclear power plant component.

AB  - Despite recent interest in assessing the condition of fish assemblages in Great Lakes coastal wetlands and a concern for increasing turbidity as a major stressor pathway influencing these ecosystems, there is little information on fish tolerance or intolerance to turbidity on which to base wetland assessment metrics. Existing studies have borrowed tolerance designations from the stream literature, but they have not confirmed that the designations apply to Great Lakes wetlands or that designations based on tolerance to degradation in general apply to turbidity in particular. We used a published graphical method to determine turbidity tolerances of Great Lakes fishes based on their pattern of occurrence and relative abundance across coastal wetlands spanning a turbidity gradient. Fish composition data were obtained from fyke-net and electrofishing surveys of 75 wetlands along the U.S. shoreline of the Laurentian Great Lakes, representing a turbidity range of approximately 0-110 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). Turbidity levels of 10, 25, and 50 NTU (corresponding to the thresholds in use for state water quality criteria) were used to separate fish into tolerance classes. We found that the turbidity tolerances of many species in Great Lakes wetlands differed from the published tolerances to general degradation in streams. Also, the tolerance levels for many species were unclear owing to the species' infrequent occurrence. Although many of the wetlands sampled had quite low urbidity, a large proportion of the fish species were tolerant or moderately tolerant to turbidity and very few were intolerant, suggesting that enumerating intolerant species may not be a useful metric or that the metric should be expanded to include moderately intolerant species. Our study lays the foundation for additional turbidity indicator development efforts for Great Lakes coastal wetlands.

AB  - The study presents a survey of the species composition of ground beetles occurring in the five major subtypes of grassland ecosystems, distributed on the territory of Bulgaria (dry, mesic, wet, alpine-subalpine and inland salt grasslands). A total of 329 species of 71 genera were identified. The qualitative analysis of the carabids' species composition confirmed the potentially crucial significance of humidity for the distribution of carabids. This parameter occurred as the first axis on the ordination graph. The other important factor appears to be the soil conditions, which was the second axis. The analysis of the life forms of the ground beetles occurring in grasslands showed a predominance of the zoophages (181 species; 55%) over the mixophytophages (148 species; 45%). After summarizing all available information, a model of the distribution of the species in the ecosystem subtypes, altitudes and regions was prepared. On the basis of the arithmetical average number of the common species from all altitude belts was developed a 5-scale system for assessment of the species richness of ground beetles and the conditions in the five subtypes of grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are invasive to North America, and their range has expanded within the Mississippi River Basin, seemingly unchecked, since their introduction in the late 1970s, with the exception of the upper reaches of the Illinois River. With the imminent threat of their movement into the Great Lakes, the goal of the present study was to assess whether differences in the physiological status between silver carp at the leading edge of their invasion front and core population sites could explain their lack of expansion upstream toward Lake Michigan over the past decade. A transcriptomic approach using RNA sequencing and analysis of plasma variables were used to quantify differences among fish at the leading edge and two downstream core population sites. Leading-edge fish exhibited upregulation of genes associated with xenobiotic defense (e.g., ATP-binding cassette C1 [abcc1], abcc2, abcc6), decreased cell integrity (i.e., macroautophagy and apoptosis; autophagy-related protein 9A [atg9a], caspase 3b [casp3b]), and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., abca1, apolipoprotein A1 [apoa1], sterol O-acyltransferase [soat1]) and downregulation of genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 [tp53bp1]) compared to core population sites. Transcriptomic profiles of leading-edge fish were consistent with fish inhabiting a polluted environment and suggest that poorer water quality conditions upstream of the leading edge may represent a non-permanent barrier to silver carp range expansion. The present study provides potential molecular targets for monitoring the physiological status of silver carp over time and in response to future improvements in water quality upstream of their leading edge.

AB  - The continued airworthiness of ageing aircraft and long-term durability of new airframes depends, in part, on the integrity of adhesive bonds used for repairs and joining structural components. Additionally, the advent of composite materials and advanced repair techniques incorporating composites has increased the number of adhesively bonded joints specified for use in aerospace structures. Traditionally, adhesive bonds have been analysed and designed using a dependable and rigorous stress-based approach. However, the need to address the effect of bondline flaws and to understand the fatigue characteristics of bonded joints has led to the adoption of a discipline already common in the design of metallic components-fracture mechanics. To understand the durability of bonded structures, however, it is further necessary to examine the effect of environmental exposure on the performance of the adhesive bondline. Familiarity with the stress-based and fracture mechanics analytical approaches, as well as an understanding of environmentally induced trends in bond performance is paramount to quality design. This paper will briefly discuss the attributes of the two main forms of bonded joint analysis, and will broadly outline a design approach that uses fracture mechanics and accounts for environmental effects. Experiments discussed in this paper were performed specifically to use fracture mechanics in assessing the environmental effects on a toughened epoxy adhesive. Results indicate that the Mode I fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth threshold of this adhesive are significantly reduced upon exposure to a high temperature, high humidity aircraft service environment. These results will be used to illustrate the philosophical arguments supporting the design approach.

AB  - Persistence of an herbicide is defined as the ability to maintain the integrity of its molecule and chemical, physical, and phytotoxic properties in the environment where it was applied. Knowledge of persistence has implications both for the toxicity generated on species grown in succession and for the period in which the herbicide controls weeds. This study aimed to assess the persistence of the herbicide saflufenacil in an Oxisol by means of bioassays. Two experiments with the application of 29.4 g ha(-1) of saflufenacil were carried out under field conditions: the first in the 2011/2012 season and the second in the 2012/2013 season. Soil samples were collected at depths of up to 10 cm at different times after application. Subsequently, two bioassays were carried out in a greenhouse by using beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) as bioindicators. The studies were carried out in a completely randomized design with four replications. Treatments consisted of periods after saflufenacil application (0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, and 100 days). The crop was also considered as a factor. Stand, height, and phytotoxicity of plants were assessed in both agricultural seasons at 14, 21, and 28 days after sowing (DAS), as well as shoot fresh (SFM) and dry matter (SDM) at 28 DAS. In general, saflufenacil persistence was between 25 and 35 days. Beet was more sensitive to the presence of saflufenacil in the soil when compared to cucumber. Herbicide effects were higher in the 2012/2013 season when compared to the 2011/2012 season.

AB  - Today, there is a clear understanding of the concept of "financial accessibility" as a necessary condition for sustainable poverty reduction, innovation and economic growth. However, the relationship between financial availability and traditional for the financial sector to ensure the stability, integrity and protection of consumers of financial services has not been sufficiently studied and not considered in a single context. This situation began to be corrected and acquired a special urgency in the post-crisis period, when the study of this problem could help to understand the causes of the onset of financial structural changes. The purpose of the paper is a research of the nature of implicit connections between the level of protection of consumers interests of the financial services market as drivers of innovation development in the country, and three conditional sectors: general economic status, public administration and financial stability. The basis of the study was the statistical information of the IMF, CGAP and the World Bank on the Financial Access 2010 database, the Global Findex database and the G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators of the World Bank, the database of OECD/INFE on Adult Financial Literacy at the time of 2010 for 95 countries with different levels of economic development. The system of simultaneous structural equations was used as a method for calculations. 31 indicators were selected for formalizing the implicit structural links between the four contingent sectors: the general economic condition of the countries, public administration, financial stability of the countries and the level of protection of the interests of consumers of the financial services market, among which 12 major components were selected by the method of main analysis, included for further analysis. The formalization of the relationships between the latent variables introduced in the study allowed the following conclusion: with an increase in the level of protection of the interests of consumers of the financial services market, the level of public administration and the general economic state is growing. Thus, it was confirmed the thesis that the level of consumer protection in case of consumer financial services market fulfills the role of a locomotive for innovative development of the country as a whole.

AB  - The analysis of phytolith assemblages is an important method in studies that uses the soil as an environmental record in order to reconstruct the paleoclimatic conditions. Despite being underused in soil science, this technique is used complementary to the analysis of pollen and other microfossils, as well as to evaluate silicon reserves in the soil. Currently, there are several concentration methods for phytolith extraction from sediments, soils, and paleosols. Most were developed and applied to materials of temperate zones or hydromorphic environments. Few have been conducted in tropical soils where oxides and hydroxides of iron and aluminum, as well as organic matter that often blankets the soil matrix, are common and hamper the extraction, the observation and identification of phytoliths, compromising the morphological analysis and quantification of phytolith assemblage in soils. In this paper, three methods of pre-treatment for the removal of the coating of silt and sand particles were applied to samples of an Oxisol (Humic Hapludox) in order to compare the cleaning efficiency, integrity and number of phytoliths. The first method consisted of the oxidation of soil organic matter and of an acid hydrolysis for the removal of carbonates and oxides. In the second method, the dominant process was the reduction of iron using a combination DithioniteCitrate-Sodium Bicarbonate. In the third method, only acetate and sodium dithionite dissolved in water was used. Overall, Method 1 was the most aggressive to phytoliths and proved less efficient and more selective in phytolith extraction. Methods 2 and 3 were similar in the pre-treatment of samples. Method 2 allows the conservation of greater variety and number of phytoliths, and smaller quantities of other particles. Method 3 is relatively inexpensive and faster because it uses fewer chemicals and centrifugation procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Fecal contamination is a significant source of water quality impairment globally. Aquatic ecosystems can provide an important ecosystem service of fecal contamination removal. Understanding the processes that regulate the removal of fecal contamination among river networks across flow conditions is critical. We applied a river network model, the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES-Ecoli), to quantify removal of fecal indicator bacteria by river networks across flow conditions during summers in a series of New England watersheds of different characteristics. FrAMES-Ecoli simulates sources, transport, and riverine removal of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Aquatic E. coli removal was simulated in both the water column and the hyporheic zone, and is a function of hydraulic conditions, flow exchange rates with the hyporheic zone, and die-off in each compartment. We found that, at the river network scale during summers, removal by river networks can be high (19-99%) with variability controlled by hydrologic conditions, watershed size, and distribution of sources in the watershed. Hydrology controls much of the variability, with 68-99% of network scale inputs removed under base flow conditions and 19-85% removed during storm events. Removal by the water column alone could not explain the observed pattern in E. coli, suggesting that processes such as hyporheic removal must be considered. These results suggest that river network removal of fecal indicator bacteria should be taken into consideration in managing fecal contamination at critical downstream receiving waters.

AB  - Temperatures and light intensities that deviate from optimum often affect maize (Zea rnays L.) production in temperate regions. Objectives of the current study were (i) to investigate the effects of extreme temperatures and low light conditions on photosynthesis in maize hybrids, (ii) to test whether maize hybrids show distinctive reactions when subjected to different stresses, and (iii) to investigate informativeness of different fluorescence parameters in different stress conditions. Plants of five maize hybrids were subjected to: cold (Co), low light (LL), heat (H), and severe heat (SH) treatments and field (F) conditions along with control (C), and chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) was measured. ChlF transients were shown to respond to different treatments by changing the appearance of OJIP band, mostly at steps J and I, while the appearance of the K step was confirmed as a good indicator of temperature stress. PC analysis revealed grouping of parameters with PCs according to their informativeness. Parameter psi Eo, was shown to be in most defined by the F treatment, probably due to higher light intensity compared to C. Variables regarding electron transport and dissipation showed specific reactions to H and SH treatments. Co and LL conditions caused specific changes in in parameters V-J and V-I. Further research on usability of ChIF in maize breeding is needed, as it represents the data-rich, easy to measure method, providing the biological framework for explanation of reactions to different stresses.

AB  - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a two-year regional pilot survey in 2007 to develop, test, and validate tools and approaches to assess the condition of northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coastal wetlands. Sampling sites were selected from estuarine and palustrine wetland areas with herbaceous, forested, and shrub/scrub habitats delineated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Status and Trends (NWI S&T) program and contained within northern GOM coastal watersheds. A multi-level, stepwise, iterative survey approach is being applied to multiple wetland classes at 100 probabilistically-selected coastal wetlands sites. Tier 1 provides information at the landscape scale about habitat inventory, land use, and environmental stressors associated with the watershed in which each wetland site is located. Tier 2, a rapid assessment conducted through a combination of office and field work, is based on best professional judgment and on-site evidence. Tier 3, an intensive site assessment, involves on-site collection of vegetation, water, and sediment samples to establish an integrated understanding of current wetland condition and validate methods and findings from Tiers 1 and 2. The results from this survey, along with other similar regional pilots from the Mid-Atlantic, West Coast, and Great Lakes Regions will contribute to a design and implementation approach for the National Wetlands Condition Assessment to be conducted by EPA's Office of Water in 2011.

AB  - This paper analyzes the reliability of the fracture mechanics approach to environmentally assisted cracking in engineering design. A wide collection of experimental evidences of uncertainty in the fracture mechanics characteristics of the phenomenon - the crack growth kinetics v(K)-curve and the threshold stress intensity factor K-th - is presented. Although these basic fracture mechanics items are supposed to depend solely on the material and the environment, they are notably sensitive to the influence of a wide family of test/service variables, producing loss of confidence in materials evaluation and structural integrity assessment.

AB  - The effects of nutrient levels and salinity on prezygotic components of gender (number of ovules and of anthers per flower), on secondary accessory structures (number and size of petals), and on possible indicators of normal development (number of abnormal anthers and staminodes) were investigated for six maternal families of the highly autogamous Spergularia marina, cultivated under controlled conditions in hydroponic tubs. Mean ovule number and mean staminode number per flower were not affected by changes in nutrient levels and salinity, while mean anther number per flower decreased and mean petal size increased under the harsher growing conditions (low-nutrient level or salinity). Mean petal and abnormal anther numbers per flower were affected by nutrient levels but not by the salinity treatment. We observed few significant phenotypic correlations among the seven studied traits but observed strong phenotypic correlations between petal number and abnormal anther number under all growing conditions. The overall lack of treatment-specific correlations indicates that evolutionary trajectories in this species may not be strongly affected by the environmental conditions under which natural selection occurs. In contrast to other studies, we report that, for traits expressed prior to pollination, male reproductive traits (number of normal and abnormal anthers per flower) were more sensitive to growing conditions than were traits related to female reproduction (ovule number per flower). Finally, in partial opposition to our initial prediction, we found that the anther/ovule ratio was highly sensitive to salinity but not to nutrient level.

AB  - Rangeland condition has often been assessed in relation to either botanical, edaphic, environmental or management factors. In this investigation, we analysed the interaction of soil and topographic variables, management and range condition against the background of a sociological survey of livestock owners in western Iran to better understand the main influencing factors of rangeland quality in the area. In four grazing areas in Kermanshah differing in grazing pressure, environmental variables and livestock owners' perceptions on range condition, investigations of botanical composition, soil and topographic variables were carried out on 43 main plots. To evaluate range condition, four factors were considered, namely litter frequency, herbage palatability, amount of biomass, and percentage of bare soil. A questionnaire was used to obtain information about management practices, the perception of livestock owners on range condition and suggested solutions to problems in the different grazing areas. The range condition scores showed that the condition of the sites was either fair or poor. Of the soil and topographic factors, only north-facing aspect explained part of the variation in range condition scores. High grazing intensity was associated with poor range condition. To improve the rangeland condition, measures influencing water availability and a reduction of grazing pressure seem to be more relevant in the study area than fertilisation or seeding.

AB  - Aim. The aim of the research was to study the features of formation of adaptive ability, meat productivity and quality indicators of mutton obtained in the arid conditions of the Volga region from sheep of the Edilbaev breed of different genotypes.
   Material and Methods. A package of teaching materials has been developed concerning an increase in the productive qualities of different genotypes of the studied breed in the conditions of arid regions of southern Russia.
   Results. The authors' research has demonstrated the high adaptive abilities of animals of the Edilbaev breed, their economic and biological qualities, food and taste indicators of their meat, as well as the possibility of further development of the breed in the arid conditions of southern Russia. As a research base, we selected the Volgograd-Edilbay LLC breeding farm (the world's only breeding and genetic center for raising Edilbaev sheep) which is located in the Volgograd region and specializes in breeding pure-bred animals in arid steppe, semi-desert and desert zones. Due to the great demand for the livestock of this breed from farms located in arid territories, this study of the comparative aspects of production characteristics of animals of original and new types in the arid conditions of the Volga region is of interest to both science and practical animal husbandry.
   Conclusion. An assessment of the nutritional value of mutton obtained from animals of the Edilbaev breed has shown its high nutritional and biological qualities.

AB  - Aim To understand how vegetation mediates the interplay between fire and climate. Specifically, we predict that neither the switching of climatic conditions to high flammability nor the sensitivity of fire to such conditions are universal, but rather depend on fuel (vegetation) structure, which in turn changes with productivity. Location An aridity/productivity gradient on the Iberian Peninsula (Mediterranean Basin). Methods We defined 13 regions distributed along an aridity gradient, which thus differ in productivity and fuel structure. We then assessed the changes in the temporal fireclimate relationship across regions. Specifically, for each region we estimated three variables: the aridity level for switching to flammable conditions (i.e. climatic conditions conducive to fire), the frequency of these flammable conditions and the area burnt under such conditions. These variables were then related to regional aridity and fuel structure indicators. Results In mediterranean ecosystems, the aridity level for switching to flammable conditions increased along the aridity gradient. Differences in fire activity between regions were not explained by the frequency of flammable conditions but by the sensitivity of fire to such conditions, which was higher in wetter and more productive regions. Main conclusions Under mediterranean climatic conditions, fuel structure is more relevant in driving fire activity than the frequency of climatic conditions conducive to fire. At a global scale, fuel also drives the fireclimate relationship because it determines the climatic (aridity) threshold for switching to flammable conditions. Our results emphasize the role of landscape structure in shaping current and future fireclimate relationships at a regional scale, and suggest that future changes in the fire regime (i.e. under global warming) might be different from what it is predicted by climate alone.

AB  - 1. Under the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), several rivers in the UK have been designated Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) because they support important populations of fish species. Several factors need to be considered when establishing survey protocols to assess the conservation status Of fish species in these rivers
   2. It is important to understand the biology and habitat requirements of fish species and to design appropriate monitoring surveys adequately assess the status of the fish populations. This information can, in turn, provide the basis for establishing sustainable conservation targets for specific stocks, a process known as condition assessment.
   3. Favourable condition of fish species in SAC rivers is assessed using three criteria. The first relates to density Of fish in various life stages against pre-set targets. assuming that an appropriate number of sites is surveyed to account for natural spatial and temporal variations in fish populations. The second is CV evaluation of the demographic structure to demonstrate continued recruitment success. Third, by mapping the distribution or the target species ill individual rivers and where favourable condition is only achieved where there has been no reduction in the distribution range river between surveys.
   4. The framework described was developed from limited survey data. As more monitoring, and assessment data become available, the threshold criteria for favourable condition for each Species should be improved. and uncertainty in the procedures reduced. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

The results suggest that older age at delivery and lower cultural level of the mothers, indicators of critical biological and socioeconomic conditions, even at present increase stillbirth risk. Moreover, in the less favourable environment of the southern regions, selection is still sex-specific.

AB  - We have analysed the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale gas field (gas pool) in the Southeastern Sichuan Basin in the light of previous studies on the main constraints of shale gas field enrichment in North America. We have demonstrated that, unlike the relatively simple tectonic evolutionary history of its North American counterparts, South China, represented by the Sichuan Basin and its peripheral areas, has undergone multiple uplifting events and intense folding and thrusting processes. After the distribution of high-quality shale formations has been identified, the structural and preservation conditions are important determinants of the level of shale gas enrichment and productivity. For a complex structural area that has experienced high thermal evolution to become enriched in shale gas and highly productive, the following prerequisites are indispensable: (1) normal structures, i.e. uplifts and anticlines, the latter being the most favourable structural type for shale gas enrichment; (2) hyperpressure, which is not only an important identifier of the presence of a regionally closed environment, but also, an important signature of natural gas pool enrichment; (3) late regional strike-slipping processes and good roof and floor conditions-the existence of structural conditions for forming and maintaining a compressional-shearing environment and a roof and floor that provide good closure are critical indicators of shale gas enrichment in complex structural areas; (4) distance to any regional aqueous layers and avoidance of faults channelling these aqueous layers.

AB  - Specific leaf area (SLA) is an essential functional trait and indicator for estimating plant strategies in response to environmental changes. Intraspecific and interspecific variations of SLA have been extensively studied, whereas the combined effects of soil water content and heat conditions on SLA dynamics have received little attention. Field experiments with different irrigation regimes for maize (Zea mays L.) were designed and conducted across two growing seasons during 2013-2014 in north China, which usually have onset of severe drought conditions. Our results showed that maize plant SLA decreased with effective accumulated temperature under both rain-fed and drought conditions. Different intensities of water stress beginning at the three-leaf stage (2014) and the seven-leaf stage (2013) resulted in significant decreases of leaf area and leaf dry mass, however, with no significant differences in SLA. It is the occurrence time rather than the intensity of water stress that significantly affected the scaling of SLA. Moreover, the total effect of soil moisture on SLA was much higher in 2014 than that in 2013, but it was the opposite for heat conditions. The results imply that there is a trade-off mechanism between soil water and heat conditions in shaping the dynamic characteristics of SLA. The results may give insights into the accurate simulation of SLA dynamic characteristic and guidance for the production and management of maize.

AB  - Land-based sewage pollution is a major threat to the health of near-shore coral reefs. Macroalgal delta N-15-values are useful indicators for tracking nitrogen sources and sewage input; however, the direct link between delta N-15-values of macroalgae and the coral condition, including live coral cover, species richness, and juvenile coral density, is unclear. Macroalgal delta N-15-values of two species, Lobophora variegata and Tricleocarpa oblongata, were measured in Wenchang (northeast Hainan Island, South China Sea) in both the dry and wet seasons, to assess the influence of nitrogen sources and nutrient stress resulting from sewage input or upwelling on the condition of corals. Macroalgal delta N-15-values showed that shallow stations between the reef and the coast were severely affected by sewage input (e.g., river discharges and aquaculture ponds), whereas deep stations on the outside of the reef were influenced by upwelling-based nutrients. Correlation and redundancy analysis demonstrated that delta N-15-values of L. variegata had a stronger relation with coral condition than any other environmental parameter (e.g., water quality index, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients), with significant negative correlations in both the dry and wet seasons. Thus, macroalgal delta N-15-values can be used to determine where nutrient stress is negatively affecting corals, highlighting the links of human activities and coastal upwelling with marine ecosystems.

AB  - This study was an attempt to evaluate sperm chromatin structure in the semen of insemination boars. Preparations of semen were stained with acridine orange, aniline blue, and chromomycin A3. Abnormal protamination occurred more frequently in young individuals whose sexual development was not yet complete, but may also be an individual trait. This possibility is important to factor into the decision regarding further exploitation of insemination boars. Thus a precise assessment of abnormalities in the protamination process would seem to be expedient as a tool supplementing morphological and molecular evaluation of semen. Disruptions in nucleoprotein structure can be treated as indicators of the biological value of sperm cells.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown positive associations between ornaments and condition, as predicted by indicator models of sexual selection. However, this idea is continuously challenged by opposite results, which reveal our lack of full understanding of how sexual selection works. Environmental heterogeneity may explain such inconsistencies, but valid field tests of this idea are currently lacking. We first analysed the relationship between condition and ornament expression from nine populations over 7 years in a wild bird, the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We then manipulated male aggressiveness at the population level by means of testosterone implants in a replicated field experiment. We found that the relationship between condition and ornamentation varied greatly between environments and became stronger when environmental conditions (ECs) were worse or when aggressiveness in the population was experimentally increased. Some ornaments may therefore reliably advertise a better condition only in adverse ECs. Considering environmental heterogeneity can help reconcile conflicting findings regarding the reliability of ornaments as indicators of condition and will help our understanding of sexual selection processes.

AB  - Following a discussion of four approaches to children's services and intervention design, a description of PASSKey, an ecobehavioral and naturalistic approach to intervention design, is presented. PASSKey stands for planned activity, systematic sampling, and keystone behavior, which represent the major components of the model. It has been developed for early intervention consultants to provide technical assistance for intervention planning with young children reported to have learning and/or behavioral problems. The intervention design method capitalizes on existing teacher or parent (or other direct-care providers) competencies and thereby may enhance acceptability and generalizability of interventions. The model is illustrated through an actual case, and implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB  - This study outlines an alternative, versatile and flexible procedure to the Assessment System for the Ecological Quality of Streams and Rivers throughout Europe using Benthic Macroinvertebrates (AQEM) protocol for selecting and assessing candidate bioindicators for Water Framework Directive (WFD) compliant monitoring programmes. Based on different forms of benthic macroinvertebrate data using relative abundance of family level taxonomic groups, metrics and traits collected during spring 2010 at 96 lotic sites across northern Portugal, the procedure employs components of top down and bottom up analytical processes and introduces the concept of niche breadth to assess biological quality element response to environmental and stressor parameters across different spatial levels. Random Forest classification revealed that fractal and non-fractal land use metrics at basin and local level were extremely important determinants of Water Framework Directive determination of "Good" ecological quality, particularly at the local scale. The amount of urbanization at the lower spatial level was a particularly important determinant of ecological quality, while the extent and type of forest (especially coniferous) was more important at higher, river basin scale. Distance-based linear models (DISTLM) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) were used to determine associations between invertebrate data and non-redundant environmental predictors selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results revealed a stronger association between invertebrate traits and selected environmental predictors compared to the other types of invertebrate data, although some association between invertebrate relative abundance and eutrophication was detected. Principal Components Analyses (PCA) were run for the non-redundant sets of predictors for each macroinvertebrate data set to extract an environmental quality gradient along the first axis. Niche breadth, calculated for candidate indicators to avoid bias resulting from expert judgement, was distributed by rank along its respective PCA gradient. Five candidate indicators for each data type were selected for their preference for the most pristine sites and five were selected due to their close link with the most degraded streams. Candidate bioindicators for impacted sites tended to be stenobiotic in character, due to the impoverished structural and functional diversity associated with such conditions. Finally Partial Least Squares Regression was used to refine and validate selected candidate metrics, to produce a comprehensive final list of macroinvertebrate measures of ecological quality.

AB  - Anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) create environmental conditions that alter biological organisation and ecosystem functioning in fresh waters. We studied 38 wadeable streams spanning a N and P gradient to contrast responses of algal and fish assemblages to nutrient enrichment.
   Surface water total P (TP) and total N (TN) concentrations represented a wide range (TP: 7-2380 mu gL(-1); TN: 127-15 860 mu gL(-1)) and were correlated across our study sites. Total P explained significantly more variance in periphyton carbon (C)-to-nutrient (C:P, C:N) and N:P ratios than TN. Abrupt, nonlinear declines in these ratios were observed between 20 and 50 mu gL(-1) TP and 500-1000 mu gL(-1) TN; beyond these values, ratios exhibited minimal additional decline.
   Algae assemblage structure was strongly linked to surface water TP, TN and catchment-scale nutrient sources (wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges and % pasture cover). In particular, there were synchronous declines in frequency and cell densities of many alga species associated with TP concentrations >21 mu gL(-1) (90% CI of 18-48 mu gL(-1)) as well as simultaneous increases in tolerant species associated with increasing enrichment.
   Fish assemblage structure was most strongly associated with % pasture, WWTP discharges and fine sediment cover, yet also showed significant but weaker correlations with surface water and periphyton nutrient variables. However, two benthic fish species, Etheostoma spectabile and Campostoma anomalum, significantly declined with TP >28 mu gL(-1) (90% CI, 24-56 mu gL(-1)) and 34 mu gL(-1) (90% CI, 21-56 mu gL(-1)), respectively. Conversely, the tolerant minnow Cyprinella lutrensis and invasive carp Cyprinus carpio increased nonlinearly with increasing surface water TP.
   Our results provide new insights into interpretation and analysis of assemblage-level responses to nutrient enrichment. Our findings indicate that a numerical criterion for surface water TP of c. 20 mu gL(-1) would be needed to maintain natural algae assemblages and at least two specialist fishes within our study region. Proliferation of weedy alga species and increased abundance of invasive fishes are also likely when surface water concentrations exceed these thresholds.
   While many streams likely exceed these thresholds, managers should consider potential low-level enrichment effects when developing criteria for ecosystems to protect existing nutrient-limited streams.

AB  - In recent years, the analysis of single or multiple species trait patterns was regarded as a reliable biomonitoring tool alternative or in addition to the traditional taxon-based methods. Hitherto, the trait approach was overwhelmingly applied to macroinvertebrate assemblages to monitor anthropogenic induced degradations of freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known yet whether bio-ecological traits derived from speciose and functionally diverse meiobenthic taxa might also provide diagnostic descriptors for the assessment of ecosystem health. The aim of our pilot study was to assess if the trait composition (including life history, morphometrical and ecological attributes) of lake nematode assemblages can reflect signs of cultural eutrophication equally well as the concomitant change in the species composition. Sediment samples for the analysis of the nematodes assemblage structure were taken at littoral sites of 15 German and Swedish lakes. Lakes were assigned to three traditional classes along the trophic continuum-oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic. Canonical correspondence analyses illustrated that both the nematode trait and species compositions were significantly altered to similar extents along the eutrophication gradient. A set of 7 out of 28 trait modalities and a group of 12 from 30 species could be defined as indicative of oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions, and enabled us to discriminate among the three trophic lake states, without confounding effects of pronounced trait intercorrelations. Trait modalities such as a high number of offspring per year and the feeding type suction feeder predominated at the upper range of the enrichment gradient, whereas for modalities such as the obligate asexual reproduction, the feeding type chewer and several specifying nematode morphometrics (short body length, slender body shape) the opposite trend was revealed. However, the observed trait replacement did not imply an increased potential of resilience or resistance to disturbance, suggesting that eutrophication effects rather indirectly shaped nematode assemblages. This first attempt to apply a trait-based analysis to nematode assemblages was found to be successful for distinguishing among different degrees of lake eutrophication. However, compared to macroinvertebrate taxa there remains a great paucity on bio-ecological trait data for nematode species. Therefore future research is demanded to expand and refine nematode trait specifications with the intention to gain further insights into the mechanistic link between responses of nematode populations to environmental alterations.

AB  - Agriculture is facing up to an increasing number of challenges, including the need to ensure various ecosystem services and to resolve apparent conflicts between them. One of the ways forward for agriculture currently being debated is a set of principles grouped together under the umbrella term "ecological intensification". In published studies, ecological intensification has generally been considered to be based essentially on the use of biological regulation to manage agroecosystems, at field, farm and landscape scales. We propose here five additional avenues that agronomic research could follow to strengthen the ecological intensification of current farming systems. We begin by assuming that progress in plant sciences over the last two decades provides new insight of potential use to agronomists. Potentially useful new developments in plant science include advances in the fields of energy conversion by plants, nitrogen use efficiency and defence mechanisms against pests. We then suggest that natural ecosystems may also provide sources of inspiration for cropping system design, in terms of their structure and function on the one hand, and farmers' knowledge on the other. Natural ecosystems display a number of interesting properties that could be incorporated into agroecosystems. We discuss the value and limitations of attempting to 'mimic' their structure and function, while considering the differences in objectives and constraints between these two types of system. Farmers develop extensive knowledge of the systems they manage. We discuss ways in which this knowledge could be combined with, or fed into scientific knowledge and innovation, and the extent to which this is likely to be possible. The two remaining avenues concern methods. We suggest that agronomists make more use of meta-analysis and comparative system studies, these two types of methods being commonly used in other disciplines but barely used in agronomy. Meta-analysis would make it possible to quantify variations of cropping system performances in interaction with soil and climate conditions more accurately across environments and socio-economic contexts. Comparative analysis would help to identify the structural characteristics of cropping and farming systems underlying properties of interest. Such analysis can be performed with sets of performance indicators and methods borrowed from ecology for analyses of the structure and organisation of these systems. These five approaches should make it possible to deepen our knowledge of agroecosystems for action. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is increasingly clear that the public, native tribes, and governmental agencies are interested in assessing the well-being of natural resources and ecosystems. This may take the form of understanding species presence, monitoring population status and trends, measuring behavior, or quantifying physiology, biological stresses, or chemical/radiological exposure through biomarkers. Often there is a separation between understanding the biological aspects of species well-being and assessing exposure to contaminants. In this paper we examine the applicability of using scuba sampling aimed primarily at specimen collection for radionuclide analysis to assess species presence/absence and to compare among sampling sites and depths. We were especially interested in whether dive transects could provide information on species presence and potential exposure to environmental contaminants. In June/July 2004 we sampled at 49 depth stations along 19 transects at Amchitka and Kiska Islands in the western Aleutian Islands in the Northern Pacific/Bering Sea region. Amchitka Island, a former World War II U.S. Navy base, was the site of three underground nuclear test shots from 1965 to 1971. Four to six transects were established at three Amchitka sites and two Kiska Sites, and 2 to 4 stations were sampled on each transect. Bottom conditions, weather and currents prevented a complete sampling of all stations. There were interspecific differences in the percent of stations where biota were found and collected, in their occurrence near the three test shots on Amchitka, and in the depth where they were found. There were no significant differences between Amchitka and Kiska Island in the percent of stations where species were found. These data suggest that information gathered incidentally to the collection of specimens for chemical/radiological analysis can prove useful for understanding the presence of benthic organisms along particular transects, at given depths, and at different geographical locations. This information also provides a baseline for the range of organisms that could be exposed to future physical or chemical/radiological stressors. The data are useful for developing future biomonitoring plans to assess biological well-being and chemical/radiological exposure only if they are published and available to the public, public policy makers, and managers. Just as it is critical to select endpoints and bioindicators that are of interest for assessing both human and ecological health, specimens should be collected using a protocol that is useful for both chemical/radiological analysis and biological information.

AB  - In the environment, abiotic (climatic conditions, physico-chemical parameters), biotic (interactions between microorganisms, vegetation and fauna), and anthropogenic (stress, pollution) filters are driving the microbial diversity observed locally. A key question in microbial ecology is to understand the impact of these filters on bacterial diversity and ecosystem functioning. To highlight the responses of bacterial assemblages to these ecological filters, a new approach based on bacterial functional traits has been developed. This approach provides a functional picture of bacterial assemblages using morphological, physiological, and genomic traits as proxies of functions, and leads to a generalizable approach over a larger range of ecosystems with different bacterial diversities. We have created a user-friendly database of bacterial functional traits, thanks to the properties of 19,455 bacterial strains. This database has been called BactoTraits. For example, oxygen preference, size and shape of bacteria, motility, optimum and range of pH and temperature, genome GC percent and trophic type are among the 19 traits included in BactoTraits. Based on the best-informed strains in the database, we identified five functional groups (i.e. mesophiles, competitors, colonizers, stress-sensitives and stress-tolerants) exhibiting a wide strain taxonomic diversity but with quite similar trait profile combinations. As an example of application, BactoTraits was used to characterize the traits and functional diversity of bacterial assemblages in soil samples from 10 sites with different physico-chemical properties and various levels of metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminations. Inference of functional traits was based on taxonomic diversity information obtained by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA. This trait-based approach has allowed to discriminate soils according to their physico-chemical properties and levels of contamination and to go further into the description of the bacterial assemblages. Several bacterial traits were identified as indicators of specific contaminants such as metals (e.g. filament shape, microaerophile and temperature optimum/range higher than 40 degrees C) or PAHs (e.g. spherical shape, facultative anaerobe/aerobe, no spore production, pH optimum >= 8, low temperature optimum but high temperature variation tolerance). Inferring trait values from a taxonomy-based approach can be extended readily to other microbial systems and contexts such as (i) studies on soils and aquatic ecosystems, (ii) microbial ecology along various environmental gradients, (iii) human, plant and animal microbiotes, as well as (iv) trophic interactions between bacterial communities and their predators.

AB  - Biotic indices developed to assess the ecological status of coastal waters according to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) often show discrepancies when they are applied in transitional environments. Although several indices have been widely used in transitional waters throughout Europe, there is still a lack of knowledge about their suitability assessing ecological status. We evaluated the performance of most common used biotic indices and community parameters (e.g. Multivariate AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI), BENTIX, Benthic Opportunistic Polychaetes Amphipods index (BOPA), diversity indices, species richness, abundance) that have been proposed in the scope of WFD, using data of macroinvertebrate community coming from a special case of transitional water body, the highly stratified Ebro estuary. Additionally, we tested their ability to respond to the main pressures affecting the Ebro estuary, the hydrological alteration due to regulation and the pollution pressure due to nutrient enrichment. Estimation of hydrological alteration was based on flow historical data (period from 1913 to 1963), that we assumed as 'hydrological reference conditions' for Ebro estuary. Pollution pressure was estimated by means of PCA analysis including organic and nutrient enrichment related variables, expressed as a synthetic index by PCA factor scores extraction. All the community parameters were able to detect changes in macrofauna composition along the estuarine gradients and were able to differentiate between the impoverished stations and the healthier ones. Regarding indices, the ratings were contradictory and only M-AMBI classified the stations in the correct way. Strong significant correlations were found between indices and metrics and the calculated pressures; nevertheless, these correlations showed a paradoxical result, since increasing hydrological alteration benefited the macrofauna, achieving great complexity. Other identified limitations of biotic indices were the opposite classifications, overestimation of ecological status and low resolution ability. We conclude that for transitional water ecosystems, where each water body has particular characteristics, is difficult the use of 'common biological' assessment tools as the results of this study, among others (more details in discussion section), have demonstrated. Nevertheless, M-AMBI seemed to work in the correct way, so further investigation about its use for transitional waters is necessary. The development of new strategies such as the use of historical data, the use of metrics as a complement for the assessment could be a reliable alternative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim Beta diversity can be partitioned into the contributions of individual sampling units to overall beta diversity, which are comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of species assemblages in the sampling units. Yet, what determines ecological uniqueness has rarely been examined. Here, we investigated the determinants of ecological uniqueness in species assemblages in forest communities.
   Location China.
   Methods We used tree census data, combined with spatially explicit environmental variables collected from forest dynamics plots across tropical, subtropical and temperate forests in China. We computed beta diversity as the total variation of the community data, and a site-based approach was used to determine whether ecological uniqueness is related to local environmental conditions and/or community characteristics.
   Results Ecological uniqueness was explained by both local environment and community characteristics, but their relative importance varied across the four forest types. We provide direct evidence that the relationship between ecological uniqueness and species richness (EUSRR) is related to the percentage of rare species in the community. Local environmental factors affecting ecological uniqueness and beta diversity were inconsistent, indicating that focusing simultaneously on beta diversity and ecological uniqueness with regard to local environmental conditions is likely to be the appropriate approach to study forest community assembly.
   Main conclusions Although the EUSRR was negative in some cases, indicating high species richness, this does not necessarily imply high ecological uniqueness. Thus, for biological conservation, species-rich sites and unique low-richness sites should be valued more. The higher degree of ecological uniqueness indicates unique species compositions, which provides insight into finding such quadrats and taking measures for protection, restoration or management. We propose that focusing simultaneously on the beta diversity, species richness and ecological uniqueness of individual quadrats is likely to be a valuable approach for biodiversity conservation programmes.

AB  - Aim. Verification of scientific concepts regarding the spatial heterogeneity of field agrocenoses. Identification of the variability of phytometric and structural crop indicators and determination of the degree of their influence on the yield and quality of winter wheat grain in the steppe zone of the Orenburg Urals.
   Material and Methods. Establishment of field experiments, related observations and counts in accordance with the methodology of state variety crops testing and B.A.Dospekhov's guidelin. Monitoring of winter wheat crops was carried by measuring the vegetation index (NDVI) with a Green Seeker Handheld Crop Sensor, Model HCS-100 (Trimble, USA). Determination of grain quality indicators was conducted according to GOST 9353-2016 Wheat - Technical Conditions. Microsoft Office Excel was employed for the correlation and regression analysis of experimental data.
   Results. Analysis of the intra-field heterogeneity of winter wheat agrocenoses in terms of yield and grain quality was conducted. The dependences of yield and grain quality on the principal crop phytometric and structural parameters were defined and expressed in the form of regression equations.
   Conclusion. The results of the studies attest to the growth of reserves of grain yield to 3.0 t/ha and grain quality to class I-II class in zonal climatic conditions of optimization of environmental factors to the level of the best basic plots by levelling out field soil heterogeneity. This is possible by restoring the fertility of anthropogenically-degraded soil through the introduction of landscape-adaptive and resource saving farming systems, soil protective and soil restorative crop rotation, differentiated application of organic and mineral fertilizers and selection of the most adaptive varieties. We also advise the introduction of intelligent 'digital technologies' aimed at fuller implementation of the genetic potential of cultivated varieties with careful consideration of natural resources and the preservation of biological diversity.

AB  - This paper presents the analog ecological-mining-geological model of the labile technogenic geological system created at the Shevchenko flooded salt mine area within Artyomovsk rock salt deposit, which is the largest rock salt deposit in Europe. Description of all the system elements taking into account their interconnection and interaction are presented on the basis of the analytical processing and compilation of basic mining and geological data as well as the results of the long-term complex ecological-mining-geological monitoring.The paper describes both the geology of the mine area and the condition assessment of the mine including its shape, parameters, and layout. In addition, scientific interpretation of the mechanism of multi-act intrasystem destructive processes, which have been taking place in the last few decades are provided. Natural and technogenic factors determining the development of the created technogenic geological system (such as man-made karst and critical geomechanical deformations) are summarized and analysed. Predictive evaluation of the time-dependent deformation processes development has been carried out using theexisting methodology for assessing the geomechanical condition of the mined-out area of the salt massive. Correctness of the method for evaluation of stability of the unsupported workings system currently in use for the Artyomovsk rock salt deposit development has been confirmed. This work concerns the scientific problems of maintenance of the geo-ecological safety in the densely populated areas disturbed by underground salt mining. Hereinabove research results add information and analytical base to improve the deformation control system for ductile salt layers in various dynamic conditions of man-caused and natural loads. It is shown that such control is required for the aim of reduction of environmental risks and ensuring the safe operation of salt deposits, salt resources protection as well as infrastructure objects at the Earth's surface nearby sites of modern salt mining activity.

AB  - The study focuses on climate change impacts on the environmental flow indicators from hydrologic method point of view using IWMI's Global Environmental Flow Calculator and Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. It also discusses how the changes in flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme conditions, timing of annual extreme water condition, frequency and duration of high and low pulses, rate and frequency of water condition changes will affect the ecosystem. Climate change disturbs the ecology by directly affecting the functions of individual organisms (growth and behavior), modifying the population (size and age structure), and altering the ecosystem structure, functioning (e.g., decomposition, nutrient cycling, water flows, and species composition and species interactions) and its distribution within landscapes (Gitay et al., 2002). Ecosystem regime shifts can occur naturally and by anthropogenic factors (Muenich et al. in Ecol Model 340:116-125, 2016). Climate change effects on flow regime are expressed by different indicators such as mean annual runoff, mean river discharge, low and high flows, mean seasonal discharge, and changes from permanent to intermittent flow or vice versa. Understanding of changes in flow regimes is important for the well-being of humans and freshwater-dependent biota with respect to water and habitat availability (Doll and Schmied in Environ Res Lett 7(1):14037, 2012). Even though the basin is rich in fish species, peoples living in lower Omo-Gibe basin and Turkana region are undertaking a traditional fishing culture. Wildlife in the parks, pastoralist communities using the flood recession farming and livestock farming are dependent on the river. The environmental flow that sustains these activities is inevitably necessary for the survival of the biodiversity. Understanding of the flow variability helps to protect the freshwater biodiversity and maintenance of goods and services that the river provides.

In recent decades, their distribution has declined rapidly, and in the British Isles, this loss is thought to have been extensive. Given increasing knowledge of how these ecosystems support fisheries production, the understanding of their potential rapid loss, and the difficulty in restoring them, it is vital we develop an understanding of the risks they are under, so that management actions can be developed accordingly. Developing an understanding of their environmental status and condition is therefore critical to their long-term management. This study provided, to our knowledge, the first examination of the environmental health of seagrass meadows around the British Isles. This study used a bioindicator approach and involved collecting data on seagrass density and morphology alongside analysis of leaf biochemistry. Our study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first strong quantitative evidence that seagrass meadows of the British Isles are mostly in poor condition in comparison with global averages, with tissue nitrogen levels 75% higher than global values. Such poor status places their long-term resilience in doubt. Elemental nutrient concentrations and morphological change suggest conditions of excess nitrogen and probable low light, placing many of the meadows sampled in a perilous state, although others, situated away from human populations were perceived to be healthy. Although some sites were of a high environmental health, all sites were considered at risk from anthropogenic impacts, particularly poor water quality and boating-based disturbances. The findings of this study provide a warning of the need to take action, with respect to water quality and disturbance, to prevent the further loss and degradation of these systems across the British Isles.

AB  - Plants in natural ecosystems are exposed to a combination of UV radiation, ionizing radiation (IR) and other abiotic factors. These factors change with the altitude. We investigated DNA alterations of some wild plants of different plant families in natural ecosystems at three altitudes in Rila Mountain, Bulgaria (1500, 1782, and 2925 m above sea level (a.s.l.) exposed to UV radiation, IR and other abiotic stresses, to assess the tolerance of plant species to the changing environmental conditions in three successive growth seasons. For this purpose, physicochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular methods were applied. DNA damage was assessed by micronucleus test and molecular method comet assay adapted and applied by us to wild plant species from Onagraceae, Rosaceae, Boraginaceae, Saxifragaceae, Orobanchaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae families, growing at three different altitudes. Variability in the DNA sensitivity and the level of tolerance was observed among the plant species in response to combined abiotic factors assessed by induced DNA damage and gross beta activity. The studied representatives of Poaceae were less susceptible than the other studied species at all three altitudes and showed close level of DNA injuries to that of unaffected control plant grown in laboratory conditions. The lower levels of DNA damage of these wild plant species corresponded to their lower ability to accumulate radionuclides. There was a particularly pronounced low level of DNA injuries in the plant species at the highest altitude. The level of DNA damage showed correlation with the values of some abiotic environmental factors. The results would contribute to the elucidation of the extent of adaptation of plant species to the continuously changing environment and would be useful in selecting sensitive herbaceous monitor species for environmental impact assessment at mountain and alpine sites.

AB  - This study assesses the change in fish exploitation patterns of the sabalo fisheries of the lower Parana River basin based on hydrological, biological, and fishery indicators. From historical catch records, we recorded a shift from a lightly and moderate exploited status before 2001 to a heavily exploited one, as a result of the development of sabalo exports from 2001 onwards. Channel and floodplain connectivity indices demonstrated that the Parana exhibited highly favorable hydrological conditions between 1972 and 1999 but more adverse conditions from 1999 to 2009, as a consequence of flood pulses reduction coincident with a fishing mortality increment. A total catch of 15,000 tons, including local consumption, regional market, informal sales, and exportation volumes, was estimated as the maximum sustainable catch. That level was instead exceeded 3 fold in 2004, in parallel with a decrease in the mean fish length from 48 to 42 cm, along with a reduction in both the mesh size from 16 to 12 cm and megaspawner proportion, and an increase of fishing mortality. Although growth overfishing was not noted, an analysis of the spawning potential ratio trend indicated that recruitment overfishing took place during 2005, since the fishing mortality rate was 4 times greater than the natural mortality rate. These observations suggest that less favorable hydrological conditions after 1999 coupled with a coincident high fishing pressure could have impacted the sabalo population biomass. Management of sabalo fisheries requires to set aside a single economic vision of the resource use moving to an ecosystem-oriented approach that incorporate, among others components, the hydrological regime, species life history traits, fishing impacts on other species, and main stakeholders socioeconomic requirements as key elements for the preservation of fishery sustainability.

AB  - Filamentous diatoms generally form filamentous or chain like groups by the thorn or protrusion structure between adjacent cells, which are important components of phytoplankton communities in large river ecosystems. In order to explore the indicating functions of filamentous diatoms in response to cascade dam constructions in aquatic ecosystems, we investigated the 13 cascade dams along the main channel of the East River (China) during November 2018 (dry period) and July 2019 (wet period). A total of 18 filamentous diatoms (including variants) were identified, including 14 species of Aulacoseira and 4 species of Melosira, among which Aulacoseira granulata was predominant. The biomass of filamentous diatoms could be a good bioindicator for seasonal and spatial vari-ations of water environments, since it appeared apparently higher in high water retention time (WRT) conditions (dry seasons or downstream). As for each cascade, the maximum or minimum biomass often appeared at stations closest to the dam. The filament length of Aulacoseira was longer than that ofMelosira, which was mainly caused by morphological and structural differences. The filament length of A. granulata could be a good bioindicator of seasonal variations, since it was larger in dry seasons than that in wet seasons. The filament length of M. varians could be a good bioindicator of seasonal and spatial variations of water environments, since it appeared apparently more often in high WRT conditions (dry seasons or downstream). Moreover, both biomass and morphological traits of filamentous diatoms were mainly impacted by physical factors, which implied that the nutrient conditions of this fragmented aquatic ecosystem is beyond the demands of algal growth. In conclusion, the abundance and ecological traits of filamentous diatoms are suitable for identifying the spatial and seasonal characteristics of aquatic environ-ments greatly affected by cascade dams.

AB  - A key challenge for natural resource management is how to detect effects of environmental stress on individuals and populations before declines in abundance occur. Variability in carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) among consumers can provide information on the population tmphic niche and how it may change in response to environmental stress. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in primary producers and in an ecosystem engineer, the bioturbating sandprawn Kraussillichfrus kraussi, in Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa, along a human disturbance gradient. Diet partitioning mixing models were coupled with isotope niche analyses and individual body condition data to investigate shifts in resource utilisation and diet plasticity from minimally to highly disturbed sites. The delta N-15 values of seagrass, Zostera capensis indicated a nutrient gradient, with the highest delta N-15 values at highly disturbed sites indicating either anthmpogenic or marine nitrogen inputs. A decreasing delta N-15 signal with distance from human disturbance/mouth of lagoon was however not evident for sandprawns nor their presumed dietary sources (phytoplankton, microphytobenthos or sediment organic matter), likely because of faster isotope turnover time compared to seagrass and/or differential fractionation for sandprawns among the sites. Sandprawn isotope niche sizes varied among sites, with no trend along the disturbance gradient. The smallest niche coincided with uniform feeding on microphytobenthos according to mixing models. On an individual level, deviating isotope values from population means were correlated to better body condition, suggesting that a divergent feeding strategy is beneficial. Our results support a generalist feeding behavior of the sandprawns with no evidence of reduced physiological status at the site with most human disturbance.

AB  - On a global scale, the frequencies and magnitudes of hypoxic events in coastal and estuarine waters have increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Fish populations are suitable indicators for the assessment of the quality of aquatic ecosystems, as they are omnipresent and often comprise a variety of different lifestyles and adaption strategies. We have investigated on the molecular level the impact of hypoxia on two fish species typical of European estuaries. We monitored the expression of eleven putatively hypoxia-responsive genes by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR in brains, gills and hearts of the ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) and the flounder (Platichthys flesus). We first investigated the effect of naturally occurring hypoxia in the Elbe estuary. In a second approach, expression changes in the response to hypoxia were monitored under controlled laboratory conditions. The genes that showed the strongest effect were two respiratory proteins, myoglobin and neuroglobin, as well as the apoptosis enzyme caspase 3. As previously observed in other fish, myoglobin, which was considered to be muscle-specific, was found in brain and gills as well. Comparison of field and laboratory studies showed that - with the exception of the heart of flounder - that mRNA levels of the selected genes were about the same, suggesting that laboratory conditions reflect natural conditions. Likewise, trends of gene expression changes under hypoxia were the same, although hypoxia response was more pronounced in the Elbe estuary. In general, the flounder displayed a stronger response to hypoxia than the ruffe, suggesting that the flounder is more susceptible to hypoxia. The most pronounced differences were found among tissues within a species, demonstrating that hypoxia response is largely tissue-specific. In summary, our data suggest that laboratory experiments essentially mimic field data, but additional environmental factors enhance hypoxia response in nature.

AB  - Classical ecological theory predicts a succession towards plant communities that are determined by environmental conditions. However, in ecological restoration, species composition often remains different from the predicted target community, compromising the success of restoration measures.
   We analysed the relative importance of environmental conditions, management and distance to source populations for floodplain grassland succession following re-conversion from intensive to traditional use. The study was established at 33 grassland sites in central German river valleys. Species composition, environmental variables, past and current management, and the distance to source populations of characteristic species of traditional management (indicator species) were recorded and compared using multivariate statistics. We further tested the speed of colonization by two indicator species, Silaum silaus and Serratula tinctoria, along transects from source populations into unoccupied fields.
   The species composition of the successional grassland was mainly determined by elevation, total soil nitrogen, distance to remnant species-rich grasslands and frequency of mowing or grazing. Elevation and distance were negatively, and frequency was positively related to the occurrence of late successional species.
   Colonization by indicator species was only dependent on the distance to source populations; other explanatory variables were not significant. Migration from adjacent source sites of S. silaus and S. tinctoria into re-converted grasslands was slow, reaching only 40 m and 15 m after 15 years.
   Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrated the limitations of the deterministic view on plant succession and the high relative importance of propagule availability in grassland restoration. Natural colonization will only be successful if source populations of the target species are adjacent to the restoration sites. Artificial introduction techniques are recommended to overcome dispersal barriers.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate biochemical responses of filamentous algae integrated with surface waters in Yavuzeli-Araban catchment (the south-east of Turkey) by the use of a multivariate approach. This catchment having anthropogenic activities and different climate could affect environmental variables of surface waters, changed the biochemical compounds of filamentous species. A canonical correspondence analysis elucidated that heavy metals, water temperature, and nutrients were found to be major environmental factors governing the occurrence/succession and biochemical contents of filamentous algae. Cladophora glomerata is mainly linked with water temperature, antimony, orthophosphate, and conductivity, whereas Spirogyra majuscula related to nitrate and lead. Filamentous algae obtained from various sampling stations had different biochemical responses to different physicochemical factors. The biochemical responses of species were significantly different between sampling stations (p < 0.05) at different sampling seasons. Relatively high nutrients and low heavy metal contents stimulated the formation of pigments and total protein content by filamentous algae. On the other hand, increment in heavy metal ions in ecosystems lead to increase malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, proline, total thiol group, and total phenolic compounds by filamentous algae. A significant positive relation between heavy metal ions and mentioned biochemical compounds observed from the Pearson correlation test. Besides, the surface structure of algal biomass changed concerning the different responses of species under various environmental conditions, indicated by the Fourier transform infrared analysis. Filamentous algal species showed different temporal and spatial occurrences in the region, which could be due to the biochemical responses of algae species to different complex environmental conditions. A significant increment in mentioned biochemical compound levels in filamentous algae obtained from a different broad of habitats and their sensitivity/tolerance to the environmental condition could make them valuable bioindicators.

AB  - Grapevine varieties possess desirable characteristics for phytoremediation purposes. We investigated the potential of grapevine cv Askari in phytoremediation of heavy metal (HM) pollutions. In total 80 grapevine seedlings were exposed to four levels of HM stress (mild, low, moderate, and severe) in greenhouse condition during two growing years (2018 and 2019). The HM concentrations (Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Pb) were subsequently determined in the soils, roots, and grapevine aboveground parts (AGPs), and then phytoextraction and phytostabilization potential assessment indices, i.e., biological absorption coefficient (BAC), bioconcentration factor (BCF), and translocation factor (TF), were calculated. Results led to ranking of the cumulative concentration order of the HMs, i.e.: soils (3476.6) > AGPs (1418.8) > roots (562.2) mg/kg-DW. The mean concentrations ranking order of studied HMs were in soil: Cu (1184.8) > Pb (865.5) > Cd (803.2) > Cr (623.0) > Zn (277.9) mg/kg-DW; roots, Cu (242.0) > Cd (239.5) > Zn (188.8) > Pb (63.5) > Cr (17.2) mg/kg-DW; and AGP environments, Cu (910.2) > Cd (322.9) > Zn (160.3) > Pb (152.9) > Cr (25.3) mg/kg-DW. Principal component analysis results demonstrated the same distribution pattern for the studied HMs between soil, root, and AGP environments, and the highest correlation coefficients were found for Cu, Zn, and Cd. Based on the obtained results (Cu-BAC (> 1), Zn-BCF (> 1), Zn-TF (< 1), Cu-AGP mean concentrations (> 1000 mg/kg-DW), and Cd-AGP mean concentrations (> 100 mg/kg-DW)), it can be concluded that grapevine cv Askari possesses potentials for phytoremediation purposes of Cu, Zn, and Cd. These results were acquired in a greenhouse environment and under controlled conditions; we suggest that the phytoremediation potential of this grapevine variety be assessed in a contaminated vineyard environment as well.

AB  - The progress of the agriculture border has led an important loss of natural habitats, with significant consequences for biodiversity. In this sense, the studies in anuran amphibian tadpoles inhabiting these environments are relevant, because the larval stage is a phase of population regulation. The aim of this study was to analyze the body condition and diet in Rhinella arenarum, tadpoles, an anuran species widely distributed in South America and that inhabit agroecosystems. Three sites were sampled, two agroecosystems with different alteration degrees (C1 and C2) and an uncultured (SM) third place. The captured tadpoles were anesthetized, fixed and preserved in formaldehyde (10%). Subsequently, body measurements were made and the complete intestine was removed and analyzed for food items under a binocular microscope. The diet in R. arenarum tadpoles has a dominance of algae Bacillariophyceae, followed by Cyanophyceae. In particular, the class Bacillariophyceae, due to the presence of the genus Navicula, Nitzschia, Gomphonema and Hantzschia, was important in the diet of the anurans in those agroecosystems. Class Cyanophyceae, mainly represented by genus Oscillatoria and Euglenophyceae represented by Euglena and Strombomonas, were predominant in the diet of the anurans in SM. Some differences in the total items consumed by tadpole were observed between the studied sites. Tadpoles that inhabit the modified sites (C1 and C2) recorded a significantly smaller amount of food. Moreover, the tadpoles that inhabit these sites showed a lower body condition. The presence of certain algae associated with eutrophic environments, could indicate some pollution in agroecosystems (C1 and C2). Food resources would be lesser in places with strong agricultural activity, possibly with a greater degree of eutrophication. A smaller food amount could have consequences at population level for the short and long time terms, because of its impact on individual growth. Larval diet is suggested as a potential bioindicator of environmental health for these areas.

AB  - The use of foraminifers as bioindicators of pollution in coastal and paralic environments has undergone a very fast development. Among various criteria, morphological abnormalities are sometimes considered as pollution indicators. However, responses to pollutants have not always been distinguished from responses to natural environmental parameters. In particular, endopelic foraminifers often live in changing pH conditions that may induce test deformation.
   To study pH effects, cultures with pH ranging from normal marine down to ph 7 were prepared using hydrochloric acid to lower the pH. Ammonia beccarii was collected and introduced into these different cultures. Under neutral pH (7.0) conditions, pseudopodial emission was reduced or stopped. Then the test became opaque as a result of superficial alteration, which is the first stage of test decalcification. Decalcification progressively extended over the whole test, first destroying the last chambers, which are thinner. After 15 days, only interlocular walls were preserved, giving the test a star-shape characteristic of an advanced stage of decalcification. If a specimen was maintained in low pH conditions, the test was sometimes entirely destroyed and only the cytoplasm, covered with the Inner Organic Layer, remained. On the other hand, if a specimen with a partially dissolved test was placed in a solution with normal pH, it was able to rebuild its test. Recalcification was somewhat different from the original calcification and was accompanied, in most cases, by morphological abnormalities (e.g., abnormal expansions, irregular chamber sizes, wall with concave form).
   These observations show that temporary acidification of the environment, causing partial decalcification of the test, is able to induce morphological abnormalities of foraminiferal tests during recalcification. This acidification may be caused by anthropogenic impact or a natural cause. In both cases, deformation of foraminiferal tests yields information on environmental characteristics of the area.

AB  - Antarctic fur seals (AFS) are an ecologically important predator and a focal indicator species for ecosystem-based Antarctic fisheries management. This species suffered intensive anthropogenic exploitation until the early 1900s, but recolonized most of its former distribution, including the southern-most colony at Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands (SSI). The IUCN describes a single, global AFS population of least concern; however, extensive genetic analyses clearly identify four distinct breeding stocks, including one in the SSI. To update the population status of SSI AFS, we analyzed 20 years of field-based data including population counts, body size and condition, natality, recruitment, foraging behaviors, return rates, and pup mortality at the largest SSI colony. Our findings show a precipitous decline in AFS abundance (86% decrease since 2007), likely driven by leopard seal predation (increasing since 2001, p << 0.001) and potentially worsening summer foraging conditions. We estimated that leopard seals consumed an average of 69.3% (range: 50.3-80.9%) of all AFS pups born each year since 2010. AFS foraging-trip durations, an index of their foraging habitat quality, were consistent with decreasing krill and fish availability. Significant improvement in the age-specific over-winter body condition of AFS indicates that observed population declines are driven by processes local to the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The loss of SSI AFS would substantially reduce the genetic diversity of the species, and decrease its resilience to climate change. There is an urgent need to reevaluate the conservation status of Antarctic fur seals, particularly for the rapidly declining SSI population.

AB  - Robust assessments of the effects of fishing require accounting for components of fishing mortality, including post-release fishing mortality (Fr). Random-effects meta-analysis synthesized Fr in seven pelagic shark species captured, tagged and released with 401 pop-up satellite archival tags compiled from 33 studies and three gears (longline, purse-seine, rod & reel). The majority of Fr outcomes occurred within days of release, and the summary effect size for Fr was 0.27 [95% CI: 0.19-0.36], ranging from a low pooled effect size of 0.17 for blue shark (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) to 0.38 (silky shark, Carcharhinus falciformis, Carcharhinidae). Fr rates in blue shark were consistent over dissimilar spatial and temporal scales, and results from earlier meta-analysis were replicated, which is the most powerful way to authenticate results. Condition at tagging was a strong predictor, and dichotomized survival outcomes in silky shark and no sex-, size-, location-or gear-specific Fr rates were demonstrated. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses indicated exposure to risk factors and conditions whilst caught on the gear probably had the largest explanatory effect on Fr, rather than stressors incurred during handling and release. Records from 549 tagged istiophorid billfishes (six species, three gears, 43 studies) demonstrated they are more robust to stressors sustained during capture, handling and release than pelagic sharks. Findings from previous meta-analysis on Fr rates in white marlin (Kajikia albida, Istiophoridae) were replicated. Synthesized Fr rates enable prioritizing approaches to mitigate by-catch fishing mortality, to improve the quality of stock and ecological risk assessments and to expand our knowledge of factors influencing trophic structure.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to investigate shifts in the bacterial community structure and soil enzyme activities during long-term reclamation of different land use types in a freshwater wetland.
   Materials and methods: Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing and soil extracellular enzymes were used to evaluate changes in bacterial community structure and potential function under four different land use types after 38 years of reclamation: abandoned wetland (AW), vegetable field (VF), pond sediment (PS), rice field (RF) and natural wetland (NW).
   Results and discussion: Although bacterial rRNA gene alpha diversity remained unchanged, the bacterial community composition changed significantly under different land uses according to hydrological conditions. Under drying-wetting cycle conditions, RF harbored a similar bacterial community composition as NW, with Acidobacteriales, Holophagae, Planctomycetes, and Spirochaetae being dominant in both. Additionally, AW and VF as upland soil had significantly higher abundance of Gemmatimonadates and Actinobacteria. The composition of permanently flooded soil (PS) had unique features and significantly enriched levels of Chlorobi. The shifts in bacterial community structure were mainly driven by soil moisture content, as well as total organic C and N. However, variations in potential enzyme activities were better explained by soil properties than microbial community composition, suggesting high plasticity of the resident microbial community to environmental conditions.
   Conclusions: Rice field harbored a similar bacterial community structure as natural wetland, while the responses of enzyme activities for all land use types differed significantly. The distributions of bacterial community might be influenced by hydrology, while extracellular enzyme activities were closely related to soil properties. Our results suggest that the function of the active microbial community should also be considered in environmental risk models as indicators of ecosystem conversion caused by land use and anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Coastal environments, such as the Lagoon of Venice, are subject daily to a wide range of variability. In these environments benthic foraminifera, a class of marine Protista, can be used as bioindicators. These organisms, through the structure of their assemblage (their presence-absence-relative dominance) define the extent of similar environmental conditions (biotopes). Sampling carried out in 1983, based on the quantitative analysis of 559 bottom samples, has delineated the extent of the various biotopes for the entire Lagoon and it has indicated the parameters that control the distribution of the various biofacies, which are the exchange time with the sea, pollution, fresh water input and the presence of intertidal morphologies. In 2001, 52 new samples were collected using the same methodology as 1983 sampling. The new samples were then compared with the previous faunas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov index.
   The results obtained through the comparison of foraminiferal associations from the samples taken in 1983 and 2001 from the sector of the Lagoon of Venice north of the Malamocco inlet indicate unchanged conditions for about 50% of the area. These results show the effect of the purification plant operating since 1986 in that area where industrial and urban stresses predominated. The results also indicate a collapse of some interticial morphologies related to the increase of tidal energy following the deepening and straightening of the main channels. More stable conditions appear to predominate in the southern basin of the Lagoon where the main modifications are related to the collapse of the salt marshes due to the subsidence.
   These results show the capacity of the benthic foraminifera to monitor the changes occurring in unstable environments and to indicate the evolutionary trends of transition environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper analyses the association between working conditions and physical health using data from the Sixth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS6) released in 2017. The econometric analysis uses two indicators to describe health status: self-assessed health (SAH), which is a subjective indicator of health; and an objective indicator of health (SICK), which is based on the occurrence of any illness or health problem that has lasted or is expected to last for more than 6 months. The theoretical hypotheses concerning the association between working conditions and SAH and the association between working conditions and SICK are tested using a standard ordered probit model and a standard probit model, respectively. The results show that encouraging working conditions, work environment, and job support are associated with both better self-assessed health and better objective health.

AB  - Drosophila species often exhibit latitudinal clines for morphological traits, frequently interpreted as adaptations to local climates conditions, especially to temperature. While there are many works on climatic data and genetic variations, the precise effects of temperature in natural conditions are not known. Here, we investigated the phenotypic variations of wild collected Drosophila simulans adults over 12 successive months during which average air temperature varied from 14 to 30 degrees C. Three kinds of traits were measured each month on random samples of 50 flies from two sites and, as control, in laboratory cultures grown at several constant temperatures ranging for 12 to 31 degrees C. All traits exhibited major changes in their mean values. For size-related traits and abdomen pigmentation, a maximum was observed during the coldest months and a minimum in summer. For sternopleural bristles number, a reverse shape was observed with a maximum in July. The shapes of these curves match the shapes of the reaction norms observed under laboratory conditions. For size and pigmentation, mean values are negatively correlated to temperature, but the magnitude of the variation was far less important in nature than in the laboratory. We suggest that the air temperature is not a convenient indicator of the real developmental temperature in nature, especially for low temperatures. Our results show that thermal seasonal variations produce different phenotypes, which may be submitted to natural selection. However, temperature is not the only source of variation and nutritional effects on larvae play also an important role. The impact of temperature in nature is clearly less important than when investigated in the laboratory. Such a result should be considered in ecological genetic studies, especially when biological data are correlated with a diversity of abiotic climatic factors.

AB  - In temperate woody plants, flowering time is adjusted to the environmental temperature, and survival to cold winter temperatures is achieved through dormancy. But also chilling temperatures during dormancy are required for proper flower bud development and flowering. The time the flower bud remains dormant is both genetically and environmentally controlled, and is a major factor determining the adaptation of species and cultivars to particular ecological conditions because chilling requirements vary greatly among genotypes. Recently this adaptation is jeopardised with climate changing conditions. However, little is known on the biological milestones underpinning these events, and when differences in flowering time are established. In this work we evaluate the hypothesis that anther meiosis time is related to winter cold temperatures, and that differences in flowering time are set up by differences in the time when pollen meiosis occurs. For this purpose, anther development has been characterised in five apricot cultivars with different chilling requirements. The work was done over two years with different weather conditions, a cold and a mild winter. The sporogenous tissues differentiated prior to dormancy and remained in this apparently quiescent stage during the winter. Once chilling requirements were fulfilled, meiosis closely followed and was highly correlated to breaking of endodormancy. Meiosis was completed within one week and was followed by a change in the colour of the anthers from green to yellowish, which could be a useful visual indicator to know that breaking of endodormancy had already occurred. The fact that this sequence of events was consistent in all the cultivars, and different climatic years analysed, supports the hypothesis that winter cold temperatures are related to the time of pollen meiosis, which in turn reflects in different flowering times.

AB  - The nature conservation, and wider environmental importance of peatlands, particularly in relation to carbon management, has led to there being a growing interest in attempting to manage degraded peatlands in a way that will restore them to fully functioning peatland ecosystems. Much of this management is concerned with the rewetting of these sites therefore it has become important to monitor the surface wetness of these bogs and if possible compare current wetness with previous, pre-damage, conditions. We present previously unpublished case studies of the use of testate amoebae to monitor bog restoration schemes in N.W. England (Holcroft Moss, Cheshire) and Ireland (Ardagullion Bog, Co. Longford). In addition we summarise the key conservation related conclusions of our previously published work on two other sites in N. W England - Astley Moss (in the Chat Moss complex of Greater Manchester) and Danes Moss (Cheshire). At Holcroft the record of lead pollution from the peat core allows us to date recent changes in the testate community preserved in a peat core and relate these to both conservation management and other changes in the landscape around the bog in over the last 50 years. Ardagullion Bog provides an illustration of the utility of using multiple peat cores in the testate monitoring of peat bog restoration and illustrates that a bog that has only suffered limited 'damage' is able to be restored to something close to pre damage conditions on a decadal time scale. We also summarise what we see as the main lessons from testate studies of bog restoration - both from the case studies described in this paper and from the wider literature - and discuss the conditions under which testate amoebae may be of particular use in peatland restoration.

AB  - 1 Variation in diversity with habitat productivity has long been a central ecological topic. Plant diversity is mostly highest at intermediate productivity, exhibiting the unimodal (so-called 'hump-back') relationship. This relationship has been explained by both evolutionary and ecological processes, but the potential role of dispersal limitation has not been considered.
   2 We used European flora data to show that dispersal limitation may contribute to the unimodal productivity-diversity relationship. Species were characterized by their habitat productivity preference and dispersal probability (determined by the number of seeds and the presence of a dispersal syndrome). We calculated average relative dispersal probabilities for species assemblages occurring preferentially in different habitat productivity levels.
   3 At low productivity levels, species without dispersal syndromes predominate (R-2 = 0.89), but at high productivity levels, species with a low number of seeds are common (R-2 = 0.89). The total relative dispersal probability, combining both the dispersal probabilities attributable to the number of seeds and to the presence of dispersal syndrome, had a unimodal relationship with habitat productivity (R-2 = 0.86). Thus, the unimodal productivity-diversity relationship may arise due to the minimal dispersal limitation of local richness in conditions of moderately low productivity. At very low productivity, the lack of dispersal syndromes may limit dispersal. At high productivity, the low number of seeds may limit dispersal.
   4 Consequently, in conditions where species pool size and biotic interactions do not vary along productivity gradients, the variation in dispersal probabilities with productivity alone can produce unimodal relationships between diversity and productivity. Thus, dispersal limitation may contribute to the observed diversity pattern and ecosystem functioning to a greater extent than usually assumed.

AB  - Potamogeton crispus has a significant effect on the purification of contaminated water and can improve the stability of aquatic ecosystems, but much research work was carried out under controlled conditions. The water quality indexes were measured to determine whether the purification effect under natural conditions can achieve the same effect as under controlled conditions in this study. The physical and chemical indicators of the water around the P. crispus population were monitored to study the range of impact of P. crispus population during the logarithmic growth period on the water in Xuanwu Lake, Nanjing City. These indicators included pH, secchi disc transparency, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, ammonia, and total phosphate. The result showed that P. crispus population played an important role in improving lake water quality. P. crispus population increased dissolved oxygen concentration, improved transparency, reduced turbidity, absorbed nutrients from the water column. The transparency, turbidity, and pH value could be affected to 40% of the width of P. crispus population, while dissolved oxygen concentration could be affected to the same width of the population. But the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration could be affected to 10% of the population. In vertical space, the influence of P. crispus population on the surface water was greater than that of the bottom water. According to this study, the gap between P. crispus population can be controlled at 20% of the population width, which can effectively reduce nutrient concentration, improve water transparency and dissolved oxygen content, improve water quality. In the process of ecological restoration with P. crispus population, the width of P. crispus population should be controlled and prevent the spread by regular harvesting, blocking with the net, and so on. The gap between populations should also be determined according to the population width.

AB  - Quantitative response of the watershed health to climate variability is of critical importance for watershed managers. However, existing studies seldom considered the impact of climate variability on watershed health. The present study therefore aimed to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of reliability (R-el), resilience (R-es) and vulnerability (V-ul) indicators in node years of 1986, 1998, 2008 and 2014 in connection with Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for 24 sub-watersheds in the Shazand Watershed of Markazi Province in Iran. The analysis was based on rainfall variability as one of the main climatic drivers. To achieve the study purposes, the monthly rainfall time series of eight rain gauge stations distributed across the watershed or neighboring areas were analyzed and corresponding SPIs and R-el ResVul indicators were calculated. Ultimately, the spatial variation of SIN oriented R-el ResVul was mapped for the study watershed using Geographic Information System (GIS). The average and standard deviation of SPI-R-el ResVul index for the study years of 1986, 1998, 2008 and 2014 was obtained 0.240 +/- 0.025, 0.290 +/- 0.036, 0.077 +/- 0.0280 and 0241 +/- 0.081, respectively. In overall, the results of the study proved the spatiotemporal variations of SPI-R-el ResVul watershed health index in the study area. Accordingly, all the sub-watersheds of the Shazand Watershed were grouped in unhealthy and very unhealthy conditions in all the study years. For 1986 and 1998 all the sub-watersheds were assessed in unhealthy status. Whilst, it declined to very unhealthy condition in 2008 and then some 75% of the watershed ultimately referred again to unhealthy and the rest still remained under very unhealthy conditions in 2014.

AB  - Existing definitions of "soil quality" and "sustainable land management" are analysed to derive a procedure for defining land quality (LQ) indicators of sustainable land management. Land - rather than soil qualities are considered to reflect the impact of the climate on soil behaviour. LQ is different for different types of land use and attention is arbitrarily confined here to agriculture. Simulation modelling of crop growth and solute fluxes is used to define LQ as the ratio between a conditioned crop yield and potential yield x 100. The actual agro-ecological condition and its potential, both expressed by LQ for a given piece of land, is considered here as independent input into broader land-use discussions which tend to be dominated by socio-economic and political considerations. Agro-ecological considerations should not be held hostage to actual socio-economic and political considerations which may change in the near future while the LQ has a much more permanent character. The proposed LQ reflects yields, risks of production as simulations are made for many years, and soil and water quality associated with the production process. The latter are expressed here in an exploratory manner for seven tropical soils and in more detail for Dutch conditions in terms of the probability that groundwater is polluted with nitrates, reflecting the most dominant current LQ problem. The proposed procedure requires the selection of acceptable production and pollution risks by the user before a LQ value can be obtained. Existing definitions implicitly emphasise the field and farm level. However, LQ is also important at the regional and higher level which, so far, has received little attention. Then, again, an agro-ecological approach is suggested when defining the LQ as input into the planning process, emphasising not only an independent assessment of the potential for agricultural production, but also of nature conservation.

AB  - Wildlife is exposed to a diverse set of extrinsic and intrinsic stressors, such as climatic variation or life history constraints, which may impact individual health and fitness. El Nino and climatic anomalies between 2013 and 2016 had major ecological impacts on the California Current ecosystem. As top marine predators, California sea lions (CSL) experienced decreased prey availability and foraging success, impacting their nutritional state. We hypothesize that chronic stress to juvenile CSL increased during the 2015-2016 El Nino and that breeding represents a period of chronic stress for adults, which impact a variety of physiological processes. We opportunistically captured and sampled juvenile CSL (female, n=29; male, n=38) in central California and adult male CSL (n=76) in Astoria, Oregon and quantified a suite of analytes in serum as indicators of acute stress markers, metabolism and thyroid function, and adaptive immune response. We found that stress hormones and glucose were decreased in juvenile CSL during 2016 relative to 2015 and in adult male CSL after the breeding season, which may indicate chronic stress downregulating HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis sensitivity with associated metabolic impacts. Conversely, thyroid hormones for both juvenile and adult male CSL were increased, suggesting greater energetic requirements resulting from increased foraging activity during suboptimal conditions in juveniles and breeding tenure in adult males. Immunoglobulin IgG was elevated in juveniles in 2016 but reduced in adult males post-breeding. This suggests that juveniles may face immunostimulatory pressure during anomalously warm ocean environments; however, for adult males, breeding is a significant energetic cost resulting in reductions to immune function. Our results indicate that environmental conditions and life history stage may influence physiological responses in an important marine predator and a sentinel species of changing ocean ecosystems.

AB  - The influence of management practices on forest ecosystems is usually analyzed by a comparison of species composition and richness. Different types of management practices increase plant species richness, mainly due to an increase in the number of ruderal and open habitat species. So far, most of the studies have been performed in the forest types that were most common in the studied regions. In this study we focused on broadleaved ravine forests that are spatially limited to specific habitat conditions, including steep rocky slopes with skeletal soil and unstable ground. These forests are local biodiversity hotspots, and, due to limited accessibility, have been subject to only limited management practices, mainly removal of single trees.
   We collected a dataset of 215 plots sampled between 1991 and 2015 in both managed forests and protected areas. We used multivariate techniques to compare the differences in the overall species composition. In addition, we compared differences in diversity, structural and habitat indices to find any possible differences. There were no differences in both the plot level and accumulative species richness and diversity indices between protected and managed forests. In addition, a comparison of habitat conditions and different ecological groups, including ruderal and open habitat species, alien species and ancient forest indicator species also revealed no differences. The only significant differences between the protected and managed forests related to the evenness and shrub cover.
   We concluded that low intensity forest management in ravine forests resembles natural disturbances, which are characteristic of natural ravine forests. The species composing these communities are adapted to frequent natural disturbances and thus forest management did not influence significant habitat conditions. However, to fully understand the effect of these practices on biodiversity, a comparison of structural characteristics is needed.

AB  - The stable C isotope composition of organic matter and opal phytoliths in diverse ecosystems demonstrate that soils carry a C isotopic signature that reflects long-term inputs of above-and below-ground C-3 or C-4 biomass. The utility of these isotopic characterization data for paleoenvironmental study is based on a knowledge of dominant soil forming processes as well as geomorphic and climatic conditions. This paper reports on both the theory and applicability of isotopic characterization of soil organic C and opal phytoliths. The theoretical perspectives are discussed in light of broad environmental applications. Details of the sample collection and preparation an provided with insights into quantities and pretreatment required for stable C isotopic characterization. Two case studies from the central Great Plains region are presented. Paleoclimatic interpretations are discussed for a portion of the central Great Plains. These interpretations are based on the stable C isotope data recovered from Holocene paleosols. These data indicate higher proportions of C-3 vegetation persisted during the early Holocene. The concordance in the C isotopic signatures of soil organic matter and phytoliths provide strong biological evidence of regionally cooler conditions. This C isotopic concordance also appears during the mid-Holocene; C isotope values indicate an increase in the proportion of C-4 vegetation, which reflects regionally warmer climatic conditions than present. Isotopic discordance in soil organic C and phytoliths can indicate the degree of diagenesis resulting from pedological alteration. Geomorphic and pedologic evidence indicate that the C isotope discordance between soil organic matter and opal phytoliths is the result of local topographic variations and spatial heterogeneity associated with plant distribution.

AB  - High spatial heterogeneity of catchment properties enhances the variability of ecohydrological responses to changing natural and anthropogenic conditions, like the European-wide droughts in 2018-2019. Based on new adaptations of a tracer-aided, process-based ecohydrological model (EcH(2)O-iso), we investigated drought-induced nonstationary ecohydrological behavior in a small agricultural headwater catchment (1.44 km(2)) in central Germany. Multiple environmental time-series helped inform various aspects of catchment functioning that have been impacted by agricultural activity and changing climate conditions and helped to further constrain model calibration. Multi-criteria calibration showed that data collected during drought years were highly informative in reproducing the changes in stream water dynamics. Further, inclusion of delta 2H and delta 18O data was valuable for reducing model uncertainty and increasing confidence in simulations of green- and blue-water flux partitioning and storage-flux-age interactions. Using the best-performing calibrations, we further analyzed the high spatiotemporal variability of internal ecohydrological processes and the varying responses of fluxes and associated water ages to prolonged drought stress. Under drought conditions, modeled stream runoff contributed from deeper, older storages increased significantly after a particularly wet season, resulting in a sharp increase in stream water age. Unlike relatively minor changes in soil evaporation, seasonally typical transpiration fluxes were initially maintained in April-June but dramatically decreased as the drought further developed in July-September. Importantly, the tracer-based transpired water age was much older after April, providing a potential indicator of drought impacts and the need for precautionary management responses. Our findings are important for similar agricultural headwater ecosystems in other drought-sensitive regions.

AB  - Reversing ecological degradation through restoration activities is a key societal challenge of the upcoming decade. However, lack of evidence on the effectiveness of restoration interventions leads to inconsistent, delayed, or poorly informed statements of success, hindering the wise allocation of resources, representing a missed opportunity to learn from previous experiences. This study contributes to a better understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services at ecological restoration sites. We developed a method using Landsat satellite images combined with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, and applied this to an arid rural landscape, the Baviaanskloof in South Africa. Since 1990, various restoration projects have been implemented to halt and reverse degradation. We applied the BACI approach at pixel-level comparing the conditions of each intervened pixel (impact) with 20 similar control pixels. By evaluating the conditions before and after the restoration intervention, we assessed the effectiveness of long-term restoration interventions distinguishing their impact from environmental temporal changes. The BACI approach was implemented with Landsat images that cover a 30-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 meter. We evaluated the impact of three interventions (revegetation, livestock exclusion, and the combination of both) on three ecosystem services; forage provision, erosion prevention, and presence of iconic vegetation. We also evaluated whether terrain characteristics could partially explain the variation in impact of interventions. The resulting maps showed spatial patterns of positive and negative effects of interventions on ecosystem services. Intervention effectiveness differed across vegetation conditions, terrain aspect, and soil parent material. Our method allows for spatially explicit quantification of the long-term restoration impact on ecosystem service supply, and for the detailed visualization of impact across an area. This pixel-level analysis is specifically suited for heterogeneous landscapes, where restoration impact not only varies between but also within restoration sites.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess the functional shifts of the herb layer in the submediterranean Ostrya carpinifolia coppiced forests (central Italy) along a coppicing rotation cycle. More specifically, the following questions were addressed: i) is there a pattern in functional trait composition of the herb layer along a regeneration chronosequence?; ii) which traits states differentiate each regeneration stage?: iii) are patterns of trait state variation related to the change of the environmental conditions? Species cover percentage was recorded in 54 plots (20 m x 20 m) with homogeneous ecological conditions. Releves, ordered on the basis of the time since the last coppicing event and grouped into three age classes, were analysed with regard to trait variation, based on species absolute and relative abundance. Differences in light, temperature, soil moisture, and nutrients bioindicator values between consecutive regeneration stages were tested using the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test. Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) revealed statistically significant separation between young and intermediate-aged stands with regard to most traits. Indicator species analysis (ISA) highlighted indicator trait states, which were filtered, along the chronosequence, by changes in environmental conditions. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that light intensity had the greatest effect on traits states variation from the first to the second regeneration stage, while variation from the second to the third age classes was affected by temperature. Young stands were differentiated by short cycle species with acquisitive strategies that only propagated by sexual reproduction, with light seeds, summer green and overwintering green leaves, and a long flowering duration. Intermediate-aged and mature stands were characterized by traits associated with early leaf and flower production, high persistence in time, and showing retentive strategies aimed at resource storage (e.g., geophytes, spring green leaves, rhizomes, and mesomorphic/hygromorphic leaves).

AB  - We investigated the relations among 83 hydrologic condition metrics (HCMs) and changes in algal, invertebrate, and fish communities in five metropolitan areas across the continental United States. We used a statistical approach that employed Spearman correlation and regression tree analysis to identify five HCMs that are strongly associated with observed biological variation along a gradient of urbanization. The HCMs related to average flow magnitude, high-flow magnitude, high-flow event frequency, high-flow duration, and rate of change of stream cross-sectional area were most consistently associated with changes in aquatic communities. Although our investigation used an urban gradient design with short hydrologic periods of record (a parts per thousand currency sign1 year) of hourly cross-sectional area time series, these five HCMs were consistent with previous investigations using long-term daily-flow records. The ecological sampling day often was included in the hydrologic period. Regression tree models explained up to 73, 92, and 79% of variance for specific algal, invertebrate, and fish community metrics, respectively. National models generally were not as statistically significant as models for individual metropolitan areas. High-flow event frequency, a hydrologic metric found to be transferable across stream type and useful for classifying habitat by previous research, was found to be the most ecologically relevant HCM; transformation by precipitation increased national-scale applicability. We also investigated the relation between measures of stream flashiness and land-cover indicators of urbanization and found that land-cover characteristic and pattern variables, such as road density, percent wetland, and proximity of developed land, were strongly related to HCMs at both a metropolitan and national scale and, therefore, may be effective land-use management options in addition to wholesale impervious-area reduction.

AB  - Remote high-elevation lakes represent unique environments for evaluating the bioaccumulation of atmospherically deposited mercury through freshwater food webs, as well as for evaluating the relative importance of mercury loading versus landscape influences on mercury bioaccumulation. The increase in mercury deposition to these systems over the past century, coupled with their limited exposure to direct anthropogenic disturbance make them useful indicators for estimating how changes in mercury emissions may propagate to changes in Hg bioaccumulation and ecological risk. We evaluated mercury concentrations in resident fish from 28 high-elevation, sub-alpine lakes in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Fish total mercury (THg) concentrations ranged from 4 to 438 ng/g wet weight, with a geometric mean concentration (+/- standard error) of 43 +/- 2 ng/g ww. Fish THg concentrations were negatively correlated with relative condition factor, indicating that faster growing fish that are in better condition have lower THg concentrations. Across the 28 study lakes, mean THg concentrations of resident salmonid fishes varied as much as 18-fold among lakes. We used a hierarchal statistical approach to evaluate the relative importance of physiological, limnological, and catchment drivers of fish Hg concentrations. Our top statistical model explained 87% of the variability in fish THg concentrations among lakes with four key landscape and limnological variables: catchment conifer density (basal area of conifers within a lake's catchment), lake surface area, aqueous dissolved sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon. Conifer density within a lake's catchment was the most important variable explaining fish THg concentrations across lakes, with THg concentrations differing by more than 400 percent across the forest density spectrum. These results illustrate the importance of landscape characteristics in controlling mercury bioaccumulation in fish. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We evaluate the condition and reproductive status of the lesser silver smelt, Argentina sphyraena in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. We describe for the first time several life history traits of this species, i.e. condition, reproductive cycle, fecundity, breeding strategy, oocyte recruitment and egg quality, and evaluate the links between these traits. We also contrast condition and reproduction parameters in two study areas with different environmental conditions: the Gulf of Lion and the Balearic Sea. Our results indicate that A. sphyraena is a capital breeder with group-synchronous oocyte development and determinate fecundity. Energy requirements for reproduction are mostly met by lipids stored in the mesentery which is the main fat deposit and a good indicator of condition; this means that condition can be estimated visually and easily using a fat scaling technique. Our results show that, in terms of condition and reproduction, this species performs better in the colder and more productive Gulf of Lion than in the warmer and less productive Balearic Sea, as evidenced by the amount of stored energy and reproductive strategy. These findings suggest that suboptimal environmental conditions may have a negative impact on the condition and reproduction strategy of cold-water species, which will ultimately affect their abundance and distribution.

AB  - LiDAR-based segmentation of urban tree canopies and their physical properties (canopy height, canopy diameter, 3D surface and volume) is a replicable, complementary and useful information source for urban ecosystem condition accounts, and an important basis for ecosystem service modeling and valuation. However, using available LiDAR data collected for municipal purposes other than vegetation mapping (such as for example engineering) entails a level of accuracy which may limit the usefulness of the data for change detection in ecosystem accounts. To account for changes in the urban tree canopy of Oslo (capital city of Norway) between 2011 and 2017, a segmentation model was developed based on available airborne LiDAR data scanned for general purposes. The results from the entire built-up area of Oslo indicate a general increase in the number of tall trees ( 10 m) and a moderate decrease in tall trees ( 10 m). The total tree canopy area within the Small House plan area decreased by 1.04%, with a corresponding 2.13% decrease in the tree canopy volume. With respect to the segmentation accuracy, the changes in aggregate tree canopy cover are too small to determine canopy change with confidence. This study demonstrates the potential for identifying ecosystem condition indicators as well as the limitations of using general purpose LiDAR data to improve the precision of urban ecosystem accounting. For future ecosystem service accounting in urban environments, we recommend that municipalities implement data acquisition programs that combine concurrent field data sampling and LiDAR campaigns designed for urban tree canopy detection, as part of general urban structural inventorying. We recommend using LiDAR and satellite remote sensing data depending on canopy densities. We also recommend that future tree canopy segmentation is done within a cloud-computing environment to ensure sufficient geoprocessing capacity.

AB  - Association between orphanhood status and a child's development outcomes is contested among authors. The contestation mainly focusses on the differences between orphans and non-orphans based on single indicators. However, focusing on single indicators such as education does not account for the multidimensional nature of living conditions of children as per here and now. In this study Child Living Conditions which take on many dimensions are computed using the intrinsic value approach. We tested the hypothesis that the average living conditions of orphans were less than the average living conditions of non-orphans in Uganda in 2011. Uganda Demographic and Health Survey data for 2011 was analysed using Multilevel mixed effects regression to achieve the objectives. Although some differences between orphans and non-orphans were observed, the margin was small. Notably the average conditions of children who lived in female headed households was less than for children in male headed households, less for rural than urban children and less for children in distant regions than for children in Kampala and the central region. The major factors which strongly associated with the variation in child living conditions were household headship, place of residence and regional differences. Thus rather than emphasizing the association between orphanhood or other child characteristics, and child living conditions, the conditions that perpetuate the low intrinsic value conditions for all children should be targeted

AB  - Air pollution and the urban heat island effect are known to directly affect ecosystems in urban areas. Lichens, which are widely known as good ecological indicators of air quality and of climatic conditions, can be a valuable tool to monitor environmental changes in urban environments. The objective of this work was to select lichen functional traits and functional groups that can be used as ecological indicators of the effects of urbanization, with emphasis in the Southern subtropics, where this had never been clone. For that, we assessed lichen functional composition in urban sites with different population density, which was considered as proxy for grouping sites in two levels of urbanization (low and medium/high).This a priori grouping was based on their significantly differences on air pollutants and land cover. Urbanization and air pollution showed to affect all lichen functional traits, with different responses depending on the functional group. Medium/high density urbanization was associated to an increase on the mean relative abundance of lichens with chlorococcoid green algae, foliose narrow lobes, soredia as the main reproduction strategy, pruinose thallus and containing secondary metabolites for chemical protection. Lower density urbanization showed a higher relative frequency of cyanolichens and lichens with Trentepohlia as the main algae, loosely attached crustose thallus and isidia as the main reproductive structure. The differences found on photobiont and growth form traits in response to the environmental variables used as proxies of microclimatic conditions (forest cover and number of trees around the sampling units), enabled us to detect the urban heat island effect (drier conditions in more urbanized sites).

AB  - Understanding how human-induced management interacts with and affects the structure and functioning of large estuarine ecosystems is a major research challenge. In West Africa, human intervention on the Senegal River Estuary was intended to reduce the impact of major flooding by opening a new mouth in October 2003, 25 km to the north of the existing mouth. This study describes the effects of the new environmental conditions on the physical and biochemical characteristics of the water column and on microbial communities (bacteria, phytoplankton by size class and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF)) in comparison with the situation in 2002. In 2006, seventeen stations were sampled, during both neap and spring tides, at a depth of 0.5 m along a salinity gradient from freshwater to marine conditions. Inorganic nutrient levels were often low but there were high levels of chlorophyll a in the estuarine area (mean of 13.7-20.7 mu g L-1 in spring and neap tide conditions, respectively) producing a eutrophic status in this estuary. Average HNF abundances were lower (mean of 108 and 174 cells l(-1) during neap and spring tides, respectively) compared to the situation in 2002 (mean between 2.5 and 6.7 x 10(4) cells l(-1)). Three biological indicators for assessing environmental changes are discussed: ratio of bacteria to heterotrophic flagellate abundances, ratio of picophytoplankton to nanophytoplankton, and the density of thermo-tolerant coliforms (TTC) and faecal streptococci. It is demonstrated that man-made alteration of the hydrologic regime can modify the microbial community structure and cause the health status of the estuary to deteriorate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many natural freshwater ecosystems, especially in the north eastern Macedonia, are polluted with heavy metals, which are released by active mines. Long-term exposure to high levels of dissolved metals might result in increased metal bioaccumulation in organs of aquatic organisms, and consequently might cause various sub-toxic and toxic effects. The aim of this study was to assess the health of Vardar chub (Squalius vardarensis) inhabiting mining impacted rivers Zletovska and Kriva, in comparison with chub from the reference Bregalnica River. It was done by use of indicators of tissue damage (histopathology of liver and gonads) and general indicators of exposure to environmental stressors (condition factor, organo-somatic indices and external/internal macroscopic lesions). Histological assessment of gonads revealed good reproductive health in all three rivers, indicating high tolerance of gonads to contaminant exposure. Contrary, several external/internal lesions were more pronounced in chub from severely metal contaminated Zletovska River. Prevalence of hepatic lesions was also higher in mining impacted rivers (in Kriva, 70%; in Zletovska, 59%) compared to Bregalnica River (38%). The spectrum of histological lesions observed in chub liver varied from non-specific minor degenerative conditions, such as lymphocyte infiltration, fibrosis, parasites, granulomas and lipidosis, to extensive and/or more severe changes such as bile duct proliferation, necrosis, megalocytosis, light-dark hepatocytes and hepatocytes regeneration. The results of histopathological investigation for all three rivers showed clear signs of water contamination, especially prominent in mining influenced rivers. More research efforts should be devoted to study of environmental conditions and metal contamination in the mining impacted rivers worldwide, especially of their effects on health of local ichthyofauna.

AB  - There has recently been an increase in the usage of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). P25 TiO2 NPs, a mixture of anatase and rutile phase in 3:1 ratio, are generally used for photocatalytic applications because both phases exhibit a synergistic effect on the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 NPs. In the present study, increased toxicity of UVA-pre-irradiated P25 TiO2 NPs on freshwater algae Scenedesmus obliquus was assessed under visible light and dark exposure conditions at actual low concentrations (0.3, 3 and 35 mu M of Ti). Photocatalytic property of P25 TiO2 NPs caused disaggregation of UVA-pre-irradiated NPs, thus significantly decreasing the mean hydrodynamic diameter (MHD) (188.74 +/- 0.54 nm) than that of non-irradiated NPs (232.26 +/- 0.44). This decrease in diameter of UVA-pre-irradiated NPs may increase its biological activity towards algal samples. All concentrations of pre-irradiated NPs, under both light and dark conditions, showed a significantly lesser cell viability (p < 0.001) when compared with non-irradiated NPs. Increased production of ROS, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation supported the viability data. Higher exopolysaccharide production and more nuclear damage were observed for pre-irradiated NPs. NP uptake was also more for the pre-irradiated NPs on treated samples when compared with non-irradiated NPs on treated samples, which, in turn, established the higher toxic potential of UVA-pre-irradiated TiO2 NPs. This study improves our understanding of the toxic effects of UVA-pre-irradiated TiO2 NPs on freshwater algae, thereby emphasising the need for ecological risk assessments of metal oxide nanoparticles in a natural experimental medium.

AB  - The present report describes a three-step approach that was used to characterize and define thresholds for the Least Disturbed Condition in Mediterranean streams of four different types, regarding organic pollution and nutrients, hydrological and morphological alterations, and land use. For this purpose, a common database composed of national reference sites (929 records) from seven countries, sampled for invertebrates, diatoms and macrophytes was used. The analyses of reference sites showed that small (catchment <100 km(2)) siliceous and non-siliceous streams were mainly affected by channelization, bank alteration and hydropeaking. Medium-sized siliceous rivers were the most affected by stressors: 25-43% of the samples showed at least slight alterations regarding channelization, connectivity, upstream dam influence, hydropeaking and degradation of riparian vegetation. Temporary streams were the least affected by hydromorphological changes, but they were nevertheless affected by alterations in riparian vegetation. There were no major differences between all permanent stream types regarding water quality, but temporary streams showed lower values for oxygenation (DO) and wider ranges for other variables, such as nitrates. A lower threshold value for DO (60%) was determined for this stream type and can be attributed to the streams' natural characteristics. For all other river types, common limits were found for the remaining variables (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, total P. % of artificial areas, % of intensive and extensive agriculture, % of semi-natural areas in the catchment). These values were then used to select the list of reference sites. The biological communities were characterized, revealing the existence of nine groups of Mediterranean invertebrate communities, six for diatoms and five for macrophytes: each group was characterized by specific indicator taxa that highlighted the differences between groups.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary characterization of the biological responses of Hediste diversicolor to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under controlled laboratory conditions. In order to test the effects of PAH exposure, a battery of biomarkers was applied to the polychaetes by exposing them to sublethal concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (0.1 and 0.5 mg L-1) for 10 d under laboratory conditions. The battery of biomarkers tested included oxidative stress biomarkers (glutathione content, enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases), total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) toward peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals and activity of acyl CoA oxidase (AOX) as a marker of peroxisome proliferation measured in the entire body; lipofuscin and neutral lipid accumulations and levels of Ca2+-ATPase activity analyzed in the intestinal epithelium; lysosomal membrane stability and genotoxic effects measured as DNA strand breaks and frequency of micronuclei in coelomocytes. Chemical analyses were also carried out to verify the polychaete's benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) bioaccumulation levels after the exposure period. The results obtained indicate that B[a]P caused significant changes in most of the parameters measured in H. diversicolor. Biological responses to the organic compound were particularly significant for the biomarkers measured in the intestinal epithelium and in coelomocytes, emphasizing that these tissues were more affected during our experimental conditions. Considering the key trophic role of this benthic species in estuarine and coastal ecosystems, this study confirmed that H. diversicolor is an appropriate bioindicator of organic contamination.

AB  - This article presents an online diagnostics method to predict critical conditions in ceramic insulators. For this purpose, a variety of experimental tests have been conducted on different kinds of ceramic insulators under different environmental conditions in order to analyze their leakage current. Fast Fourier transform analysis of leakage currents shows a strong correlation between the ratio of the third to fifth harmonic amplitude regarding occurrence of critical conditions and degree of insulator ageing. Therefore, the index of the third to fifth harmonic amplitude is utilized as the detection indicator of critical conditions in ceramic insulators. An increase in the index of the third to fifth harmonic amplitude to more than one represents a critical condition in the insulators and estimates a high probability of flashover occurrence. The obtained results have also shown the viability of the index in insulators monitoring procedures. Training the proposed index to a microprocessor powered device gives ability to the system for online diagnosis of ceramic insulator qualifications, detecting critical conditions, and predicting flashover occurrence.

AB  - Common land is land with an ancient form of ownership. At one time it was economically important, but now its importance lies in the preservation of cultural landscapes and ecological balance. This article uses the geographic information system to analyze selected landscape indicators with respect to various types of agricultural land and determine whether and to what extent the assertion holds true that in Slovenia common agricultural land is preserved primarily in areas with poorer natural conditions for agriculture.

AB  - Present-day habitats of the Ebro Delta, NE Iberian Peninsula, have been ecologically altered as a consequence of intensive human impacts in the last two centuries (especially rice farming). Benthic foraminiferal palaeoassemblages and sediment characteristics of five short cores were used to reconstruct past wetland habitats, through application of multivariate DCA and CONISS techniques, and dissimilarity coefficients (SCD). The timing of environmental changes was compared to known natural and anthropogenic events in order to identify their possible relationships. In deltaic wetlands under altered hydrological conditions, we found a decrease in species diversity and calcareous-dominated assemblages, and a significant positive correlation between microfaunal changes and organic matter content. Modern analogues supported palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the recent evolution of the Delta wetlands. This research provides the first recent reconstruction of change in the Ebro Delta wetlands, and also illustrates the importance of benthic foraminifera for biomonitoring present and future conditions in Mediterranean deltas.

AB  - Battery electric buses can reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China's transportation system. On-road testing is necessary to evaluate these benefits compared to their diesel counterparts through life-cycle assessment for both the upstream fuel production and operation stages. Three electric buses from China are operated and charged in Macao under different air-conditioning, load, and speed settings. In the minimum load scenario, the two 12-m buses achieve 138-175 kWh/100 km, and the 8-m bus achieves 79 kWh/100 km (system charging loss included). When air-conditioning and load are at their maximum values, the energy consumption increases by 21-27%; however, air-conditioning usage exerts a greater impact than passenger load. The diesel bus on-road performance increases more significantly than the electric bus performance under low speeds, higher load, and air-conditioning use, while the electric bus energy and CO2 emission benefits increase. Across a wide range of conditions, the electric bus reduces petroleum use by 85-87% compared to a diesel bus and achieves a 32-46% reduction in fossil fuel use and 19-35% in CO2 emissions from a life-cycle perspective. A cleaner power grid and an increase in system charging efficiency (if better than 60 84%) would enhance the future benefits of electric buses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over 400 sites were sampled in the nearshore of the U.S. Great Lakes during the U.S. National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) field survey in summer 2010. Underwater video images were recorded in addition to routine NCCA benthic assessment measures. This paper has two objectives: (1) to develop a process to evaluate video performance with acceptance criteria, exploring reasons for poor images, and (2) to use acceptable videos in an example application with invasive mussels, evaluating the enhancement potential of video to supplement traditional grab sampling. A standard hierarchical protocol was developed to rank video performance based on quality and clarity. We determined controllable and uncontrollable factors affecting video performance. Moreover, specific thresholds limiting video were identified: > 0.5/m for light extinction and > 3.5 A mu g/L for chlorophyll a concentration. To demonstrate the utility and enhancement potential of video sampling, observed dreissenid presence from excellent (221 of 362 videos) videos was compared with NCCA benthic taxonomy, in the context of the statistically based NCCA survey. Including video increased the overall area estimate of the U.S. Great Lakes nearshore with invasive mussels by about 15 % compared to PONAR alone; 44 % (7570 km(2)) of the surveyed region had mussels. The proportion of the nearshore area having mussels varied from low (3.5 %) in Lake Superior to > 50 % in the lower lakes. PONAR and video have unique strengths and weaknesses as sampling tools in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, but when paired were complimentary and thus provided a more thorough benthic condition assessment at lake and regional scales.

AB  - Regional monitoring and assessments of the health of forested ecosystems require indicators of forest conditions and environmental stresses.  Indicator selections depend on objectives and the strategy for data collection and analysis.  This paper recommends a set of indicators to signal changes in forest ecosystem distribution, productivity, and disturbance.  Additional measurements are recommended to help ascribe those changes to climate variation, atmospheric deposition, and land use patterns.  The rationale for these indicators is discussed in the context of a sequential monitoring and assessment strategy.

AB  - Identification of potential restoration areas is significant and important for implementing a sustainable restoration project and maintaining the ecosystem integrity. We established an eco-hydrological approach to identify potential restoration areas of freshwater wetlands that should and can be restored. Our eco-hydrological method identifies potential restoration areas from three dimensions, namely, transverse, longitudinal and vertical directions. Based on transfer matrix analysis between freshwater wetland and other land cover types and bird habitat suitability assessment, we identified the areas that should be restored under the 1989 and 2000 goals were 36,112 ha and 37,230 ha, respectively. Based on hydrological connectivity and balance between ecological water supply (EWS) and ecological water requirements (EWRs), the area can be restored under the 1989 and 2000 goals were 31,165 ha and 33,963 ha, respectively. The approach and results of this study can help in future restoration efforts in the Yellow River Delta and other similar coastal wetlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Apart from flies, ants are Australia's most noticeable and studied insects. In addition to their sheer abundance and ubiquity in most terrestrial ecosystems, they are also exceptionally diverse. Here, we outline the history of describing the Australian ant fauna and document the resources that are available for identifying and researching them. Unusual patterns in chromosome numbers in individual species are discussed, and the rediscovery of an ancient ant is described. A framework for understanding the dynamics of Australian ant communities is outlined, and the functional groups that fall within this framework are documented. The predictability of responses of ant communities to stress and disturbance has enabled a protocol for using ants as bioindicators of environmental health and integrity to be developed. This has been exported and adapted to other regions of the world. Australian ant research has also lead to promising sources of biopharmaceuticals. As well as describing these two practical applications of Australian ant research, this review looks at some of the future directions that studies on Australian ants might take.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the environmental conditions of a heavily polluted marine habitat using descriptors of fish parasites. Epinephelus coioides from Jakarta Bay as well as off Jakarta Bay was studied for metazoan parasites. Based on 70 fish and considering previous studies (230 fish), an environmental indicator system was designed. Including the recent study, a total of 51 parasite species have been recorded for E. coioides in Indonesian waters. Seven of them combined with five parasitological indices are useful descriptors for the environmental status of marine ecosystems. The results are visualized in a star graph. A significant different parasite infection between nine analyzed localities demonstrates the negative influence of the megacity Jakarta onto the coastal environment. We herewith complete a parasite based indicator system for Indonesian coastal waters, and suggest that it can be used in other marine habitats as well as for further epinephelids.

AB  - Several monitoring programs have been set up to assess effects of atmospheric deposition on forest ecosystems The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects on the understorey vegetation, based on the first round of a regional (the Netherlands) and a European forest monitoring program A multivariate statistical analysis showed surprisingly similar results for both data sets; the vegetation appeared to be largely determined by the 'traditional' factors soil, climate, and tree species, but there was a small but statistically significant effect of atmospheric deposition. The effects of deposition include a slight shift towards nitrophytic species at high N deposition in the European network, and towards acidophytic species at high S-deposition in the Dutch network The relatively small effect of atmospheric deposition is understandable in view of the very large natural variation in environmental conditions Time series of both vegetation and environment are needed to assess deposition effects in detail.

AB  - An industrial symbiosis (IS) is a group of industrial plants and other actors which exchange energy, water, by-products and waste. This article studies the evolution of an IS centred around a Finnish pulp and paper mill and analyses how the operations of the case system developed in a more sustainable direction during the years 1890-2005. We build upon basic sustainability principles known as The Natural Step (TNS) System Conditions by identifying and selecting quantifiable indicators for each of the conditions in the case of our target symbiosis. The study reveals that the environmental impacts of the case IS became more far-reaching during the 110-year period studied. Emissions, however, decreased substantially after the 1970s due to tightening environmental legislation and other policy measures and the progress in environmental technology, not due to symbiosis-type of arrangements. There has been no strong driver for more symbiosis-like cooperation among the companies in this study. It appeared that the main motives for increased collaboration were economic.

AB  - Climate refugia are anomalous "pockets" of spatially or temporally disjunct environmental conditions that buffer distinct flora and fauna against prevailing climatic conditions. Physiographic landscape features, such as large water bodies, can create these micro-to-macro-scale terrestrial habitats, such as the prevailing westerly winds across the Laurentian Great Lakes that create relatively cooler leeward conditions in spring and relatively warmer leeward conditions in autumn. The leeward Great Lakes climate effects create refugia (popularly known as a "fruit belt") favorable for fruit-bearing trees and shrubs. These fruit belt refugia owe their existence to seasonal inversions whereby spring cooling prevents early flower budding that leaves fruit trees susceptible to late spring killing frosts, and autumn warming prevents early killing frosts. With global climate change, however, warmer summers and milder winters, and corresponding warmer waters, might erode the leeward delaying effect on spring flowering, creating a paradoxical situation in which warming increases the risk of frost damage to plants. We evaluated the success of regional agriculture in the Great Lakes fruit belt to test our hypothesis that warmer spring climate (and concomitant warmer lake waters) correspond with degraded fruit production. We also examined long-term trends in Great Lakes climate conditions. We found that the cold-sensitive fruit tree (apple, grape, peach, and cherry) refugia were destabilized by relatively warmer springs. Moreover, we found several indicators that lake waters are warming across the Great Lakes, which portends negative consequences for agricultural and natural plant communities in the Great Lakes region and in similar "fruit belt" refugia worldwide.

AB  - Land use and land cover changes are important issues globally resulting in changing hydrological and ecological conditions. In addition to field sampling and measurements, we applied a model cascade comprising an ecohydrological model and a species distribution model. We developed five land use scenarios (three deforestation and two afforestation scenarios) for our Chinese study basin in the Poyang lake area. In detail, we assessed the impact of land use changes on the hydrologic regime and stream macroinvertebrate distributions for the most likely deforestation scenario.
   Simulated deforestation scenarios result in higher streamflow and surface runoff compared with the base model. The spatial distribution of stream macroinvertebrates, a group of organisms well known as water quality indicators, was modelled to describe the effect of the changing environmental conditions on the freshwater ecosystem. For the deforestation scenario, species richness was reduced, and the occurrence of the stonefly Togoperla sp. decreased considerably. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Where vegetation is managed for nature conservation, results should be assessed against criteria linked to the objectives of management. An assessment method is presented in which the goal vegetation was defined as a specific biotope limited by a set of biophysical conditions. Vegetation was sampled from field boundary strips intended for the conservation of arable plant communities. Species suited to the specified conditions (suited species) were defined by applying rule sets to a matrix of species with their traits and habitat preferences, compiled from a range of data sources. The proportional contribution of suited species to the total vegetation was calculated for each set of conditions. Scores for each condition (suited species scores) were combined to provide overall comparative site values representing the extent to which the goal vegetation was established. There was close correlation with results of a previous assessment by expert opinion poll. Variation between sites in soil type and cultivation frequency was reflected by differences in individual suited species scores. Ideally, suited species selection would be by traits alone but currently there are insufficient data available. The method is readily applicable to other vegetation types.

AB  - Background: Understanding how trees respond to drought is critical to forecasting both short and long-term impacts of climate change on forests. The isotopic ratio of C-13 to C-12 stored in wood - referred to as delta C-13 - is widely used as an indicator of plant water status. Yet whether changes in delta C-13 linked to drought are also associated with declines in annual carbon assimilation and allocation to stem growth remains unclear.
   Methods: Here we used tree ring data from over 3000 trees - representing 26 populations of 16 common European tree species sampled at six locations that span more than 20 degrees in latitude - to test whether drought induces coordinated changes in carbon isotope ratios and stem basal area increments (BAI).
   Results: We found that delta C-13 is a reliable indicator of drought across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. All but one of the populations sampled in this study showed a statistically significant increase in delta C-13 under drought conditions. However, when considering the effects of these same drought events on BAI, we found no evidence to suggest that increases in delta C-13 were coupled with significant declines in stem growth. While BAI was 11.9% lower on average in drought years, this decline in BAI was not significant when analysed across species. In fact, only seven of the 26 populations we sampled exhibited significant declines in BAI under drought conditions - four of these from a single study site in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania.
   Conclusions: While delta C-13 responded strongly and consistently to drought across a diverse group of tree species and environmental conditions, we found that most tree species were able to sustain growth even under conditions of low soil water availability. Consequently, while delta C-13 provides a powerful indicator of past drought occurrence, by themselves carbon isotope ratios tell us little about how carbon sequestration and allocation to wood are affected by conditions of low water availability across Europe's forests.

AB  - In Russia, 60 million people live in the cities with high levels of air pollution. Comparative statistical analysis of pollutant emission and immission processes in 1099 cities in the country revealed the role of climate and other environmental factors, fuel mix, and the impact of agglomeration effect on the distribution of pollutants in the cities' atmosphere. In 80% of Russia's cities, air pollution is connected to the levels of anthropogenic emissions; in 5% of the cities, urban pollution levels (pollutants concentration levels according to monitoring (measuring) data) are lower than emissions; and in 15% of the cities, natural conditions amplify the anthropogenic impact. The level of anthropogenic impact in Russia's cities is largely determined by a combination of low efficiency and high power intensity, outdated industrial specialization and inherited transport networks that cannot adequately accommodate current traffic flows. The system of proposed indicators of ecological conditions of the urban environment can be used in assessment of the environmental component of quality of life and its modern processes providing the basis for further ecological and geochemical studies of urban areas.

AB  - Mangrove macrobenthos species are used as ecological indicators as they are sensitive to changes in sediment properties. In this study, the population density of the common mangrove whelk Cerithidea decollate was assessed during different environmental conditions in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa. Previously, this species was found to persist through both hypersaline and freshwater-dominated conditions. The natural variability in C. decollata populations could provide information on the potential for this widespread species to be used as an ecological indicator in mangroves. We found that snail population density as well as sediment conductivity, moisture content and organic content differed between three mangrove sites that were monitored between 2010 and 2015. The relationship between snail population density and physicochemical characteristics of the sediment was therefore investigated using a mixed-effects model, and sediment conductivity was found to be the best predictor of C. decollata abundance. The resistance of this species to environmental variability could inform on resilience to ecological shifts, which is important when measuring responses associated with climate change.

AB  - Indicators of estuarine health are frequently compromised by large, natural temporal and spatial variance, which often mask long-term environmental trends and confound remedial actions. Ecosystem indicators seldom provide information on the pristine condition or the history of anthropogenic change of a water body. The current investigation used sedimentary metals and novel field and analytical techniques to determine the pristine condition and assess the magnitude and history of human-induced temporal and spatial change of an estuarine system. Two vintages of normalised metal concentrations in surficial sediment (1992 and 2007) indicate Cu and Zn concentrations have increased over the period, while Pb concentrations have declined a change verified by strategically located sedimentary cores. Assuming no change in metals supply and dispersion, Cu and Zn are predicted to increase in concentration and areal extent, whereas Pb concentrations and areal cover will decrease. High concentrations of sedimentary Cu may be having an adverse affect on the health of benthic animals over extensive areas, which are predicted to expand if no remedial strategy is implemented.

AB  - Mapping and assessing landscape aesthetic quality (LAQ) at the national level can provide valuable insights to scientists and policymakers about the general condition of targeted cultural ecosystem service (CES). A generalised view based on unified methodological standards allows comparing LAQ between countries, thus facilitating international environmental management policies. LAQ can be assessed by combining subjective and objective metrics. This approach makes it challenging to map and assess the LAQ at national scale since it requires consensus-based methodologies to be reliably applicable in a broader geographic region. The national-scale studies related to LAQ are not common since they require high computational resources and differ in data accessibility. However, it is crucial to conduct broader LAQ studies to reveal the more general picture of LAQ condition and support (adjust) policy implementation at the national scale. More studies are needed to assess LAQ at the national level. This study aims to map and assess LAQ in Lithuania on the national scale. To achieve this aim, we adapted a LAQ mapping and assessment approach previously applied in Germany at the national scale. Based on previous work, we tested the methodology's transferability by applying it in a different geographical region by using local datasets. In this study, we partially modified sub-indicators calculation methods and performed an additional in-depth analysis to gather more information on LAQ accessibility and condition in Lithuania. Geographic Information Systems modeling and spatial statistics analysis allowed for achieving this aim. The results revealed that agricultural and urban areas had the lowest landscape diversity, naturalness, uniqueness, and LAQ in general, while areas with high ruggedness, forests, protected areas, natural monuments, and heritage sites had the highest LAQ scores. Viewshed analysis showed that a significant part of Lithuanian territory with the highest LAQ values have limited visibility due to terrain energy and undulation. Cumnian spit and Nemunas riverbanks are few of high LAQ areas with high visual accessibility potential. The patches with high LAQ were clustered in protected areas, while the lowest LAQ values were observed in agricultural lands and urbanised areas. LAQ CES assessment is critical for higher quality environmental management regulation practices. High LAQ areas may need a better protection and provide wellbeing for the population, while low LAQ areas may require additional restoration effort. It also provides a better understanding of the LAQ condition and contributes to achieve national, European, and global goals related to landscape planning, management, and sustainable development.

AB  - The pelagic Southern Ocean is a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll ecosystem. Here, phytoplankton growth is colimited by iron supply and light availability. This creates a general expectation that when light is available in the austral summer (shallow mixing depths), phytoplankton concentrations may be high or low depending on the delivery of iron to the surface layer. When light is not adequate (deep mixing depths), phytoplankton concentrations will likely be low, even if iron is available. Here we show that low surface kinetic energy behaves like a necessary but not sufficient condition for high chlorophyll concentrations. In high kinetic energy conditions, high chlorophyll concentrations are rare. Conversely, under low kinetic energy conditions, both high and low chlorophyll concentrations were observed. We show that higher kinetic energy conditions are related to deeper mixed layers, which is likely a proxy for local light conditions. Probabilistic models of chlorophyll based on surface kinetic energy were able to describe 30% of the spatial variability in monthly chlorophyll climatologies. This means that local light availability, proxied by mixing through kinetic energy, significantly shapes the spatial distribution of chlorophyll in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that regions with consistently higher kinetic energy may not be as sensitive to iron inputs compared to historic iron addition experiments, which were conducted in low surface kinetic energy conditions.
   Plain Language Summary Phytoplankton are at the base of the food web in most ocean ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean, they are critical for converting carbon dioxide into organic matter. Some of that organic matter is exported to the deep ocean and sequestered from the atmosphere. Therefore, factors that affect phytoplankton concentrations are important for understanding their impact on both marine ecology and global carbon budgets. Here we show that surface kinetic energy may be an important indicator of phytoplankton concentrations in the Southern Ocean. We propose that increased surface kinetic energy results in deeper vertical mixing, limiting phytoplankton access to light. We show that phytoplankton blooms are not common in high kinetic energy environments in the Southern Ocean in the summertime.
   Key Points
   Kinetic energy is a proxy for mixed layer depth, operating as a necessary but not sufficient condition for phytoplankton blooms High kinetic energy appears to suppress phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean The spatial pattern of kinetic energy in the Southern Ocean explains up to 30% of the variability in the spatial distribution of chlorophyll

AB  - Yellow River delta (YRD) is a typical example of a valuable coastal ecosystem that is under increasing anthropogenic threat in China. To understand the current health status of this region, three surveys in 2011 for the abiotic conditions and macrobenthic assemblages were performed. The concentration of trace metals were relatively low in the sediment at all sampling stations representing a good sediment quality. A total of 159 macrobenthic species were identified during the three surveys. ABC curves showed that the macrobenthic fauna at 8 sampling stations suffered disturbances from human activities. M-AMBI index indicates that the benthic ecological quality of YRD is currently still not in a good condition. Five trace metals, water temperature and depth were the main environmental variables affecting the distribution pattern of macrobenthic assemblages. Community succession has occurred over the past 60 years, as evidenced by changes of species composition, key species, distribution pattern and range. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship between parasites and environmental stress were studied in two tropical coastal lagoons of Northwest Mexico: Urias estuary (highly polluted) and Teacapan estuary (slightly polluted). Metazoan parasites were examined in 292 white mullet (Mugil curema) specimens collected bimonthly during a year from both systems. Haliotrema mugilinus, Metamicrocotyla macracantha, Ergasilus sp., Caligus sp., Holobomolochus sp., and Lernaeopodidae were found in gills, while Contracaecum sp. larvae III was found liver, hepatic portal vein and kidneys. Ecological indices were influenced by the slightly higher number of parasitic species in Urias compared to Teacapan, as well as the clear dominance of two species: Ergasilus sp. and Contracaecum sp. in both systems. In fact, Ergasilus sp. showed considerably higher abundance in Urias, possibly indicating that its success was a result of adverse conditions affecting the host, while Contracaecum sp showed higher abundances in Teacapan, suggesting that the environmental conditions occurring in Urias could have produced negative impacts on the nematode's infective potential.

AB  - This review summarizes some of the main findings of our work with the Metals in the Environment Research Network examining seasonal and regional effects on metal accumulation, growth, condition, and physiology in wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from 10 lakes comprising two metal contamination gradients in the industrial regions of Sudbury, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada. The specific objectives of this review are: (1) to propose threshold tissue metal concentrations to discriminate between fish from contaminated and reference sites; (2) to identify factors that can influence metal accumulation and fish condition; and (3) to define an experimental approach for measuring metal effects in wild yellow perch. Using tissue thresholds appeared useful not only for discriminating fish from clean or contaminated environments, but also provided a simple approach to examine metabolic consequences of tissue metal accumulation. Overall, fish from Sudbury grew faster, expressed higher aerobic capacities, and died younger, but also appeared better at limiting accumulation of some metals than Rouyn-Noranda fish. The condition of the latter fish was clearly more affected by metals than Sudbury fish. Finally, our dataset allows us to propose that yellow perch are highly suitable for ecological risk assessment studies of metal effects in wild fish, but that fish size, season, and region must be considered in sampling design and that several reference sites must be studied for meaningful conclusions to be reached.

AB  - As soil destruction is one of the most conspicuous environmental impacts of opencast mining, mining companies are compelled to restore the exploited areas and to develop monitoring programs to test the effectiveness of the restoration treatments. Soil physical and chemical parameters are usually used as soil quality indicators, but bioindicators are more promising as they evaluate the global soil capability to support its ecological functions. In this work, we used soil mesofaunal bioindicators to evaluate four post-mining restoration treatments (soil spreading, soil spreading + grass and herb sowing, soil spreading + tree planting and soil spreading + sowing + planting). Twelve years after restoration none of the treatments had achieved the restoration of the preoperational forest soil conditions. Soil spreading was the least effective treatment. Soil spreading + sowing and soil spreading + sowing + planting generated grassland soil conditions. Soil spreading + planting induced an incipient forest soil structure. Number of taxa, collembolan and oribatid species diversity and communites structure were the most sensitive mesofaunal parameters to evaluate the soil restoration treatments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of forest management on biodiversity and ecosystem processes has been little studied in Mexican temperate forests. In this way, roots are good functional indicators of an ecosystem because they constitute much of the living ground biomass and exert control over soil formation processes, organic matter production and nutrient dynamics. This study compares coarse and fine root biomass from a protected forest and a managed area where there was selective logging during 2003 and 2004, resulting in the removal of 10 % of the trees. The average root biomass did not differ significantly between sites (P = 0.185). Root biomass in the managed forest was 3.05 Mg.ha(-1) (S.E. = 0.25) and 3.39 Mg.ha(-1) (S.E. = 0.24) in the preserved forest. Fine roots occupied the highest percentage of the biomass in both forest types, although their values did not differ significantly between sites (P = 0.095). As the results suggest, selective logging maintains environmental conditions, particularly those of the soil, which allows having similar biomass to that in the forest preserved under natural conditions.

AB  - Assessing the health of ecosystems has become a focal point among researchers worldwide. Recently, the European Water Framework Directive intensified the development of approaches to assess ecosystems' ecological quality. The Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT) is a multimetric approach to evaluate condition of subtidal soft bottom macroinvertebrates of coastal and transitional waters. The effects of anthropogenic disturbances on benthic macroinvertebrate communities, from 1990 to 2006, allowed testing BAT performance in Mondego estuary (Portugal). The method was able to detect decrease on ecological quality, induced essentially by eutrophication and physical disturbances, and follow communities' subsequent recovery. It evidenced, nevertheless, some limitations associated with the unstable nature of estuaries. The ecological classification of key species in the community and the balance expected between ecological groups of estuarine communities had great influence in the final ecological assessment. Shortcomings of the method were discussed in the light of its suitability for assessing transitional waters' condition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine macrofaunal and physico-chemical responses to organic enrichment beneath salmon farms in contrasting flow environments, and reveal pronounced flow-related differences in the magnitude and spatial extent of effects. Total macrofaunal abundances at high flow sites were nearly an order of magnitude greater than at comparable low flow sites, representing a significant benthic biomass. These very high abundances occurred in conjunction with moderate-to-high species richness, and were evident in the absence of appreciable organic matter accumulation. Biological responses to increasing sulfide were variable; however a significant biological threshold was evident at 1500 mu M. Macrofaunal responses at high flow sites differed substantially from the Pearson-Rosenberg model. The atypical ecological conditions were attributed to (i) limited accumulation of fine sediments, (ii) maintenance of aerobic conditions in near-surface sediments, and (iii) an abundant food supply. Thus, enhanced resilience to organic waste at well-flushed sites appears related to both biological and physical processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a framework for the protection of groundwater, inland surface waters, estuarine waters, and coastal waters. The WFD constitutes a new view of the water resources management in Europe because, for the first time, water management is: (i) based mainly upon biological and ecological elements, with ecosystems being at the centre of the management decisions; (ii) applied to European water bodies, as a whole; and (iii) based upon the whole river basin, including also the adjacent coastal area. Although the marine water bodies affected by the WFD relate to only 19.8% of the whole of the European continental shelf, its application constitutes a challenge and an opportunity in nearshore, coastal and continental shelf research.
   This contribution highlights some of the main tasks and the research to be undertaken in the coming years, proposing investigations into: typologies; physico-chemical processes; indicator species; reference conditions; integration of the quality assessment; methodologies in determining ecological status, etc. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is a multivariate technique that involves transformations of data matrices to provide optimal comparability. We propose GPA to quantify the concordance among sets of variables that characterize natural, human and productive subsystems. When the land use fits in with the physical support of agricultural production, people's well-being should be evident in a high concordance between the land use and the social conditions. In a situation of instability each set of variables operates in diverse directions resulting in lower resilience and sustainability. Two GPA were performed, between physical support and land use data sets (concordance = 67.4%), and between land use and social conditions data sets (concordance = 65.3%). The interplay between the pair of concordance values constitutes a bi-dimensional index which serves as an ecological indicator. Based on bootstrap confidence interval, the 49 counties of the Pampa Ecoregion, Argentina, were classified in medium, high or low concordance. The lack of concordance is an indicator of imbalances which may contribute to guide environmental management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable development of mineral resources (MRs) is important for a national strategy of resource security and ecological civilization. Reasonable zoning of MRs for development and management is key. In this study, we developed a multi-objective framework for MRs zones (MRZs), including indicator sets and dividing processes, after evaluating and grading indicators of 131 county-level units in Henan Province, China. We used this framework to customize resource management measures for all kinds of MRZs. The dominant criteria in the zoning evaluation system were resource conditions, development and utilization conditions, ecological environment conditions, and socioeconomic conditions, which included ecological priority, resource security, and socioeconomic development. Discriminant analyses, spatial superposition, cluster analyses, and exclusion method in ArcGIS were used to divide the study area into five categories: prohibited MRZ, restricted MRZ, key MRZ, optimal MRZ, and common MRZ. The results indicated the obvious regional characteristics of MRZ distribution in Henan Province, with 32 restricted MRZs, seven key MRZs, three optimal MRZs, and 23 common MRZs. Prohibited MRZs were located in 51 counties. For the different MRZ types, specific management measures were put forward to improve the layout structure and facilitate the future MRs planning.

AB  - Along the southeastern coast of Costa Rica, a variety of pesticides are intensively applied to produce export-quality plantains and bananas. In this region, and in other agricultural areas, fish kills are often documented by local residents and/or in the national news. This study examines principal exposure pathways, measured environmental concentrations, and selected toxicity thresholds of the three most prevalent pesticides (chlorpyrifos, terbufos, and difenoconazole) to construct a deterministic risk assessment for fish mortality. Comparisons of observed pesticide concentrations, along with estimated biological effects and observations during actual fish kills, highlight gaps in knowledge in correlating pesticide environmental concentration and toxicity in tropical environments. Observations of fish kill events and measured pesticide concentrations in the field, along with other water quality indicators, suggest that a number of environmental conditions can interact to cause fish mortality and that current species toxicity datasets may not be applicable for estimating toxicological or other synergistic effects, especially in tropical environments.

AB  - Genetically engineered fish with enhanced phenotypic traits have yet to be implemented into commercial applications. This is partly because of the difficulties in reliably predicting the ecological risk of transgenic fish should they escape into the wild. The ecological consequences of the phenotypic differences between transgenic and wild-type fish, as determined in the laboratory, can be uncertain because of genotype-by-environment effects (GXE). Additionally, we are limited in our ability to extrapolate simple phenotypes to the complex ecological interactions that occur in nature. Genetic background can also shape the phenotypic effects of transgenes, which, over time and among different wild populations, can make risk assessments a continuously evolving target. These uncertainties suggest that assessments of transgenic fish in contained facilities need to be conducted under as wide a range of conditions as possible, and that efficacious physical and biological containment strategies remain as crucial approaches to ensure the safe application of transgenic fish technology.

AB  - Primary producers and decomposers-the two most important groups for the functioning of ecosystems-have complex, indirect interactions. They are indirect mutualists through nutrient cycling, but also competitors for inorganic nutrients due to Stoichiometric constraints in decomposers. We examine the conditions under which they are able to coexist, and hence ecosystems are able to persist, using a stoichiometrically explicit minimum model for an ecosystem. The model takes into account the coupling of carbon and a nutrient in the biomass and detritus, the nutrient limitation and the energy-providing role of primary producers, the recycling role of decomposers, and the stoichiometric constraints leading to indirect competition for the nutrient, The model shows that two conditions must be met to ensure coexistence of primary producers and decomposers: (1) decomposers must be limited by the carbon provided by plant detritus,. and (2) the difference between the carbon: nutrient ratios of primary producers and decomposers must be sufficiently small. Condition (1) is fulfilled if decomposers are better competitors than primary producers for nutrient uptake. When nutrient uptake by plants and decomposers has a Lotka-Volterra form, these results are robust whether the nutrient cycle is closed or open. When nutrient uptake is donor controlled, however, coexistence is facilitated by an open nutrient cycle. We conclude that ecosystem persistence is not a trivial issue when stoichiometry is taken into account in ecological processes. Strict conditions on the carbon: nutrient ratios and competitive abilities of plants and microorganisms may be required. Given these theoretical results, we highlight the lack of experimental data concerning primary producer and decomposer coexistence conditions. and we suggest that more research has to be performed.

AB  - The Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada) is a subarctic marginal sea characterized by highly variable hydrodynamic conditions that generate a spatial heterogeneity in the marine production. A better understanding of physical-biological linkages is needed to improve our ability to evaluate the effects of climate variability and change on the gulf's planktonic production. We develop a three-dimensional (3-D) eddy permitting resolution physical-biological coupled model of plankton dynamics in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The planktonic ecosystem model accounts for the competition between simplified herbivorous and microbial food webs that characterize bloom and post-bloom conditions, respectively, as generally observed in temperate and subarctic coastal waters. It is driven by a fully prognostic 3-D sea ice-ocean model with realistic tidal, atmospheric, and hydrological forcing. The simulation shows a consistent seasonal primary production cycle, and highlights the importance of local sea ice dynamics for the timing of the vernal bloom and the strong influence of the mesoscale circulation on planktonic production patterns at subregional scales.

AB  - Knowledge on baseline values of stress biomarkers in natural conditions is urgent due to the need of reference values for monitoring purposes. Here we assessed the cellular stress response of the chiton Chaetopleura angulata in situ. Biomarkers commonly used in environmental monitoring (heat shock protein 70 kDa, total ubiquitin, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide-dismutase, lipid peroxidation) were analyzed in the digestive system, gills and muscle of C. angulata, under spring and summer conditions in order to assess seasonal tissue specific responses. Season had an effect on all targeted organs, especially affecting the digestive system which displayed clear seasonal clusters. The respective Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) showed a 7.2-fold seasonal difference. Muscle and gills showed similar IBRs between seasons making them appropriate organs to monitor chemical pollution as they were less responsive to seasonal variation. The most stable biomarkers in these organs were ubiquitin and superoxide-dismutase thus being reliable for monitoring purposes.

AB  - Ecotoxicology provides a basis for making decisions on the likely impact of a chemical or effluent on the aquatic environment. It encompasses laboratory ecotoxicity tests of various types to explore relationships between exposure and effect under controlled laboratory conditions, through to studies of the effects of chemicals or effluents under a variety of ecological conditions in complex field ecosystems. This paper will focus on the value of laboratory ecotoxicity tests as a tool in assessing water quality. Laboratory tests are valuable (i) in deriving and assessing water quality criteria, (ii) for screening and ranking chemicals and predicting their hazard and risk, (iii) for establishing dilution levels of chemicals or effluents prior to discharge into water bodies, (iv) in determining cause-effect relationships in postimpact studies, acid (v) for establishing and validating field bioindicators. Both the advantages and deficiencies of using ecotoxicological testing for these purposes are illustrated from research with pesticides, metals and sediments. Use of a combination of both laboratory- and field-based ecotoxicology studies is important to gain a full understanding of the effects of chemicals at the ecosystem level.

AB  - Visual impact is one of the major environmental impacts of motorways and requires adequate assessment. This study investigated the effect of traffic noise on the perceived visual impact of motorway traffic by comparing impact with sound to impact without sound. Computer visualisation and edited audio recordings were used to simulate different traffic and landscape scenarios, varying in four traffic conditions, two types of landscape, and three viewing distances. Subjective visual judgments on the simulated scenes with and without sound were obtained in a laboratory experiment. The results show that motorway traffic induced significant visual impact. In both sound conditions, increases in traffic volume led to higher visual impact and changes in traffic composition changed the impact significantly when traffic flow was low. Visual impact was significantly higher in the natural landscape and the increment was largely constant and independent from the effect of traffic condition in both sound conditions. The effect of viewing distance was also significant and there was a rapid-to-gentle decrease of visual impact by distance both with and without sound, but the decrease with sound was less rapid and the decrease pattern less clear. Overall, introduction of traffic noise increased the visual impact by a largely constant level which did not show clear dependence with noise level, traffic condition, landscape type, or viewing distance, although there was a possible effect of viewing distance on the increase. It suggests that the additional impact caused by traffic noise should be considered in visual impact assessment of motorway projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are an integral part of the soil. Almost all of the processes taking place in it are associated to some degree with the vital activity of microorganisms. Therefore, the characteristics of the microbial community are among the most important diagnostic indicators reflecting the conditions of soil formation. Paleosols retain a number of properties from the moment of burial, and this is reflected in the corresponding parameters of their microbial community: the active biomass of microorganisms, the ecological-trophic structure of the microbial community, the oligotrophy index, etc. Microbial communities of soils of different ages of different natural regions of the Volga-Don interfluve were studied in order to elucidate the laws of their spatiotemporal change in connection with the existing conditions of soil formation. It is established that the characteristics of the microbial communities of modern soils in the dry and desert-steppe zones of the southeastern Russian Plain to a greater extent reflect the specifics of local conditions of soil formation. Thus, with one subtype of affiliation, soils located in different lithological, geomorphological, and landscape conditions can very noticeably differ in microbiological parameters. Conversely, the characteristics of microbial communities of various soil types (subtypes) can be quite close if the latter are confined to similar relief elements, parent rocks, and levels of groundwater occurrence. The state of microbial communities in a given historical period is largely determined by the laws of evolution of a specific soil area (landscape) and the secular variability of bioclimatic conditions. In this regard, local specificity arises in the dynamics of the state of microbial communities and their structural and functional organization.

AB  - Data from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) from 1990 to 1993 were used to assess the condition of the Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary. Ambient water, sediment and biota were collected during the summer months from 53 LIS stations using an unbiased sampling design. The design consists of two LIS subunits, LIS proper, and small estuaries (>2.6 km(2)) at the margins of the Sound. Selected indicators of condition included: benthic species composition, abundance and biomass; fish species composition and gross external pathology; sediment physical and chemical characterization and sediment toxicity; and water clarity and quality. Results of the four-year sampling indicated that 28(+/-11)% of the areal extent of LIS proper had a benthic index < zero (impacted) and 51(+/-12)% of the area of small estuaries was impacted. Analysis of the results of other indicators also shows that small estuaries were particularly affected. For example, 42(+/-10)% of the areal extent of small estuaries exhibited sediment toxicity, and significant chemical contamination was evident in 22% of the area of small estuaries. Low dissolved oxygen (D.O.) concentrations (<5 ppm), however, appeared to affect only the deeper open waters of western LIS. Approximately 48(+/-12)% of the areal extent of LIS proper documented exposure to at least moderate D.O. stress (<5 ppm). The overall results of this monitoring study indicate that significant anthropogenic impacts have occurred in LIS and that if remediation was to take place, specific localized sediment problems would need attention. Point source and non-point source nutrient inputs to the Sound, which are believed to be the primary causative factor for the observed hypoxic conditions, would also need attention.

AB  - The first World Forum on Natural Capital (WFNC) was an important moment in the production of valued nature. It brought together bankers, CEOs, and business elites to promote financialized environmental accounting as a solution to ecosystem degradation. Anti-capitalist activists, however, opposed the further intrusion of economic logic to environmental decision-making and resisted its progression. While WFNC organizers were able to advance the concept of natural capital through traditional (print and web 1.0) media, they struggled to control the social media narrative. Digital activists were able to challenge the official narrative on Twitter and compel organizers to address the associated social and environmental justice concerns. As such, social media produced the conditions for both abstracting nature into value-bearing commodities and, simultaneously, resisting such abstraction. Drawing on theories of counterpublic organization, public spheres of deliberation, and agonistic confrontation, this paper explores the discursive co-production of nature in a new digitally mediated world.

AB  - Seagrasses are one of the most valuable marine ecosystems on earth, yet they are declining worldwide at alarming rates. With most of seagrass monitoring based on long term responses to environmental pressures, there is growing interest in developing alternative diagnostic tools that more effectively identify changes in seagrass ecological status at an early stage. Besides morphological indicators, functional and biochemical descriptors may provide a good understanding of plant's responses to environmental changes. Moreover, the epiphytic microbial communities of seagrasses may also shift in response to changes in environmental conditions, although these have been seldom used as a descriptor of environmental change. In this study three Halophila stipulacea (Forsk.) Aschers meadows, found in the Gulf of Aqaba (northern Red Sea), were characterized using an integrated approach to highlight possible differences in the meadows ecological status. Plant descriptors, including leaves morphometrics (leaf size, leaf number/plant, leaves with lost apex), photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophylls, Carotenoids) and total phenols contents, were investigated and coupled with the plants' epiphytic microbial community structure and composition, studied using pyrosequencing. The entire suite of descriptors highlighted differences among the meadows ecological status based on changes in plants' morphology and biochemistry, and their associated microbial communities, in response to the different environmental conditions (water column turbidity, seawater and sediment nutrients) and the geomorphological features (bottom slope, granulometry) of the stations. Leaf morphology and photosynthetic pigment content were modulated in H. stipulacea in response to light availability and hydrodynamics in the Gulf of Aqaba. The highest leaf surface area and photosynthetic pigment contents were observed at the lowest irradiance and hydrodynamics/granulometry among stations. Total phenol content showed differences among stations with increasing concentrations from north to south. The microbial communities showed differences among stations and plant compartments, with high incidence of Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in light limiting conditions, while Cyanobacteria and Rhodobacteraceae thrived in conditions of high light availability and hydrodynamics. The mutual response of the seagrass plants and the microbial communities provided evidence of their functional relationship, which undoubtedly needs further investigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such descriptors have been used in an integrated approach. We provide evidence of their effectiveness in discriminating seagrass ecological status, even at small spatial scales. This work constitutes a new approach to the assessment of seagrasses and a stepping stone in the application of microbial communities as a putative marker in a changing environment.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity as bioindicators of litter arthropodofauna in pasture restoration in the Atlantic Forest Biome. Areas of native forest under natural regeneration, and pastures treated with different ecological restoration techniques were evaluated, with pitfall traps. The sampling period was from April/2017 to October/2018, bimonthly. Families Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae, and Leiodidae, species Pheidole cf. sarcina (Formicidae) and Mastigoceras sp. 1 and Szeptyckitheca sp. 1 (Collembola) were indicators of well-conserved areas, whereas families Cicadellidae and Delphacidae, Formicidae species Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863) and Camponotus melanoticus Emery, 1894 were indicators of degraded areas. From the springtail community, species richness is a metric that can be used as a bioindicator. It was observed that all taxonomic identification levels allowed for the differentiation of the environmental conditions of the sampling areas, with less specific identification levels, such as family, possibly indicating changes in areas under the restoration process.

AB  - Spatial modelling is an emerging approach to the management of coastal marine habitats, as it helps understanding and predicting the results of global change. This paper reviews critically two recent examples developed in Liguria, an administrative region of NW Italy. The first example, aiming at predicting habitat status depending on human pressures (i.e. anthropogenic activities capable of producing impact), provides managers with the opportunity of envisaging different scenarios for the consequences of coastal development choices. The second example defines the status of an important Mediterranean coastal marine habitat (Posidonia oceanica meadows) under natural conditions, allowing quantification of human impact on regressed meadows. Both modelling approaches are useful to define the targets of coastal management and, combined with information on cost of conservation (or management), actions can provide guidance to decision-making. Well-planned and sustained monitoring is essential for model validation and improvement.

AB  - A good indicator species should be easy to sample, identify and measure, and be informative about its ecological context. We analysed data from a nation-wide dung beetle survey in Venezuela in order to assess the indicative response of Oxysternon festivum (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) to vegetation and climatic condition in the Orinoco river basin. Our approach consisted of two steps: estimating habitat suitability (HS) from historical records and mean environmental conditions, and analysing four different properties measured during a nationwide survey (occurrence, total abundance, individual body size, and total biomass), in relationship with HS and current environmental covariates measured from remote sensors. O. festivum population status could not be completely explained by historical or current conditions alone, but rather by combinations of both. It was strongly associated with forest vegetation, but abundance, biomass and body size increased under harsher (hotter and drier) climatic conditions. Thus, O. festivum seems to be sensitive to changes in vegetation cover, but tolerant to certain levels of perturbance, where it probably replaces other, more sensitive species. Fully understanding the role of O. festivum requires the analysis of its relationships to other species. We strongly recommend the development of similar protocols for the analysis of other potential ecological indicator species, drawing information from historical and contemporary sources and exploiting the available statistical tools to reveal complex patterns. Given the high diversity of dung beetles, and the growing interest in this group, several candidates will probably be found in most tropical countries.

AB  - AimCorrelative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances (climatic equilibrium'). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs.
   LocationEurope and contiguous USA.
   MethodsWe contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium.
   ResultsA large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions.
   Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.

AB  - Egeria densa is an often-found invasive species in Japan, which has spread widely in the past two decades in rivers where no macrophytes had previously been found. As a result, these ecosystems have now become dominated by E. densa. The habitat preference for E. densa colony formation was investigated using the tissue concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2: a reactive oxygen species) under varying conditions in rivers and laboratory conditions. The empirical equations that can describe the macrophyte tissue H2O2 formation under various velocity and light conditions were produced. The H2O2 concentrations of dark-adapted plants are proportional to the flow velocity, and the surplus H2O2 concentration in the light-exposed condition corresponded to the photosystems produced H2O2. When the H2O2 concentration exceeds 16 mu mol/gFW, plant tissue starts to deteriorate, and biomass declines, indicating the critical values required for long-term survival of the plant. The empirically obtained relationships between flow velocity or light intensity and the analysis of H2O2 concentration for different slopes and depths of channels found that the H2O2 value exceeds the critical H2O2 concentration in channels with above 1/100 at around 0.6 m depth. This agrees with the observed results where colonies were not found in channels with slopes exceeding 1/100, and biomass concentration was the largest at depths of 0.6 to 0.8 m. H2O2 concentration is quite applicable to understanding the macrophyte condition in various kinds of macrophyte management.

AB  - This study investigates the connections between climate fluctuations and sardine and anchovy production in the NW Mediterranean, taking the Western Mediterranean Oscillation index (WeMOi) as an indicator of climate variability. The basic working hypothesis is that sardine and anchovy productivity is influenced by the WeMOi, a proxy for the local environmental conditions such as sea surface temperature (SST) and river runoff. Sardine and anchovy landings (1974-2009) in the Catalan Coast and landings per unit of effort (LPUE) were used as proxy for recruitment. The results demonstrated a clear link between climate fluctuations and sardine and anchovy production. Positive WeMOi values were significantly correlated with low SST, high river runoff and high LPUE, that is, with better-than-average recruitment of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, negative WeMOi values were associated with high SST, low river runoff and low LPUE. During the negative WeMOi phases (such as that at the end of the analyzed period), environmental conditions are unfavourable for the overall biological productivity in the NW Mediterranean and would decrease the survival, growth, condition and reproduction of sardine and anchovy during their life cycle. Despite the evidences on the appropriateness of the NAOi as an indicator of the climate in Europe and its impact on some biological variables, we suggest that using a regional index, such as the WeMOi, can provide a more accurate representation of the environmental conditions affecting small pelagic fish production in the NW Mediterranean.

AB  - Many arsenite oxidizing bacteria show potential for application in bioremediation of arsenic contaminated waters, but most can be used effectively only under conditions similar to those prevailing at their isolation site. This problem may be overcome by the use of the plasmid pSinA, which provides its hosts arsenite oxidation ability. However, the application potential of the natural host strain, Sinorhizobium sp. M14, has not been assessed under environmental conditions, which may readily affect the efficiency of the oxidation process. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of several factors (e.g. pH, temperature, arsenic concentration) on the growth kinetics and arsenite oxidation abilities of Sinorhizobium sp. M14. Batch experiments were carried out to determine the adaptability of the strain. Subsequently, growth kinetics were tested and verified in continuous cultures, under environment-like conditions. The obtained results indicate that the strain is capable of intensive growth (doubling time = 9.2 h) and efficient biooxidation in a wide range of conditions, including low temperatures (As(III) oxidation rate = 0.533 mg L-1 h(-1) at 10 degrees C). It was shown that aeration of the cultures may increase both growth and biooxidation rates, when appropriate supplementation with organic nutrients is provided. The obtained qualitative indicators allow for the comparison of arsenite-oxidizing abilities of M14 with other strains, proving its potential for application in arsenic-contaminated water treatment technologies.

AB  - Cephalopods are highly sensitive to environmental conditions and changes at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Relationships documented between cephalopod stock dynamics and environmental conditions are of two main types: those concerning the geographic distribution of abundance, for which the mechanism is often unknown, and those relating to biological processes such as egg survival, growth, recruitment and migration, where mechanisms are sometimes known and in a very few cases demonstrated by experimental evidence. Cephalopods seem to respond to environmental variation both 'actively' (e.g. migrating to areas with more favoured environmental conditions for feeding or spawning) and 'passively' (growth and survival vary according to conditions experienced, passive migration with prevailing currents). Environmental effects on early life stages can affect life history characteristics (growth and maturation rates) as well as distribution and abundance. Both large-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes and local environmental variation appear to play important roles in species-environment interactions. While oceanographic conditions are of particular significance for mobile pelagic species such as the ommastrephid squids, the less widely ranging demersal and benthic species may be more dependent on other physical habitat characteristics (e.g. substrate and bathymetry). Coastal species may be impacted by variations in water quality and salinity (related to rainfall and river flow). Gaps in current knowledge and future research priorities are discussed. Key research goals include linking distribution and abundance to environmental effects on biological processes, and using such knowledge to provide environmental indicators and to underpin fishery management.

AB  - With the theory of super-network and the variational inequality method, this paper establishes a super-network model of economic development in three aspects, builds a new indicator system for measuring economic development, and calculates the equilibrium conditions for the balance of economic development. Firstly, the economic development is divided into three parts: economic growth, ecological environment optimization and scientific and technological progress. Respectively, with the set of measuring indicators in three aspects as a point of super-network and the link between these indicators as a super edge, thus a super-network model is established. Secondly, the hierarchical variable clustering analysis method is used to analyze the tightness of the links among the nodes in the super-network; and the objective function is established by using the partial measurement index, which simplifies the model. Finally, the variational inequality and projection iterative algorithm are used to calculate the equilibrium condition of the whole model. The main conclusions in this paper are as follows: (1) The indicators of economic development are interrelated with each other. (2) It can contribute to the balanced development of the economy in satisfied certain conditions.

AB  - We studied the spatio-temporal impacts of physical and chemical environmental variables (depth, sediment type, salinity, temperature, oxygen, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen) on soft-sediment zoobenthos in the open coastal Gulf of Finland during 2001-2015. The study included 55 sampling-stations covering the east-west gradient of the Finnish coastal zone. The chosen environmental variables significantly influenced the distribution of the species in space and over time. Some zoobenthic taxa formed assemblages with each other, occurring in similar environmental conditions, while Gammarus spp. and Chironomidae clearly differed from other taxa in regards to ecological requirements. We showed the critical influence of oxygen (normoxia, hypoxia, anoxia) on individual species, some better adapted to low oxygen conditions (e.g., Chironomidae) than others (e.g., Monoporeia affinis). The nutrient concentrations in the surface sediment also significantly affected the benthic assemblage patterns. The number of species in space and time increased with increasing oxygen concentrations. This study clearly shows that in order to maintain healthy marine communities, it is essential to counteract excess nutrient inputs and their indirect effects on sufficient O-2 conditions for the benthic habitats.

AB  - A classification of the phytoindication approaches is suggested, which includes autindication, synindication, and symphytocenoindication. The autecological indication includes methods of the environment assessment by the plant condition from cyto-molecular to population levels. Efficiency of these methods is highly variable, there are absolute indicators (those species which distribution biology ensures their occupation of the niches related to an indicate) and very week indicators. Within the synecological indication, two levels should be recognized, phytocenotic and syntaxonomic ones. The former employs indicating species groups. ecological scales, <<Biological floras>>, ordination along an environmental factor gradient. The latter presumes the environment assessment by communities types, that is by the species complexes which are organized by this environment. The method based on the syntaxa of ecological-floristic classification (the Braun-Blanquet method) seems to be most promising. Unlike the dominant units, the syntaxa of floristic classification posses clear-cut ecological characteristics; the number of syntaxa is limited and they are defined by international standards. High hindrance resistance of the syntaxa implies stability of each diagnostic block relative to the environmental fluctuations. Symphytocenoindication is based on the spatial landscape design, in which sigma-syntaxa could be characterized quantitatively.

AB  - An essential requirement to determine a population's potential for evolutionary change is to quantify the amount of genetic variability expressed for traits under selection. Early investigations in laboratory conditions showed that the magnitude of the genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variation can change with environmental conditions. However, there is no consensus as to how the expression of genetic variation is sensitive to different environmental conditions. Recently, the study of quantitative genetics in the wild has been revitalized by new pedigree analyses based on restricted maximum likelihood, resulting in a number of studies investigating these questions in wild populations. Experimental manipulation of environmental quality in the wild, as well as the use of naturally occurring favourable or stressful environments, has broadened the treatment of different taxa and traits. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis on recent studies comparing heritability in favourable versus unfavourable conditions in non-domestic and non-laboratory animals. The results provide evidence for increased heritability in more favourable conditions, significantly so for morphometric traits but not for traits more closely related to fitness. We discuss how these results are explained by underlying changes in variance components, and how they represent a major step in our understanding of evolutionary processes in wild populations. We also show how these trends contrast with the prevailing view resulting mainly from laboratory experiments on Drosophila. Finally, we underline the importance of taking into account the environmental variation in models predicting quantitative trait evolution.

AB  - Application of dispersants aims to enhance the natural dispersion process in order to reduce the size of the slick and the amount of oil at the surface. This study presents an approach for modeling the development of the surface oil slick as a function of the wind speed, oil viscosity, and dispersant application. We modeled the oil slick mass distribution across a transect through the slick over time taking into account the continuous entrainment of oil, resurfacing process of the different oil droplet size classes and horizontal transport. Outcomes show distinctively different oil slick features, depending on how favorable conditions are for dispersion. A large comet-shaped slick is formed in the case of suboptimal dispersion. Optimal dispersion yields a small surface oil slick, with a large mass of oil suspended. The benefit of dispersants is limited to in conditions with suboptimal natural dispersion, with the exception of extremely unfavorable conditions in which the slick size would be increased. The oil slick length, fraction of oil still floating, lifetime of the slick, and wind drift are highly influenced by wind speed and related mixing conditions, and to a lesser extent by oil properties. In the newly defined Dispersibility Factor (DF) the oil slick properties and environmental conditions can be combined into one value that correlates with the simulation outcomes and therefore can be used as an indicator of favorability of natural dispersion and likelihood of added value of chemical dispersion.
   Plain Language Summary In certain conditions, (part of) an oil spill can disappear from the water surface through a process called natural dispersion. One available oil spill response option is to enhance this process by addition of dispersants (chemical dispersion). An informed decision for such response requires insight in the oil slick size WITH and WITHOUT treatment. This paper aims to enable such assessment of net effectiveness, by providing a strategy for modeling the dispersion process. The findings of earlier laboratory investigations were applied in a model that simulates submergence of oil by breaking waves, rise of the separate oil droplets and concurrent wind-driven differential transport between the floating slick and suspended droplets. The simulation outputs help assess the added value (or not) of dispersant application in reducing the potential adverse effects of the surface oil slick for different oil types and conditions.

AB  - Saline wetlands have received limited attention from researchers and this neglect has often resulted in their degradation and limited conservation, and insufficient information to design conservation and management plans. Gallocanta Lake is a nature reserve of international importance for winter birds. The importance of the soil here, which supports niches and protected habitats for certain species of birds, has been recognized more recently. The soil of Gallocanta Lake undergoes strong oscillations of saturation and drainage followed by drying because of irregular rain and variable flooding conditions associated with fluctuations in the level of the lake. This study examined reducing conditions and morphological indicators of reduction in the soil around the lake with indicators of reduction in soils (IRIS) tubes, which are coated with iron oxides. We surveyed five sites for between 22 and 34weeks. The average amount of iron removed from the IRIS tubes during the period studied ranged between 4 and 96%. The intensity of reduction in the soil differs according to subtle topographic differences between sites; it increases with the decrease in elevation. The large soil salinity (electrical conductivity saturated soil extract, ECe, from 18.1 to 182dSm(-1)), carbonate-rich composition (from 18.4 to 69.7% calcium carbonate equivalent, CCE) and overall small organic matter content (from 0.4 to 6.2% organic matter) do not seem to constrain iron mobilization because of the reducing conditions. Differences in iron depletion and patterns on the IRIS tubes show the heterogeneity of soil conditions and the complexity of factors involved in redox processes. Further research is needed to gain knowledge of the redox processes in the context of pedogenesis in semiarid lacustrine environments.

AB  - Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) Reiman et Lewin is a raphid diatom widely distributed in mudflat assemblages. Video microscopy showed various movement modalities defined as smooth and corkscrew gliding, pirouette, pivot, rock and roll, rollover, and simultaneous pirouette and gliding. Z-axis projection analysis of images revealed a unique gliding motif with corkscrew motions, which may have important ecological implications for C. closterium movement in muds. The general response to salinity alteration was a decrease in gliding movements with a concomitant increase in other modalities listed above. Short-term responses to salinity change include dramatic alteration in modalities in hypo-saline conditions and cessation of motility in extreme hyper-saline environments. Modality changes were rapid and occurred within 5 s in response to hyper-saline conditions. Hypo- or hyper-saline conditions resulted in decreased gliding speed in standard media. Five- and 15-day acclimation to salinity changes resulted in a progressive reduction in gliding movement, increased non-gliding modalities and increased cell aggregation. Aggregation in hypo-saline conditions was accompanied by a large increase in the polymer extracted by hot bicarbonate- and ethylenediamine tetraaceticacid- fractions of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), the polymers of which have been implicated in cell attachment/motility phenomena. The monosaccharide profiles of these fractions were altered in response to hypo-saline conditions. In general, monosaccharide profiles showed increased diversity upon cessation of motility and aggregation of cultures. The movement responses of C. closterium in response to environmental changes, accompanied by modifications in EPS, may form part of an adaptive strategy to survive in mudflats and could be useful as bioindicators of environmental changes.

AB  - The recent focus of scientific communities relay on assessing marine environment using different bio-indicators. The Cuddalore coastal water receives different effluents from SIPCOT industrial area through the Uppanar estuary. In this background, the present study deals with the hypothesis that polychetes can be a bio-indicator for assessing environmental conditions of Cuddalore coastal waters. The result revealed that Cluster and MDS plots showed that stations I, II and III, IV grouped together in respect to species composition. Abundance Biomass Curve (ABC) indicates stations I and II are polluted because of the dominance of indicator species of an ecological group (EG-IV & V). These stations (I & II) has been fixed at the confluence point of fishing harbor and Uppanar back waters while other stations (III & IV) in off-shore of the coastal waters. Thus, this study proved that polychaetes having the great potential for assessing the nature of the ecosystem receiving industrial effluents.

TI  - Identifying and Testing Engagement and Public Literacy Indicators for River Health

LA  - English
AB  - Natural resource management (NRM) organisations in Australia are increasingly recognising the need for complement studies of biophysical condition of the environment with studies of social condition, such as values, understanding, and participation related to the environment. Relevant and reliable social indicators that can be scaled and measured on a regular basis are essential to meet this need. In this study, we identified four indicators to test the social condition of the public in the State of Victoria in Australia with regard to river health. These indicators were river use, river knowledge and literacy, values and aspirations, and river health behaviours.
   We tested the four indicators through telephone and web-based surveys with over 1000 people in three areas of Victoria. We analysed the survey data statistically and gathered baseline data on the social condition of river health in the three regions. We made recommendations for how this data could be interpreted and used in community engagement and science communication programmes about river health. We also examined the limitations of the methodology and recommended modifications to the survey design and application for an anticipated roll-out of the survey across the entire State of Victoria. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) will use this survey instrument to test social indicators on a regular basis.

AB  - Rapid environmental assessment (REA) involves scoring abundances of ecosystems/species groups and magnitude of pressures, concurrently, using the same logarithmic (0-6) assessment scale. We demonstrate the utility of REA data for an alert system identifying different levels of coastal management concern. Thresholds set for abundances/magnitudes, when crossed, trigger proposed responses. Kerkennah, Tunisia, our case study, has significant natural assets (e.g. exceptional seagrass and invertebrate abundances), subjected to varying levels of disturbance and management concern. Using REA thresholds set, fishing, green algae/eutrophication and oil occurred at 'low' levels (scores 0-1): management not (currently) necessary. Construction and wood litter prevailed at 'moderate' levels (scores 2-4): management alerted for (further) monitoring. Solid waste densities were 'high' (scores 5-6): management alerted for action; quantities of rubbish were substantial (20-200 items m(-1) beach) but not unprecedented. REA is considered a robust methodology and complementary to other rapid assessment techniques, environmental frameworks and indicators of ecosystem condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lake systems are under heavy pressure impacting on their biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. This is especially acute in West Africa and developing countries which lack resources and technical capacities for waste disposal, water purification, as well as sufficient scientific capacities for biomonitoring and integrated management. The preservation, monitoring and improvement of lake quality in these countries are, however, of paramount importance. Throughout the developed world, an array of indicators and multimetric indices have been incorporated into lake biomonitoring and assessment. Here, we assess the numerous procedures, metrics and indices using macroinvertebrates as indicators for lake quality and assess applicability in West African lakes and in developing countries more generally. We propose a framework for macroinvertebrate-based monitoring adapted to these countries, including recommendations for developing new indices and adapting tolerance scores of taxa to local conditions. This work underlines the importance of macroinvertebrates for biomonitoring of lake health in West African lakes and developing countries more generally.

AB  - Anoxic and iron-rich (ferruginous) conditions prevailed in the ocean under the low-oxygen atmosphere that occurred through most of the Archean Eon. While euxinic conditions (i.e. anoxic and hydrogen sulfide-rich waters) became more common in the Proterozoic, ferruginous conditions persisted in deep waters. Ferruginous ocean regions would have been a major biosphere and Earth surface reservoir through which elements passed through as part of their global biogeochemical cycles. Understanding key biological events, such as the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, or even the transitions from ferruginous to euxinic or oxic conditions, requires understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring within ferruginous oceans, and their indicators in the rock record. Important analogs for transitions between ferruginous and oxic or euxinic conditions are paleoferruginous lakes; their sediments commonly host siderite and Ca-carbonates, which are important Precambrian records of the carbon cycling. Lakes that were ferruginous in the past, or euxinic lakes with cryptic iron cycling may also help understand transitions between ferruginous and euxinic conditions in shallow and mid-depth oceanic waters during the Proterozoic. Modern ferruginous meromictic lakes, which host diverse anaerobic microbial communities, are increasingly utilized as biogeochemical analogues for ancient ferruginous oceans. Such lakes are believed to be rare, but regional and geological factors indicate they may be more common than previously thought. While physical mixing processes in lakes and oceans are notably different, many chemical and biological processes are similar. The diversity of sizes, stratifications, and water chemistries in ferruginous lakes thus can be leveraged to explore biogeochemical controls in a range of marine systems: near-shore, off-shore, silled basins, or those dominated by terrestrial or hydrothermal element sources. Ferruginous systems, both extant and extinct, lacustrine and marine, host a continuum of biogeochemical processes that highlight the important role of iron in the evolution of Earth's surface environment.

AB  - This research reveals the depositional environment can affect the organic matter enrichment. The major elements and trace elements are important indexes to reconstruct the depositional environment of Ordovician subsalt marine formations in the central-east Ordos Basin, combining organic parameters with inorganic parameters. Based on the microfacies, the study area is divided into gypsum-bearing dolomite flat, dolomite flat, gypsum-salt depression and limy dolomite flat. The higher Ti/Al ratios and the characteristics of trace elements show that there were detrital inputs in the sedimentation process. When the amounts of detrital inputs are large enough, they can obviously adsorb the elements and dilute the organic matter. Therefore, gypsum-bearing dolomite flat and dolomite flat have lower organic matter accumulation with higher detrital input. Lower P/Ti and Ba-excess indicate the deficiency of paleoproductivity. Sr/Ba is higher than 0.6, indicating marine-continental transitional and marine environment. Even the paleosalinity is higher, previous researches have demonstrated the descending sea levels and strong hydrodynamic conditions are unfavorable for organic matter preservation. Lower paleoclimate index "C" and higher Sr/Cu illustrate arid and hot conditions. The value of V/(V + Ni) suggests that the limy dolomite flat is under the oxidizing conditions, and the three other environments are reductive to a certain extent. The Mo-U covariation shows that the water body is under strongly restricted conditions. These conditions are not conducive to biological growth and the accumulation of organic matter, causing low ancient productivity. The partial correlation analysis shows: the organic matter enrichment is affected by multiple factors; paleoproductivity, paleosalinity and paleoclimate have greater influence on the results of organic matter enrichment, and detrital input and oxidation conditions can decrease the paleoproductivity, indicating multiple factors are interrelated and interact with each other.

AB  - Many animal signals used for mate choice assessment are condition dependent, but less is known about the condition dependence of other biologically important signals. We asked whether yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventer) alarm calls varied as a function of parasite infection and/or neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios (a measure of immunological challenge). We found that marmots infected with Eimeria, an intestinal parasite, had noisier calls. This is potentially because of an immunostimulating effect of Eimeria infection which may draw energy from nonvital functions. The results suggest calls potentially contain information about parasite status which could be used by receivers to estimate a caller's condition. Future studies are required to determine whether infection influences caller reliability and how receivers respond to alarm calls from parasitized individuals.

AB  - Induction and intensity of insect reproductive activity are related to the action of physical and biological factors in the ecosystem and to modulations resulting from biocenotic, sexual and social stimulation. Studies on the physiology and endocrinology of insect reproduction. therefore, should take into account its ecological conditions.
   More than a decade has elapsed since the first report appeared on the presence of ecdysteroids (moulting hormones) in the ovaries and testes of reproductively competent adult insects, and also in eggs. The physiological significance of these hormones varies. depending on the insect species under investigation. In this study, we present some environmental aspects on ecdysteroid synthesis and ecdysteroid metabolism in the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus DE GEER (Ensifera, Gryllidae), Our results on adult and embryonic ecdysteroids in crickets will be discussed as follows: -  Ecdysteroid titers in female and male adults during the reproductive period. -  Alternative sites for ecdysteroid production and rates of ecdysteroid synthesis throughout the adult life cycle. -  Ecdysone 20-hydroxylation throughout adult life span. -  Inactivation of ingested ecdysteroids (14-dehydroxylation). -  Synthesis and metabolism of ecdysteroids during embryogenesis.

AB  - The status of different response indicators of forest condition were measured and assessed between 1995 and 1997 at 6 Permanent Monitoring Plots (PMPs) in Tuscany (central Italy), where beech, holm oak and Turkey oak are the most frequent tree species. Foliage transparency, leaf damage and crown dieback have changed significantly over the monitoring period. Leaf area, length of the current year shoots, and total leaf area changed as well, but only for Turkey oak. Changes were consistent between and within the plots. Different indices of plant diversity showed marked changes, apparently linked to natural dynamics within individual ecosystems. These rapid and contrasting fluctuations in the various indicators of forest ecosystem make it difficult to derive a synthesis about the general condition of ecosystems and - especially - about the effects of air pollution.

AB  - The purpose of the given research was to carry out complex ecological assessment of vegetables grown in the city of Zhytomyr and in its residential suburb as to the content of nitrates and heavy metals in them. The results of the research showed that on the average from the whole amount of samples selected on the territory of the city the excess nitrate content was found in potatoes, bulb onion, green onion, garden radish and red beet. In the rest of vegetable and fruit samples the excess of the nitrate level was not found. In vegetables grown under the conditions of agroecosystems of suburban settlements the excess nitrate content was fixed in 44.6 % of the samples selected. Most often the excess of the norm was observed in potatoes (75 % of the samples). The comparative analysis of vegetable products grown under different conditions showed that vegetables grown in settlements of the residential suburb were more polluted with nitrates than those grown in urban ecosystems. It has been established that in the selected samples of vegetables grown under the conditions of the city higher content of heavy metals, especially lead and cadmium, is observed. From the total amount of the samples the most dangerous for human consumption proved to be leaf parsley in which the excess of lead, cadmium and zinc level was on the average 5.1, 7.3 and 3.2 times respectively, and the safest vegetable was garden carrot. As a result of the investigations into the content of heavy metals in vegetables grown in the residential suburb, it has been established that absolutely safe for man are garden carrot, red beet, cucumbers, tomatoes and onion in which the level of heavy metals is substantially lower than the maximum permissible one. Lead content in white head cabbage and parsley was fixed at the level of 1.25 and 3.45 mg/kg. Slight increase in cuprum content was found in white head cabbage, and in potatoes the content of zinc exceeding the norm was fixed. It has been proved that crop products grown under the conditions of urban ecosystems contain higher amount of heavy metals as compared with the same crops grown in the residential suburb. When conducting the investigations into the content of nitrates and heavy metals in different vegetable parts we found that distribution of pollutants among organs of plants was first of all determined by their species and biological characteristics of organs themselves.

AB  - This study presents a novel technique for estimation of contamination level as well as flashover voltage of outdoor insulators based on dielectric dissipation factor evaluated from the applied sinusoidal excitation and corresponding surface leakage current. Existing literature shows that surface leakage current of insulator is infested with odd harmonics though the applied voltage is sinusoidal in nature. The presence of harmonic contents in leakage current is due to non-linear characteristics of the insulator surface owing to formation of dry bands. The nonlinear characteristic of the insulator surface depends on its contamination level which in turn affects the corresponding flashover voltage. Therefore, the harmonic configuration in leakage current can be correlated with the contamination level on insulator surface and corresponding flashover voltage. Considering the fact, in this contribution, a non-linear equivalent circuit of insulator has been proposed based on harmonic components of the leakage current. For each harmonic component of the leakage current flowing through the insulator system, energy lost and energy stored in the system is calculated, which eventually enables to calculate dielectric dissipation factor. The proposed technique is applied for experimental investigation on 11 kV disc porcelain insulator artificially contaminated in the laboratory under controlled environmental conditions.

AB  - This article uses normal behavior models to present an integrated approach for condition assessment of wind turbine generator systems. Monitoring parameters selected from the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of wind farms are used to establish an assessment index system. Health degree is defined to quantify indices. A neural network is used to establish normal behavior models for the parameters closely related to the natural environment. Estimation errors of the neural network models follow a normal distribution. Thus, health degrees can be calculated based on the probability density function of normal distribution. For other monitoring parameters, normal behavior models are developed based on the Parzen estimation, a common non-parametric estimation method. Health degrees are calculated based on the fitted probability density functions. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation is employed, and an assessment process is designed. Finally, the proposed method is performed on actual 1.5-MW wind turbine generator system. The results of condition assessment of two cases are compared with those obtained using the traditional method. Results show that the proposed method is more effective in assessing wind turbine generator systems than the traditional method.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are organisms that are recognized as water quality bio-indicators. A wide variety of indices and metrics have been shown to respond to a variety of anthropogenic impacts, usually under a general condition of environmental impairment. The absence of a clear distinction in the relations between specific pollutants and biotic variables is very common and can lead to biased interpretation of biomonitoring. The aims of this research were to test taxonomic and non-taxonomic responses to specific environmental conditions instead to general conditions. For this purpose, we estimated the theoretical toxicity by comparing toxicity values published by EPA with metal concentrations in water and sediments. Then we tested the responses of biological variables to toxicity and other environ mental conditions using the linear mixed effects models approach. We generated 32 models considering 24 different biological metrics and indices that were grouped in five levels. Taxonomic and abundance metrics were best predictor than functional or tolerance-based indexes. The strongest model was that which considered subfamily taxonomic resolution responding to Al_w and Cr_s.

AB  - 1. For truly predictive community ecology, it is essential to understand the interplay between species traits, their environment and their impacts on the composition of plant communities. These interactions are increasingly understood for various environmental drivers, but our understanding of how traits, in general, change during succession is still modest. We hypothesize that (initial) abiotic conditions other than light drive the successional dynamics of other traits. The idea that different initial abiotic conditions lead to different trait trajectories during succession was predicted long ago but has never been tested for traits.
   2. In this study, we compared the successional (decades to centuries) trait trajectories of 19 ecosystem types in low-altitude NW Europe using a database including >4700 plots. We tested which traits (out of a total of 12, including those associated with light competition strategies) show consistent shifts across ecosystems. Additionally, we investigated, through a novel partitioning of trait differences (using partial principal component analyses), whether abiotic factors can explain trait shifts that occur over and above light-induced trait shifts.
   3. We show that canopy height, woodiness, leaf size and seed mass increase, and flowering onset and flowering duration decrease consistently with succession across ecosystems, while leaf economic traits and life span showed a mixed response during succession. Accounting for the effect of height revealed that the initial and prevailing abiotic conditions-particularly soil moisture-co-determine trait shifts during succession. Therefore, different initial starting conditions may lead to different trajectories in trait space, most notably due to the differential response of specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content and life span. For example, SLA decreases in seres that become drier over time (initially very wet), while it increases in seres that become wetter over time (initially very dry).
   4. Synthesis. Our novel approach of partitioning successional trait shifts between the influence of competition for light and other abiotic factors showed that trajectories of ecosystems through trait space can be explained by a combination of the two: a universal response to changing light availability and a specific response depending on initial abiotic conditions.

AB  - Genetically identical individuals of the white form of Metridium senile were kept in the laboratory for 40 months, during almost 2 years of which they were irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation simulating the shape of the solar UV spectrum. The living and experimental conditions were largely matched to the conditions in the sea anemones' natural habitat on the North Sea coast. Controls were shielded from direct radiation or irradiated with only the visible range of the spectrum; for the UV tests, the UV component corresponded either to the conditions in the natural habitat or to twice or 4 times this dose. All experiments were preceded by a several-month settling-in period, and UV irradiation was always begun at a low intensity. Under these conditions UV was not lethal but produced many parameter changes, of which only those that were irreversible for the entire duration of the experiment, from September 1992 to August 1994, are described here. The body mass fell significantly in all three UV-radiation modes. All irradiated animals positioned themselves so as to be less exposed to the radiation, and all changed colour from white to brown. These responses are discussed with reference to the potential of M. senile as an indicator or monitor for UV in the northern European coastal region. Field analyses are currently being conducted to demonstrate the extent to which the present results apply to field conditions.

AB  - The agro-ecosystem model Daisy was used to explore the long-term fate of nitrogen (N) after land application of compost and digestate (based on source separated organic municipal solid waste (MSW)). The cumulative crop N yield response and emissions for mineral fertilizer (MF), anaerobically digested organic waste (MSW-D), and composted organic waste (MSW-C) were derived by fitting a linear mixed model to the outcomes of the simulations. The non-linearity of crop N yield responses and emission responses to increasing N fertilizer application was addressed by dividing these responses into high and low crop response conditions. The crop N yield response and five emission pathways (NO3 (-) leaching to groundwater, NO3 (-) and NH4 (+) loss to surface water, and NH3 and N2O emissions into the atmosphere) were quantified as environmental inventory factors, which were calculated for both high and low response conditions. The crop N yield response cumulated over time from the application of N fertilizer almost levelled out for MF within 3 to 5 years after application, while it increased over a time period of 100 years for MSW-C. In addition, MSW-D showed features of both MF and MSW-C, a steep rise in crop N yield response due to high inorganic N content and a gradual increase thereafter, due to the slow mineralization of organic N. Overall, 52-69 % of N applied as MF was up-taken by plant biomass, while plant uptakes of 15-28 % by MSW-D and 19-29 % by MSW-C were measured under high response conditions. When the N fertilizer application rate exceeded the rate of plant uptake, the rate of N utilization dropped by 80-90 % for MF, albeit to lesser degree for MSW-D and MSW-C. The simulations showed that emissions to the environment from organic fertilizers took place over a longer time and omission of the longs-term effects could result in underestimation of potential impacts to the environment. As well as the time scope of assessment, local conditions were determining the N emissions. For the N2O emission, there were very small differences between high and low response conditions for organic fertilizer. The N2O emission factors varied for 1.8-3.0 % for MSW-D and 1.7-5.1 % for MSW-C. For NO3 (-) leaching to groundwater, there were large differences between high and low response conditions. For high response conditions, the emission factors varied from 6 to 39, 17 to 68, and 9 to 59 of input N from the application of MF, MSW-D, and MSW-C, respectively. Under low response conditions, much higher leaching emission factors were estimated ranging from 21 to 61 % for MF, 20 to 73 % for MSW-D, and 11 to 66 % for MSW-C.

AB  - Urban territories are marked by a high level of environmental pollution. A comprehensive analysis of pollution sources and pollutant spreading, determined by the natural conditions of the territory and the urban infrastructure, is needed to assess the environmental situation of the city. This approach regards the urban environmental situation as a dynamic medium, changing in time and space. This study aims to substantiate the approach to the integrated ecological status assessment of urban territories, based on geoinformation analysis and 3D cartographic modeling of pollutant distribution in the urban environment. The paper proposes the principles of integrated environmental assessment, including analysis of both the degree of pollution and the processes of pollutant distribution. The experimental analysis of the ecological status was performed in Novosibirsk, Russia. A digital terrain model, a digital model of terrain features that have an adverse impact on the environmental situation, and an environmental database were created. The city was zoned based on the composite indicator of the hazard level. Pollutant fluxes from the anthropogenic objects, posing environmental hazard, was 3D-modeled.

AB  - As demands on aquatic resources increase, there is a growing need to monitor and assess their condition. This paper reviews a variety of aquatic environmental assessments, at local, national. international and global scales and finds confusion in the terminology used to describe assessments. In particular the terms 'ecosystem' and 'integrated' are often misused resulting in lack of clarity. Therefore, definitions of some assessment terminology are suggested, consolidating existing proposals and simplifying future applications. A conclusion from the review is that a new classification system is required. The categorisation system proposed builds on preliminary work of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Assessment classification is based on the environmental components considered, methodologies and nature of the linkages between components, and the inclusion or exclusion of socio-economic factors. The assessment terminology and categorisation system provided could in future simplify the way that assessments are defined and used to inform development of management strategies.

AB  - Disturbances affecting flow and sediment transport regimes (e.g. dams, diversions, gravel mining, weirs, bank reinforcements, climate changes) can promote riverbed degradation and channel narrowing, and thus influence vegetation dynamics and composition. This study investigates the relationships and feedbacks between channel adjustments and riparian vegetation dynamics by combining an analysis of morphological channel changes with a wider phytosociology analysis of existing vegetation within the river corridor. These relationships were illustrated by using the case study of the Panaro River (located in the Northern Apennines, Italy), being a representative case of a deeply incised and narrowed river. More specifically we analyzed: (1) the relations between landforms and distributional patterns of vegetation types and characteristic plant species (index species): these provided information about the hydrogeomorphic condition of fluvial landforms and about channel adjustments; (2) the distance of riparian vegetation conditions from expected conditions as a consequence of human impact, based on the fact that each species and vegetation type has a given tolerance for specific disturbance regimes or stresses. Although some expected relations between landforms and vegetation types were found, we recorded significant deviations from the typical correlation pattern existing between morphology and vegetation, and this could be used to infer the intensity and the typology of human disturbances. In particular, the index species can indicate present ecological conditions and on past channel evolution. With this knowledge it might be possible to develop botanical recovery models in the future and, even more importantly, enable the recognition of the differences between temporal and spatial diversity.

AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region of the northern Great Plains is an important region for waterfowl production because of the abundance of shallow wetlands. The ecological significance of the region and impacts from intensive agriculture prompted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to select it as one of the first areas for developing and evaluating ecological indicators of wetland condition. We examined hypothesized relations between indicators of landscape and wetland conditions and waterfowl abundance on 45 40 km(2) study sites in North Dakota for 1995-1996. Landscape condition was defined a priori as the ratio of cropland area to total upland area surrounding wetlands. Measures of waterfowl abundance included estimated numbers of breeding pairs (by species and total numbers) and gamma, a species-specific correction factor which effectively adjusts breeding pair estimates for annual or area-related differences in pond size. Landscape indicators and waterfowl measures varied among regions. Results indicated that most areas in the Coteau region are of much higher quality for ducks than those in the Drift Plain, and areas in the Red River Valley are of the poorest quality for ducks. Regression models demonstrated the impact of agricultural development on breeding duck populations in the Prairie Pothole Region. The most consistent landscape indicators of waterfowl abundance were percent of cropland and grassland. Models were inconsistent among years and species. The potential biotic indicators of landscape and wetland condition examined here would be appropriate for temporal trend analyses, but because of inherent geographic variability would not be appropriate for single-year geographic trend analyses without more extensive evaluations to improve explanatory models.

AB  - In smart interactive environments, such as digital museums or digital exhibition halls, it is important to accurately understand the user's intent to ensure successful and natural interaction with the exhibition. In the context of predicting user intent, gaze estimation technology has been considered one of the most effective indicators among recently developed interaction techniques (e.g., face orientation estimation, body tracking, and gesture recognition). Previous gaze estimation techniques, however, are known to be effective only in a controlled lab environment under normal lighting conditions. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to achieve a successful gaze estimation under various low-light conditions, which is anticipated to be more practical for smart interaction scenarios. The proposed approach utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance users' eye images captured under low-light conditions, thereby restoring missing information for gaze estimation. Afterward, the GAN-recovered images are fed into the convolutional neural network architecture as input data to estimate the direction of the user gaze. Our experimental results on the modified MPIIGaze dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an average performance improvement of 4.53%-8.9% under low and dark light conditions, which is a promising step toward further research.

AB  - Bacillus cereus, a food poisoning bacterium closely related to Bacillus anthracis, secretes a multitude of virulence factors including enterotoxins, hemolysins, and phospholipases. However, the majority of the in vitro experiments evaluating the cytotoxic potential of B. cereus were carried out in the conditions of aeration, and the impact of the oxygen limitation in conditions encountered by the microbe in natural environment such as gastrointestinal tract remains poorly understood. This research reports comparative analysis of ATCC strains 11778 (BC1) and 14579 (BC2) in aerobic and microaerobic (static) cultures with regard to their toxicity for human lung epithelial cells. We showed that BC1 increased its toxicity upon oxygen limitation while BC2 was highly cytotoxic in both growth conditions. The combined effect of the pore -forming, cholesterol dependent hemolysin, cereolysin O (CLO), and metabolic product(s) such as succinate produced in microaerobic conditions provided substantial contribution to the toxicity of BC1 but not BC2 which relied mainly on other toxins. This mechanism is shared between CB1 and B. anthracis. It involves the permeabilization of the cell membrane which facilitates transport of toxic bacterial metabolites into the cell. The toxicity of BC1 was potentiated in the presence of bovine serum albumin which appeared to serve as reservoir for bacteria-derived nitric oxide participating in the downstream production of reactive oxidizing species with the properties of peroxynitrite. In agreement with this the BC1 cultures demonstrated the increased oxidation of the indicator dye Amplex Red catalyzed by peroxidase as well as the increased toxicity in the presence of externally added ascorbic acid.

AB  - Perhaps the most pressing issue in predicting biotic responses to present and future global change is understanding how environmental factors shape the relationship between ecological traits and extinction risk. The fossil record provides millions of years of insight into how extinction selectivity (i.e., differential extinction risk) is shaped by interactions between ecological traits and environmental conditions. Numerous paleontological studies have examined trait-based extinction selectivity; however, the extent to which these patterns are shaped by environmental conditions is poorly understood due to a lack of quantitative synthesis across studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies on fossil marine bivalves and gastropods that span 458 million years to uncover how global environmental and geochemical changes covary with trait-based extinction selectivity. We focused on geographic range size and life habit (i.e., infaunal vs. epifaunal), two of the most important and commonly examined predictors of extinction selectivity. We used geochemical proxies related to global climate, as well as indicators of ocean acidification, to infer average global environmental conditions. Life-habit selectivity is weakly dependent on environmental conditions, with infaunal species relatively buffered from extinction during warmer climate states. In contrast, the odds of taxa with broad geographic ranges surviving an extinction (>2500km for genera, >500km for species) are on average three times greater than narrow-ranging taxa (estimate of odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval=2.3-3.5), regardless of the prevailing global environmental conditions. The environmental independence of geographic range size extinction selectivity emphasizes the critical role of geographic range size in setting conservation priorities.

AB  - The fecal indicator bacterial species Escherichia coli is an important measure of water quality and a leading cause of impaired surface waters. We investigated the impact of the filter-feeding metazooplankton Daphnia magna on the inactivation of E. coli. The E. coli clearance rates of these daphnids were calculated from a series of batch experiments conducted under variable environmental conditions. Batch system experiments of 24 to 48 h in duration were completed to test the impacts of bacterial concentration, organism density, temperature, and water type. The maximum clearance rate for adult D. magna organisms was 2 ml h(-1) organism(-1). Less than 5% of E. coli removed from water by daphnids was recoverable from excretions. Sorption of E. coli on daphnid carapaces was not observed. As a comparison, the clearance rates of the freshwater rotifer Branchionus calyciflorus were also calculated for select conditions. The maximum clearance rate for B. calyciflorus was 6 x 10(-4) ml h(-1) organism(-1). This research furthers our understanding of the impacts of metazooplankton predation on E. coli inactivation and the effects of environmental variables on filter feeding. Based on our results, metazooplankton can play an important role in the reduction of E. coli in natural treatment systems under environmentally relevant conditions.
   IMPORTANCE Escherichia coli is a fecal indicator bacterial species monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess microbial water quality. Due to the potential human health implications linked to high levels of E. coil, it is important to understand the inactivation or reduction mechanisms in surface waters. Our research examines the capacities of two types of widespread filter-feeding freshwater metazooplankton, Daphnia magna and Brachionus calyciflorus, to reduce E. coil concentrations. We examine the impacts of different environmentally relevant conditions on the clearance rates. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the importance of metazooplankton in controlling E. coli concentrations and what conditions will reduce or increase grazing. These results provide baseline data to support future efforts to develop a quantitative model relating zooplankton uptake rates to relevant environmental variables.

AB  - Riverine input is essential for the sustainability of the estuaries, wetlands, and swamps into which they flow. An existing coastal ecosystem model was used with forested wetland and fish habitat indicators to evaluate current environmental conditions as well as future restoration projects via 50-year simulations of riverine flow with sea level rise and subsidence. The objective of this study was to utilize the Integrated Compartment Model developed for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's 2017 Coastal Master Plan to understand how alternations of riverine flow from existing rivers and future restoration projects may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland habitats and suitability of fish habitats. The model was applied to the Lake Maurepas ecosystem where the Amite River flows into the lake and supports vital fisheries for surrounding communities, as well as a unique and valuable recreational resource. Additionally, the Amite River nourishes the marshes and swamps around Lake Maurepas that are essential for storm surge protection for the broader region. Modeling results suggest that the major contributing factor to the freshwater conditions to the Lake Maurepas area is the challenge of relative sea level rise the combination of rising seas and subsidence. Fresh forested areas comprised of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica) in Maurepas Swamp decrease significantly under all future climate and relative sea level rise simulations except when future restoration projects are utilized. An estimated 1000 km(2) of fresh forested wetland could be maintained over a 50-year period when considering certain restoration projects that increase freshwater flow and under climate change-related rainfall patterns, sea level rise and subsidence. However, modeled results indicate that more than 100% of the current riverine flows into the Maurepas Swamp region are still not sufficient to fully counteract the impacts of the assumed future sea level rise scenario and maintain the current forested wetlands surrounding Lake Maurepas. The higher salinities and more estuarine open water areas provide additional habitat in the future that will likely be more suitable for spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and adult bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilh) than largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Modeled future conditions of this ecosystem can inform restoration agencies and organizations by helping to prioritize and plan for future decades by incorporating critical factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and precipitation patterns, including the possible need to plan and prepare for changes in the fish communities and consider how that might influence the well-being of local communities.

AB  - Introduction - Behavior is one of the most important indicators for assessing cattle health and welfare. The cow comfort improves economically important responses in dairy cattle such as feed intake, milk production, reproduction and health. The environmental variation in air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were recognized as the potential hazards which affect the animal's biological system.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental conditions (ambient temperature, relative humidity and temperature-humidity index) on the total locomotor activity (TLA) behavior in dairy cows.
   Materials and methods - 18 Modicana cows (5-8 years, mean body weight 512+/-78 kg), selected from two different farms (A and B), were enrolled in the study. During experimental period, ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded by means of a data logger and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated as indicator of thermal comfort for cattle. Each animals were equipped with an activity monitoring data loggers (Actiwatch-Mini(R)) in order to record the daily TLA.
   Results and discussion - The results of the present study confirmed that the TLA is influenced by environmental conditions. The ambient temperature and THI recorded during the experimental periods were within the upper critical zone. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) a significant effect of season (P < 0.0001), whereas no effect of farm on the amount of TLA was found. A trigonometric statistical model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level, amplitude, acrophase and robustness of rhythm. Our results showed a circadian rhythm of daily TLA in all periods, with different percentages of robustness, and acrophase in the photophase.
   Conclusions - These results provide insight into the TLA responses of dairy cow to different environmental conditions, allowing to better evaluate its ability to adapt and cope with environmental stress. Major changes in TLA were found at the hottest environmental condition therefore suitable measures should be adopted in order to minimize environmental stress and to improve animal welfare.

AB  - Understanding how environmental conditions influence productivity of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) requires identifying relationships between ocean-driven processes and early marine growth and survival. We studied size, condition, and abundance of juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) captured in July in Icy Strait, Alaska over 17 years (1997 - 2013). We investigated relationships between these juvenile chum salmon characteristics and a suite of marine variables expressed at basin-wide, regional, and local scales using correlation and multivariate analyses. Juvenile chum salmon tended to be longer in years with warmer sea-surface temperatures in spring and summer. Average energy density was higher in years when variables such as local winds and mixed-layer depth indicated enhanced water-column mixing in June and July. Marine factors at the regional scale, specifically freshwater discharge and upwelling, were associated with the abundance of juvenile chum salmon. Catch per unit effort of juvenile chum salmon was higher in years with greater freshwater discharge and more intense downwelling in the prior winter, suggestive of mechanisms increasing recruitment of juvenile chum salmon through enhanced primary productivity and possibly reduced predation risk. Overall, our study supported previous work suggesting that a strong Aleutian Low indicates good conditions for salmon recruitment in the Gulf of Alaska, although we found that local conditions explained more variation in juvenile chum salmon responses than did basin-scale climate indicators. Furthermore, our work revealed a compelling role for freshwater discharge in driving ecological mechanisms that influence the growth and survival of juvenile salmon in the nearshore marine waters of Southeast Alaska.

AB  - The zooplankton fauna and the relationship with their environmental variables were investigated on the epilimnion layer of the seven reservoirs (Demirdoven, Devegecidi, Menzelet, Sir, Omerli, Porsuk, Tahtali) of different regions (Marmara, Aegean, Mediterranean, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia) throughout the summer months (2015) in Turkey. According to the trophic conditions reservoirs varied between oligo-and eutrophic status. Chlorophylla concentration, measured for the estimation of primary production, was determined considerably high along the investigation period. A total of 62 zooplankton species were identified with the contribution of 44 rotifers, nine cladocerans and nine copepods. Except one reservoir, all of the others were dominated by rotifera group, and also in each study site dominant taxa were changed at species level. On the other hand common dominant taxa for all reservoirs was the rotifer Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943 with 95 % frequency. In terms of zooplankton species, most of the studied reservoirs showed less than 50% similarities, due to their different limnological conditions and different geographic locations. Reservoirs in high trophic conditions in the present study were represented by low species diversity. Water quality in the reservoirs with respect to biological data were determined as beta-mesosaprobic. The using limnological and biological indices to determine water quality were consistent. Densities of main zooplankton groups, and also frequent species of the reservoirs correlated with epilimnion layer depths and total phoshorus concentrations significantly. On the other hand rotifera variation was affected mainly by physical variables (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity), and crustacean variations were related with total phoshorus. The comperative assessment between limnological variables and zooplankton community in this reservoirs was studied for the first time.

AB  - Background and purpose: Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and behavior. Plants displaying allometric relationships between certain traits across different environments should have higher relative fitness then plants lacking these allometric relationships. We hypothesized that there are differences in external morphology between Plantago major L. (ssp. major) leaves exposed to different environmental conditions with variations for the leaf characters analysed.
   Materials and methods: Seven, linear dimensions on each leaf leaf blade apical width (AW), leaf-blade length (LL), leaf size (LS), leaf width (LW), leaf shape (LW/LL), the distance from the midrib to the neighboring vein (MV) and vein distances within a leaf (VD) were analysed. Here, besides analyzing allometric relationships between the common plantain leaves exposed to different environmental conditions, morphological data were also used for a regression analysis and for a cluster analysis.
   Results: In the reference area (Vinci village) leaves have significantly longer LL and they are significantly broader compared with leaves from polluted site (Pancevo). At both sites, LL decreased relatively to LS (i.e. negative allometry is character specific). This study also revealed that VD and LW/LL are developmentally and functionally integrated P. major leaf characters. Moreover, VD is under more selective pressure to adapt to current environmental conditions than LW/LL.
   Conclusions: Obtained data showed that leaf size is significantly related to both, developmental and environmental conditions. This indicates that plant species such as Plantago major L. (ssp. major) should be considered as reliable bioindicators in environmental quality monitoring studies.

AB  - The region of Coquimbo has the highest percentage of goats (Capra hircus) in Chile and is severely affected by droughts. This can lead to environmental challenges such as limited water and forage availability when goats are kept in natural grasslands. The objective of this study was to assess the welfare of dairy goats in semi-intensive production systems under drought conditions. The study was carried out in La Serena city, region of Coquimbo, Chile and 22 semi-intensive dairy goat farms were assessed using the Animal Welfare Indicators protocol. In each evaluation, the following indicators and information were gathered: physical and behavioural indi-cators of animal welfare, farmers' sociodemographic information, farm facilities, husbandry practices and management of the farm, and farmers' perception of animal welfare. Of the goats evaluated (n = 446), the vast majority had a body condition score (BCS) considered normal (n = 349; 78.25%). The main welfare problems were poor hair condition, faecal soiling, overgrown claws and improper disbudding or dehorning. The majority of farmers (96%) considered it 'rather important' or 'very important' to handle their goats in a gentle manner, expressing concern about the welfare of their animals and considering pain as a negative experience for goats. A lower than expected percentage of very thin animals (low BCS) were seen, considering the drought conditions and the forage shortage that affects the region, and no animals were observed with signs of thermal stress. The semi-intensive production systems could be an alternative to pasture-based systems to overcome environmental challenges.

AB  - Two bottom trawl surveys of fish were undertaken during the seasonal sea ice retreat in 2006 and 2007 in the northern Bering Sea. For each trawl, we calculated catch per unit area (CPUA) for all fish taxa. Arctic cod Boreogadus saida, Bering flounder Hippoglossoides robustus and snailfish (Liparidae) were the dominant species south of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), whereas Arctic alligatorfish Ulcina olrikli, Arctic staghorn sculpin Gymnocanthus tricuspis and shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius were the dominant fishes north of SLI. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to investigate relationships between environmental conditions and fish community structure in the northern Bering Sea. One goal of the study was to assess the importance of environmental variables on groundfish assemblages. The results showed that sediment grain size (an indicator of current speed) was the most important environmental factor explaining fish community structure in both years of the study. Bottom water nutrients (nitrate + nitrite), bottom water chlorophyll a (ch1 a) (with similar results for total ch1 a in the water column), sediment grain size, and sediment C/N ratios had stronger relationships with fish distribution in 2006 (cold, pre-bloom conditions), whereas bottom water temperature and sediment grain size were more important in 2007 (warm, bloom conditions) among a total of 14 environmental variables that were analyzed. These findings indicate strong linkages between physical conditions (e.g. water temperature and hydrography as it affects sediment grain size) and biological conditions (e.g. bloom status) in structuring fish communities in the northern Bering Sea.

AB  - Environmentalists have argued that ecological degradation will lead to declines in the well-being of people dependent on ecosystem services. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment paradoxically found that human well-being has increased despite large global declines in most ecosystem services. We assess four explanations of these divergent trends: (1) We have measured well-being incorrectly; (2) well-being is dependent on food services, which are increasing, and not on other services that are declining; (3) technology has decoupled well-being from nature; (4) time lags may lead to future declines in well-being. Our findings discount the first hypothesis, but elements of the remaining three appear plausible. Although ecologists have convincingly documented ecological decline, science does not adequately understand the implications of this decline for human well-being. Untangling how human well-being has increased as ecosystem conditions decline is critical to guiding future management of ecosystem services; we propose four research areas to help achieve this goal.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims at finding the environmental impacts generated by an electric disk insulator supply chain, used for the distribution of electricity by an open wire system, through a case study. This study also aims at benchmarking the environmental impacts of an electric insulator manufacturing process by taking ideal condition of zero waste as reference.MethodsCradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out by following the guidelines provided in ISO 14040 series standards and using Umberto NXT software. ReCiPe endpoint and ReCiPe midpoint impact assessment methodologies have been used to calculate environmental impacts under various categories. The primary data has been collected from a medium-scale manufacturer of electric disk insulators located at Bikaner in north-west India. The secondary data has been taken from ecoinvent 3.0 database and literature. The environmental impacts using endpoint assessment (ecosystem quality, human health, and resources) and midpoint assessment (climate change, fossil depletion, human toxicity, metal depletion, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, and water depletion) categories have been computed. Finally, the results are compared and benchmarked against the ideal zero waste condition using three different production scenarios. The limitation of this study is that the data has been collected only from one manufacturer and its supply chain.Results and discussionIt has been found that the use of steel, electricity, and fuel; transportation of product; and disposal of water generate high environmental impacts in the supply chain. It has also been found that in the electric disk insulator supply chain, the raw material extraction phase has the highest environmental impacts followed by manufacturing, disposal, transportation, and installation phases. This study has also found that benchmark scenario B (zero waste condition) is environmentally more efficient in comparison to scenario A (actual recycling condition) and scenario C (maximum waste condition).ConclusionsThis study has identified that raw materials, resources, and processes in the supply chain of an electric disk insulator manufacturing unit are responsible for the environmental damage. The various manufacturing processes and installation of the electric disk insulators are similar for all manufacturers except the machinery efficiency and the generated waste. This study provides environmental impacts associated with an electric disk insulator manufacturing process under zero waste or ideal conditions (scenario B). These results are used as a benchmark to compare environmental performance of electric disk insulator supply chain operating under actual conditions.

AB  - Ozone (O-3) critical levels have been established under the Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention to assess the risk of O-3 effects in European vegetation. A recent review study has led to the development of O-3 critical levels for annual Mediterranean pasture species using plants growing in well-watered pots at a coastal site and under low levels of competition. However, uncertainties remain in the extrapolation of the O-3 sensitivity of these species under natural conditions. The response of two O-3-sensitive annual Mediterranean pasture Trifolium species at the coastal site was compared with the response of the same species growing at a continental site, in natural soil and subject to water-stress and inter-specific competition, representing more closely their natural habitat. The slopes of exposure-and dose response relationships derived for the two sites showed differences in the response to O-3 between sites attributed to differences in environmental growing conditions, growing medium and the level of inter-specific competition, but the effect of the individual factors could not be assessed separately. Dose based O3 indices partially explained differences due to environmental growing conditions between sites. The slopes showed that plants were more sensitive to O-3 at the continental site, but homogeneity of slopes tests revealed that results from both experimental sites may be combined. Although more experimental data considering complex inter-specific competition situations and the effect of important interactive factors such as nitrogen would be needed, these results confirm the validity of applying the current flux-based O-3 critical level under close to natural growing conditions. The AOT40 based O-3 critical level derived at the coastal site was also considered a suitable risk indicator in close to natural growing conditions in the absence of soil moisture limitations on plant growth.

AB  - This work aims to assess the trematode parasites infecting the edible cockle Cerastoderma edule, collected in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, one of the most relevant biodiversity hotspots of the Western Iberia, and evaluate the relationship between the observed patterns and environmental descriptors. A total of 11 of the 16 trematode species known to infect C. edule were identified, including Himasthla continua and Psilostomum brevicolle as new occurrences in this lagoon. Parvatrema minutum was the most abundant and dominant species. Species richness and prevalence were high. The relationship between trematode species abundance, intensity and prevalence, and also environmental variables, showed that most parasites preferred muddy sand areas with euhaline conditions in opposition to areas with contamination and/or distant from the lagoon entrance. This study highlighted the good ecological status of the ecosystem and the transitional biogeographic characteristics of the western Portuguese coast where northern and subtropical faunas can coexist.

AB  - Ecological indicators have become important tools for assessment and monitoring of natural resources, being the understanding of the relationship between antropic activities and the environmental response essential for their structuring. Although the development of potential indicators may prove sensitive to many variables, they must demonstrate their ability to take the surrounding conditions, from those relatively preserved to those highly disturbed. Based on this premise, the development of the Hydrossedimentological DisturbanceIndex (HSDI) for environmental assessment at watersheds in Minas Gerais state, emerges as a potential tool to support decisions which should be focused on the improvement of natural resources management. A HSDI proposal was developed from the hydrological, climate and water quality database available in Minas Gerais state, highlighting sediment transport (ST), hydrological stress (HS), groundwater recharge (Rec) and current soil erosion potential (SEP), working with a robust tool for determining the weights of factors with appropriate scientific background and subsequent development of map for analyzing its distribution, having Paraopeba river watershed as study case.

AB  - The health of Eucalyptus gomphocephala is declining within its natural range in south-western Australia. In a pilot study to assess whether changes in mycorrhizal fungi and soil chemistry might be associated with E. gomphocephala decline, we set up a containerized bioassay experiment with E. gomphocephala as the trap plant using intact soil cores collected from 12 sites with E. gomphocephala canopy condition ranging from healthy to declining. Adjacent soil samples were collected for chemical analysis. The type of mycorrhiza (arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal) formed in containerized seedlings predicted the canopy condition of E. gomphocephala at the sites where the cores were taken. Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization was higher in seedling roots in soil taken from sites with healthy canopies, whereas colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dominated in roots in soil taken from sites with declining canopies. Furthermore, several soil chemical properties predicted canopy condition and the type of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots. These preliminary findings suggest that large-scale studies should be undertaken in the field to quantify those ectomycorrhiza (ECM) fungi sensitive to E. gomphocephala canopy decline and whether particular ECM fungi are bioindicators of ecosystem health.

AB  - A methodology of ecological risk assessment for the terrestrial ecosystem under chronic radioactive pollution of a biotope near a regional radioactive waste storage has been developed in terms of the critical environmental loads analyzed. It consists of five stages: determination of effect indicators and assessment of their values; establishment of reference species and indices; assessment and analysis of critical loads by plotting "dose-effect" dependencies; ecological risk assessment from critical loads versus permissible values; plotting of risk functions to calculate the expected adverse alterations in the ecosystem. Based on the results obtained the storage risk for a terrestrial ecosystem is considered to be inadmissible and this implies unstable conditions in the territory in the nearest future. The calculations and mapping have shown that in the territory studied the area with excess critical loads is 48% for CFU and 61% for Sr-90 accumulation coefficient. The analyzed risk functions give evidence of highly probable negative alterations in the tested ecosystem: 85% for CFU and 99% for Sr-90 accumulation coefficient.

AB  - 1. Development in organisms can vary in response to fluctuating environments. In holometabolous insects, variation in adult phenotypic traits is strongly influenced by growth conditions experienced by larvae. The main aim of this study was to assess how much environmental insight can be gained from analysis of the phenotypic changes in an insect's life history parameters in response to realistic food limitations.
   2. This investigation was motivated by a need for more information about the developmental requirements of the endangered pine hoverfly Blera fallax (Linnaeus) (Diptera, Syrphidae) in Scotland. Blera fallax depends on a scarce and often ephemeral habitat, rot holes of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. stumps. We studied how rearing conditions affected growth in captive larvae, and compared these responses with a wild population.
   3. The growth curve observed in the field was similar to that in resource-limited, lab conditions, suggesting that resources are limiting in nature. The effects of resource availability on development time and body size depended on sex. Adult females were larger but had more variable size at maturity compared with males. In contrast, males typically were not smaller in resource-limited conditions, but rather continued to develop for another year. Between 2% and 20% of larvae extended development over 2 years regardless of growth conditions, perhaps indicating a semivoltine strategy to circumvent extinction during years with a low breeding success.
   4. These results identify life history traits that may be important for other saproxylic Diptera in rot holes, and organisms that experience food restrictions during growth.

AB  - Vembanad wetland ecosystem - the largest Ramsar site on the South West Coast of India, located in the most populous coastal segments of Kerala, serves as the rice bowl of the state that forms a major hotspot of biological diversity. Alterations in natural hydrologic regime of Vembanad wetland started with the commissioning of Thanneermukkom barrage (TMB) across the backwater system in 1976, to prevent saline water intrusion, which adversely affected the eco-biology of the water body. The study was conducted during March 2011 to February 2012 on a monthly basis to evaluate the eco-hydrological status of this multifunctional ecosystem. Reclamation of estuarine areas for agriculture and other interventions has led to drastic decline in water holding capacity (2.4 to 0.6 km(3)) and depth (av. 4.02 m) of the estuary over the years. Water quality on an average reflects a neutral (7.11) and well oxygenated (7.4 mg L-1) nature; the salinity varying from 0.01 to 31.8 ppt. TMB plays a crucial role in influencing the salinity pattern of Vembanad wetland; with an oligohaline (0.5-5 ppt) in southern whereas meso and polyhaline (5-18 ppt) condition prevailing in northern stations. The estuary is nutrient rich with nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus ranging between 0.05-5.9 mu mol L-1 and 0.18-6.49 mu mol L-1 respectively. Trophic index (TRIX value 6.39 +/- 0.75) indicated an impacted water quality condition leading to an accelerated eutrophication in the system. Bacillariophyceae (83.55%), Chlorophyceae (8.98%), Cyanophyceae (6.92%) and Zygnemophyceae (0.55%) were the major phytoplankton. Zooplankton community was composed of calanoids (63%), rotifers (22.5%), copepodites (2%), amphipoda (2%), crustacean naupli (1.5%) and cladocerans (1.2%) showing a declining trend in post barrage phase. Benthic polychaetes like Spionidae and Capitellidae were opportunistic bio-indicators of organic enrichment. Decline in fishery diversity and production (4387.31 t), reflects considerable ecological impacts on lower trophic levels. Thus the study presents an over view on a degrading coastal wetland system of India and signifies the need for enhanced restoration programmes for long term management and conservation objectives.

AB  - The reactions and behaviours of the nematode fauna in an acid mull of a deciduous forest (State Forest of Orleans, France) have been monitored for four years in the course of an experimental deprivation and doubling of annual litter supplies as well as of a deprivation of litter and rain-leaching arrivals. The deprivation of litter rapidly entails, from the year following the withholding, a regression in the density of the populations, firstly at surface (0-3 cm) then at depth (- 3-10 cm), as well as a modification in the intensity of the two seasonal activity peaks. In contrast to the other trophic groups, the density of the plant feeder nematodes increases during the two years after the litter withholding. Furthermore, a different behaviour in the animal activity at the surface and at depth occurs. As part of the two-fold litter supply, in addition to a decrease of the density of the nematode fauna, we have observed an enhancement of the dominance of fungal feeder nematodes compared to bacterial feeder nematodes, a particular trend of the level (- 1-3 cm) that behaves, in the beginning of the experiment, as a surface level (0-1 cm) then evolves like a depth level (- 3-6 cm and - 6-10 cm), thus emphasizing the surface-depth imbalance in the vertical animal distribution. Also we have pointed out an increase of the density of Cephalobidae and Plectidae contrarily to the other bacterial feeder nematodes. The experiment of litter and rain-leaching arrival deprivation has allowed us to give some elements of comparison in situ on the nematode resistance to a deficient soil hydric regime but also on the aptitude and rapidity of some species to react when the environmental conditions become favourable again; then the ecological significance of the behaviour of the colonizing bacterial feeder species is discussed. Referring to a previous experiment of litter supply withholding and literature data (clear-cutting soil acidification, nematode behaviour in desert soils) the authors draw attention to the role of the litter and the underground vegetative system on the maintenance of the biological activity and on the organization of the nematode populations. Furthermore the role of these animals as potential indicators of the environmental conditions is emphasized.

AB  - Protocols have been proposed for rapid generation turnover of temperate legumes under conditions optimized for day-length, temperature, and light spectra. These conditions act to compress time to flowering and seed development across genotypes. In pea, we have previously demonstrated that embryos do not efficiently germinate without exogenous hormones until physiological maturity is reached at 18 days after pollination (DAP). Sugar metabolism and moisture content have been implicated in the modulation of embryo maturity. However, the role of hormones in regulating seed development is poorly described in legumes. To address this gap, we characterized hormonal profiles (IAA, chlorinated auxin [4-Cl-IAA], GA(20), GA(1), and abscisic acid [ABA]) of developing seeds (10-22 DAP) from diverse pea genotypes grown under intensive conditions optimized for rapid generation turnover and compared them to profiles of equivalent samples from glasshouse conditions. Growing plants under intensive conditions altered the seed hormone content by advancing the auxin, gibberellins (GAs) and ABA profiles by 4 to 8 days, compared with the glasshouse control. Additionally, we observed a synchronization of the auxin profiles across genotypes. Under intensive conditions, auxin peaks were observed at 10 to 12 DAP and GA20 peaks at 10 to 16 DAP, indicative of the end of embryo morphogenesis and initiation of seed desiccation. GA(1) was detected only in seeds harvested in the glasshouse. These results were associated with an acceleration of embryo physiological maturity by up to 4 days in the intensive environment. We propose auxin and GA profiles as reliable indicators of seed maturation. The biological relevance of these hormonal fluctuations to the attainment of physiological maturity, in particular the role of ABA and GA, was investigated through the study of precocious in vitro germination of seeds 12 to 22 DAP, with and without exogenous hormones. The extent of sensitivity of developing seeds to exogenous ABA was strongly genotype-dependent. Concentrations between 5 and 10 mu M inhibited germination of seeds 18 DAP. Germination of seeds 12 DAP was enhanced 2.5- to 3-fold with the addition of 125 mu M GA(3). This study provides further insights into the hormonal regulation of seed development and in vitro precocious germination in legumes and contributes to the design of efficient and reproducible biotechnological tools for rapid genetic gain.

AB  - Dung beetles were used as an indicator group to identify whether oases play an important role as a refuge for biodiversity under harsh environmental conditions inMediterranean ecosystems. Here, we provide a comparative framework for analysing seasonal changes in species composition, abundance and diversity in two local dung beetle assemblages trapped at two contrasted habitats. Using pitfall traps, we collected 3585 dung beetle specimens representing two subfamilies, 15 genera and 28 species (11 Aphodiinae and 17 Scarabaeinae). We trapped 24 and 10 species in humid pasture and oases habitats, respectively. Aphodiinae was more abundant in humid habitats, while Scarabaeinae dominated in oases. Abundance of the six common species was higher in oases than in humid pastures. Multivariate analyses showed that there were two different faunas functioning differently. The humid pastures assemblage showed net temporal segregation with high alpha and beta (temporal turnover) diversities, which may be the result of a well-established community adapted to local climatic conditions. Furthermore, the contrast generated by the oases in the desert environment has allowed for widely distributed and some non-desert-adapted species to be more abundant. The harsh conditions of the desert environment have led to the development of an impoverished fauna with lower temporal heterogeneity (low temporal beta diversity). Evenness, core species and groups were lower under oases conditions than compared with humid habitats. This study demonstrates that humid pastures in Tunisia have richer dung beetle assemblages than oases, but with comparison to surrounded area, oases may represent a refuge for some species and an important conservation area for dung beetles living in harsh conditions in desert environments.

AB  - While there is huge promise in monitoring physiological parameters in free-living organisms, we also find high amounts of variability over time and space. This variation requires us to capitalize on long-term physiological monitoring to adequately address questions of population health, conservation status, or evolutionary trends as long-term sampling can examine ecoimmunological and endocrine interactions in wild populations while accounting for the variation that often makes ecophysiological field studies difficult to compare. In this study, we tested how immune efficacy and endocrinology interact while accounting for ecological context and environmental conditions in two snake species. Specifically, we measured bacterial killing ability, steroid hormones, and morphological characteristics in multiple populations of the Western Terrestrial Gartersnake (Thamnophis elegans) and Common Gartersnake (T. sirtalis) for multiple seasons over 6 years. Leveraging this long-term dataset, we tested how a broad immune measure and endocrine endpoints interact while accounting for individual traits, sampling date, and environmental conditions. Across both species, we found bacterial killing ability to be directly related to corticosterone (CORT) and temperature and greater overall in the spring compared to the fall. We found CORT and testosterone yielded relationships with individual sex, sampling temperature, and time of year. Wild populations can exhibit high amounts of variation in commonly collected physiological endpoints, highlighting the complexity and difficulty inherent in interpreting single endpoints without taking ecological and environmental conditions into account. Our study emphasizes the importance of reporting the environmental conditions under which the sampling occurred to allow for better contextualization and comparison between studies.

AB  - The effects of air pollutants on forests around the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland were studied by measurement of the sulphur and calcium content of pine needles and evaluation of the ecological conditions of pine forests. Several parameters for pine trees and their needles were chosen as well as the species composition and condition of epiphytic lichens. Very high pine needle S- and Ca-contents were measured in the vicinity of the Narva and Slantsy plants. In this region both the acid and basic pollutant load is massive, partly neutralizing each other. It is suggested that the total load will, sooner or later, cause unexpected environmental damage. Wide 'lichen desert' areas were detected around Narva and Slantsy. Near the margins of these areas extraordinary epiphytes on pines were observed namely Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th.Fr. and red-coloured green alga Trentepohlia umbrina. They are regarded as indicators of alkaline pollution. The lowest pine needle S- and Ca-contents of the study area were measured in south-eastern Finland. The condition of pine forests and their needles was, however, better on the neighbouring Karelian Isthmus although the species number of epiphytic lichens was very low and the condition of the lichens was poor. It is suggested that these most sensitive indicators of air pollutants are damaged by pollutants from St Petersburg and Narva. Vast virgin forests of the Karelian Isthmus act as pollutant sinks reducing the effect of pollutants on trees. On the Finnish side intensive forest management has been carried on for many decades making forests and trees more sensitive to pollutants.

AB  - A field study was performed to examine the effects of correlated color temperature (CCT) and lumen output of fluorescent lighting on office occupants' visual comfort, brightness perception, satisfaction, and self-reported productivity. Twenty-six participants were recruited (mean age = 38.8 years; age range = 23-55 years). Ten of them had daylight access in their personal work areas. Four lamp types were selected to create luminous conditions organized as a 2 x 2 factorial design, comprising two levels of CCT (i.e., 3500 and 5000 K) and lumen output (i.e., 2330 and approximate to 3000 lm). Each condition lasted two weeks. Under each condition, participants adapted during the first week. During the second week they completed ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) three times daily using smart phones. Two of the daily EMAs included questions about lighting. Participants also completed a web-based survey on the last day of each condition. The results from the EMA (60.0% response rate) and web-based (77.2% response rate) surveys were generally consistent, indicating that CCT significantly affected spatial brightness perception, visual comfort, satisfaction, and self-reported productivity. The luminous conditions at 5000 K (visually cooler) were rated to be brighter than those at 3500 K (visually warmer), especially when higher lumen output was in place. However, the increase in spatial brightness perception came with lower satisfaction, worse visual comfort, and worse self-reported productivity. The conditions at 5000 K were judged to be too cool, especially for those who had daylight in their work areas. The results of this study do not support the spectrally enhanced lighting (SEL) method advocated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as an energy savings strategy. Even when higher CCT resulted in higher spatial brightness perception, occupants' visual comfort and satisfaction were compromised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of three potential anthropogenic stressful factors (coastal pollution from the mainland, the causeway Caibarien-Santa Maria and fishing with bottom-trawling nets) on the condition of seagrasses was assessed at 12 sites in two bays of Sabana-Camaguey archipelago, between 2010 and 2013. As for indicators of the condition of the seagrass ecosystem, the structure of the macrophyte community, marine angiosperm's shoot density, and shoot length of marine angiosperms were analyzed. Abiotic variables as depth, turbidity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, and chemical oxygen demand of seawater, were evaluated. The relationships of the three potential anthropogenic stressful factors and the abiotic factors (predictor variables) with the biological response variables were analyzed. Seagrass meadows in better condition, with higher values of cover and density of Thalassia testudinum, and lower values of depth, turbidity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand, were found at sites out of the bays and furthermost from the causeway and mainland. Areas without vegetation or with lower values of cover and density of T. testudinum, and higher cover of macroalgae and pioneer species of marine angiosperms as Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii, were found in both bays. Turbidity and depth were the abiotic factors with the stronger negative influence on the structure of the seagrass community. Chemical oxygen demand and salinity also showed negative influences. Coastal pollution seems to be the anthropogenic factor that most influences the condition of seagrasses. No recovery of seagrasses was observed in areas where bottom-trawling fisheries had ceased. Distance to the causeway was not correlated with the condition of seagrass, but the potential for a negative influence on circulation persists. Seagrasses in the studied bays remain affected by the above-mentioned predictor abiotic factors, whose effects may be reinforced by the three anthropogenic stressful factors, acting synergistically with the bays' oceanographic characteristics.

AB  - Background: Aversive conditioning has been proposed as an important etiologic mechanism in social phobia; however, empirical evidence is scarce and has not relied on a detailed analysis of the acquisition and extinction of the conditioned emotional response.
   Methods: Fourteen men sustaining generalized social phobia and 19 healthy control subjects participated in differential aversive conditioning with two neutral faces as conditioned stimuli and an aversive odor as unconditioned stimulus. Subjective and peripheral physiological responses were obtained.
   Results: Both groups were successfully conditioned as reflected by differential subjective (valence, arousal, subjective unconditioned stimulus expectancy) and peripheral physiological responses (skin conductance, startle response). There was no evidence for an enhanced conditionability in the social phobics; however, they showed an enhanced unconditioned stimulus expectancy, especially for the nonreinforced conditioned stimuli during acquisition, and a delayed extinction of the conditioned skin conductance response as well as a certain dissociation between subjective and physiological responses.
   Conclusions: The enhanced unconditioned stimulus expectancy during acquisition and the overall elevated subjective arousal suggest that, under threat, subjects with generalized social phobia may be more prone to associate neutral social cues and an aversive outcome. Furthermore, delayed extinction of the conditioned response seems to contribute to the etiology and maintenance of generalized social phobia. (C) 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Forest structure and diversity have generally been well studied, but the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on structural differences of hemi-boreal old-growth and managed mature stands have not been quantified along a wide range of the productivity gradient. This study compared 39 quantitative or qualitative characteristics and various widely accepted biodiversity indicators of a stand, its understorey and the forest floor in old-growth and conventionally managed mature stands of dry alvar and fresh boreo-nemoral forests. This study has to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating of forest "naturalness". We examined 154 stands over a wide biogeographical range in Estonia.
   Many forest structural characteristics, including stand basal area and composition, amount of dead wood, and coverage of understorey layers (shrub, herb and moss layers) followed productivity and/or biogeographical gradients. Old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris (CWD, consisting of logs and snags), a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey and herb layer, and a more heterogeneous pattern of herb layer diversity than mature managed forests. We found a correlation between live trees greater than 40 cm in diameter and forest age. The effects of forest management on the forest floor are both direct and indirect. Anthropogenic disturbance directly decreased shrub and herb layer coverage. Indirectly forest management increased herb layer coverage, proportion of graminoids, and species richness of the herb layer by improving light conditions as stand canopy was opened.
   The sets of indicators for assessing ecosystem quality in each forest site-type have overlapping features, such as the amount of dead wood, canopy closure of the stand and the presence of woodpeckers and specific lichens. Several other old-growth or disturbance indicators are forest-type specific, related to the composition of shrub and herb layer vegetation.
   Results suggest that stands managed with an extended rotation can be compositionally very similar to old-growth forests. Stands differ quantitatively in structural features, but these differences are confounded by other environmental factors, such as soil productivity, forest age or biogeography. Mature and old-growth forests still enclose features created by the mid-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) history of forest management practices. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peatlands host a large number of highly specialised species and are important carbon storage and freshwater reservoirs, but are heavily threatened by, e.g., peat extraction and drainage. For improved protection of peatlands, the development of an ecological assessment system is necessary. Existing systems based, for instance, on peat formation and water level are rather coarse and differ between countries. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the predictive power of biodiversity indicators - particularly invertebrates (Oribatida, Araneae, Carabidae) and vegetation - for more finely reflecting environmental conditions in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in order to determine which taxonomic groups should be included in an ecological assessment system for peatlands. Therefore, we selected three plots in each of four peatland study sites in a German low mountain range and sampled the taxonomic groups using standard methods appropriate to represent assemblage structure and site diversity (Oribatida: Sphagnum samples; Araneae, Carabidae: pitfalls traps; vegetation: vegetation surveys). Our results indicate the necessity of implementing different taxonomic groups into an overall ecological assessment system, as all of them reacted differently to different ecological gradients. Oribatid mites were the best predictors of moisture, one of the most important factors in peatlands. Ground-dwelling spiders responded to several different factors; most remarkably, they strongly correlated with landscape area covered by peatland-related Natura 2000 habitat types, as a proxy for habitat quality. Carabidae most strongly correlated with the size of the Sphagnum plots, moss cover and moisture, but their species richness was very low. Vegetation, as the best established indicator group in peatlands, showed the weakest correlations to the tested environmental parameters, probably due to short-term changes in environmental conditions and a delayed response of the plant community. Hence, the set of most relevant environmental parameters can only be represented when multiple taxa are included in an assessment system. Also, overall biodiversity is not represented by a single taxon, because the correlation in assemblage similarity between the taxonomic groups was low. Considering ecological sensitivity, sampling effort (=number of samples and necessary site visits), taxonomic stability and state of knowledge on species' habitat requirements, we therefore suggest the inclusion of ground-dwelling spiders, oribatid mites and vegetation in an ecological assessment system for peatlands, complemented by a few sensitive, easy to recognize indicator species of other taxonomic groups.

AB  - P>1. Currently pelagic ecosystems are changing significantly due to multiple threats. An important management policy is to establish marine protected areas, until now overlooked due to the difficulty of declaring 'high seas' protected areas, obtaining long-term distribution data on indicator species and the dynamic nature of these ecosystems.
   2. Within this framework, we developed predictive habitat suitability models of an oceanic predator, the vulnerable wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, in the highly dynamic Southern Ocean. Based on a long-term tracking database (1998-2008), we estimated three quantitative ecological indices that complementarily describe the hierarchical habitat use of the species at multiple spatial scales: where the species (i) spent more time (the seascape, based on the time spent per area), (ii) searched for prey (the foraging habitat, based on zones of increased foraging intensity using first passage time), and (iii) fed (the feeding habitat, based on prey capture data).
   3. Predictive habitat models reasonably matched the observed distribution patterns and described albatross multi-scale habitat use as a hierarchical arrangement: albatrosses foraged over topographic features in subtropical waters, nested within the wider seascape due to the constraint imposed by the colony effect, whereas feeding occurred nested over the continental shelf and seamounts in areas of low oceanographic variability within the Polar Frontal Zone.
   4. Within the current oceanographic conditions, the location of key pelagic habitats for albatrosses breeding in the southern Indian Ocean encompassed certain topographic features such as pelagic areas surrounding main breeding sites, seamounts and submarine mountain ranges. The placement of these pelagic hotspots depends on the current sea surface temperature conditions.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The present study provides two key conservation and management tools. First, we provide the first map to support the development of a prospective network of priority conservation zones across the southern Indian Ocean based on habitat predictions of an oceanic indicator species. This could be used not only to support conservation of top predators but also the underlying biodiversity associated with pelagic key habitats. Secondly, the developed habitat modelling procedure is widely applicable and could be used to track changes in species distribution in both marine and terrestrial environments within the current global change scenario.

AB  - Odonata are an important component of lotic communities and their abundance and diversity may inform on the health of running waters. The survey of the odonatofauna of three major Algerian wadis: Kebir-East, Seybouse, and Rhumel, led to the identification of 40 species. Our results revealed the presence of Calopteryx exul, a Maghrebian endemic, at Wadi Seybouse and seemed to confirm the extinction of the type population at Wadi Rhumel where the species was first recorded in the XIXth Century. The results also indicated the range expansion of several species: Coenagrion caerulescens, Orthetrum nitidinerve, Trithemis kirbyi and Urothemis edwardsii whose relict population is critically endangered. Additionally sampling of abiotic factors (altitude, water temperature, conductivity, etc.) was carried out and data analysed in view of exploring a possible co-structure between the faunistic and environmental data sets. Data analysis indicated that correlation between abiotic factors (hydroperiod, water conductivity and water temperature) and species richness differed between streams and thus Odonata may prove useful in evaluating the ecological integrity of Mediterranean lotic systems.

AB  - The use of the CEN (European Committee for Standardization) standard method for sampling fish in lakes using multi-mesh gillnets allowed the collection of fish assemblages of 445 European lakes in 12 countries. The lakes were additionally characterised by environmental drivers and eutrophication proxies. Following a site-specific approach including a validation procedure, a fish index including two abundance metrics (catch per unit effort expressed as fish number and biomass) and one functional metric of composition (abundance of omnivorous fish) was developed. Correlated with the proxy of eutrophication, this index discriminates between heavily and moderately impacted lakes. Additional analyses on a subset of data from Nordic lakes revealed a stronger correlation between the new fish index and the pressure data. Despite an uneven geographical distribution of the lakes and certain shortcomings in the environmental and pressure data, the fish index proved to be useful for ecological status assessment of lakes applying standardised protocols and thus supports the development of national lake fish assessment tools in line with the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - As an essential component of lotic habitats, aquatic insects have commonly been used as bio-indicators of the ecological integrity of lotic habitats. However, recent large-scale declines have given rise to concerns about freshwater ecosystems functioning correctly. During three consecutive years, we surveyed Wadi Cherf, Upper Seybouse, Algeria, and employed the size-frequency distribution of head capsule width to sketch the life history of Oligoneuriopsis skhounate, an Ibero-Maghrebian endemic mayfly, whose distribution and ecology are not so well-known known. O. skhounate exhibited a seasonal univoltine summer cycle with growth and development taking place during the warmest period of the year (late spring to early autumn). The absence of nymphs during winter and the presence of last instar nymphs from July to November suggested a lengthy egg diapause, following the aestivo-autumnal emergence and reproduction. The study also raises the issue of freshwater biodiversity conservation in North Africa by highlighting the case of O. skhounate, acting as an indicator species of important but vulnerable aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Networks of ponds (pondscapes) are becoming increasingly significant for resilient landscape planning in rural areas. Farmland and forestry ponds are habitat islands that support heterogeneous communities of aquatic organisms.
   Species richness, Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI), Shannon's index, and species composition are used here to assess the complementary conservation value of adult dragonfly assemblages associated with forty ponds across a protected area-sugarcane-forestry mosaic.
   Despite differences in environmental variables among the various ponds, dragonfly species richness, DBI, Shannon index scores, as well as responses to particular environmental variables, did not differ between ponds in sugarcane, plantation forestry, and protected areas. Dragonfly composition differed in response to vegetation cover.
   Our results highlight the importance of catchment and regional management for all ponds within the pondscape, and show that ponds in the transformed areas (i.e. sugarcane and forestry areas) are important contributors to regional conservation. As the various ponds were complementary in their dragonfly assemblages, we recommend conservation focus at the level of the pondscape rather than on individual ponds.

AB  - The level of protection provided by the present environmental risk assessment (ERA) of fungicides in the European Union for fungi is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the structural and functional implications of five fungicides with different modes of action (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, cyprodinil, quinoxyfen, and tebuconazole) individually and in mixture on communities of aquatic hyphomycetes. This is a polyphyletic group of fungi containing key drivers in the breakdown of leaf litter, governing both microbial leaf decomposition and the palatability of leaves for leaf-shredding macroinvertebrates. All fungicides impaired leaf palatability to the leaf-shredder Gammarus fossarum and caused structural changes in fungal communities. In addition, all compounds except for quinoxyfen altered microbial leaf decomposition. Our results suggest that the European Union's first-tier ERA provides sufficient protection for the tested fungicides, with the exception of tebuconazole and the mixture, while higher-tier ERA does not provide an adequate level of protection for fungicides in general. Therefore, our results show the need to incorporate aquatic fungi as well as their functions into ERA testing schemes to safeguard the integrity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - 1. To assess the efficacy of environmental management policies and practices, there is a progressive transition from monitoring of activities towards assessment of their outcomes for the environment.
   2. Population trends of key taxonomic groups can serve as useful indicators of broader environmental integrity and health. Several necessary and desirable criteria for selecting, meaningful and suitable indicators are discussed. The attributes of a range of taxa and survey methods used for their assessment are discussed with reference to these criteria.
   3. Survey methods. data holdings and analytical methods for populations of wild birds at present provide a good basis for developing indicators of the quality of fresh waters at a landscape scale. Other taxa are not necessarily any less appropriated however, survey design and data representativeness are often limiting, factors to the use of other taxa for assessing geographic and temporal trends.
   4. Taxonomic science and ecological monitoring are necessary for determining society's Progress with sustainable development and for informing appropriate enhancements to policy and management practice. particularly so for fresh waters. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

AB  - Resource management agencies commonly defend controversial policy by claiming adherence to science-based approaches. For example, proponents and practitioners of the "North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, "which guides hunting policy across much of the United States and Canada, assert that science plays a central role in shaping policy. However, what that means is rarely defined. We propose a framework that identifies four fundamental hallmarks of science relevant to natural resource management (measurable objectives, evidence, transparency, and independent review) and test for their presence in hunt management plans created by 62 U.S. state and Canadian provincial and territorial agencies across 667 management systems (species-jurisdictions). We found that most (60%) systems contained fewer than half of the indicator criteria assessed, with more criteria detected in systems that were peer-reviewed, that pertained to "big game," and in jurisdictions at increasing latitudes. These results raise doubt about the purported scientific basis of hunt management across the United States and Canada. Our framework provides guidance for adopting a science-based approach to safeguard not only wildlife but also agencies from potential social, legal, and political conflict.

AB  - Metrics characterizing the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in wadeable streams in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States were analyzed to explore the relative responses of the metrics to different types of anthropogenic stress. The data used in our study were collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program from 1993 to 1996. Regression models were developed relating metric values at reference sites to natural sources of variability. These models were then used to predict reference values at test sites. Test site metric observations were scaled by subtracting the predicted reference value and dividing by the standard deviation of residuals at reference sites. Stressor-response relationships for each scaled metric were then estimated using generalized additive models. Metric responses to 4 groups of stressors (nutrient enrichment, habitat degradation, elevated metals concentrations, and elevated ion concentrations) were different. The proportional abundance of tolerant taxa was the most sensitive indicator of nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation, whereas Ephemeroptera richness was the most sensitive indicator of elevated metals or ion concentrations.

AB  - An integrated biological effect monitoring concept has been tested in flounder (Platichthys flesus L.) from four locations with different anthropogenic impact in the German Eight. During 3 years of sampling, biomarkers at all levels of biological organisation from the molecular to the ecosystem level were applied and tested on 742 individual fish of body lengths between 18 and 25 cm. At the ecosystem level, the fish were taken as a habitat for the parasite assemblage. The hypothesis was that changes in the environment might lead to changes in the species diversity of parasites and in the infection intensity of single species, as well as between heteroxenic and monoxenic parasite species (H/M ratio). At the molecular level, activity of the CYP1A-dependent monooxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was used as a biomarker of exposure. At the subcellular level, the integrity of lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes was taken as an indicator of non-specific acute and chronic toxic effects. Both biomarkers are recommended by the ICES Advisory Committee on the Marine Environment for the application in biological effects monitoring programmes. In addition, neutral lipid content in the liver was used as a marker for pathologically induced fat accumulation. In the same individual fish, a new method for the measurement of macrophage aggregate activity in the liver was tested for its application and reliability in reflecting immunosuppression. Tests were accompanied by chemical analysis of standard organochlorine and heavy metal residues in flounder tissue, A total of 33 parasite species were found. As an indicator species, the mean abundance of Trichodina sp. reflected best the pollution gradient observed with highest infection intensity at the most polluted location. Species diversity was significantly higher in fish caught near the reference site and significantly lower in fish from the polluted Elbe estuary. The use of the heteroxenous/monoxenous species ratio as a marker was not useful at the locations investigated because of the dominance of heteroxenous species at all habitats. Since EROD activity and macrophage aggregate activity were dependent on sex and maturity of female flounder, only male fish were taken into consideration for the integrated evaluation of data. All biochemical and histochemical tests were able to reflect accurately the site-specific differences, as well as an observed pollution event at the end of 1995 as determined by chemical analyses. The correlation analysis revealed a connection not only between the single parasitological and biochemical parameters but also within these groups. The non-specific immune response and TrichodinL1 infection intensity were correlated with all other parameters, leading to the assumption that these may serve as links between the lowest and the highest levels of biological organisation. The simultaneous use of metabolic and parasitological results facilitated the interpretation of the observed variations of the data and the distinction between natural variation and pollution-mediated effects.

AB  - Complexities of the post-NPM era have resulted into a new governance approach based on 'collaboration', a network-based model that links various stakeholders [state and non-state actors], ostensibly to maximise public value. The 'consensus model' has its underpinning 'rules of the game'; without which collaborative outcomes may end up being conflictual and counter-productive. Adopting a critical stage review, this paper draws mainly from theoretical and recent empirical literature to unpack the factors that catalyse successful collaborative natural resource governance. We reflect on these to design an 'ABC framework' aimed at providing signpost to agencies, governments and conveners of collaboration on how to execute this socio-technical process to maximise value. The framework hinges on three broad pillars: Adopting and advancing human skills, Building integrity and legitimacy and Creating a sense of attachment to the resource in question. We discuss these with specific indicators synchronized from recent natural resources collaboration experiences in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European seas are under anthropogenic pressures impacting the state of water quality, benthic habitats and species. The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires the Member States to assess the impacts of pressures and make a programme of measures leading to good environmental status (GES) by 2020. This study presents a method for assessing the quantity and distribution of anthropogenic impacts on benthic habitats in the Baltic Sea by using spatial data of human pressures and benthic habitats. The southern sub-basins were more extensively impacted than the northern sub-basins. Over the entire sea area, deep sea habitats were more impacted than shallower infralittoral and circalittoral habitats. Sand and coarse sediments were the seabed types relatively most impacted in the Baltic Sea scale. A comparison against tentative thresholds for GES showed that in the sub-basin scale only one third of the habitat types was in GES. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We assessed the density and productivity of Parkesia motacilla (Louisiana Waterthrush) at 4 Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock)-dominated headwater streams representing 2 distinct stream morphologies: ravines, defined by steep banks and fast-flowing water; and benches, characterized by braided streams meandering across a flat floodplain. The Louisiana Waterthrush is an established bioindicator of headwater-stream ecological integrity used to investigate overall habitat quality. We conducted the study from 2010 to 2013 in the Appalachian Highlands of northeastern Pennsylvania. Pair density and number of fledglings produced per km of study stream were exceptionally high at the 2 bench sites compared with the literature, and were significantly higher than in ravine sites, in part due to significantly higher nest survival on benches (69%) compared to ravines (33%). Double brooding was also significantly higher on benches. Differences in density, productivity, and nest survivorship between ravines and benches in our limited study suggest that benches may be of higher quality for this species. Our results have conservation and management implications regarding threatened Eastern Hemlock ecosystems, and the topic warrants further investigation.

AB  - The main goal of this study was to examine the natural variability of alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) GAERTN.) leaf processing and explore its potentiality as a functional indicator to assess the ecological status of Spanish headwater streams. Breakdown of leaf litter was studied during autumn-winter in reference headwater streams of two regions of northern Spain: the Basque Country (on the Atlantic) and Catalonia (on the Mediterranean). Spring experiments were also carried out in the Atlantic region in order to study seasonal changes. Leaf mass loss rates were slightly higher in Catalonian streams. Temperature was not the main factor for explaining differences between the two regions. In the Atlantic one, however, water temperature determined the spatial and seasonal variability of leaf litter processing. Because of the high natural variability in breakdown rates, our results highlight the difficulty in detecting moderate impairments on stream functioning through the analysis of leaf litter decomposition if this process is not accompanied by the study of other factors affecting it.

AB  - Because polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) persist in the environment and are lipophilic they can accumulate in wildlife. Little is known about accumulation or effects of PCBs in anurans; therefore, we chose them for study at a PCB contaminated Superfund site. We wanted to determine which anuran species and life stages were the best indicators of PCB accumulation in outfalls (drainage ditches) flowing from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), Paducah, Kentucky, and how PCB accumulation might affect individuals. We measured PCBs (Aroclor 1260) in captured adult anurans of various species. A total of 60 adults of six different species were captured among all study sites. Juvenile anurans had greater concentrations of PCBs than adults (P < 0.001); however, there were no differences in PCB accumulation among species in either adults (P = 0.103) or juveniles (P = 0.584). The results of this study indicate that juvenile anurans accumulated greater concentrations of PCBs compared to adults collected from the same stream locations and that juveniles appear to be useful indicators of PCB contamination in aquatic systems. No adverse effects were observed in captured anurans.

AB  - Corporate responsibility has become an important issue for management to address. The responsibility of the organization for the public environment (ecological, social and economic aspects of the environment) has become a matter of management attention referring to the entire organization and all major stakeholders. Therefore safe, environmentally sound, and economically viable energy production and supply should be essential part of management issues. The anticipated closure of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant at 2009 will change the situation of electricity generation in Lithuania significantly. The costs of electricity generation and distribution are the most important criteria shaping decisions in the energy production and supply companies. Sound energy and environmental accounting must be the basis of any strategic decision making in order to keep up with the increasing complexity of energy and environmental problems. Efficiency, equity, ecological integrity, and technological change are introduced as fundamental aspects that need to be considered in a comprehensive sustainable energy production and supply framework. Since these issues cannot be suitably included within the frame of a single model, a combination of ecological, economic, technological and social measures for different aspects of Lithuanian energy system and sustainable development are analysed.

AB  - Fish assemblages at 16 sites in the upper French Broad River basin, North Carolina were related to environmental characteristics using detrended correspondence analysis, principal components analysis, and linear regression. The primary gradient affecting sites in this basin was related to agricultural influence, characterized by high levels of agricultural land cover, nitrate plus nitrite, sulfate, specific conductance, and sediment. Agricultural influence on the fish assemblage was represented as a trophic shift from specialized insectivores to generalized insectivores and an herbivore. A secondary influence on variation among sites was related to urban land cover, population density, increased concentrations of metals, and soil erodibility. This primarily urban gradient was characterized by an increase in the number of native and introduced fish species, particularly sunfish and omnivores species, and a decline in the percent of piscivores. These results support the identification of indicators for different environmental influences, which can improve the ability of resource managers to diagnose impairment in this basin and in similar basins.

AB  - In this study we examine the ecological responses of aquatic macrophytes and benthic macroinvertebrates to a trout farm effluent located in the upper Tajuna River (Guadalajara province, Central Spain), comparing the suitability of biological metrics and indices based on these two communities to assess trout farm pollution in the upper reaches of fluvial ecosystems. Sampling surveys were carried out in winter and summer 2006, and in spring 2007. Four sampling sites were selected along the study reach: S-1, placed upstream from the trout farm, was used as a reference station; S-2, S-3 and S-4 were placed about 10, 100 and 1000 m downstream from the trout farm outlet, respectively. The stream bottom was mainly stony with cobbles and pebbles at all sampling sites, except at S-2 where it was covered by a thick layer of organic sediment. Aquatic macrophytes and benthic macroinvertebrates significantly increased in abundance downstream from the trout farm effluent, particularly at S-3 and S-4. However, while the diversity of aquatic macrophytes increased downstream (at S-3 and S-4, but not at S-2), the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates significantly decreased, particularly at S-2. Regarding aquatic macrophytes, moss coverage values, as well as values of the Index of Macrophytes (IM) and the Macroscopic Aquatic Vegetation Index (MAVI), were higher at S-1 than at S-2. In contrast, values of moss coverage and IM were significantly lower at S-1 than at S-3 and S-4. MAVI values were similar at S-1, S-3 and S-4. Regarding benthic macroinvertebrates, the abundance percentage of oligochaetes and chironomids (expressed as OC%) was significantly higher at downstream polluted sites (particularly at S-2) than at S-1. Conversely, the abundance percentage of ephemeropterans, plecopterans and trichopterans (expressed as EPT%), and scores of the total Biological Monitoring Water Quality (t-BMWQ) index and the average Biological Monitoring Water Quality (a-BMWQ) index were much lower at S-2 than at S-1, with a clear tendency to increase with increasing downstream distance from the trout farm. Correlation analyses showed that changes in physicochemical parameters (inorganic nutrients, dissolved oxygen and turbidity) along the study reach were better correlated with changes in metrics and indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates. Overall it is concluded that metrics and indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates (such as OC% and EPT% metrics and t-BMWQ and a-BMWQ indices) can be more suitable than those based on aquatic macrophytes for the biological monitoring of trout farm pollution in the upper reaches of fluvial ecosystems, since the higher diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates inhabiting the river bottom would permit this community to exhibit a better indicator performance regarding the environmental stress caused by trout farm effluents. However, further studies are needed in order to generalize this conclusion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A robust food web is one which suffers few secondary extinctions after primary species losses. While recent research has shown that a food web with parasitism is less robust than one without, it still remains unclear whether the reduction in robustness is due to changes in network complexity or unique characteristics associated with parasitism. Here, using several published food webs, simulation experiments with different food web models and extinction scenarios were conducted to elucidate how such reduction can be achieved. Our results show that, regardless of changes in network complexity and preferential parasitism, the reduction in food web robustness is mainly due to the life cycle constraint of parasites. Our findings further demonstrate that parasites are prone to secondary extinctions and that their extinctions occur earlier than those involving free-living species. These findings suggest that the vulnerable nature of parasites to species loss makes them highly sensitive indicators of food web integrity. (C) 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

AB  - Issues of environmental sustainability, limits to growth and opportunity, introduction of new technology, and the economic and social costs of resource degradation have forced more proactive integration of biophysical and socio-economic data. Natural resources management, including soil, water and land quality, involve balancing the often conflicting objectives of food and fibre production under scenarios of increasing demand, while increasing economic efficiency and maintaining the quality of the environment. It involves integration of data from several disparate disciplines, scaling the data to make them compatible on input, identifying strategic indicators, criteria and thresholds with which to assess the state and performance of the system, and the application of biophysical and economic optimisation models to examine the impacts and trade-offs of alternate management options. However, some basic questions of scales and hierarchies still have to be resolved, e.g. how to "scale-up" the biophysical data to the level at which public policy is formulated without losing the integrity of the data. This paper examines these and related issues by discussing the theories and principles of spatial and temporal hierarchies and scales, and providing some examples of application.

AB  - In this pilot study, we evaluated the usefulness of the alkaline comet assay as a biomonitoring tool at the level of plankton communities affected by varying water quality. Zooplankton was collected in autumn 2007 and spring 2008 in two shallow lakes, one being predominantly polluted with aluminium compounds as result of water treatment process (Lake Njivice; 45A degrees 10' N, 14A degrees 30' E) and the other unpolluted (Lake Ponikve; 45A degrees 05' N, 14A degrees 30' E) used as control. Water and sediment chemistry parameters were assessed at both lake sampling sites. The results indicated that the main pollutant in both matrices was aluminium, whose concentrations exceeded the value of 0.15 mg/L-1 legally accepted for drinking water by Croatian water quality regulations. Plankton composition of the investigated lakes showed that only a few species are dominant and appear at both sites. Cladocerans are represented by Daphnia magna Straus 1820, and copepods by the calanoid Eudiaptomus padanus etruscus (Losito 1901), the cyclopoid Cyclops sp. and dipterans by larvae of Chaoborus flavicans (Meigen 1830). Other species were determined only occasionally and with low abundance. As observed, the comet assay had adequate sensitivity to detect the differences in levels of DNA damage among the dominant zooplankton taxa. Zooplanktons collected in Lake Njivice show a lower degree of DNA integrity compared with animals from the reference lake (Lake Ponikve). Inter-species variability in DNA damage was observed, indicating different genome susceptibility to the same genotoxic pollutants present in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, in the polluted Lake Njivice, seasonal differences in the levels of DNA damage within particular species of zooplankton were also noted. Calanoida, Daphnia and Chaoborus mainly had higher values of all three comet parameters in autumn 2007 than in spring 2008. Feeding modes strongly influenced the level of DNA damage in zooplankton species studied. We assume that the mechanisms of DNA damage and genotoxicity, as detected in the present comet assay study, were similar as those described in previous studies dealing with pollution by toxic metals. Although it was a preliminary study, obtained results confirmed the high sensitivity of the comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in cells of zooplankton organisms. The alkaline comet assay on simple aquatic organisms, as confirmed here, might represent an additional parameter useful in environmental risk assessment, especially in cases when other bioindicator species are very scarce or absent.

AB  - Copper (Cu) exposure can increase leaf-associated fungal biomass, an important food component for leaf-shredding macroinvertebrates. To test if this positive nutritional effect supports the physiological fitness of these animals and to assess its importance compared to waterborne toxicity, we performed a 24-day-bioassay in combination with a 2x2 factorial design using the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum and a field-relevant Cu concentration of 25 mu g/L (n = 65). Waterborne toxicity was negligible, while gammarids fed leaves exposed to Cu during microbial colonization exhibited a near-significant impairment in growth (similar to 30%) and a significantly reduced lipid content (similar to 20%). These effects appear to be governed by dietary uptake of Cu, which accumulated in leaves as well as gammarids and likely overrode the positive nutritional effect of the increased fungal biomass. Our results suggest that for adsorptive freshwater contaminants dietary uptake should be evaluated already during the registration process to safeguard the integrity of detritus-based ecosystems.

AB  - Of the many groups of organisms proposed for use in biomonitoring, assemblages of fish, algae, and benthic macroinvertebrates are the most commonly selected. Purported advantages and disadvantages of using these groups, along with those of zooplankton, were assembled from 65 different publications and websites. From these, 13 categories of advantages and nine of disadvantages were created. The diversity of the assemblage and its importance to the ecosystem were reported as advantages in >20% of citations for each group; these similarities suggest that some redundancy exists among the different groups in terms of these features. Likewise, sampling difficulties and lack of analytic metrics were disadvantages listed in >20% of citations for each group. Few reported advantages (e.g. recreational value of fish) or disadvantages (e.g. short generation time of algae) were unique for a particular assemblage. The validity of reported advantages and disadvantages were sometimes region specific, other times incorrect. The choice of which assemblage is most appropriate for a biomonitoring program ultimately depends on the characteristics of the area to be studied and the program objectives.

AB  - The operation and management of social infrastructures can create significant headaches for municipal governments. Sewer systems are no exception, and prioritizing plans and strategies for asset management is usually adopted as a cost-effective solution. The condition assessment, which is an important element of asset management, provides current information about the condition of municipal facilities. Condition assessments were first used by Water Research Centre (WRc) in the UK, the country with the longest history of sewer management, and are now widely used in many countries. Korea uses the condition assessment protocol developed by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), but as this protocol does not fully reflect the underground environment in Korea, the assessments and judgments are ambiguous. The sewer condition assessment and rehabilitation decision-making (SCARD) program developed by this study is based on the MOE protocol with the defect items, score, and condition grading system modified in consideration of the type of buried pipelines in Korea. To compare the assessment results produced by these two protocols, a closed-circuit television inspection was performed on 11km of sewer pipeline in the sampled area in P city. The inspection indicated that SCARD set a higher score of structural defects common to both protocols for items that affect the collapse mechanism (fracture, damage, etc.). The amount of pipeline that received a grade of five for internal condition rating of identified structure defects was 45% with the MOE protocol, which was much higher than the 0.6% given with SCARD. This result showed that there was a big difference between the two protocols in condition grade evaluations of structural defects. In the future, the findings of this study can be used to develop an objective protocol reflecting actual sewer pipeline conditions.

AB  - Water quality is affected by a complex combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. To assess watershed integrity on a larger scale and for an optimal, cost-effective integrated watershed management, defining linkages between upstream watershed land cover and riverine water quality is essential. A correct upstream area calculation is an absolute necessity to reach conclusive results, but remains problematic in human influenced catchments. Especially sewer infrastructures (including wastewater treatment plants) are difficult to incorporate. We developed a method that allows us to integrate the sewer system in the upstream calculations and applied it on the Nete catchment in Belgium. Our results show strong changes in results compared to standard runoff methods. We conclude that if sewer systems are not incorporated in upstream area calculation, the impact of human activities on the water quality at a catchment scale estimates will be severely biased. A thorough understanding of the evaluated catchment and a correct translation of the different hydrological flow paths in the upstream area calculation is absolutely necessary to gain reliable results.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are used commonly as water-quality indicators in wadeable streams and rivers. However, increased depth and overall complexity of large rivers may cause inaccessibility or unacceptable index and metric variability when attempting a single wadeable method. Significant increases in sampling effort and time expenditure have been recommended to compensate for the increased variability when assessing large rivers. However, the transition between wadeable streams and nonwadeable rivers is not well defined, especially for free-flowing systems. We evaluated the utility of a modified wadeable-stream collection method for sampling large and complex semiwadeable rivers. Our results suggest that water-quality measurements across the width of a river can be used to identify influences of multiple water sources. This spatial information and a single-habitat (e.g., riffle-run) approach could be used with a modest increase in sampling effort to reduce metric variability and provide important source-tracking information. These supplementary data and a grasp of the complex ecological processes that exist in large rivers are essential for recognizing why biological communities differ among sites and for using macroinvertebrates to assess large river systems.

AB  - Cave cricket abundance is used as an indicator of integrity of cave ecosystems. One means of monitoring cave cricket abundance is counting crickets as they emerge from cave entrances for two hours after sunset. The influence of cloud cover, relative humidity, and surface temperature on counts is unknown and there might be few cave crickets that emerge during the first hour of the survey. Using mixed effects models, I assessed the influence of these environmental variables on exit counts and estimated when cave crickets emerged within the two-hour survey period. Exit-count surveys were conducted in eleven caves over four years in central Texas, and caves were surveyed up to four times a year across the four calendar seasons. Cloud cover, relative humidity, and temperature influenced counts, but the greatest influence was from temperature. Peaks in cave cricket counts occurred 80 to 90 minutes after the start of a survey and declined thereafter. Cave cricket exit count surveys should record surface temperature, cloud cover, and relative humidity at the start of surveys so that counts can be adjusted for these environmental influences. Also, surveys can be shortened to 1 or 1.5 hours in length.

AB  - It is at the local/community level that the connections among ecosystem health, the health of human communities, and individual livelihoods are most apparent and critical. This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It presents case studies of Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.

AB  - Transformation of the natural land cover is one of the most important global changes. Changes in land use may strongly affect ecosystem functions and biodiversity by directly or indirectly modifying key structural properties. Here, we examined the effects of land use on the size structure of fish communities in subtropical Uruguayan streams. We analysed the suitability of non-taxonomic, size-related variables as a tool to elucidate shifts in stream fish assemblages along a gradient in land use change. We also tested some taxonomic variables (e.g., species richness and species diversity) to compare their response with size-related variables. In the more anthropogenic disturbed basins (i.e., dominance of urban and agricultural land use), we found higher size diversity, slope of size spectrum (flatter slopes) and total range of fish length, whereas higher species richness, fish abundance and species diversity were detected in more pristine stream basins (i.e., dominance of rangelands). In combination with traditional taxonomic variables, size-related variables of fish communities in streams may be effective tools in evaluating the changes occurring in freshwater ecosystems associated with anthropogenic changes in land use.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a conceptual framework of environmental stress-response for a geomorphic system. Constructs and methods generated from the literature were applied in the development of an integrative stress-response framework using existing environmental assessment techniques: interaction matrices and a systems diagram. Emphasis is on the interaction between environmental stress and the geomorphic environment of a sandy barrier system. The model illustrates a number of stress concepts pertinent to modeling environmental stress-response, including those related to stress-dependency, frequency-recovery relationships, environmental heterogeneity, spatial hierarchies and linkages, and temporal change. Sandy barrier stress-response and recovery are greatly impacted by fluctuating water levels, stress intensity and frequency, as well as environmental gradients such as differences in sediment storage and supply. Aspects of these stress-response variables are articulated in terms of three main challenges to management: dynamic stability spatial integrity, and temporal variability. These in turn form the framework for evaluative principles that may be applied to assess how policies and management practices reflect key biophysical processes and human stresses identified by the model.

AB  - The classical paradigm of sexual selection is that of advertising males and choosy females; however, male mate choice may be more common than previously thought. Unlike visual and acoustic cues, females rather than males usually emit long-distance chemical signals for mate attraction, thus providing an excellent opportunity to examine male mate choice further. Here, I used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice via chemical cues in a natural scenario. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize in this system, so I predicted strong male mate choice for good-condition females to maximize male reproductive fitness. Results of field-based choice tests showed differential male attraction to good-condition females: all males were found on the cages of good-condition females and none on those of poor-condition females. In a second series of choice tests conducted in large field enclosures, I found that some poor-condition females attracted males in the absence of good-condition females, and that these females had significantly more eggs in their ovaries than the unattractive poor-condition females. Furthermore, when egg number was controlled but female body condition varied, males no longer had a significant preference for good-condition females. I therefore propose that the male preference for fecund females is a result of egg-bearing females producing a greater quantity/quality of pheromone than egg-free females, and that chemical cues are likely to be an honest indicator of female fecundity in this system.

AB  - Benthic invertebrates are good indicators of aquatic ecosystem health. Yet, environmental monitoring and assessment of community changes in relation to both natural and human sources of disturbance involves considerable efforts for sample processing and time-consuming identifications of organisms, which make challenging large-scale and continuous monitoring programs required under the current regulatory frameworks at European scale. The use of higher taxa (e.g. families) as surrogates for species is a mainstream approach to reduce cost and time associated to fine taxonomic resolution in environmental studies, especially concerning macro-invertebrate communities. However, this approach of 'taxonomic sufficiency' simply relies on the static grouping of organisms in taxa belonging to a single higher taxonomic level irrespective of their ecological relevance or difficulties in their taxonomic identification, leading to unnecessary losses of taxonomic detail or ecological information. A new approach, namely the Best Practicable Aggregation of Species (BestAgg), has been recently developed as an alternative procedure for species surrogacy. BestAgg is based on aggregating species in the minimum number of surrogates sufficient to depict species-level community patterns consistently, while capitalizing on ecological information. Although the approach has been successfully applied to marine and freshwater invertebrate assemblages, its effectiveness in transitional water systems, where the complex and highly variable environmental conditions may affect the performance of surrogacy methods, still remain untested. Here, we applied the BestAgg approach to quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of variability of macro-invertebrate assemblages from Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Northern Adriatic Sea). Surrogates were defined using species-level data from a representative lagoon system, which served as pilot study. Then, they were used to analyze macro-invertebrate assemblages in two independent lagoons in the same geographic area. Results showed that BestAgg surrogates were effective in depicting multivariate patterns of macro-invertebrate assemblages as at species level over and beyond potential variations among the investigated lagoons. The use of families, following a more classic approach based on taxonomic sufficiency, also provided results comparable to those obtained using species. However, with respect to families, BestAgg surrogates allowed an estimated timesaving of 40% higher while still retaining an equivalent amount of information on species-level patterns. More importantly, BestAgg allowed exploiting different criteria of species aggregation, leading to a set of surrogates more aligned with ecological/functional characteristics of organisms, suggesting that BestAgg approach may provide a fresh perspective for optimizing trade-offs between pragmatism and the need for relevant ecological information in environmental assessment and monitoring.

AB  - Over the past decades, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) found in environmental matrices worldwide have raised concerns due to their toxicity, ubiquity and persistence. A widespread pollution of groundwater and surface waters caused by PFASs in Northern Italy has been recently discovered, becoming a major environmental issue, also because the exact risk for humans and nature posed by this contamination is unclear. Here, the Po River in Northern Italy was selected as a study area to assess the ecological risk posed by perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), a class of PFASs, considering the noticeable concentration of various PFAAs detected in the Po waters over the past years. Moreover, the Po has a large environmental and socio-economic importance: it is the largest Italian river and drains a densely inhabited, intensely cultivated and heavily industrialized watershed. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived using two regulated methodologies, assessment factors (AFs) and species sensitivity distribution (SSD), which rely on published ecotoxicological laboratory tests. Results were compared to those of a novel methodology using the mechanistic ecosystem model AQUATOX to compute PNECs in an ecologically-sound manner, i.e. considering physical, chemical, biological and ecological processes in the river. The model was used to quantify how the biomasses of the modelled taxa in the river food web deviated from natural conditions due to varying inputs of the chemicals. PNEC for each chemical was defined as the lowest chemical concentration causing a non-negligible yearly biomass loss for a simulated taxon with respect to a control simulation. The investigated PFAAs were Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as long-chained compounds, and Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) as short-chained homologues. Two emerging contaminants, Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) and triclosan, were also studied to assess the performance of the three methodologies for chemicals whose ecotoxicology and environmental fate are well-studied. The most precautionary approach was the use of AFs generally followed by SSD and then AQUATOX, except for PFOS, for which AQUATOX yielded a much lower PNEC compared to the other approaches since, unlike the other two methodologies, it explicitly simulates sublethal toxicity and indirect ecological effects. Our findings highlight that neglecting the role of ecological processes when extrapolating from laboratory tests to ecosystems can result in under-protective threshold concentrations for chemicals. Ecosystem models can complement existing laboratory-based methodologies, and the use of multiple methods for deriving PNECs can help to clarify uncertainty in ecological risk estimates.

AB  - The term "landscape harmony" (LH) is relatively rarely used in literature. Semantically similar expressions, such as landscape coherence, unity, or sparse integrity are used more frequently. The LH index has been applied in the scope of the following concepts: (1) scenic beauty analysis, where LH describes the characteristic of perceived landscape; and (2) the ecological aspect, where LH refers to the mutual relationship between various abiotic and biotic landscape components. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new quantitative index describing LH combining both of the concepts. The basis for the index development is the assumption that landscape is harmonious by nature, both from the visual and ecological point of view. Therefore, any indicator attempting to reflect landscape harmony in fact measures the level of its disharmony. That is why the manuscript presents the Index of Landscape Disharmony (ILDH) measuring the impact of different factors (elements) affecting the unity of landscape. The index ranged from 0 to 3 (ILDH = 0 means fully harmonious landscape and ILDH = 3 means extremely disharmonious landscape). It involves the following three variables: (1) land type; (2) shape of objects; and (3) form and colour harmony. The index was applied in relation to 24 test areas representing different types of landscape scenes. The study results showed that the level of anthropogenic transformation does not have to negatively affect landscape harmony. Its impact depends on the coherence with landscape type and quality of man-made objects. The study also shows that LH, even if an indicator is applied, cannot be fully presented in an objective manner. The novelty of the research derives from the fact that this is the first index to be introduced combining aesthetic and ecological assessment of LH, possible to be calculated for natural, rural, and built up areas.

AB  - The bioassessment and monitoring of the ecological status of rivers using macrophytes has gained new momentum since macrophytes were recognised as biological quality elements for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD; EU/2000/60).
   Our objectives were to test the suitability of two predictive modelling approaches to macrophyte communities as a tool for water quality assessment, and to compare their performance with other more common approaches-the use of macrophytes as indicators of the trophic status of rivers and multimetric indices. We used floristic and environmental data that were collected in the spring of 2004 and 2005 from around 400 sites on rivers across mainland Portugal, western Iberia.
   We build two predictive models: MACPACS (MACrophyte Prediction And Classification System) and MAC (Macrophyte Assessment and Classification) based on RIVPACS and the BEAST methods, respectively. Whereas MACPACS is derived from taxa occurrence data. MAC uses a quantitative measure of taxa abundance. Both models showed good performance in predicting reference sites to the correct group and low rate of misclassification errors. However, they performed differently. MAC depicts a reliable response to the overall human-mediated degradation of fluvial systems, as does the multimetric index (RVI, Riparian Vegetation Index), but MACPACS presented only a poor correlation with the Global Human Disturbance Index and with the nutrients input. The incorporation of abundance data in vegetation predictive models appears to be particularly important to the detection of high levels of degradation. The values for correlations with physical-chemical pressure variables were lower than expected for MTR (Mean Trophic Rank) due to an insufficient number of scoring species found in Portuguese fluvial systems. Our results suggest that the most effective methods for bioassessment in Mediterranean-type rivers are either the RVI or the MAC predictive model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Larvae of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) were sampled off the north coast of Spain from March to June 1992 as part of a programme to investigate factors affecting subsequent recruitment. Histological analyses of the larvae were carried out as a measure of nutritional condition for comparison with environmental variables and subsequent survival at the juvenile stage. Tissues were grouped into short-term indicators of nutritional condition, including the digestive tract, liver and pancreas, and long-term indicators represented by cartilage, notochord and muscle tissue. Long-term indices showed little difference between months, most specimens being in relatively good condition. Short-term indices showed greater variation because larvae sampled in March and May were in significantly poorer condition than those in April and June. A third measure of condition, the presence of irreversibly damaged tissue indicated that larvae sampled in March were in the poorest condition. This measure of condition was suggested as being the most objective assessment with respect to potential larval mortality. It was not possible to compare larval condition with survival to the juvenile stage because only an insignificant number of larvae from spawning along the north coast of Spain recruited to the nursery area; most juveniles were derived from spawning further to the south. It was suggested that offshore transport associated with upwelling off the north-west coast was responsible for the loss of larvae from the north coast and may be a more significant factor in determining recruitment than nutritional condition.

AB  - On recherche des indicateurs pour suivre l'integrite ecologique des forets et autres types d'ecosystemes et l'on utilise generalement des mesures biologiques comme indicateurs, compte tenu de leur importance ecologique inherente et de leur capacite a fournir des indices de changements environnementaux. De telles mesures se basent generalement sur des donnees obtenues a partir d'un reseau de places echantillons permanentes sur lesquelles on suit un grand nombre d'especes vegetales. Cependant, les donnees peuvent demeurer difficiles a interpreter, surtout en l'absence d'informations correspondantes sur les agents de stress naturels ou anthropogenes. Les auteurs examinent ici les principes generaux pour l'utilisation d'indicateurs et discutent les types de mesures de la composition sur la base de places echantillons, obtenues de la vegetation, et qui peuvent s'averer les plus pertinentes pour faire le suivi de l'integrite ecologique. On met l'accent sur la vegetation du parterre des ecosystemes terrestres, mais les principes dont on discute sont pertinents pour d'autres types de vegetation. On examine les plantes individuelles, les regroupements, les adventices, les indices de diversite, les valeurs indicatrices de Ellenberg, l'index d'evaluation de la qualite floristique, les indicateurs multivaries et multimetriques, les concepts de seuils de changement et les besoins pour des etats de reference. L'utilite de toute approche individuelle tend a etre etroitement liee au contexte specifique. En particulier, la valeur de l'utilisation d'especes individuelles comme indicatrices depend etroitement de facteurs comme le type d'interet pour la communaute floristique et les types et intensites des agents stressants anthropogenes. On considere les especes adventices comme indicateurs particulierement valables compte tenu de leur relation etablie avec des agents stressants anthropogenes, leur historique, leur pertinence pour l'ensemble des communautes floristiques, et leur capacite a engendrer des changements indesirables pour la biodiversite et les processus ecologiques.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity is expected to create variation in the ornament-condition relationship. This topic has been studied in males with less attention being given to females. Here, we explore inter-population variation in the relationship between the size of a male-like trait, supra-orbital combs, and body mass in female red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We used the abundance of the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis, a parasite with strong negative effects on this species, as a proxy of environmental conditions. We studied six populations over 5 years and showed that the comb size-body mass relationship varied with mean parasite abundance, with stronger ornament-condition relationships in populations with higher parasite infection levels. Our study supports the idea that environmental conditions, and in particular parasite infection levels, may affect the reliability of female ornaments as condition indicators.

AB  - The death of native trees caused by non-native pathogens is a global problem. An assessment of the potential ecological and conservation impacts of any tree disease should identify: (1) ecosystem functions associated with the tree species; (2) which species use the tree and how; (3) the suitability of alternative tree species to replace the threatened tree species; and (4) potential management options to mitigate or reduce the impact of the disease.
   We assess the potential ecological impact of Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (ash dieback) on Fraxinus excelsior in the UK. 953 species were identified as associated with F. excelsior trees: 12 birds, 28 mammals, 58 bryophytes, 68 fungi, 239 invertebrates, 548 lichens. Forty-four 'obligate' species were identified: 11 fungi, 29 invertebrates and 4 lichens; and 62 'highly associated' species.
   Off-setting the loss of ash with 'alternative tree species' may be one 'solution' to the biodiversity threat. No single alternative tree species can act as host for all ash-associated species but Quercus robur/petraea can host 69%. In an assessment of ecosystem function, when compared to other European deciduous tree species, F. excelsior interacts with the environment in a unique way, particularly in relation to nutrient cycling.
   Exploration of different management scenarios in response to ash dieback indicated that management which did not remove infected F. excelsior trees was the best for 'obligate' and 'highly associated' species.
   The results highlight wide-ranging ecological implications of ash dieback of relevance to other invasive pests and pathogens that are threatening the integrity of other tree species and woodland ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Information on condition, growth and reproduction was collected from a sample of 155 female lechwe in the Linyanti Swamp, northern Botswana.  Condition varied significantly with age, reproductive state and season and indications were found of relationships between body mass and the attainment of puberty in young females and body mass and the fertility of adult females.  There were also indications that the population was under nutritional stress because of high water levels and that this had caused reductions in the growth rate and fertility of young females.
   It is suggested that the sensitivity of young females to adverse environmental conditions could be exploited to optimize population monitoring for conservation purposes by using them as an indicator class, rather than monitoring the entire population.  Because of relationships between condition, growth and reproduction, it is also suggested that long-term monitoring of condition should form part of any effort to understand population dynamics.

AB  - The Caspian Sea hosts areas of high ecological value as well as industrial, leisure, and agricultural activities that dump into the water body different kinds of pollutants. In this complex context, a proper description of the origin and potential sources of pollution is necessary to address management and mitigation actions aimed at preserving the quality of the water resource and the integrity of the ecosystems. Here, we aimed at detecting sources of both nitrogen inputs, by N stable isotope analysis of macroalgae, and metals in macroalgae and sediments in two highly anthropized coastal stretches at the Iranian side of the Caspian Sea. Sampling was done near the mouth of rivers and canals draining agricultural and urbanized areas. In the westernmost waters, facing a port city, low macroalgal delta N-15 signatures indicated industrial fertilizers as the principal source of pollution. By contrast, in the central coastal waters, facing touristic areas, the high macroalgal delta N-15 indicated N inputs from wastewaters. Here the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations in waters were associated with excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Metal concentrations varied largely in the study areas and were lower in macroalgae than in sediments. Localized peaks of Pb and Zn in sediments were observed in the central coastal sites as probable byproducts of mining activity transported downstream. By contrast, Cr and Ni concentrations were high in all sampling sites, thus potentially representing hazardous elements for marine biota. Overall, macroalgal delta N-15 coupled with metal analysis in macroalgae and sediments was useful for identifying the main sources of pollution in these highly anthropized coastal areas. This double approach in comprehensive monitoring programs could thus effectively inform stakeholders on major environmental threats, allowing targeted management measures.

AB  - River impoundments and waste water discharge are a serious threat to the integrity and biodiversity of river ecosystems, especially in central Italy. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in autumn and summer along the Aniene River to assess the cumulative biological effect of the numerous dams and sewage treatment plants that affect its middle and lower course. We hypothesized that (i) increasing habitat impairment would promote the formation of nestedness in species assemblage, where species poor locations support only a sub-set of organisms from richer sites; (ii) specific life-history traits would confer sensitivity to habitat degradation. Patterns of macroinvertebrate richness and diversity along the river tracked the distribution of dams and sewage treatment plants. Partial Mantel test showed that dissimilarity in assemblages increased with the number of dams and treatment plants between reaches after controlling for longitudinal distance. Assemblages were significantly nested, and nestedness appeared related to both water quality gradients (phosphorous, turbidity) that reflected anthropogenic inputs, and to natural gradient in altitude. Reaches with nested assemblages (supporting a sub-set of the species pool) were characterized by greater representations of taxa with shorter life cycles, while, in contrast, species rich sites supported taxa with longer life cycles and lower dispersal ability. These results suggest that the cumulative effect of dams and sewage treatment plants promoted the formation of nested subsets in species distribution. Moreover, it appeared that certain functional traits that conferred sensitivity also dictated the progressive non-random loss of taxa in face of multiple anthropogenic stressors. These findings have conservation implications in the regions, but need to be considered preliminary since anthropogenic and natural factors co-varied systematically along the study river precluding the identification of single factor effects.

AB  - Aim Freshwater ecosystems are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Where long-term datasets are available, shifts in species phenology, species distributions and community structure consistent with a climate change signal have already been observed. Identifying trends across the wider landscape, to guide management in response to this threat, is limited by the resolution of sampling. Standard biomonitoring of macroinvertebrates for water-quality purposes is currently not well suited to the detection of climate change effects, and there are risks that substantial changes will occur before a management response can be made. This study investigated whether dragonflies, frequently recommended as general indicators of ecological health, are also suitable as indicators of climate change. Location Data were analysed from standard bio-assessment monitoring at over 850 sites spanning a 9 degrees latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia. Methods Using variation partitioning, we analysed the proportion of assemblage turnover in dragonflies and other macroinvertebrate assemblages that can be explained by climate and other environmental drivers. We also tested whether the utility of dragonflies as indicators improved at higher taxonomic resolution and whether the turnover of dragonfly assemblages was congruent with that of other groups. Results Climate explained three times as much variation in turnover of dragonfly species than dragonfly and other macroinvertebrate assemblages at family level. The dissimilarity of dragonflies and varying turnover in each macroinvertebrate assemblage meant surrogacy amongst groups were low. Main conclusions On the basis of the influence of climate on turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages, dragonfly species distribution appears highly sensitive to climatic factors, making this taxon a potential useful indicator of climate change responses. However, the low surrogacy amongst assemblages also suggests that a shift in the focus of conservation management from specific taxa to the functional composition of assemblages across a diverse range of habitats is needed.

Thermal power and hydropower are the two major power sources in China. Hydropower has both positive and negative effects on the ecosystem. However, there are few studies on the comprehensive impact of hydropower on the ecosystem. Therefore, the main innovation of this article is to integrally and comprehensively study the impact of hydropower to propose recommendations for hydropower development. The study of hydropower's effects on the overall ecosystem including resources, the environment, and economic society reflects the integrity, and the simultaneous study of hydropower's positive and negative effects reflects the comprehensiveness. First, this paper constructs a system dynamics (SD) model that can analyze the impact of replacing thermal power with hydropower on the ecosystem and proposes an improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. Then, this paper takes the province of Fujian as an example for SD scenario simulation and proposes recommendations for each indicator in the ecology subsystem. Finally, this paper performs CCD analysis on subsystems of the ecology subsystem in different policy scenarios and provides suggestions for future hydropower development in Fujian. Results show that hydropower technology improvement and efficiency increase (HTIEI) is more conducive to the development of the overall ecosystem. The scientificity of the current hydropower policy in Fujian is proven through theoretical analysis, and further hydropower development proposals are proposed. This paper provides a basis for the formulation of power generation policies and promotes ecological civilization construction for Fujian. The proposed methods in this paper can also provide tools for policy research on clean energy power generation.

AB  - Damming disrupts lotic continuity, creating a lentic water body upstream of the dam and a lotic stretch downstream that is highly vulnerable to temporal fluctuations in flow and physiochemical quality depending on the operational regime of the dam. Thus, an essential part of any dam operation programme must take into account a typologically suitable environmental flow regime, in order to maintain downstream structure and function. We assessed the seasonal impact of daily flow peaking regimes on the taxonomic composition, metrics and traits of the macroinvertebrate community in the lotic section situated downstream of the Itutinga reservoir on the Rio Grande in the state of Minas Gerais in southeast Brazil. The flow manipulation experiments were carried out in both wet (January) and dry periods (July) of 2010. The samplings were carried out in two hydraulic situations (fixed flow and daily flow peaking). Benthic macroinvertebrates and sediment were collected in three habitat types (backwater, fluvial beach and running water). Water variables were measured only in the fluvial beach habitat. Both water column and sediment variables downstream were heavily influenced by the retention capacity of the reservoir rather than the daily flow peak value. The trait approach was more sensitive than abundance and metrics and could detect the effects of daily flow peaking. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities sampled downstream of the Itutinga reservoir were more influenced by the sediment composition at each of the three studied habitats, than by the tested daily flow peaking. However, given the short timescale of this study, it may be difficult to the influence of these two interrelated factors. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports the evolution of rain drop size distribution (DSD) during bright band (BB) and no-BB (NBB) conditions of low intensity rainfall events as observed by a vertically pointing Micro Rain Radar (MRR) over Pune (18.58A degrees N, 73.92A degrees E), India. The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor Z (dBZ) at the 0A degrees C isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at similar to -60A degrees C with clear indication of BB at 0A degrees C. Storm heights at warmer than 0A degrees C are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity R (mmh (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) relationship of the form Z = aR (b) are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the Z-R relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.

AB  - An energy management strategy (EMS) plays a decisive role in the performance of pure electric vehicles. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of EMS is directly affected by prospective driving conditions. This paper conducted research on grey wolf fuzzy optimal energy management strategy optimization for electric vehicles based on driving condition prediction. In order to improve the accuracy of driving condition prediction, a combined prediction method was proposed which combines fixed state transition matrix prediction and rolling prediction based on cycling conditions. The evaluation results show that the proposed solution has better prediction accuracy than previous approach. Then, this paper adopted the fuzzy logic control strategy based on driving condition prediction, which is optimized by using the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm. The results of simulation analysis revealed that the energy management strategy combining condition prediction and GWO algorithm had significant improvement in energy consumption rate and other indicators. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments were conducted and the results had good coherence to that of the simulation. This verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in a real-time environment.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events. Such events coupled with demand for fresh water to support rapidly growing cities may reduce flow permanence and threaten stream biodiversity. We examined the role that flow permanence and urbanization play in limiting stream biodiversity in the Austin, Texas, USA, metropolitan area. We contrasted responses of macroinvertebrate communities to impervious cover (IC) among streams spanning a wide range of flow permanence using long-term biomonitoring and discharge data collected across 104 sites. The number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa significantly and independently declined with increasing IC and decreasing flow permanence. However, the decline in the number of all taxa as flow permanence decreased depended on the level of IC. Higher IC levels were associated with disproportionately greater declines in taxon richness. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) further parsed the community response by identifying 49 taxa that sharply declined in density and frequency of occurrence primarily between 3.7 and 24% IC. However, when the analysis was repeated after splitting the data into 2 groups of high and low flow permanence, the range of IC resulting in sharp density declines was lower for the low-flow permanence group (3-11% IC, greatest change at 9% IC) than the high-flow-permanence group of streams (7.7-28% IC, greatest change at 23% IC). Despite being composed of taxa largely regarded as pollution tolerant, the low-flow-permanence group of streams was characterized by taxa that evolved in habitats with intermittent flow and are integral components of their biological integrity. These results imply that future urban growth may have disproportionately negative effects on streams forecasted to become increasingly intermittent consequent to climate change.

AB  - One focus of ecosystem service research is the connection between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being as well as the socioeconomic influences on them. Despite existing investigations, exact impacts from the human system on the dynamics of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being are still uncertain because of the insufficiency of the respective quantitative analyses. Our research aims are discerning the socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being and demonstrating mutual impacts between these items.
   We propose a DPSIR framework coupling ecological integrity, ecosystem services as well as human well-being and suggest DPSIR indicators for the case study area Jiangsu, China. Based on available statistical and surveying data, we revealed the factors significantly impacting biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in the research area through factor analysis and correlation analysis, using the 13 prefecture-level cities of Jiangsu as samples. The results show that urbanization and industrialization in the urban areas have predominant positive influences on regional biodiversity, agricultural productivity and tourism services as well as rural residents' living standards. Additionally, the knowledge, technology and finance inputs for agriculture also have generally positive impacts on these system components. Concerning regional carbon storage, non-cropland vegetation cover obviously plays a significant positive role. Contrarily, the expansion of farming land and the increase of total food production are two important negative influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem's food provisioning service capacity, regional tourism income and the well-being of the rural population. Our study provides a promising approach based on the DPSIR model to quantitatively capture the socioeconomic influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being for human-environmental systems at regional scales.

AB  - Ecosystem models require the specification of initial conditions, and these initial conditions have some level of uncertainty. It is important to allow for uncertainty when presenting model results, because it reduces the risk of errant or non-representative results. It is crucial that model results are presented as an envelope of what is likely, rather than presenting only one instance. We perturbed the initial conditions of the Chatham Rise Atlantis model and analysed the effect of this uncertainty on the model's dynamics by comparing the model outputs resulting from many initial condition perturbations. At the species group level, we found some species groups were more sensitive than others, with lower trophic level species groups generally more sensitive to perturbations of the initial conditions. We recommend testing for robust system dynamics by assessing the consistency of ecosystem indicators in response to fishing pressure under perturbed initial conditions. In any set of scenarios explored using complex end-to-end ecosystem models, we recommend that associated uncertainty analysis be included with perturbations of the initial conditions.

AB  - Aim Recurrent species assemblages integrate important biotic interactions and joint responses to environmental and spatial filters that enable local coexistence. Here, we applied a bipartite (site-species) network approach to develop a natural typology of lakes sharing distinct fish faunas and provide a detailed, hierarchical view of their bioregions. We then compared the roles of key biogeographical factors to evaluate alternative hypotheses about how fish communities are assembled from the regional species pool. Location Ontario, Canada and the Upper Midwest, USA. Time period 1957-2017. Major taxa studied Freshwater fishes. Methods Bipartite modularity analysis was performed on 90 taxa from 10,016 inland lakes in the Southwestern Hudson Bay, Mississippi River and St. Lawrence River drainages, uncovering bioregionalization of North American fishes at a large, subcontinental scale. We then used a latent variable approach, pairing non-metric partial least-squares structural equation modelling with multiple logistic regression, to show differences in the biogeographical templates of each type of community. Indicators of contemporary and historical connectivity, climate and habitat constructs were estimated using a geographical information system. Results Fish assemblages reflected broad, overlapping patterns of postglacial colonization, climate and geological setting, but community differentiation was most linked to temperature, precipitation and, for certain groups, lake area and water quality. Bioregions were also marked by non-native species, showing broad-scale impacts of introductions to the Great Lakes and surrounding basins. Main conclusions The dominant effects of climate across broad spatial gradients indicate differing sensitivities of fish communities to rapidly accelerating climate change and opportunities for targeted conservation strategies. By assessing biological variation at the level of recurrent assemblages, we accounted for the non-stationarity of macroecological processes structuring different sets of species on the landscape and offer novel inference on the assembly of inland fish communities.

AB  - Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) have been broadly converted into pastures and crops, with direct consequences to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and social welfare. Such land use and cover changes (LUCC) usually are strongly influenced by government environmental and development policies. The present study aimed at analyzing LUCC in Brazilian TDFs between 2000 and 2015, using the north of Minas Gerais state (128 000 km(2)) as a case study. We evaluated the potential biophysical and social-economic drivers of TDF loss, natural regeneration and net area change at the county level. Further, we determined the effects of these LUCC variables on socioeconomic indicators. We identified a considerable change in TDF cover, expressed as 9825 km(2) of deforestation and 6523 km(2) of regeneration, which resulted in a net loss of 3302 km(2). The annual rate of TDF cover change was -1.2%, which is extremely high for a vegetation type that is protected as part of the Atlantic Rain Forest biome since 1993. TDF deforestation was directly affected by county area and by the increase in cattle density, and inversely affected by terrain declivity, indicating that land conversion is mostly driven by cattle ranching in flat regions. TDF regeneration was directly affected by county area and inversely affected by the increase in population density and terrain declivity. LUCC variables did not affect welfare indicators, undermining claims from rural sectors that TDF protection would cause a socioeconomic burden for northern Minas Gerais. Our results highlight the importance of naturally regenerating secondary forests to the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and its services, which are frequently neglected in conservation strategies. Hegemonic macroeconomic policies affecting TDFs have been deeply rooted in deforestation for commodities production, and need urgent review because they cause long-term environmental impacts without evidence of welfare gains.

AB  - The fish biodiversity of the Ria de Aveiro has been analysed during the 20th century, as an indicator of the biological integrity of the ecosystem. Ninety-two distinct species and 38 families of Agnatha, Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes occurred during the period. The family and species richness showed two levels of magnitude, from the 1910s, with high values (26-28 families and 51-52 species), and during the last two decades with more variable values (20-27 families and 38-55 species). A total of 13 species (four non-sporadic species) have disappeared recently. The lagoon system has been affected by large-scale anthropogenic influences mainly the substantial development of industries and the increasing population in the watershed, in addition to overfishing, climatic changes and dredging. In general, as shown by an analysis of the ecotrophic guilds present, the area maintained a similar structure during the whole period. No significant differences in time were recorded for any of the designated guilds. The twenty-two frequent species, which occurred in six or seven surveys, were mainly estuarine resident species or marine adventitious species, living in the substratum (benthic fish), on soft substratum and vegetated bottoms. They were feeding either on invertebrates alone or on invertebrates and fish, and producing pelagic or benthic eggs. The 19 sporadically-recorded species, recorded only once, were mostly marine adventitious, demersal fishes, living above rough bottom and vegetation, feeding strictly on invertebrates, and producing eggs benthically or deposited into vegetation. It is concluded that the Ria de Aveiro estuarine coastal lagoon has supported similar fish communities during the past century and that these comprise representatives of various ecological types.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest region (wide sense) includes very complex tropical environments, increasingly threatened by extensive anthropogenic conversion (> 30%). Ecologically specialized, short-generation insects (butterflies) are evaluated here as indicators for monitoring community richness, landscape integrity, and sustainable resource use in the region. The > 2100 butterfly species in the Atlantic Forest region have been censused in many sites over 35 years, giving comparable daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term site lists. The 21 most thoroughly studied sites include 218-914 species, of which half can be censused in a week or less. The butterfly communities are divided into six relatively distinct faunal regions, centered in the northeast, the central coastal tablelands, the southeast coastal plain, the mountains plus interior of the southeastern states, the central plateau, and the southern states. Species richness shows the highest values in coastal mountains from 15 to 23 degreesS. Local butterfly communities show a high turnover, with 20 to 40 percent of the species, especially small Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae, recorded only as unstable populations or "tourists." Easily sampled species in the family Nymphalidae, and especially its bait-attracted subfamilies, are best correlated with the entrire butterfly fauna and can be used as surrogates for species diversity In most butterfly groups, species richness is well predicted by landscape connectivity alone, or by composite indices of environmental heterogeneity, natural disturbance, and (negatively) anthropogenic disturbance. Principal components and redundancy analyses showed that the richness and proportions of different butterfly groups in the local fauna are variably explained by disturbance, seasonality, temperature, vegetation, soils, and landscape connectivity. Various groups thus can be used as rapid indicators of different types of change in the community, its environment, and the landscape. Threatened and rare species also can be used as indicators of the most unique Atlantic Forest communities (paleoenvironments), which need special attention.

AB  - Background Human impact has had a profound influence on modern vegetation. Expert-based vegetation indicator systems have been developed to measure and characterize human impacts on vegetation. Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is a widely used, primarily North American system for assessing degradation and natural quality through species-based values called coefficients of conservatism. The hemeroby and naturalness indicator value (NIV) systems were independently developed for users to assess human impacts in Europe. Despite the similarities among these indicator systems, there is no mutual recognition among them, and they have developed and operate in relative isolation from one another. Approach We review the FQA, hemeroby, and NIV systems to provide a basic summary of the three systems and to evaluate them, highlighting their nearly identical core mechanics and conceptual commonalities. We also compare and contrast the three systems to less integrative ecological indicator systems that can be used to indirectly measure human impact, notably the Ellenberg system. Findings We describe how FQA and naturalness indicator values, in particular, could be considered twin systems. Despite these core similarities, users of these systems do not cite each other, potentially overlooking benefits from applying methods and concepts from separate systems. The FQA, hemeroby, and NIV systems have unique weaknesses, strengths, and primary applications compared to other ecological indicator systems. Conclusions We conclude by discussing the future role and utility of the three specialized human impact indicator systems for scientists and practitioners. Human impact indicator values may be valuable for use in basic research, but arguably their most important applications are in the practice of conservation, such as monitoring restored ecosystems.

AB  - Water is clearly the key driver of ecosystem functioning in arid and semi-arid floodplain environment. Both local rainfall and overbank flow contribute to water accessible by a plant. Variability in rainfall and hydrological regimes at seasonal and longer time scales exerts strong influences shaping ecosystem structure and function in arid and semi-arid floodplains. Yet there are few studies exploring how the interplay of climatic and hydrologic factors affects the integrity of floodplain ecosystems, especially the intermittently flooded vegetated wetlands. In fact, the importance of hydrological regimes prevailingly dominates the literature on floodplain ecology. Consequently, re-establishing and maintaining hydrological regimes has become the cornerstone underpinning most large scale floodplain conservation and restoration programs. In this study, we quantified the relative contribution of climatic and hydrologic variables to ecosystem functioning in the generalized additive modelling (GAM) framework using indicators derived from time series of MODIS 250 m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Results from the "best fitted" GAM models reveal that local rainfall has a closer and more important relationship with wetland mean NDVI (a surrogate of system primary productivity) although the co-variability between primary productivity and inflow is significantly positive. On the other hand, inflows play a dominant role in creating and maintaining the spatial heterogeneity represented by standard deviation of wetland NDVI while local rainfall has an opposite effect. Further, different vegetation community types exhibit distinct seasonality patterns in the NDVI-based primary productivity. These results illustrate the complexity of interactions between vegetation type, climate variations, and hydrology in floodplain wetlands. These results also demonstrate the sensitivity of floodplain wetlands to the perturbations in rainfall and temperature regimes, which would be more intense under the projected climate change.

AB  - Variations in fish condition, pyloric caeca (PC) mass and tissue metal concentrations were examined in two consecutive summers in yellow perch collected along two polymetallic gradients in Canada, Sudbury (ON) and Rouyn-Noranda (QC). The potential of PC mass variations to help interpret food web-mediated changes in condition was also evaluated. The lack of relationships between PC weight and condition, even in reference lakes, indicated that factors other than feeding rate influenced fish condition. Inter-annual variations in fish condition (12-58%), PC weight (14-20%) and tissue metal concentrations (30-550%) were often of greater magnitude than differences between reference and contaminated fish sampled in the same year. The apparent lack of correspondence between feeding rate and condition and the large inter-annual variation in examined metrics highlight the need to better understand the ecological underpinnings that influence metal toxicity in field situations.

KW  - ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING
KW  - ALGORITHM
AB  - This paper proposes a circuit breaker (CB) condition assessment model which combines the fuzzy set theory, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and evidential reasoning (ER). Four assessment factors, that is, (i) electrical characteristics, (ii) mechanical characteristics, (iii) insulation characteristics and (iv) miscellaneous factors, are selected as the condition parameters. A hierarchical assessment index system is constructed based on preventive tests data, intelligent electronic device monitoring data, maintenance data and operating environment. The inputted condition parameters indices are processed by the membership functions of a fuzzy distribution to obtain relative impairment grades which represent the relative grade of the CB condition towards the fault. The weights of the CB condition factors and indices are generated by the AHP based on experts' interviews and feedbacks, and the final assessment is determined by ER according to the decision factors combined. An intelligent maintenance model is built with field examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in assessing the CB operation conditions.

AB  - The rivers of Appalachia (United States) are among the most biologically diverse freshwater ecosystems in the temperate zone and are home to numerous endemic aquatic organisms. Throughout the Central Appalachian ecoregion, extensive surface coal mines generate alkaline mine drainage that raises the pH, salinity, and trace element concentrations in downstream waters. Previous regional assessments have found significant declines in stream macroinvertebrate and fish communities after draining these mined areas. Here, we expand these assessments with a more comprehensive evaluation across a broad range of organisms (bacteria, algae, macroinvertebrates, all eukaryotes, and fish) using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA). We collected water samples from 93 streams in Central Appalachia (West Virginia, United States) spanning a gradient of mountaintop coal mining intensity and legacy to assess how this land use alters downstream water chemistry and affects aquatic biodiversity. For each group of organisms, we identified the sensitive and tolerant taxa along the gradient and calculated stream specific conductivity thresholds in which large synchronous declines in diversity were observed. Streams below mining operations had steep declines in diversity (-18 to -41%) and substantial shifts in community composition that were consistent across multiple taxonomic groups. Overall, large synchronous declines in bacterial, algal, and macroinvertebrate communities occurred even at low levels of mining impact at stream specific conductivity thresholds of 150-200 mu S/cm that are substantially below the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aquatic life benchmark of 300 mu S/cm for Central Appalachian streams. We show that extensive coal surface mining activities led to the extirpation of 40% of biodiversity from impacted rivers throughout the region and that current water quality criteria are likely not protective for many groups of aquatic organisms.

AB  - We studied the relations of aquatic macrophyte communities, ecological quality metrics and water quality to lake characteristics and to land use defined at multiple spatial scales (three lake marginal zones (LMZs) of contrasting width and the whole topographic catchment) in 110 boreal lakes in Finland using ordination and generalised additive modelling. Variation in macrophyte community composition of our lakes was related to water quality, land use, latitude and lake morphology. Relationships of macrophyte status metrics - the proportion of type-specific species (TT50), Percent Model Affinity (PMA) and Trophic Index (TI) - to land use were scale dependent. The proportion of agricultural and urban land use adjacent to the lake shoreline (LMZs of 300 m and 500 m) had a more significant effect on the metrics compared to land use at the catchment scale. The scale-related pattern in the effect of land use was not congruent among metrics and the metrics also showed different indications of deterioration. Lower sensitivity to the measured disturbance of the pressure sensitive metric TI compared to the other metrics (1150 and PMA) based on general type-specific species composition was presumably due to a lack of helophytes in the species pool used, and due to invariable indicator values across lake types. Moreover. TI varied more with hydromorphology related natural gradients than TT50 and PMA. This could be due to lack of habitat for eutrophication sensitive submerged indicator species in shallow lakes. Our study demonstrates that choosing the most influential catchment scale for the evaluation and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts on lacustrine biota, may be significant in conserving and restoring the ecological quality of freshwaters, as required by, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding approaches to aid biological assessments and monitoring of waterbodies. While biodiversity measured by morphology and by DNA often has been found correlated, few studies have compared DNA data to established measures of impairment such as multimetric pollution tolerance indices used by many bioassessment programs. We incorporated environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seston into a rigorous watershed-scale biological assessment of an urban stream to examine the extent to which eDNA richness and diversity patterns were correlated with multimetric indices and ecological impairment status designations. We also evaluated different filtering approaches and taxonomic classifications to identify best practices for environmental assessments. Seston eDNA revealed a wide diversity of eukaryotic taxa but was dominated by diatoms (36%). Differentiation among sites in alpha and beta diversity was greater when operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified taxonomically, but coarse resolution taxonomy (kingdom) was more informative than finer resolution taxonomy (family, genus). Correlations of DNA richness and diversity with multimetric indices for fish and macroinvertebrates were generally weak, possibly because Metazoa were not highly represented in our DNA dataset. Nonetheless, sites could be differentiated based on ecological impairment status, with more impaired sites having lower eDNA diversity as measured by the Shannon index, but higher taxonomic richness. Significant environmental drivers of community structure, as inferred from constrained ordination analyses, differed among kingdoms within the eDNA dataset, as well as from fish and macrobenthos, suggesting that eDNA provides novel environmental information. These results suggest that even a simple seston eDNA filtering protocol can provide biodiversity information of value to stream bioassessment programs. The approach bears further investigation as a potentially useful rapid assessment protocol to supplement more intensive field sampling efforts.

AB  - Potential vegetation environments (e.g., habitat types, range sites, ecological sites) are important to land managers because they provide a conceptual basis for the description of resource potentials and ecological integrity. Efficient use of potential vegetation classifications in regional or subregional scale assessments of ecosystem health has been limited to date, however, because traditional ecological unit mapping procedures often treat such classifications as ancillary information in the map unit description. Accordingly, it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the precise location, patch size, and spatial arrangement of potential vegetation environments from most traditional ecological unit maps. Recent advances in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), terrain modeling, and climate interpolation facilitate the direct mapping of potential vegetation through a predictive process based on gradient analysis and ecological niche theory. In this paper, we describe how a predictive vegetation mapping process was used to develop a 30 m raster-based map of 4 grassland, 5 shrubland, and 6 woodland habitat types across the Little Missouri National Grasslands, North Dakota. Discriminant analysis was used in developing this potential vegetation map based on 6 primary geographic information system themes. Geoclimatic subsections and remotely sensed vegetation lifeform maps were used in predictive model stratification. Terrain indices, LANDSAT satellite imagery, and interpolated climate information were used as independent (predictor) variables in model construction. A total of 616 field plots with known habitat type membership were used as dependent variables and assessed by a jackknife discriminant analysis procedure. Accuracy values of our map ranged from 54 to 77% in grasslands, 62 to 100% in shrublands, and 70 to 100% in woodlands dependent on geoclimatic subsection setting. Techniques are also described for generalizing the 30 in pixel resolution habitat type map to appropriate ecological unit maps (e.g., landtype associations) for use in ecosystem health assessments and land use planning.

AB  - In tropical regions, expanding human activities have become increasingly threatening to the ecological integrity of protected areas. Shifting cultivation and other agricultural activities around the protected areas by rural communities often lead to increased carbon emissions, wildlife habitat destruction and increasing hunting pressure. Land use planning, with the participation of local communities in the buffer zones, is being considered to strengthen the implementation of the Man and the Biosphere Program at Crocker Range Park, Sabah, Malaysia. As part of the European Union's 'Tackling Climate Change Through Sustainable Forest Management and Community Development' program, we emphasized the participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) approach to support village-scale land use planning that considers the needs of multiple stakeholders in the community. The PGIS was applied within a multi-criteria framework to determine the location of a potential community conservation area (CCA) and to plan future land use activities in the village. Key informant interviews were followed by a participatory mapping workshop, attended by various stakeholders and experts, which was convened to discuss and elicit local knowledge to generate the environmental and resource indicators for determining potential land use activities within the village (e.g., agriculture, tourism and recreation, and forest restoration). Based on the discussions and spatial analyses, a land use zoning map with a potential CCA was presented at a follow-up land use decision making workshop. The villagers and external stakeholders reached a consensus on the land use zoning; leading to the designation process of the CCA. The PGIS-based land use planning has effectively supported the community forest conservation and is potentially applicable to other Southeast Asia regions with similar environmental and socio-economic settings.

AB  - Finfish aquaculture has damaged seagrass meadows worldwide as wastes from the farms can kill these habitat forming plants, In Cyprus, the Mediterranean endemic Posidonia oceanica is at its upper thermal limits yet forms extensive meadows all around the island. Understanding this under-studied isolated population may be important for the long-term survival of the species given that the region is warming rapidly. When fish farming began around Cyprus in the mid-nineties, cages were moored above seagrass beds, but as production expanded they were moved into deeper water further away from the meadows. Here, we monitored the deepest edge of meadows near fish farms that had been moved into deeper waters as well as at a decommissioned farm site. Four P. oceanica monitoring systems were set up using methods developed by the Posidonia Monitoring Network. Seagrass % coverage, shoot density, % of plagiotropic rhizomes, shoot exposure, leaf morphometry, and sediment organic matter content and grain size were monitored at 11 fixed plots within each system, in 2012-2014 and in 2017. Expansion at the lower depth limit of seagrass meadows was recorded at all monitoring sites. Most other P. oceanica descriptors either did not change significantly or declined. Declines were most pronounced at a site that was far from mariculture activities but close to other anthropogenic pressures. The most important predictor affecting P. oceanica was depth. Monitoring using fixed plots allowed direct comparisons of descriptors over time, removes patchiness and intra-meadow variability increasing our understanding of seagrass dynamics and ecosystem integrity. It seems that moving fish farms away from P. oceanica has helped ensure meadow recovery at the deepest margins of their distribution, an important success story given that these meadows are at the upper thermal limits of the species.

AB  - 1. The fifth-order southern alpine Brenno River and its floodplains are severely impaired by embankments, water abstractions and the construction of dams for hydropower generation. The river's annual mean discharge is reduced to 27% of the natural flow and the number of small (50-100 m(3) s(-1)) and medium-sized (101-150 m(3) s(-1)) floods is reduced significantly.
   2. Lateral hydrological connectivity has decreased strongly as a result of the flow regulation, whereas the significance of vertical connectivity has increased. The remnants of the middle and lower floodplains still contain springbrooks, ponds, and intermittently connected channels, which are all sustained by emerging groundwater.
   3. Aquatic floodplain habitats can be classified partially by faunal composition. The lotic/lentic gradient appears to be a dominant compound factor structuring invertebrate assemblages when considering all aquatic habitats. The exfiltration of groundwater in conjunction with a reduced lateral connectivity enables the occurrence of many stenotopic species.
   4. A comparison of present floodplains with those shown on historical maps shows that the fluvial landscape has changed markedly. The proportions of functional floodplain units characterized by autogenic succession and trends to late successional stages (i.e. senescence) have increased.
   5. Floodplains of the Brenno river are still considered to represent important ecological areas and they are protected by law. Whilst the legislative protection of floodplains is the basis for conservation, this does not include the restoration of driving hydrological processes. An annual release of small- and medium-sized floods could generate a diversity of disturbances, thereby promoting rejuvenation and counteracting senescence.
   6. Alternative conservation options that circumvent ongoing contracts of water use, though generally promising, are limited because of the operation of hydropower schemes. At present the exfiltrations of groundwater mitigate the impacts of flow regulation on the ecological integrity of the floodplains. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Well-designed monitoring approaches are needed to assess effects of industrial development on downstream aquatic environments and guide environmental stewardship. Here, we develop and apply a monitoring approach to detect potential enrichment of metals concentrations in surficial lake sediments of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), northern Alberta, Canada. Since the ecological integrity of the PAD is strongly tied to river floodwaters that replenish lakes in the delta, and the PAD is located downstream of the Alberta oil sands, concerns have been raised over the potential transport of industry-supplied metals to the PAD via the Athabasca River. Surface sediment samples were collected in September 2017 from 61 lakes across the delta, and again in July 2018 from 20 of the same lakes that had received river floodwaters 2 months earlier, to provide snapshots of metals concentrations (Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) that have recently accumulated in these lakes. To assess for anthropogenic enrichment, surficial sediment metals concentrations were normalized to aluminum and compared to pre-industrial baseline (i.e., reference) metal-aluminum linear relations for the Athabasca and Peace sectors of the PAD developed from pre-1920 measurements in lake sediment cores. Numerical analysis demonstrates no marked enrichment of these metals concentrations above pre-1920 baselines despite strong ability (> 99% power) to detect enrichment of 10%. Measurements of river sediment collected by the Regional Aquatics- and Oil Sands-Monitoring Programs (RAMP/OSM) also did not exceed pre-1920 concentrations. Thus, results presented here show no evidence of substantial oil sands-derived metals enrichment of sediment supplied by the Athabasca River to lakes in the PAD and demonstrate the usefulness of these methods as a monitoring framework.

AB  - Ichthyoplankton communities are dynamic and vary spatiotemporally based on factors such as wind, water currents, and phenology. Nonetheless, ichthyoplankton are an indicator of spawning success in fish populations and examining their community diversity and composition can serve to provide information on ecosystem integrity. Although some ichthyoplankton species may be transient, understanding their distribution in space and time provides information on species composition, abundance, and habitat use during critical early life stages. We sampled the spring-summer ichthyoplankton community during 2008 and 2009 in northern Lake Huron to determine species succession, abundance, and species diversity along physical and environmental gradients. Seasonal succession of species was similar during both years, indicating well-defined patterns in spawning by northern Lake Huron fish populations. Invasive alewife, rainbow smelt, and round goby were the dominant species during both years, with native stickleback species also abundant. Shannon Entropy (H') increased with increasing water temperature until late summer when H' declined. H' decreased with increasing bottom depth and distance to tributary mouth indicating the important ecological role of these habitat features during early life stages. Although ichthyoplankton diversity was comparable to or higher than that reported for other areas of the Great Lakes, the prominence of invasive species in our study is reflective of the disturbed state of the lake Huron fish community, despite large reductions in invasive planktivorous fish since 2004. Continued monitoring of ichthyoplankton communities will be important for measuring the impacts of species invasions or other ecosystem stressors on fish community structure in the Great Lakes.

AB  - In order to provide guidelines for the management of fish stocks in artificial reservoirs in the Amazon region, the present study analyzed the composition and structure of the fish communities of four sectors (upstream, lake, reservoir, and downstream) of the area affected by the Coaracy Nunes hydroelectric reservoir on the Araguari River in the Brazilian state of Amapa. Variation in ecological parameters was analyzed in the context of the impacts suffered since the damming of the river approximately 40 years ago. Standardized samples of fish were collected in gillnets during eight campaigns in 2009 and 2010. Abundance and biomass were initially evaluated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and lognormal, log-series, geometric series, and broken stick models were then calculated. The K-dominance and Abundance-Biomass (ABC) curves were also analyzed, together with the size-spectrum of the specimens. The results indicated that the sector downstream from the dam had the highest species richness, and was most consistent with the broken stick model. The ABC and K-dominance analyses also confirmed that this sector was the most balanced, in ecological terms. The lake sector had the only community that fitted the geometric series model, and all the analyses indicated a predominance of small individuals, typical of impacted communities. The analyses of the reservoir sector indicated a disturbed environment, whereas the upstream sector was characterized by a more balanced community, reflecting its greater resilience to the impacts caused by the reservoir, and its potential of this area for the conservation of local fish communities. The results also confirmed the applicability of the analytical tools employed for the study of fish communities in reservoir environments.

AB  - The concept of spatial scale is at the research frontier in ecology, and although focus has been placed on trying to determine the role of spatial scale in structuring communities, there still is a further need to standardize which organism groups are to be used at which scale and under which circumstances in environmental assessment. This paper contributes to the understanding of the variability at different spatial scales (reach, stream, river basin) of metrics characterizing communities of different biological quality elements (macrophytes, fishes, macroinvertebrates and benthic diatoms) as defined by the Water Framework Directive. For this purpose, high-quality reaches from medium-sized lowland streams of Latvia, Ecoregion 15 (Baltic) were sampled using a nested hierarchical sampling design: (river basin -> stream -> reach). The variability of metrics within the different groups of biological quality elements confirmed that large-bodied organisms (macrophytes and fish) were less variable than small-bodied organisms (macroinvertebrates and benthic diatoms) at reach, stream and river basin scales. Single metrics of biological quality elements had the largest variation at the reach scale compared with stream and basin scales. There were no significant correlations between biodiversity indices of the different organism groups. The correlation between diversity indices (Shannon's and Simpson's) of the biological quality elements (macrophytes, fish, benthic macroinvertebrates and benthic diatoms) and a number of measured environmental variables varied among the different organism groups. Relationships between diversity indices and environmental factors were established for all groups of biological quality elements. Our results showed that metrics of macrophytes and fish could be used for assessing ecological quality at the river basin scale, whereas metrics of macroinvertebrates and benthic diatoms were most appropriate at a smaller scale.

AB  - Coastal zones are responsible for a wide range of ecological functions but are also objects of concern for their integrity and environmental balance due to their different uses and pressures suffered. Such scenario adds up to the non-inclusion of the environmental perception of the population as a management strategy and as a way to broaden the participation of society in this process, understanding that, in turn, this perception can be influenced by the age group and the type of relationships that people keep with the place. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in marine environmental perceptions according to different age groups (from 07 to 16 years, from 17 to 34 years, from 35 to 50 years and older than 50 years) considering as indicators: importance, sense of belonging, sense of responsibility and interest, in the Araca Bay, Sao Sebastiao, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Regarding the importance of Araca, younger interviewees are shown to be linked preferably to the leisure and family fishing that the bay provides. As for the older, fishing is a matter of major importance. Concerning the sense of belonging, there is a difference that partially depends on the age group, but most of the individuals interviewed like to live there and use the Bay in different ways. The lowest sense of responsibility was observed in individuals aged 17 to 34 years, as opposed to the younger age group. The lower involvement with Araca Bay was observed in the interviewees who do not use the bay in any way or do not know it very well, despite living there since birth, regardless to the age group. Thus, it is verified that the involvement of people with this site is much more related to the knowledge, the use and creation of an identity with the region than with the age.

AB  - Decades of agricultural growth has led to the over appropriation of Yakima water and the ecological integrity of the Basin has been compromised. We evaluate the impact of current water allocation on the natural flow regime of the Yakima River using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration/Range of Variability Analysis and by quantifying indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit. We analyze the sustainability of the current water allocation scheme based on a range of sustainability criteria, from weak to strong to environmentally sustainable. Economic efficiency is assessed by describing the current allocation framework and suggesting ways to make it more efficient. Our IHA/RVA analysis suggests that the allocation of water in the Yakima River has resulted in a highly altered flow regime. Ecodeficit is far in excess of ecosurplus. We conclude that this allocation scheme is weakly sustainable, if sustainable at all, in its current framework. The allocation of water is also not economically efficient and we suggest that a reallocation of water rights may be necessary in order to achieve this objective. The creation of water markets to stimulate voluntary water rights transactions is the best way to approach economic efficiency. The first step would be to extend beneficial use requirements to include instream flows, which would essentially allow individuals to convert offstream rights into instream rights. The Washington trust water rights program was implemented as a means of creating a water market, which has contributed to the protection of instream flows, however more needs to be done to create an ideal water rights market so that rights migrate to higher valued uses, many of which are met instream. However, water markets will likely not solve the Yakima's water allocation problems alone: some degree of regulation may still be necessary. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methods for defining and retrieving reference conditions for large rivers were explored with emphasis on hydromorphologic and biologic quality indicators. For a set of four large rivers in the European Western Plains ecoregion, i.e., the rivers Meuse, Loire, Allier, and Dordogne, reference reaches were selected based on geomorphologic characteristics. A survey of riparian land use, vegetation, and bed geometry was done for the selected reaches. Responses of the riparian landscape to hydromorphologic conditions were determined with a set of existing and newly developed measures of riparian dynamics and forest development. Strong correlations were observed at the reach and local levels between the ratios of width to depth and embankment and the developed measures of riparian dynamics and forest. Boundary conditions for riparian forest development were determined for the hydromorphologic and biologic indicators of riparian dynamics and vegetation structure. These conditions also proved useful for determining the presence of sustainable populations of Populus nigra and Salix purpurea. From this agreement between abiotic and biotic boundary conditions, a set of useful reference conditions was determined, and a framework for the definition of reference and good status conditions subsequently evolved. Finally, a proposal for assessment and monitoring the proposed indicators is discussed for its applicability.

AB  - Wetland ecosystems have been globally degraded and lost due to rapid urbanization and climate change. An assessment of national scale inventory, including wetland types and conditions, is urgently required to understand the big picture of endangered wetlands, such as where they are and how they look like. We analyzed the spatial patterns of each inland wetland type (brackish wetland was included) in South Korea and the relative importance of land cover categories on wetland conditions. The wetlands were grouped into four dominant types (riverine, lake, mountain, and human-made) according to their topography. Riverine wetlands constituted the largest area (71.3%). The relative ratio of wetlands in a well-conserved condition (i.e., "A" rank) was highest in riverine wetlands (23.8%), followed by mountain wetlands (22.1%). The higher proportion of grasslands was related to a better condition ranking, but the increasing bareland area had a negative impact on wetland conditions. We also found that wetlands located near wetland protected areas tend to be in a better condition compared to remote sites. Our results further support the importance of the condition of surrounding areas for wetland conservation.

AB  - Changes in environmental conditions can impose stress that alters the structure and function of communities. However, ecologists are only starting to explore how stress can interact with dispersal. In this study, we tested how dispersal affects the structure, diversity (evenness), and function (productivity) of marine diatom communities (Bacillariophyceae) exposed to herbicide stress using a mainland-island framework. In a microcosm experiment, we manipulated the sequence (5 levels) and speed (two dispersal levels) of species arrival under no-stress conditions and two levels of stress. When stress was absent or low, priority effects regulated community dynamics, keeping the densities of new arrivers low. Consequently, evenness was lower in dispersed than in non-dispersed communities. Moreover, because of strong local interactions, dispersal decreased productivity under no-stress conditions and low stress. Under high stress, the selection for tolerant species regulated community dynamics. This generated a decrease in evenness but buffered productivity by compensating for the loss of sensitive species. Our results show that (1) dispersal reduced evenness, but that underlying mechanisms depend on the stress-level, and (2) dispersal can function as a spatial insurance against local changes in environmental conditions. Accounting for regional processes is therefore essential for estimating the consequences of environmental changes for ecosystem functions.

AB  - Habitat change in Rhodnius spp may represent an environmental challenge for the development of the species, particularly when feeding frequency and population density vary in nature. To estimate the effect of these variables in stability on development, the degree of directional asymmetry (DA) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the wing size and shape of R. prolixus and R. robustus-like were measured under laboratory controlled conditions. DA and FA in wing size and shape were significant in both species, but their variation patterns showed both inter-specific and sexual dimorphic differences in FA of wing size and shape induced by nutrition stress. These results suggest different abilities of the genotypes and sexes of two sylvatic and domestic genotypes of Rhodnius to buffer these stress conditions. However, both species showed non-significant differences in the levels of FA between treatments that simulated sylvan vs domestic conditions, indicating that the developmental noise did not explain the variation in wing size and shape found in previous studies. Thus, this result confirm that the variation in wing size and shape in response to treatments constitute a plastic response of these genotypes to population density and feeding frequency.

AB  - The characteristics of whale remains found at four late Holocene hunter-gatherer localities from la Isla Grande, Northern coast of Tierra del Fuego, are presented. Most of the remains were fragments retrieved in strata lying close to the Surface that exhibited cultural modifications while featuring few instruments. Their analysis, and in particular the scarcity and nature of the bone tool kit stressed the need for establishing clear cut criteria for the assessment of natural versus cultural modifications. From such standpoint, taphonomical observations dealing with skeletal part representation, differential preservation, contextual integrity, and local availability of cetacean bones along the various sectors of the shoreline proved instrumental for the interpretation of the assemblages.

AB  - This research investigated the relationship between neighborhood conditions and residents' expressed perceptions of safety. Previous studies had indicated that neighborhood conditions helped shape attitudes concerning neighborhood crime, but had relied on subjective measures of those conditions. The present study analyzed the relative contribution of subjective and objective indicators of local conditions to the overall assessment of safety in a sample of 305. Housing conditions were assessed using a standardized rating system. The investigation found that housing and neighborhood quality had an impact on satisfaction with the local physical environment and perceptions of safety. Victimization also had an impact on these two variables, but contrary to expectations had no significant impact on satisfaction with people in the local environment when controlling for housing quality.

AB  - Various environmental conditions determine soil enzyme activities, which are important indicators for changes of soil microbial activity, soil fertility, and land quality. The effect of subsurface irrigation scheduling on activities of three soil enzymes (phosphatase, urease, and catalase) was studied at five depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-60 cm) of a tomato greenhouse soil. Irrigation was scheduled when soil water condition reached the maximum allowable depletion (MAD) designed for different treatments (-10, -16, -25, -40, and -63 kPa). Results showed that soil enzyme activities had significant responses to the irrigation scheduling during the period of subsurface irrigation. The neutral phosphatase activity and the catalase activity were found to generally increase with more frequent irrigation (MAD of -10 and -16 kPa). This suggested that a higher level of water content favored an increase in activity of these two enzymes. In contrast, the urease activity decreased under irrigation, with less effect for MAD of -40 and -63 kPa. This implied that relatively wet soil conditions were conducive to retention of urea N, but relatively dry soil conditions could result in increasing loss of urea N. Further, this study revealed that soil enzyme activities could be alternative natural bio-sensors for the effect of irrigation on soil biochemical reactions and could help optimize irrigation management of greenhouse crop production.

AB  - The aim of the article is the deepening of the content basis of the reproduction of forest resource potential from the perspectives of the methodology of spatial analysis in the context of ecologically balanced reproduction of forest resources.
   The results of analysis. Formation of a modern, continuous forest management area requires a more in-depth study of forest resource potential as a spatially-forming object in conjunction with subsystems of the national (regional) economic space.
   It should be noted that the size of forest potential can be defined as the sum of potentials of its separate components in accordance with various types of forest use (main, secondary, recreational, etc.), and also in accordance with existing classifications of functions of forest resources. The existing concepts are to a certain extent complex and systemic in relation to the content basis for determining the optimal forests of the territory, since they reflect the interconnection of economic, ecological and social functions of the aggregate of forest resources, as well as the multi-purpose nature of forest potential. This gives basis, in our opinion, to assert that the achievement of the optimal afforestation of the territory is a necessary but insufficient condition for the formation and optimal value of the forest resource potential with the corresponding components (economic, ecological (ecological resource, ecosystem) and social), and qualitative condition of plantations determine the extent of integrated multi-purpose forest use. It can also be said that the optimal forest potential in the first approximation is determined by the optimal forest area.
   Thus, the optimal forest resource potential can be considered as the territorial-spatial set of forest biogeocoenoses, which provide continuous environmentally balanced forest management on a multi-purpose and integrated basis.
   Spatial analysis of forest resource potential includes assessments of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the researched object. It is also necessary to assess the relationship of forest potential with the components of the territorial capital and the main subsystems of the economic space - the territory, population and economy.
   In the presented study a more differentiated and expanded classification of indicators of the relationship of forest resource potential with the main subsystems of the national (regional) economic space has been proposed.
   In the framework of the development and implementation of targeted forest reproduction programs based on the principles of project management, it is expedient to use indicators such as the increase in the area of afforestation, calculated on the basis of one percent increase in forest cover and the cost intensity of one-percent of afforestation increasing.
   Conclusions and directions of further researches. Forest resource potential is an integral part of forest management, which, in its turn, is a component of the economic space. System of socio-ecological and economic characteristics of forest resource potential is largely determined by the forestness of the territory at various spatial levels of management. It is concluded that achievement of optimal forestness of the territory is a prerequisite for the formation of the optimal value of forest resource potential.
   The presented study offers a more differentiated and expanded classification of indicators of the relationship of forest resource potential with the main subsystems of the national (regional) economic space.
   In the framework of the development and implementation of targeted programs for recreation of forest resources based on the principles of project management, the use of indicators is justified - the increase in the area of afforestation, calculated on the basis of one percent of increasing the afforestation and the cost intensity of one percent of increasing the afforestation.
   The spatial organization of forest resource potential is ultimately determined by the position of the forest resources in the territorial natural and economic complex. Further research should be aimed at the formation of institutional conditions and financial and economic mechanisms for ensuring the transformation of components of forest-resource potential into economic assets that are involved in economic activity and create value added.

AB  - Offshore oil and gas platforms have a finite life of production operations. Once production ceases, decommissioning options for the platform are assessed. The role that a platform's jacket plays as fish habitat can inform the decommissioning decision. In this study, conducted along the crossbeams of a California platform jacket and using an ROV, we compared estimates of fish diversity and densities determined from a targeted "biological" survey with those from a replicated "structural" survey. We found that the water column fish species assemblages characterized by the two methods were similar. By contrast, the two survey methods yielded different species assemblages inhabiting the crossbeam at the platform jacket base. This difference occurred because, at least off California, the platform jacket base species diversity tends to be highest where the bottom crossbeam is undercut, creating sheltering sites for many species. Because the structural method inadequately imaged the seafloor-crossbeam interface, particularly where a gap occurred between crossbeam and seafloor, substantial numbers of fishes were not visible. While we cannot extrapolate from this study to all platforms' worldwide, it is clear that routine platform structural integrity surveys may be a valuable source for opportunistic marine community surveys. Intentional planning of the structural survey to incorporate relatively minor variations (e.g., maintaining fixed ROV distance from the infrastructure and consistent 90 degrees camera angle) coupled with a deliberate consideration of the platform ecology (e.g., positioning the ROV to capture the seafloor-crossbeam interface) can substantially improve the effects on fish assemblage assessments from routine structural surveys without compromising the integrity assessment. We suggest that these biases should be both acknowledged and, understood when using routine structural surveys to inform platform ecology assessment. Additional consideration may be given to structural surveys that incorporate incremental adjustments to provide better data applicability to biological assessments.

AB  - After the April 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, and subsequent release of millions of barrels of oil, two Corexit oil dispersant formulations were used in unprecedented quantities both on the surface and sub-surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Although the dispersant formulations contain four classes of surfactants, current studies to date focus on the anionic surfactant, bis-(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (DOSS). Factors affecting the integrity of environmental and laboratory samples for Corexit analysis have not been systematically investigated. For this reason, a quantitative analytical method was developed for the detection of all four classes of surfactants, as well as the hydrolysis products of DOSS, the enantiomeric mixture of alpha- and beta-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate (alpha-/beta-EHSS). The analytical method was then used to evaluate which practices for sample collection, storage, and analysis resulted in high quality data. Large volume, direct injection of seawater followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) minimized analytical artifacts, analysis time, and both chemical and solid waste. Concentrations of DOSS in the seawater samples ranged from 71 to 13,000 ng/L, while the nonionic surfactants including Span 80, Tween 80, Tween 85 were detected infrequently (26% of samples) at concentrations from 840 to 9100 ng/L. The enantiomers alpha-/beta-EHSS were detected in seawater, at concentrations from 200 to 1900 ng/L, and in both Corexit dispersant formulations, indicating alpha-/beta-EHSS were applied to the oil spill and may be not unambiguous indicator of DOSS degradation. Best practices are provided to ensure sample integrity and data quality for environmental monitoring studies and laboratory that require the detection and quantification of Corexit-based surfactants in seawater.

AB  - This paper is a reply to Chatters et al. (2021. "Evaluating Claims of Early Human Occupation at Chiquihuite Cave, Mexico." PaleoAmerica 8, doi:10.1080/20555563.2021.1940441), in which they raise a large number of doubts about the legitimacy of our claims of earlier-than-expected human presence at Chiquihuite Cave, in northern Zacatecas, Mexico, mainly questioning the artificial nature of the lithic assemblage and the integrity of our geological contexts. We respond to their main topics of concern, contributing arguments in defense of the human origin of the artifacts. We also include 10 examples of stone tools, with full descriptions and photographs, focusing on modified flakes that bear indicators of use-wear and intentional modification.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the antibacterial efficacy of vancomycin towards Staphylococcus aureus under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and to assess the influence of oxygen on the duration of the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) after exposure to vancomycin.
   Methods and Results: Culture-based techniques and flow cytometric measurements of 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (an indicator of redox activity) and the membrane potential-sensitive fluorophore Sytox Green, were used to test four staphylococcal strains. The MICs for all strains, and the duration of PAE, were similar whether tested with or without oxygen. However, a fivefold logarithmic reduction in cell counts was observed in 10-15 h aerobically, depending on strain, compared with longer than 60 h in an anaerobic environment. Flow cytometric data correlated well with counts of colony-forming units under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
   Conclusions: The death rate of Staph. aureus exposed to vancomycin was greater in the presence of oxygen, although MIC values and PAE durations were similar whether tested aerobically or anaerobically. Also, flow cytometry provided a rapid and sensitive alternative to plate counts for the assessment of antibiotics in oxygen-free conditions.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study underlines the need for further anaerobic testing using different strain/antibiotic combinations, the results of which will have clinical significance due to the anaerobic nature of some sites of infection.

AB  - The reference condition and historical variability of aquatic ecosystems are key ecological characters for understanding the dynamic and ecological assessment of wetland systems. Based on high-resolution chronological sequences of diatom records from 10 lakes in the Yangtze floodplain, this study aims to determine their ecological and chemical reference conditions, the historical variability and its controlling factors. Mesotrophic species Aulacoseria granulata, along with non-planktonic species Fragilaria spp., Navicula spp., Cocconeis placentula, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cymbella spp. etc, were most abundant in the reference samples (1800-50). Accordingly, a relatively high chemical reference (50 mg L-1 in diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentration) was defined. The degree of floristic change comparing present with reference samples reveals that six of the 10 lakes have undergone significant ecological changes. The historical variability in those lakes was found to be regulated by the distance from the Yangtze River (negatively) and the lake catchment area (positively). This reflects the mechanism driving ecological change in floodplain lakes: the ecological conditions were sensitive to the nutrient input from the catchment and disturbance by the Yangtze River. This study demonstrates the robustness of palaeolimnological techniques in reconstructing the historical ecological characters of lake ecosystems, which may provide essential information for the management of wider types of wetland.

AB  - Pastoral agriculture influences both the food resources available for the soil food-web, and soil physical conditions. This study explored the relationship between food resources, soil physical condition, and soil invertebrates in 42 grazed pastures across different soils in New Zealand. The response of invertebrates to food resources and soil physical conditions was associated with both the size class of invertebrates (i.e., earthworm vs. nematode) and functional group (i.e., bacterial-feeding vs. plant-feeding). Changes in soil pore size, a surrogate for habitable pores, was correlated with the invertebrate community across the soils in the study, more so than potential food resources from plant litter and dung calculated from livestock numbers. Overall, management practices which improve habitable pores in the soil are beneficial not only for plant growth, but also for sustaining the diversity and abundance of the biological community which contribute to the soil services required for pasture agriculture. An invertebrate indicator, that included the abundance thresholds of each invertebrate group at which their activity would be insufficient to sustain the soil processes, would give land managers a tool to identify deficiencies in the invertebrate community and assess the implications of these deficiencies on the ability of the soil to provide the necessary ecosystem services.

AB  - Tree - soil interactions depend on environmental conditions. Planting trees may affect soil microbial communities and compromise their functioning, particularly in unfavorable environments. To understand the effects of tree species composition on soil microbial communities, we quantified structural and functional responses of soil microorganisms to tree species planted in various environments using substrate-induced respiration and phospholipid fatty acid analyses. Five forest types were studied including pure stands of native European beech (Fagus sylvatica), range expanding Norway spruce (Picea abies), and non-native Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), as well as the two conifer - beech mixtures. We found that microbial functioning depends strongly on soil nutrient concentrations in the studied forest sites. At nutrient-poor sites, soil microorganisms were more stressed in pure and mixed coniferous forests, especially in Douglas-fir, compared to beech forests. By contrast, microbial structure and functional indicators in beech forests varied little with site conditions, likely because beech provided ample amounts of root-derived resources for microbial growth. Since soil microbial communities are sensitive to Douglas-fir, planting Douglas-fir may compromise ecosystem functioning, especially at nutrient-poor sites. Overall, root-derived resources are important for determining the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities, so soil microbial responses to tree species will depend upon the provisioning of these resources as well as site-specific environmental conditions.

AB  - Given that Ligularia sibirica, a boreal relict species in Europe, occurs in Romania in a wide range of habitat types, we assumed that under different ecological conditions, the response of phytocoenoses will be different, affecting the populations' performance. Thus, we aimed to determine L. sibirica's optimum conditions, through the interactions between the environmental factors and phytocoenological composition. We grouped the communities with L. sibirica according to their ecological features, with cluster analysis. The effect of interactions between the ecological factors (expressed by the Ellenberg Indicators for nitrogen availability, soil reaction, moisture, and light) and species assemblage (from the resulting clusters) on the performance of L. sibirica (assessed through its cover abundance values), was tested with general linear models. Our results show that L. sibirica's cover abundance is influenced by the nutrient content of the substrate and by the soil reaction, not only directly but also indirectly, through the increasing competition of the ecologically specialised species (under acidification or alkalinisation conditions) or of the generalist, more productive ones (in case of eutrophication). The results also highlighted the complexity of biotic interactions from the phytocoenoses, under different ecological conditions, the same species having either a competitive or facilitative effect on L. sibirica.

AB  - Classification of waters using biological quality elements and determination of the degree of deviation from reference levels is a key issue in the Water Framework Directive of EU. Lakes in reference conditions with sufficient biological data are available for several boreal lake types with the exception of naturally eutrophic lakes. An empirical approach is one alternative for estimating the reference conditions of such lakes. We used the water transparency of the naturally eutrophic Lake Tuusulanjarvi recorded in August in the early 1910s to estimate reference values for phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations. Three phytoplankton samples during August 2000-2001 corresponded to the estimated reference values for total biomass (< 5.6 mg l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (< 28 mu g l(-1)), as did the simultaneous Secchi depths. The phytoplankton assemblage in these samples with 24 eutrophy indicators (17% of the total taxa number) corresponded in general the species list from the early 1900s, which as such could be regarded as reference assemblage. Furthermore, in August 2000, 3 years after intensive fish removal a prominent decrease in cyanobacterial biomass and toxin concentration was observed. The costs of the measures and studies in Lake Tuusulanjarvi during 1989-2003 have been approximately 2.5 million euros.

AB  - The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program ( EMAP) uses water clarity as a water quality indicator for integrated assessments of coastal waters. After the publication of the first National Coastal Condition Report (USEPA, 2001c), the national water clarity reference value of 10% of ambient surface light at 1 m depth was reevaluated and modified to reflect expected differences in regional reference light conditions. These regional differences range from naturally turbid estuaries like those found in Mississippi and Louisiana to clear water estuaries expected to support extensive beds of submerged aquatic vegetation in, e. g., Florida and Tampa Bays. For the second National Coastal Condition Report, water clarity was assessed based on regional reference values ( USEPA, 2004). Different regional water clarity reference values and data collection methods necessitated the development of a water clarity index based on light attenuation coefficients (k). This index incorporates regional reference conditions and is interchangeable with secchi depth and percent light transmission calculated from light meter measurements. Evaluation of the water clarity index shows that k values based on transmissivity at 1 m can be estimated from secchi depth measurements and successfully used as a surrogate for transmissivity calculated from light meter data. An approach for assessing water clarity in Gulf of Mexico estuaries using light meter data and secchi depth is presented.

AB  - Free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facility was used to conduct the experiments during 2011-12 and 2012-13 cropping seasons for assessing the growth and yield attributes of rice (Oryza sativa L) and maize (Zea mays L). The concentration of CO2 was kept 550 +/- 30 ppm in enriched condition. The concentration of ambient condition was 395 +/- 30. Recommended doses of NPK fertilizers were given to both the crops. Plant growth and yield parameters were measured and analyzed for both the conditions. Assessment revealed that the plant height of rice and maize did not change significantly. A significant (F=9.800; P < 0.02) change was noticed in the post-harvest index of rice. However, there no change was noticed in the post-harvest percentage of maize. Leaf area of rice (P < 0.01) and maize (P < 0.005) increased significantly at flowering stage of plants under enriched CO2 environment over the ambient. Under elevated CO2 condition, biological yields of rice and maize were improved by 14.3% and 17.2% respectively. Carbon dioxide enrichment exposure improved the grain yield by16. 2% (P < 0.02) and 13.8% (P < 0.02) for rice and maize respectively.

AB  - Domestic and foreign studies of economic consciousness and individual behavior under conditions of secondary economic socialization (ES) are discussed. The problem of studying personality's economic-psychological maturity as a resource facilitating successful adaptation to changing conditions of the economic environment is substantiated. This phenomenon is interpreted as an integrative entity including phenomena of maturity within the system of relations with other individuals, in domain of material, financial self-sufficiency and financial security of one's family, as well as personality maturity. The research analyzes indicators of personality's economic-psychological maturity under different conditions of secondary ES: attribution of responsibility for one's material well-being as well as for one's family; financial independence, self-sufficiency; level of economic claims, tolerance for representatives of economic groups, etc. It is shown that the features of the studied type of maturity differ depending on types of economic life situation (of crisis nature or relatively stable ones). Conclusions are drawn about the functions of economic-psychological maturity in situations of: job loss, coping with poverty threat, constructing an image of future economic well-being of one's family, and improving financial literacy. The direction for future research is formulated.

AB  - The ecological impact of rubber effluent on macroinvertebrate communities of the Adofi River, Niger Delta area of Nigeria were evaluated for a 6 month-period as part of a study to understand pollution processes in the river that may lead to improved regulation and policy development. Three sampling stations, each 25 m long were selected along 7 km stretch of the stream. Station 1, located upstream of the outfall from the rubber processing plant, station 2, immediately downstream of the effluent discharge point and station 3, 3 km downstream were sampled monthly. The rubber effluent impacted negatively on the sediment and water chemistry by elevating the levels of some heavy metals (Ni, Pb, and Zn), chemical parameters as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), conductivity and the amount of nutrients at the discharged site. A combined total of 87 macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded from the three stations of the river. The abundance and community structure showed variation between the effluent impacted site and the reference sites as most sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa were completely missing from the effluent impacted site. The preponderance of oligochaetes and some dipteran taxa associated with low dissolved oxygen levels in the impacted site bears credence to the fact that the chemical components of the rubber effluent waste water were lethal to some aquatic forms. Based on canonical correspondence analysis results, conductivity, BOD, phosphate and nitrate were strongly associated with the impacted station. At station 3, a community similar to the upstream reference station was found. Results illustrate the need for careful consideration of the water quality and indicator organisms in restoration. Mitigation procedures suggested for the rubber effluent included, for example, the decolourization of the highly coloured effluent and biodegradation prior to discharge, were recommended.

AB  - A unified procedure is proposed in this study to analyze the free and transient vibration behaviors of a composite laminated beam subjected to general boundary conditions under thermal scenario. A general theoretical quasi 3D shear deformation beam model incorporating both the shear deformation and thickness stretching effects is derived using the Hamilton's principle. The coupling of axial-shear-flexural-stretching with the thermal stress and the Poisson's ratio effect is taken into account. The natural frequencies, mode shapes and transient responses of composite laminated beams are evaluated analytically by the method of reverberation ray matrix (MRRM). The inhomogeneous term and the artificial spring boundary technique are introduced in MRRM to acclimatize itself to the general boundary conditions and the impulse loads of arbitrary distributions. The validity, reliability and efficiency of the proposed analytical solutions are verified by comparing with the results obtained from the published studies and finite element simulation. A considerable number of parametrical studies for the composite laminated beams with different elastic restraint parameters, lamination schemes, geometry parameters, material properties as well as various temperature rises are also analyzed and discussed. The present procedure is powerful in terms of its applicability for different high-order shape functions including polynomial and non-polynomial, as well as thin and thick beams subjected to arbitrary boundary conditions in practical engineering.

AB  - Freshwater ostracods are important for interpreting the water quality of aquatic habitats. However, using ostracods in this way requires knowledge of their ecology and habitat preferences, particularly because species may show different responses to different ecological conditions. I documented ecological requirements of five ostracod species and their distribution in ten similar-sized lakes and reservoirs in Bolu, Turkey. Five species (Darwinula stevensoni, Cypria ophthalmica, Cypridopsis vidua, Cyclocypris ovum, Fabaeformiscandona fabaeformis) were found from natural lakes, while no ostracods were encountered from reservoirs. A canonical correspondence analysis suggested that salinity, temperature, redox potential, and pH were the four most influential factors on the species habitat preference in these lakes. These results were also supported with unweighted pair group mean averages (UPGMA) that also showed ostracod preference for certain ecological conditions in these lakes was mostly species-specific, depending on the changes in the levels of variables. UPGMA analysis for clustering of species and environmental data revealed three main species assemblages. The first group was represented by a single species, F. fabaeformis, whose occurrence was closely related to water hardness. The second group included two species, D. stevensoni and C ophthalmica, that were found in relatively alkaline waters with moderate temperature. The third group was represented by two species, C vidua and C ovum.

AB  - In this study, we assess the relationship between catchment land use/cover (LUC) and stream macroinvertebrate communities at multiple spatial scales to determine the relative influence of LUC on macroinvertebrates at each spatial scale. Our results indicate that LUC at subcatchment scales was a better predictor of macroinvertebrate communities than catchment-scale LUC. Furthermore, variation explained by catchment-scale LUC was statistically insignificant after removing variation explained by near-stream LUC. We attribute this to the clumped distribution of anthropogenic LUC within the narrow stream valleys of the study area. We conclude that LUC spatial distribution and measurement scale should be considered prior to in-depth analyses relating LUC to stream ecosystems.

AB  - The paper discusses the assessment of the exhaust emissions from heavy-duty vehicles following investigations under actual traffic conditions. The environmental characteristics presented thus far were mainly based on unit or road emissions. The paper presents an analysis of exhaust emissions referred to the harmful CO2, which was assumed as measure of correctness of the combustion process. The parameters determining this way are referred to as emission indexes. The research objects were 18-meter city buses fitted with three types of powertrains: conventional engine, hybrid (electric motor combined with a diesel engine) and a spark ignition engine fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG). All buses were Euro V-EEV compliant. The measurements were performed according to the SORT 2 driving test procedure on the test route within the Poznan agglomeration. Investigations performed under actual traffic conditions allow a true assessment of environmental performance of a given research object because they cover a much greater engine operating parameter variability range compared to laboratory and homologation tests. The performed road tests and their analysis led to conclusions related to the applicability of the developed method of emission assessment based on emission indexes for vehicles fitted with different powertrains.

AB  - The seasonal fluctuations in condition, nutrition and somatic energy content, and gonad development cycle were investigated in chub Leuciscus pyrenaicus from the headwaters of the Guadalete River, a freshwater ecosystem characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations in discharge and water level, temperature and food supply. The relationship between somatic stage and gonad cycle was also investigated and discussed. Condition, nutrition and somatic energy cycles could be divided into two distinct periods: from April to January with summer decreases and autumn increments, which is common for juveniles and mature fish; and from January to March, when juveniles and mature fish displayed different temporal variations related to the reproductive cycle. Gonad development took place from the end of the winter into the summer, the testes developing before the ovaries. Spawning started in late spring (May) and continued into summer (June and July), with fish quiescent by autumn (September). The results suggest that, for L. pyrenaicus, both environmental factors (e.g. food supply, water temperature) and reproduction needs affect the condition, nutrition and somatic energy storage of fish, which have been used as indicators of the physiological status of the population.

AB  - The geo-environmental impact of anthropogenic activities in Jinshazhou area is predicted by assessing the geo-environmental problems susceptibility under the condition of nature and anthropogenic activities in the study. An evaluation factor system including natural and anthropogenic factors is setup and the principal component analysis-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is selected. Results are shown in four grades, including very low, low, high, and very high. Under the natural condition, the very low, low, high, and very high susceptible regions of geo-environmental problems take up 67.73%, 0.71%, 7.30%, and 24.26%, respectively. Under the condition of anthropogenic activities, the very low, low, high, and very high susceptible regions of geo-environmental problems take up 69.18%, 5.88%, 5.88%, and 19.06%, respectively. Comparing the susceptibility of geo-environmental problems under two conditions, it can be predicted that there is a greatly negative impact of anthropogenic activities in the southern surrounding region of Jinshazhou tunnel; while in the north of the study area, such as Poly West Coast, anthropogenic activities have a positive impact on geo-environment. The present distribution of geo-environmental problems has shown that the new evaluation technique system can be successfully applied to predict the urban geo-environmental impact of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Freshwater ostracods (Crustacea, Ostracoda) are valuable biological indicators. In Arctic environments, their habitat conditions are barely known and the abundance and diversity of ostracods is documented only in scattered records with incomplete ecological characterization. To determine the taxonomic range of ostracod assemblages and their habitat conditions in polygon ponds in the Indigirka Lowland, north-east Siberia, we collected more than 100 living ostracod individuals per site with a plankton net (mesh size 65 mm) and an exhaustor system from 27 water bodies and studied them in the context of substrate and hydrochemical data. During the summer of 2011, a single pond site and its ostracod population was selected for special study. This first record of the ostracod fauna in the Indigirka Lowland comprises eight species and three additional taxa. Fabaeformiscandona krochini and F. groenlandica were documented for the first time in continental Siberia. Repeated sampling of a low-centre polygon pond yielded insights into the population dynamics of F. pedata. We identified air temperature and precipitation as the main external drivers of water temperatures, water levels, ion concentrations and water stable isotope composition on diurnal and seasonal scales.

AB  - Aquatic insects are very important due to their ability to serve like environmental bio-indictors. In this study, we evaluated the actual environmental situation of ecosystem in the Ishemi and Shkumbini river deltas, by analysing the biodiversity of dragonfly (pilivesa) Odonata (order Odonata, class Insects, type Arthropoda). The biological material was collected during the period 2007-2008. Data collected have figured out on both areas: 23 species, 15 genera and 8 families of Odonata. The most represented group is Anisoptera with 15 species and frequency 62.51%. The Libellulidae is the most represented family with 8 species and frequency 34.78%. The ecosystem surrounding the Shkumbini delta river shows a higher diversity, properly with 18 species and frequency 78.26%, while those of the ecosystem of Ishemi delta river present a lower diversity, of 10 species and frequency 43.47%. That is an indication that the Ishemi delta river is more polluted compared to that of the Shkumbini delta river, hence not offering optimum conditions for Odonata species, which look for highly conservation habitats. In both areas are encountered only 6 common species, and the 'Jaccard index of similarity coefficient' was 26.08%, which is an indication of different conditions of environmental quality for these bioindicator species.

AB  - Nematodes, the earth's most abundant metazoa, are ubiquitous in the soil environment. They are sufficiently large to be identifiable by light microscopy and sufficiently small to inhabit water films surrounding soil particles. They aggregate around and in food sources. They include component taxa of the soil food web at several trophic levels. They can be categorized into functional guilds whose members respond similarly to food web enrichment and to environmental perturbation and recovery. Indices derived through nematode faunal analysis provide bioindicators for disturbance of the soil environment and condition of the soil food web. We enhance the resolution of faunal analyses by providing a weighting system for the indicator importance of the presence and abundance of each functional guild in relation to enrichment and structure of the food web. Graphical representations of food web structure, based on nematode faunal analyses, allow diagnostic interpretation of its condition. Simple ratios of the weighted abundance of representatives of specific functional guilds provide useful indicators of food web structure, enrichment, and decomposition channels.

AB  - yRivers host a wealth of biodiversity and play critical ecological functions, so monitoring their environmental status and tracking its changes has paramount importance for appropriate management. Although some biological groups, and especially benthic macroinvertebrates, are employed routinely to achieve this goal, the quest for bioindicators of river quality is far from over, because finding further suitable organisms may improve indication performances and inform habitat management. Using organisms that are at risk for bioindication also fulfills the goal of providing important information for the conservation of the taxon (or taxa) used for bioindication. Bats are a diverse, threatened mammal group whose characteristics make them potentially suitable bioindicators in many ecosystem types, but research in this field is still limited. In this study, set in Central and Southern Italy, we hypothesize that assemblages of foraging bats will respond to environmental status and quality of riverine ecosystems and that therefore bats may serve as effective bioindicators. We established the environmental status of 50 sampling sites selected along 10 rivers using two indices officially adopted in the country, i.e. the STAR_ICMi (evaluating water quality from macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages) and the fluvial functionality index (Indite di Funzionalita Fluviale, IFF), which incorporates several biotic and abiotic components and represents a functional indicator of river ecosystem health. At the sampling sites, we also recorded bat activity with operator-independent real-time bat recorders and classified bat passes to species or phonic groups. We examined 167,371 macroinvertebrates and 55,157 bat passes, corresponding to 15 species or phonic groups. The activity of Miniopterus schreibersii/Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis daubentonii/capaccinii declined with increasing values of STAR_ICMi and IFF, while the activity of Nyctalus/Eptesicus serotinus increased with both indices. The activity of P. kuhlii also declined as IFF values increased, while we observed the opposite for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis emarginatus, Myotis nattereri and Barbastella barbastellus. Pooling together species whose activity respectively increased or decreased as the values of quality indices increased improved indication performances by strengthening statistical significance. Our work constitutes a significant step towards the use of bats as bioindicators in river ecosystems as we show that differences in bat activity may reveal changes in environmental conditions and may thus demonstrate the effects of habitat alteration on the river biota. We highlight that locally adapted bat populations may show differences in foraging behaviour and food preferences; hence our findings warrant confirmation from other regions. Further constraints are given by the variable degree of taxonomic resolution achieved in bat sound analysis, which may represent an issue especially in species-rich bat assemblages such as those of southern Europe.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities are often used to assess the ecological integrity of streams. However, conventional methods involving morphometric identification of macroinvertebrates are usually costly and time-consuming. Here we compare stream macroinvertebrate community metrics based on conventional morphometrics vs. non-destructive DNA metabarcoding from storage ethanol to assess forest management impacts on headwater streams across a gradient of intensively managed forest catchments in eastern Canada. The two approaches demonstrated substantial congruence in the detection of taxa (81% and 69% at the family and genus level, respectively) and in the characterization of community composition and richness. However, DNA metabarcoding from preservative ethanol identified significantly fewer genera (3.3 on average, 15.9%) and families (2.0, 11.5%) than conventional morphometrics. Taxa missed by metabarcoding of storage ethanol were typically those low in proportional mass or poorly represented in the CO1 reference database. This led to some differences in the explanatory variables identified as being related to macroinvertebrate metrics, which could have implications on conclusions and management actions that might result therefrom. For example, the negative relationships between richness and reach-scale variables associated with forest management intensity were weaker when richness was based on metabarcoding as compared to conventional morphometrics. Discriminatory power was greater when data at the genus level were used. The congruence between functional feeding group results derived from morphometric (based on relative abundance) vs. metabarcoding (based on relative frequency and read abundance) identifications was group specific (r = 0.16-0.63), but low overall. We conclude that DNA metabarcoding of storage ethanol provides a promising approach for characterizing stream macroinvertebrate communities, but that its full deployment in biomonitoring projects requires developing more complete reference libraries and enhancing the sensitivity for detecting taxa with low sample biomass.

AB  - The Master Curve fracture toughness approach has been used in the USA for better defining the transition temperature fracture toughness of irradiated reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels for end-of-life (EOL) and EOL extension (EOLE) time periods. The first application was for the Kewaunee plant in which the life-limiting material was a circumferential weld metal. Fracture toughness testing of this weld metal corresponding to EOL and beyond EOLE was used to reassess the PTS screening value, RTPTS, and to develop new operating pressure-temperature curves. The NRC has approved this application using a shift-based methodology and higher safety margins than those proposed by the utility and its contractors. Beaver Valley Unit 1, a First Energy nuclear plant, has performed similar fracture toughness testing, but none of the testing has been conducted at EOL or EOLE at this time. Therefore, extrapolation of the life-limiting plate data to higher fluences is necessary, and the projections will be checked in the next decade by Master Curve fracture toughness testing of all of the Beaver Valley Unit I beltline materials (three plates and three welds) at fluences near or greater than EOLE. A supplemental surveillance capsule has been installed in the sister plant, Beaver Valley Unit 2, which has the capability of achieving a higher lead factor while operating under essentially the same environment. The Beaver Valley Unit I evaluation has been submitted to the NRC. This paper reviews the shift-based approach taken for the Beaver Valley Unit 1 RPV and presents the use of the RTT0 methodology (which evolved out of the Master Curve testing and endorsed through two ASME Code Cases). The applied margin accounts for uncertainties in the various material parameters. Discussion of a direct measurement of RTT0. approach, as originally submitted for the Kewaunee case, is also presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomolecular and hydrochemical tools were used to evaluate natural attenuation of chlorinated ethertes in a Quaternary alluvial aquifer located close to a historical source of large-scale tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination. Distinct stratification of redox zones was observed, despite the aquifer's small thickness (2.8 m). The uppermost zone of the target aquifer was characterised by oxygen- and nitrate reducing conditions, with mixed iron- to sulphate-reducing conditions dominant in the lower zone, along with indications of methanogenesis. Natural attenuation of PCE was strongly influenced by redox heterogeneity, while higher levels of PCE degradation coincided with iron- to sulphate reducing conditions. Next generation sequencing of the middle and/or lower zones identified anaerobic bacteria (Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes) associated with reductive dechlorination. The relative abundance of dechlorinators (Dehalococcoides mccartyi, Dehalobacter sp.) identified by real-time PCR in soil from the lower levels supports the hypothesis that there is a significant potential for reductive dechlorination of PCE. Local conditions were insufficiently reducing for rapid complete dechlorination of PCE to harmless ethene. For reliable assessment of natural attenuation, or when designing monitoring or remedial systems, vertical stratification of key biological and hydrochemical markers should be analysed as standard, even in shallow aquifers.

AB  - Bacteria employ a diverse array of strategies to survive under extreme environmental conditions but maintaining these adaptations comes at an energetic cost. If energy reserves drop too low, extremophiles may enter a dormant state to persist. We estimated bacterial dormancy and identified the environmental variables influencing our activity proxy in 10 hypersaline and freshwater lakes across the Western United States. Using ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios as an indicator for bacterial activity, we found that the proportion of the community exhibiting dormancy was 16% lower in hypersaline than freshwater lakes. Based on our indicator variable multiple regression results, saltier conditions in both freshwater and hypersaline lakes increased activity, suggesting that salinity was a robust environmental filter structuring bacterial activity in lake ecosystems. To a lesser degree, higher total phosphorus concentrations reduced dormancy in all lakes. Thus, even under extreme conditions, the competition for resources exerted pressure on activity. Within the compositionally distinct and less diverse hypersaline communities, abundant taxa were disproportionately active and localized in families Microbacteriaceae (Actinobacteria), Nitriliruptoraceae (Actinobacteria), and Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Our results are consistent with the view that hypersaline communities are able to capitalize on a seemingly more extreme, yet highly selective, set of conditions and finds that extremophiles may need dormancy less often to thrive and survive.

AB  - Resource managers at the state, federal, and tribal levels make decisions on a weekly to quarterly basis, and fishers operate on a similar timeframe. To determine the potential of a support tool for these efforts, a seasonal forecast system is experimented with here. JISAO's Seasonal Coastal Ocean Prediction of the Ecosystem (J-SCOPE) features dynamical downscaling of regional ocean conditions in Washington and Oregon waters using a combination of a high-resolution regional model with biogeochemistry and forecasts from NOAA's Climate Forecast System (CFS). Model performance and predictability were examined for sea surface temperature (SST), bottom temperature, bottom oxygen, pH, and aragonite saturation state through model hindcasts, reforecast, and forecast comparisons with observations. Results indicate J-SCOPE forecasts have measurable skill on seasonal timescales. Experiments suggest that seasonal forecasting of ocean conditions important for fisheries is possible with the right combination of components. Those components include regional predictability on seasonal timescales of the physical environment from a large-scale model, a high-resolution regional model with biogeochemistry that simulates seasonal conditions in hindcasts, a relationship with local stakeholders, and a real-time observational network. Multiple efforts and approaches in different regions would advance knowledge to provide additional tools to fishers and other stakeholders.

AB  - Effects of various environmental conditions on plant development and physiology were analysed in vitro on a tetraploid cultivar BF15. To preserve natural endogenic equilibrium, no growth regulators were added to the culture medium. Plants were submitted to different photoperiods, light intensities, light qualities and culture media. Their effects were analysed through morphological measurements (stem length, leaf area, node and usable node number) and biochemical assays (mean soluble protein content in upper and basal parts of stems). They provided good indicators of the development process, such as slow or rapid growth and aging.
   Three ways of development could be easily distinguished: (1) A 12 h/day photoperiod was a condition activating growth but retarding aging of the plants; other favouring agents were MS medium, low light intensity (L) and white fluorescent lighting (gro-), (2) Short days (8 h) were conditions opposing growth and inducing tuberization by accelerating aging, and (3) A 16 h/day photoperiod rapidly produced vigorous plants with large leaves but accelerated aging. The other factors increasing aging were: high light intensity (H), G medium (low nitrogen content) and Grolux fluorescent lighting (gro+)
   The effects of conditions (2) and (3) on plants are similar as far as aging and induction of tuberization are concerned.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment in coastal areas can lead to severe disturbances in marine ecosystems with implications on ecosystem functioning. The primary goal of this study was to understand the response of phytoplankton, from a region with intense upwelling events, to pulsed nutrient enrichments. A microcosm experiment using natural assemblages was conducted, following the addition of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and considering two different nutrient limitation conditions (N:P<16 and N:P>16). Laboratory work included the analysis of nutrients, as well as phytoplankton cell abundances. A fast response to the pulsed nutrient enrichments were observed in both treatments as biomass increased. Although higher biomass values were found under higher N concentrations, the community's composition was similar in both treatments. Centric diatoms, particularly Chaetoceros spp., strengthened their dominance, suggesting that, under these conditions, these may have physiological advantages that promote their growth over other groups. Throughout the experiment, phytoflagellates and pennate diatoms were common, while dinoflagellates were scarce. This study contributes to understanding how phytoplankton communities' growth and composition relate to nutrient pulses. These results provide relevant data for environmental quality assessment and management of marine environments.

AB  - The magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of hydrologic conditions regulate ecological processes in aquatic ecosystems. Conditions are typically characterized using annual-based hydrologic indices derived from daily and/or monthly stream flow data. In this study, we present an alternative approach to identify hydrologic indices based on storm hydrographs. Hydrologic indices derived from long-term daily flow data were compared to those from storm events for two headwater watersheds in Fort Benning, Georgia. Five hydrologic indices derived from daily flow data and storm events shared common features. Storm-based magnitude of mean peak discharge and mean response factor, frequency of bankfull discharge, rate of change in mean slopes of rising, and falling limb of the hydrograph were consistent with the results from long-term daily flow data. The annual flow increases and decreases were well matched by stormflow rising and falling. Both indicators showed one watershed having three times the response rates as compared to the other. Results suggested that select storm-based indices may be used as surrogates to the indices derived from long-term data.

AB  - 1. Species-based indices are frequently employed as surrogates for wider biodiversity health and measures of environmental condition. Species selection is crucial in determining an indicators metric value and hence the validity of the interpretation of ecosystem condition and function it provides, yet an objective process to identify appropriate indicator species is frequently lacking. 2. An effective indicator needs to (i) be representative, reflecting the status of wider biodiversity; (ii) be reactive, acting as early-warning systems for detrimental changes in environmental conditions; (iii) respond to change in a predictable way. We present an objective, niche-based approach for species' selection, founded on a coarse categorisation of species' niche space and key resource requirements, which ensures the resultant indicator has these key attributes. 3. We use UK farmland birds as a case study to demonstrate this approach, identifying an optimal indicator set containing 12 species. In contrast to the 19 species included in the farmland bird index (FBI), a key UK biodiversity indicator that contributes to one of the UK Government's headline indicators of sustainability, the niche space occupied by these species fully encompasses that occupied by the wider community of 62 species. 4. We demonstrate that the response of these 12 species to land-use change is a strong correlate to that of the wider farmland bird community. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of the index based on their population trends closely matches the population dynamics of the wider community. However, in both analyses, the magnitude of the change in our indicator was significantly greater, allowing this indicator to act as an early-warning system. 5. Ecological indicators are embedded in environmental management, sustainable development and biodiversity conservation policy and practice where they act as metrics against which progress towards national, regional and global targets can be measured. Adopting this niche-based approach for objective selection of indicator species will facilitate the development of sensitive and representative indices for a range of taxonomic groups, habitats and spatial scales.

AB  - Nutrient reduction measures have been already taken by wealthier countries to decrease nutrient loads to coastal waters, in most cases however, prior to having properly assessed their ecological effectiveness and their economic costs. In this paper we describe an original integrated impact assessment methodology to estimate the direct cost and the ecological performance of realistic nutrient reduction options to be applied in the Southern North Sea watershed to decrease eutrophication, visible as Phaeocystis blooms and foam deposits on the beaches. The mathematical tool couples the idealized biogeochemical GIS-based model of the river system (SENEQUE-RIVERSTRAHLER) implemented in the Eastern Channel/Southern North Sea watershed to the biogeochemical MIRO model describing Phaeocystis blooms in the marine domain. Model simulations explore how nutrient reduction options regarding diffuse and/or point sources in the watershed would affect the Phaeocystis colony spreading in the coastal area. The reference and prospective simulations are performed for the year 2000 characterized by mean meteorological conditions, and nutrient reduction scenarios include and compare upgrading of wastewater treatment plants and changes in agricultural practices including an idealized shift towards organic farming. A direct cost assessment is performed for each realistic nutrient reduction scenario. Further the reduction obtained for Phaeocystis blooms is assessed by comparison with ecological indicators (bloom magnitude and duration) and the cost for reducing foam events on the beaches is estimated. Uncertainty brought by the added effect of meteorological conditions (rainfall) on coastal eutrophication is discussed. It is concluded that the reduction obtained by implementing realistic environmental measures on the short-term is costly and insufficient to restore well-balanced nutrient conditions in the coastal area while the replacement of conventional agriculture by organic farming might be an option to consider in the nearby future.

AB  - The agricultural use of wastewater sludge promotes the recycling of nutrients and organic matter, bringing benefits to the plant development and the soil and water conservation. However, there is a growing concern about organic pollutants that may be in wastewater sludge. The presence of pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, tranquilizers, antiepileptics), hormones (natural and synthetic), musk fragrances, bactericides, and other organic pollutants in various environmental compartments is an emerging issue due to the lack of information on the potential impact associated with their occurrence, their fate and ecotoxicological effects. These compounds, termed emerging organic pollutants, may be removed during sewage treatment due to degradation, biological transformation, volatilization and/or sorption onto sludge particles. These processes are influenced by the physical-chemical properties of the pollutant and the conditions of sewage treatment. Information on physical and chemical characteristics, such as potential acidity and hydrophobicity, are important for understanding the patterns of removal and to adopt measures that favor the removal of these pollutants, such as changes in operating conditions and/or adoption of technologies. This literature review presents the physico-chemical emerging organic pollutants characteristics and their potential sorption on wastewater sludge.

AB  - A 300-year sediment record was used to investigate cladoceran community and phenotypic responses under extreme eutrophication process in the clay-turbid Mallusjarvi, a lake in southern Finland. The aims were to identify reference and disturbed communities, and to assess species and functional diversity and phenotypic characteristics as indices for lake ecological quality. The results showed that the oligomesotrophic reference status is characterized by rich planktonic and littoral-benthic assemblages with high species and functional diversity. Nutrient-enrichment, caused by increased agricultural activities in the catchment, was enhanced during the 19th century, inducing gradual responses in cladoceran community composition (decreasing benthic and increasing planktonic taxa) and functioning (decreasing invertebrate and increasing fish predation, decreasing species and functional diversity), and changes in phenotypic properties (decreasing body size of Bosmina longirostris and relative ephippial production). The disturbed state was characterized by eutrophic-hypereutrophic conditions and subsequent high abundance of planktonic cladocerans and deteriorated littoral-benthic conditions. Our results suggest that cladoceran communities, and their functional and phenotypic indices, are sensitive indicators of long-term limnological deterioration and ecosystem equilibrium.

AB  - In late July 2013, the Hercules 265 drilling rig in the Northern Gulf of Mexico experienced a catastrophic loss of control. Large quantities of natural gas spewed into the environment for similar to 2 days before the well self-sealed through down-hole collapse below the seafloor. Ecosystem Impacts of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) and collaborating Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) consortia mounted a rapid response cruise to characterize the waters around the Hercules 265 rig, beginning just 4 days after the blowout. Our analysis showed an immediate microbial response to the elevated concentrations of methane in the water column, as evidenced by the drawdown of oxygen to hypoxic conditions, the incorporation of methane-derived carbon into particles, and measurable rates of methane-assimilation and nitrogen-fixation. Additionally, radium isotope measurements allowed us to constrain the timescale of bottom water exposure to the influence of the rig. A second sampling by the Center for Integrated Modeling and Analysis of Gulf Ecosystems (C-IMAGE) consortium indicated that the ecosystem had returned to near pre-blowout conditions within one month.

AB  - Stream site classification is a fundamental step in defining reference conditions for freshwater bioassessments globally. Landscape regionalisation and stream typology approaches have both been used to determine classes that reduce inherent environmental variation and to show classes with ecological meaning. We evaluated the applicability of ecoregion and stream typology approaches in a river basin located between the Neotropical Savanna and the Atlantic Forest biomes in south-eastern Brazil. We delimited two ecoregions and assessed whether stream types within each ecoregion would further reduce environmental and macroinvertebrate assemblage variability. In addition, we determined indicator taxa for each of the reference condition classes. Our results confirm the importance of defining ecoregions a priori and for using a nested a posteriori stream typology approach for further explaining macroinvertebrate assemblage variation. Geology and natural vegetation physiognomy were the key ecoregion factors likely to influence macroinvertebrate assemblages, and stream dimension attributes best delimited meaningful stream types. Although stream classification is a very important step in any monitoring, management or restoration program, it has been widely neglected in many tropical regions. In this study we demonstrated how it can be conducted to determine macroinvertebrate assemblage potentials even with a relatively limited number of sites.

AB  - Coastal resource management revolves around defining the dynamic between people and the marine and coastal resources they use and depend upon for a large range of goods and services. The process of defining that dynamic is iterative and must account not only for changing natural resource conditions but also for changing social conditions. Decision-making therefore happens within a context of a social system that includes differing levels of capacity, commitment, economics, political mandates and pressures, and cultural and traditional frameworks. The aim of this paper is to introduce a hierarchical approach in which the large number of variables needed to measure the complex, numerous and abstract social concepts used to evaluate the delivery of ecosystem services can be aggregated into smaller sets of indicators, which can ultimately be aggregated into a single report card. These variables and indicators can identify and describe non-economic human dimensions societal benefits derived as ecosystem services that are readily collected, that can identify changes overtime, and are appropriate to specific coastal regions. The identified indicators would capture changes in the delivery of overall ecosystem services impacted by, or that will impact, changes in particular sets of environmental characteristics that are valued by society at large.

AB  - Olive farming represents an important source of income and employment in the rural areas of Andalusia (Spain), which is the most important olive oil-producing region in the world. Unfortunately, it also exerts significant environmental pressures with regard to soil erosion, use of polluting inputs, excessive water consumption and biodiversity reduction. This paper uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques and pressure distance functions to contribute a farm-level assessment of the eco-efficiency of a sample of 292 Andalusian olive farmers. We distinguish between managerial eco-efficiency and program eco-efficiency, the latter being associated to the different natural conditions prevailing in the three main olive cultivation systems in the region, namely, traditional rain-fed mountain groves, traditional rain-fed plain groves and irrigated intensive groves. Our findings show that eco-inefficient management is a widespread practice across olive farmers, mainly due to widespread technical inefficiency. Furthermore, the most eco-efficient production system is the traditional plain growing system. Finally, we find that soil-climate conditions strongly influence managerial eco-efficiency in all three aforementioned cultivation systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and concentrations of salts in surface water bodies can be affected by the natural environment and local human activities such as surface and ground water withdrawals, land use and energy extraction, and variability and long-term trends in atmospheric conditions including temperature and precipitation. Here, we quantify the relationship between 121 indicators of mean and extreme temperature and precipitation and 24 water quality parameters in 57 Texas reservoirs using observational data records covering the period 1960 to 2010. Over time scales ranging from 1week to 2years, we find that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, chloride, sulfate, and phosphorus all show consistent correlations with atmospheric predictors, including high and low temperature extremes, dry days, heavy precipitation events, and mean temperature and precipitation. Based on these relationships combined with regional climate projections, we expect climate change to increase water temperatures, decrease dissolved oxygen levels, decrease pH, increase specific conductance, and increase levels of sulfate and chloride in Texas reservoirs. Over decadal time scales, this may affect aquatic ecosystems in the reservoirs, including altering the risk of conditions conducive to algae occurrence, as well as affecting the quality of water available for human consumption and recreation.

AB  - Toxic elements often occur in the natural environment at doses higher than the maximum allowable concentration. The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is inextricably connected with the external environment, from which it obtains air and water and food. Bees are exposed to contaminants while collecting pollen, nectar, honeydew and water. Therefore, they are highly sensitive to all kinds of environmental pollution and water and air contamination. It is proven that there is a close relationship between the level of accumulation of heavy metals in soil and plants and their content in the bodies of bees and in bee products. Bees are good biological indicators of environmental contamination. At the same time, heavy metals accumulate in bee products that are later consumed by humans and animals. Research on the content of these metals in the bodies and brood of bees is extremely important because the increased use of chemicals in agriculture and other environmental factors, such as pollution with toxic elements, affect the health and mortality of bees. This paper provides an overview of studies on the harmfulness and bioaccumulation of lead, mercury and cadmium in the bodies of bees and on the impact of these elements on living organisms.

AB  - Detailed analysis of temperature indicators of Kremenchug reservoir in August showed a tendency to increase the coefficient of their variation (Cv=10.69-13.97%). This is indicated the unstability and stress of the temperature conditions of the aquatic environment for the living organisms. First of all, it affected the organisms of near-flood layers of water which are in direct contact with unstable air masses (Cv=28.45-31.45%). Blue-green algae species which were the most resistant to temperature fluctuations were Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. emend. Elenkin and Anabaena flos-aquae sp. Their maximum values were recorded in the water area near the village Chervona Sloboda. An impact of a temperature factor and a number of other abiotic factors leads to intensive water "bloom" and subsequent mass extinction of algae Cyanophyta. Hot sunny days with the air temperature up to 18-32 degrees C and water temperature of 21.0-25.8 degrees C are the most dangerous to aquatic biota. As a result of lethal consequences, significant amounts of the most sensitive species of aquatic living organisms fall out of the ecosystem: Noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) and Zander (Sander lucioperca). The obtained results could be partially explained by the global warming.

AB  - The article presents findings of recent ecological investigations into marine waters in Sevastopol region and overviews the main sources of water pollution in Sevastopol Bay and other parts of the coastal zone between capes Lukull and Foros. The work involved assessment of the position of Sewage Treatment Plant submarine outfalls, the volume of wastewater discharge, and the degree of its treatment. Side-scan sonar served to examine the condition of headwalls of sewage treatment plants in the region. The work considers the spatial distribution patterns of hydrological characteristics and currents and rising of effluent to the sea surface using autonomous buoys and mathematical simulation. Concentrations of nutrients, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and organic matter by biological oxygen demand BOD5 are determined based on historical data and results of recent research expeditions in 2016-2017. Nutrients do not exceed the Maximum Allowable Contamination levels, and no significant differences have been identified between different parts of Crimean coastal waters by the majority of indicators. Nonetheless, Yalta sea waters are recorded to contain larger quantities of silicates, while levels of petroleum hydrocarbons and organic matters exceed the standards on multiple occasions in Sevastopol district and in the Kerch Strait.

KW  - SUCCESSION
AB  - Surveys of both live and dead vegetation were conducted to examine long-term successional trends in old-growth white pine forest.  The forest successional trend, for a period of possibly up to seven centuries, shows that white pine has been the dominant species over this time period indicating that these old-growth white pine forests have been self-replacing.  Size-class analysis was used as an indicator of age-class structure.  Results of this analysis show that the old-growth white pine stands are at least partially uneven-aged.  The uneven-aged condition, resulting from continuous recruitment, was most likely facilitated by local disturbances such as small surface fires, windthrown trees and the death of large individual trees through biological or other agents.  These findings cast some doubt on the silvicultural theory that catastrophic fire is the only primary facilitator of natural white pine regeneration.  Selection logging in white pine forest may make better use of the various non-catastrophic mechanisms of natural white pine regeneration.  It is unlikely, however, that the old-growth condition can be maintained or enhanced under any cutting regime.  In addition to the production of fibre, old-growth forests are valuable components of the landscape from both a functional ecological perspective and a scientific perspective.

AB  - The Poyang Lake wetland in China is the largest wintering destination for Siberian cranes worldwide. Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of crane habitats is of great importance for ecological environment governance and biodiversity protection. The shallow water, grassland, and soft mudflat regions of the Poyang Lake wetland are ideal habitats for wintering Siberian cranes. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images, habitat areas were extracted and associated with various water levels taken on multiple dates. Landscape metrics were applied to describe the spatial structural characteristics of the crane habitats, and spatial statistics are used to explore the cold and hot spots of their distribution. Moreover, three indicators including sustainability, stability, and variety were applied to evaluate the vulnerability of the crane habitats under different hydrological conditions. Our findings indicate: (a) The main crane habitats exhibit a gradual decreasing degree of fragmentation in time, an obvious uncertainty of shape complexity and a relatively stable connectivity. (b) The crane habitats have a consistent spatial pattern of highly aggregated distributions associated with various water levels. (c) The hot spots of the habitats formed multiple "sheet" belts centered on the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions, while the cold spots indicate a spatial pattern of axial distributions. (d) The majority of the hot spots of the habitats were distributed in sub-lakes found in the southeast part of the Poyang Lake watershed and the Nanjishan and Wucheng nature reserves, while the cold spots were mainly distributed in the main channels of the basins of Poyang Lake. (e) The sustainable habitats were mainly distributed in the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions and intensively aggregated in two national nature reserves. (f) Under conditions of extremely low to average water levels (5.3-11.46 m), an increase of water level causes a decrease of the stability and variety of the crane habitats and weakens the aggregation structure.

AB  - Elemental sulfur (S(0)) is an important intermediate in the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur that is formed by chemical or biological oxidation of more reduced sulfur species. Given the restricted geochemical conditions under which S(0) should persist, the mechanisms whereby S(0) can be stabilized in the environment are not fully understood. Here we identify a process called "S(0) organomineralization", by which S(0) minerals are produced and stabilized following the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in the presence of numerous types of dissolved organics, including simple sugars and amino acids. The S(0) particles formed through this mechanism are closely associated with organics, which often form an envelope around the mineral. The organic envelopes are formed by self-assembly of the dissolved organic molecules in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen, and play in a role in the stabilization of S(0). Organic compound sulfurization probably plays an important role in the self-assembly mechanism, by causing the polymerization of relatively small dissolved organic molecules into solid, macromolecular, polymeric organics. The organomineralized S(0) particles present unique and complex morphologies, which are controlled by the type of dissolved organic compound present in the experimental media. Depending on the organics present, organomineralized S(0) can exist as different combinations of several crystal structures, including the non-thermodynamically stable beta- and gamma-S-8 allotropes, which are most likely stabilized by their close association with the organic phase. We propose that complex particle morphology combined with the presence of metastable S(0) allotropes could be used as a signature of S(0) organomineralization in natural settings. S(0) organomineralization was obtained in the laboratory under a wide range of experimental conditions that span across geochemical conditions which can be encountered in many sulfidic environments. It is possible that the reaction between reduced sulfur species and organics may significantly affect the production and preservation of S(0) in numerous natural systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microorganisms play a fundamental role in the functioning and stability of coral reef ecosystems. However, environmental disturbances can trigger alterations to the natural microbial community composition and their functional traits with potentially detrimental consequences for host organisms, such as corals, sponges and algae and concomitant implications for the entire coral reef ecosystem. Coral reefs are increasingly affected by localized impacts such as declining water quality and global pressures derived from human-induced climate change, which severely alters the natural conditions on reefs and can push dominating benthic life forms towards the limit of their resistance and resilience. Microorganisms can respond very rapidly to these altered environmental conditions so defining their natural variability over spatial and temporal gradients is critical for early and accurate identification of environmental disturbances. The rapid response of microbes to environmental change is likely to confer significant advantages over traditional reef monitoring methods, which are based on visual signs of health deterioration in benthic coral reef macroorganisms. This review discusses the potential of microbes as early warning indicators for environmental stress and coral reef health and proposes priorities for future research.

AB  - Measurement of population persistence is a long-standing problem in ecology; in particular, whether it is possible to gain insights into persistence without long time-series. Fractal measurements of spatial patterns, such as the Korcak exponent or boundary dimension, have been proposed as indicators of the persistence of underlying dynamics. Here we explore under what conditions a predictive relationship between fractal measures and persistence exists. We combine theoretical arguments with an aerial snapshot and time series from a long-term study of seagrass. For this form of vegetative growth, we find that the expected relationship between the Korcak exponent and persistence is evident at survey sites where the population return rate can be measured. This highlights a limitation of the use of power-law patch-size distributions and other indicators based on spatial snapshots. Moreover, our numeric simulations show that for a single species and a range of environmental conditions that the Korcak-persistence relationship provides a link between temporal dynamics and spatial pattern; however, this relationship is specific to demographic factors, so we cannot use this methodology to compare between species.

AB  - Background:The impact of selective thinning on forest diversity has been extensively studied in temperate and boreal regions. However, in the tropics, knowledge is still poor regarding the impacts of this silvicultural treatment on functional diversity, especially in tropical mountain forests, which are considered to be highly biodiverse ecosystems and also endangered by human activities. By evaluating the changes on functional diversity by using different indicators, hypothesizing that selective thinning significantly affects (directly or indirectly) tropical mountain forests, this work promotes sustainable ecosystem use.Methods:A total of 52 permanent plots of 2500 m(2)each were installed in a primary mountain forest in the San Francisco Biological Reserve to assess the impact of this silvicultural treatment. Selective thinning can be defined as a controlled process, in which trees that compete with ecologically and/or valuable timber species are progressively removed to stimulate the development of profitable ones, called potential crop trees (PCT). In doing so, the best specimens remain in the forest stand until their final harvest. After PCT selection, 30 plots were chosen for the intervention, while 22 plots served as control plots. The thinning intensity fluctuated between 4 and 56 trees ha(-1)(average 18.8 +/- 12.1 stems ha(-1)). Functional Diversity (FD) indices, including the community weighted mean (CWM), were determined based on six traits using the FD package implemented in R software. The difference between initial and final conditions of functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional evenness (FEve), functional dispersion (FDis), and Rao quadratic entropy (RaoQ) was modeled using linear mixed models (LMM). As fixed factors, we used all the predictors inherent to structural and ecological forest conditions before and after the selective thinning and as a random variable, we used the membership to nested sampling units.Results:Functional Richness (FRic) showed significant changes after selective thinning, the other indexes (FEve, FDis, FDiv, RaoQ) were only influenced by predictors related to ecological conditions and characteristics of the community.

AB  - The cell wall perturbants Calcofluor white and Zymolyase activate the Pkc1-Rho1-controlled Slt2p MAP kinase pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A downstream transcription factor of this pathway, Rlm1p, is known to control expression of about 20 cell wall-related genes. Global transcript analysis of Calcofluor white and Zymolyase treatment was performed to determine whether cell wall stress affects transcription of these and other genes. Transcript profiles were analysed using two recently developed algorithms, viz. REDUCE, which correlates upstream regulatory motifs with expression, and Quontology, which compares expression of genes from functional groups with overall gene expression. Both methods indicated upregulation of Rlm1p-controlled cell wall genes and STRE-controlled genes, and downregulation of ribosomal genes and rRNA genes. Comparison of these expression profiles with the published profiles of two constitutively active upstream activators of the Slt2p-MAP kinase pathway, viz. Pkc1-R398A and Rho1-Q68A, revealed significant similarity. In addition, a new putative regulatory motif, CCC(N)(10)GGC, was found. In Zymolyase -treated cells a regulatory site was identified, ATGACGT, which resembles the AFT/CRE binding site. Interestingly, Sko1p, a downstream regulator of the high osmolarity pathway is known to bind to the AFT/CRE binding site, suggesting a possible role for the Hog1 pathway in the response to cell wall stress. Finally, using REDUCE, an improved version of the Rlm1 binding motif, viz. TA(W)(4)TAGM, was discovered. We propose that this version can be used in combination with REDUCE as a sensitive indicator of cell wall stress. Taken together, our data indicate that cell wall stress results in activation of various signalling pathways including the cell wall integrity pathway. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In Upper Silesia in Poland, coal is still exploited intensively and mine dump reclamation and afforestation are important environmental mitigation activities. In this study, we analysed the survival rate and foliar nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) supply status and their quantitative relationships of two-year-old Scots pine, Norway spruce, Common oak and European beech at an early afforestation stage of a hard coal mine dump with topsoil. The conditions in the dump in the first years were particularly unfavorable for beech and spruce. The survival rate of seedlings varied between 93% for oak, 67% for pine, 30% for beech and 27% for spruce. Nutrient supply and their quantitative relationships in seedling foliage varied highly in all investigated species. The most deficient element was N; its content was lower than the accepted threshold for individual species under natural conditions. Of the soil properties analysed, electrolytic conductivity (EC) was strongly negatively correlated with foliar N and P. Thus, EC may be the factor with the highest negative effect on nutrient supply and the success of afforestation at early stages.

AB  - The goal or this study was to develop an in situ bioassay with Eisenia andrei, deploying it in several locations of an abandoned mining area. Our objectives were two-fold: (i) we intended to validate the in situ soil bioassay procedures, while (ii) providing ecologically relevant data to complement the ongoing risk evaluation based on laboratorial assays. To promote cost- and time-effectiveness, the in situ exposure was short (48h) and the endpoints analysed included oxidative stress biomarkers and metal content in soil and organisms. The bioassay was carried out under different experimental conditions, simulating local (natural soil) vs. control conditions (LUFA soil), and irrigation with artificial rainwater vs. irrigation with diluted acidic effluent. Variation in the data was mostly due to soil type, rather than irrigation water, and Substantial spatial heterogeneity was observed. Oxidative stress biomarkers did not fully work as sensitive parameters to environmental contain i nation. Earthworm metal burdens suggested a potential concern in terms of bioaccumulation of some metallic elements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of a model for assessing the impact and interactions of stressors in the ecosystem of Lake Koronia, based on fuzzy inference, is presented in this paper. The proposed fuzzy inference model assesses the synergistic interactions among several significant stressors on fish production. These stressors; include industrial pollution, pesticide and nutrient usage due to agricultural activities, and water level decrease due to irrigation works. Apart from the experts' knowledge, expressed in a set of fuzzy rules, a number of parameters such as pH, conductivity, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, and nitrate concentration were used as stressor indicators. The proposed model is capable of simulating the effect of a large variety of environmental conditions, and it can be used as a dynamic tool for ecosystem risk assessment since it produces both qualitative and quantitative results, allowing for comparisons of predictions with on-going observational research and ecosystem monitoring. Its operation was successfully verified for a number of different conditions, ranging from low stressor impact to high stressor impact (where, in fact, the fish production was diminished). Moreover, the proposed fuzzy inference model can be used as a tool for the investigation of the behavior of the aquatic ecosystem under a large number of hypothetical environmental risk scenarios.

AB  - We investigated the impact of the polyphenol tannic acid (TA) on the green algae Desmodesmus armatus and Scenedesmus vacuolatus and the diatom Stephanodiscus minutulus in order to find new diagnostic tools for allelopathic effects on phytoplankton. Esterase activity, membrane integrity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were tested using flow cytometry with specific fluorescent markers. For comparison, growth rate and photosynthesis, two variables known to be affected by TA, were evaluated. Algae were exposed to TA concentrations between 0.6 and 30 mu mol L-1 for 3, 14 and 24 h. A significant inhibition of esterase activity was detected at every time point in all three tested algal species at 30 mu mol L-1 TA and in most other treatments when TA concentrations exceeded 3 mu mol L-1. A significant production of ROS could also be detected in all three algal species, but only after a longer exposure period. Changes in membrane rigidity revealed no consistent patterns of enhancement or inhibition when tested with different TA concentrations, algal species and exposure time. Growth rates of all algae were significantly inhibited after 24 h, whereas D. armatus was the only species for which the photosynthetic yield did not decline.
   The effects on esterase activity and ROS production indicate a general influence of polyphenolic allelochemicals on phytoplankton, but also reveal patterns which vary between species, concentrations and exposure times. Changes in esterase activity were the most sensitive variable, and could be detected after short exposure periods and at naturally occurring concentrations. Thus, esterase activity may be a suitable variable for future investigations into the allelopathic effects of submerged macrophytes on phytoplankton. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocypodid crabs are important components of sandy beach ecosystems and potential indicators of environmental stress. This is the first study about Ocypode quadrata population on an equatorial, macrotidal, high-energy dissipative beach, located in the Amazon coast. The steady temperature and marked hydrological seasons in this region, along with a wide supralittoral extension, provide exceptional conditions for assessing the effect of rainfall on population structure and across shore distribution. Additionally, von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated in order to compare with other studied populations of this crab at higher latitudes (subtropical beaches). Burrow abundance had marked differences between the two hydrological seasons in the Amazon coast, with higher values related to higher rainfall. A bimodal burrow zonation was observed, with a significant relationship between burrow abundance and depth, which shows that burrows are generally less abundant and deeper under drier conditions. Growth parameters were similar to those on some subtropical areas, as opposed to some global, expected ecological trends. Large beach width and local climate were important factors to identify clear population trends, which implies that moisture affects the use of the space by these individuals.

AB  - The three rivers' source region (TRSR) located in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is an important ecological region of China for its location and high elevation. However, the ecological condition of the region is critical to water conservation and ecological security in China. Therefore, the present study focused on determining the environmental flow requirements (EFRs) of the Lancang (above Xiangda streamflow gauge), Yangtze (Zhimenda), and Yellow (Tangnaihai) Rivers, which will be helpful in the sustainable development of the region. Because of lacking ecological data, we used four hydrological methods (i.e., flow duration curve shifting, Tennant, flow duration curve analysis, and low flow index method) to assess the EFRs for the minimum and optimum eco-environmental conditions of these rivers. Since there was missing data on most gauges and we had streamflow data of only one gauge (Zhimenda) in the Yangtze headwater region, a hydrological model was applied to complete the missing data and simulate the streamflow data for the Tuotuo, DamChu, Chumar, and Tongtian Rivers for the estimation of the EFRs insides the region. The environmental flows of 118 m(3)/s (76% of mean annual flow, MAF), 312 m(3)/s (72% of MAF), 484 m(3)/s (77% of MAF) were determined for the conservation of the optimum riverine ecosystem and 67 m(3)/s (43% of MAF), 155 m(3)/s (36% of MAF), and 290 m(3)/s (47% of MAF) for the minimum eco-environmental conditions for the Lancang, Yangtze, Yellow Rivers, respectively. It was also noticed that low flow months (November to April) required more proportions of mean monthly flow than high flow months (May to October). These preliminary results will be very supportive of the water resources managers and policymakers in the case of any sustainable socio-economic development in the region.

AB  - The construction of reservoirs impacts upon freshwater ecosystems, since it changes the hydrodynamics of the entire system upstream and downstream of the dam due to flow control and changes in environmental conditions. We analyzed the temporal variation in the abundance of exogenous testate amoebae related to the suspended inorganic material in Neotropical floodplain lakes, downstream of a series of dams. Sampling was carried out between 2000 and 2012 in six lakes in the upper Parana River floodplain. The temporal variation in the abundance of the testate amoeba community was analyzed using the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis. Cucurbitella crateriformis, Protocucurbitella coroniformes, and C dentata f. quinquilobata had reduced population growth in higher concentrations of suspended inorganic material. On the other hand, Difflugia lobostoma, Centropyxis ecornis, and Difflugia pseudogramen populations increased under these conditions. These results showed that an increased flow of water could favor the growth of some populations due to the greater exchange of material between the lakes and the floodplain. The positive or negative responses could show better adaptation of the testate amoeba species to the planktonic environment. Furthermore, these results also highlighted the bioindicator role of these protozoa in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Studies using routinely gathered data increasingly show associations between area-level green space and health. However, the environment exposure measures often include only urban green space and there has been limited use of prescribing data as a proxy health indicator. This brief report presents a small-area ecological study of associations between natural environment (including private gardens and water) and the volume and cost of prescribing for cardiovascular conditions and depression in England, with confirmatory analysis using all-cause mortality (in adults aged 15-65 years). Using Besag, York and Mollie (BYM) models to adjust for known confounders and unaccounted-for spatial autocorrelation, we found a statistically significant association of lower mortality in areas with higher area density of natural environment, which was strongest in more deprived areas. There was some evidence of a positive association between cardiovascular prescribing and area density of natural environment, with a nonsignificant trend towards lower anti-depressant prescribing in areas with higher natural environment density. Apparently beneficial relationships between all cause mortality and natural environment were not observed for prescribing data, but we advocate further exploration focusing on prescribing for mental health and other conditions with plausible links.

AB  - Reliable condition indicators are necessary to perform effective diagnosis and prognosis. However, the vibration signals are often corrupted with non-Gaussian noise and rotating machines may operate under time-varying operating conditions. This impedes the application of conventional condition indicators. The synchronous average of the squared envelope is a relatively simple yet effective method to perform fault detection, fault identification and fault trending under constant and time-varying operating conditions. However, its performance is impeded by the presence of impulsive signal components attributed to impulsive noise or the presence of other damage modes in the machine. In this work, it is proposed that the synchronous median of the squared envelope should be used instead of the synchronous average of the squared envelope for gearbox fault diagnosis. It is shown on numerical and experimental datasets that the synchronous median is more robust to the presence of impulsive signal components and is therefore more reliable for estimating the condition of specific machine components.

AB  - The Galapagos Archipelago is located at the intersection of several major oceanographic features that produce diverse environmental conditions around the islands, and thus has the potential to serve as a natural laboratory for discerning the underlying environmental factors that structure marine microbial communities. Here we used quantitative metagenomics to characterize microbial communities in relation to archipelago marine habitats, and how those populations shift due to substantial environmental changes brought on by El Nino. Environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, inorganic dissolved nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied throughout the archipelago, revealing a diversity of potential microbial niches arising from upwelling, oligotrophic to eutrophic gradients, physical isolation, and potential island mass effects. The volumetric abundances of microbial community members shifted with these environmental changes and revealed several taxonomic indicators of different water masses. This included a transition from a Synechococcus dominated system in the west to an even mix of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus in the east, mirroring the archipelago's mesotrophic to oligotrophic and productivity gradients. Several flavobacteria groups displayed characteristic habitat distributions, including enrichment of Polaribacter and Tenacibaculum clades in the relatively nutrient rich western waters, Leeuwenhoekiella spp. that were enriched in the more nutrient-deplete central and eastern sites, and the streamlined MS024-2A group found to be abundant across all sites. During the 2015/16 El Nino event, both environmental conditions and microbial community composition were substantially altered, primarily on the western side of the archipelago due to the reduction of upwelling from the Equatorial Undercurrent. When the upwelling resumed, concentrations of inorganic nutrients and DOC at the western surface sites were more typical of mesopelagic depths. Correspondingly, Synechococcus abundances decreased by an order of magnitude, while groups associated with deeper water masses were enriched, including streamlined roseobacters HTCC2255 and HIMB11, Thioglobacaceae, methylotrophs (Methylophilaceae), archaea (Nitrosopumilaceae), and distinct subpopulations of Pelagibaceriales (SAR11 clade). These results provide a quantitative framework to connect community-wide microbial volumetric abundances to their environmental drivers, and thus incorporation into biogeochemical and ecological models.

AB  - Sustainable water basin management requires characterization of flow regime in river networks impacted by anthropogenic pressures. Flow regime in ungauged catchments under current, future, or natural conditions can be assessed with hydrological models. Developing hydrological models is, however, resource demanding such that decision makers might revert to models that have been developed for other purposes and are made available to them ('off-the-shelf' models). In this study, the impact of epistemic uncertainty of flow regime indicators on flow-ecological assessment was assessed at selected stations with drainage areas ranging from about 400 to almost 90,000 km(2) in four South European basins (Adige, Ebro, Evrotas and Sava). For each basin, at least two models were employed. Models differed in structure, data input, spatio-temporal resolution, and calibration strategy, reflecting the variety of conditions and purposes for which they were initially developed. The uncertainty of modelled flow regime was assessed by comparing the modelled hydrologic indicators of magnitude, timing, duration, frequency and rate of change to those obtained from observed flow. The results showed that modelled flow magnitude indicators at medium and high flows were generally reliable, whereas indicators for flow timing, duration, and rate of change were affected by large uncertainties, with correlation coefficients mostly below 0.50. These findings mirror uncertainty in flow regime indicators assessed with other methods, including from measured streamflow. The large indicator uncertainty may significantly affect assessment of ecological status in freshwater systems, particularly in ungauged catchments. Finally, flow-ecological assessments proved very sensitive to reference flow regime (i.e., without anthropogenic pressures). Model simulations could not adequately capture flow regime in the reference sites comprised in this study. The lack of reliable reference conditions may seriously hamper flow-ecological assessments. This study shows the pressing need for improving assessment of natural flow regime at pan-European scale. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) have been used as ecological indicators from long ago as they determine physiologic and metabolic potential of microbial communities and indicate the capability to adapt their metabolism to anthropogenic stressors or to changes in environmental conditions. Also, these profiles are proxies for functional diversity or functional traits of a microbial community, usually linked to the ecosystem functioning. However, statistical data analysis of CLPPs has turned out to be the main handicap in these studies. Specifically, the interference of inoculum density, the need to choose an optimal incubation time and the dif-ferent profiles obtained depending on the incubation time-point limits its usefulness. To this aim, we have developed a new approach for CLPP data analysis that considers the whole data set and dynamics of colour development along the incubation period. This approach is based on compositional data (CoDa) transformation, which reflects relative rather than absolute information, followed by repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance and data representation in a canonical variates plot. The approach has been tested by using CLPPs from real fluvial biofilm samples affected by seasonality, flow stress and different sediment depth conditions, and it has been compared to the most classic applied approaches until today (incubation fixed point or curve in-tegration, followed by a Principal Components Analysis). Our results highlight that the proposed approach (i) makes ecological interpretation of CLPPs more sensitive, (ii) clarifies differences between CLPPs even in si-tuations of marked seasonality while classical approaches provided confounding results, (iii) produces ecolo-gically meaningful results (i.e. the proposed approach showed significant differences in organic matter use capabilities among flow conditions and depth), and (iv) unifies the analysis methodology for CLPPs data. With this work we provide an R-script to be used in future studies.

AB  - Global change is altering fire frequency and severity in many regions across the world. In this work, we studied the impact of different frequency and severity regimes on the soil biochemical properties in burned areas with different environmental conditions. We selected three sites dominated by pine ecosystems along a Mediterranean-Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient, where we determined the fire frequency, and severity of the last wildfire. Four years after the last wildfire, we established 184 4 m(2) plots. In each plot, we collected a composed soil sample from a 3 cm depth, and measured several ecological variables potentially affected by the fire frequency and severity (cover of bare soil, cover of fine and coarse plant debris, cover of vegetation, and vegetation height). From each soil sample, we analyzed the enzymatic activities corresponding to the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (beta-glucosidase, urease, and acid-phosphatase, respectively), and the microbial biomass carbon. The results indicated that fire frequency only played a significant role in soil biochemical properties at the Mediterranean and Transition sites. Specifically, we found that increases in frequency contributed to increased urease and phosphatase activities (at the Transition site), as well as microbial biomass carbon (at the Mediterranean and Transition sites). In relation to burn severity, we found opposite patterns when comparing the Mediterranean and Oceanic sites. Specifically, increased severity significantly decreased beta-glucosidase, urease, and microbial biomass carbon at the Mediterranean site, whereas at the Oceanic one, severity significantly increased them. Burn severity also decreased microbial biomass carbon at the Transition site. Our results also indicated that, overall, fire frequency determined the studied ecological variables at the Mediterranean and Transition sites, but clear indirect effects on biochemical properties due to changes in ecological variables were not found. This study adds to the knowledge on the impact of shifts in fire regimes on soils in the current context of change.

AB  - The changes in diatom assemblages along an urban-to-rural gradient were characterized to assess the ecological status of the Sai Gon River, Vietnam. Diatoms and physico-chemical variables were measured at 10 stations during dry and rainy season. One-way ANOVA showed that diatom metrics and physicochemical variables were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the upper course sites and both the middle- and the lower sites. However, no significant differences were observed between the middle course sites and the lower course sites. Achnanthidium minutissimum and A. exigua were potential indicators of low nutrient in the upper course sites; Melosira granulata and Navicula viridula were preferred moderately eutrophic water in the middle course sites; while Navicula cryptocephala and Nitzschia palea were tolerant to very heavy pollution and dominant in the lower course sites. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) results showed that concentration of TSS, TN, TP, BOD5 and COD were the most important factors in structuring benthic diatom communities in the Sai Gon River. The results of this study indicated that diatom community was sensitive to changes in urban condition and could be used as an indicator of urbanization.

AB  - This article presents an approach that couples coastal ecosystem modeling with integrated environmental assessment methodologies to support coastal management. The focus is to support the development of an ecosystem approach to aquaculture management including interactions with watershed substance loading. A Chinese bay, with intense aquaculture and multiple catchment uses, and where significant modeling efforts were undertaken is used as a case study. The ecosystem model developed for this bay is used to run scenarios that test the local management strategy for nutrient reduction. The corresponding ecological and economic impacts of the managers' scenarios are analyzed by means of the Differential Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (Delta DPSIR) analysis. Emphasis is given to the analysis of the eutrophication process in the bay including present eutrophic condition and the expected changes due to the simulated scenarios. For this purpose, the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) screening model is a valuable tool to interpret and classify the data and model outputs regarding eutrophication condition and to evaluate the manageable level of the nutrient loading entering in the bay.

AB  - Freshwater lakes encounter a series of problems, such as a decline in lake water quality, a sharp decrease in biodiversity, and ecological degradation. As such, lacustrine studies by highly skilled professionals and managers with water resources at home and abroad have focused on assessing the aquatic ecosystem health status of lakes. In this study, the health status of the aquatic ecosystem in the largest freshwater lake in China (Poyang Lake) was assessed, and its temporal and spatial characteristics were illustrated. The index contained three element layers, including hydrologic characteristics, trophic status, and aquatic organisms. The health status of the aquatic ecosystem was classified into three categories: 'good', 'moderate' (subhealthy), and 'bad'. It was examined through extension evaluation method. Results showed 'moderate' health status, whereas remarkable seasonal and spatially variations. The annual changes in the health status were remarkably due to the influence of complex hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions. This study provides an overall understanding of the aquatic ecosystem evaluation in Poyang Lake. Such an understanding is vital for environmental conservation and identification of causes of the aquatic ecosystem degradation in Poyang Lake.

AB  - We investigated monomethylmercury (MMHg) bioaccumulation in lakes across a 30 degrees latitudinal gradient in eastern Canada to test the hypothesis that climate-related environmental conditions affect the sensitivity of Arctic lakes to atmospheric mercury contamination. Aquatic invertebrates (chironomid larvae, zooplankton), provided indicators of MMHg, bioaccumulation near the base of benthic and planktonic food chains. In step with published data showing latitudinal declines in atmospheric mercury deposition in Canada, we observed lower total mercury concentrations in water and sediment of higher latitude lakes. Despite latitudinal declines of inorganic mercury exposure, MMHg bioaccumulation in aquatic invertebrates did not concomitantly decline. Arctic lakes with greater MMHg in aquatic invertebrates either had (1) higher water MMHg concentrations (reflecting ecosystem MMHg production) or (2) low water concentrations of MMHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll, and total nitrogen (reflecting lake sensitivity). The MMHg:DOC ratio of surface water was a strong predictor of lake sensitivity to mercury contamination. Bioaccumulation factors for biofilms and seston in Arctic lakes showed more efficient uptake of MMHg in low DOC systems. Environmental conditions associated with low biological production in Arctic lakes and their watersheds increased the sensitivity of lakes to MMHg.

AB  - Understorey communities can dominate forest plant diversity and strongly affect forest ecosystem structure and function. Understoreys often respond sensitively but inconsistently to drivers of ecological change, including nitrogen (N) deposition. Nitrogen deposition effects, reflected in the concept of critical loads, vary greatly not only among species and guilds, but also among forest types. Here, we characterize such context dependency as driven by differences in the amounts and forms of deposited N, cumulative deposition, the filtering of N by overstoreys, and available plant species pools. Nitrogen effects on understorey trajectories can also vary due to differences in surrounding landscape conditions; ambient browsing pressure; soils and geology; other environmental factors controlling plant growth; and, historical and current disturbance/management regimes. The number of these factors and their potentially complex interactions complicate our efforts to make simple predictions about how N deposition affects forest understoreys. We review the literature to examine evidence for context dependency in N deposition effects on forest understoreys. We also use data from 1814 European temperate forest plots to test the ability of multi-level models to characterize context-dependent understorey responses across sites that differ in levels of N deposition, community composition, local conditions and management history. This analysis demonstrated that historical management, and plot location on light and pH-fertility gradients, significantly affect how understorey communities respond to N deposition. We conclude that species' and communities' responses to N deposition, and thus the determination of critical loads, vary greatly depending on environmental contexts. This complicates our efforts to predict how N deposition will affect forest understoreys and thus how best to conserve and restore understorey biodiversity. To reduce uncertainty and incorporate context dependency in critical load setting, we should assemble data on underlying environmental conditions, conduct globally distributed field experiments, and analyse a wider range of habitat types.

AB  - 1. Soft-water, oligotrophic isoetid lakes are vulnerable to eutrophication, acidification and alkalinization. As a result of these pressures it large proportion have undergone Substantial deterioration in several European Countries. The understanding of these systems has been limited by either a lack of lakes close to natural conditions or through receiving less focus in broader scale macrophyte Surveys. This has resulted in a dearth of information on specific lake types in their natural condition. Sixty-eight soft-water lakes in Ireland were Studied in order to achieve a better understanding of the biological and environmental conditions defining Such lakes.
   2. Eight groups of lakes were identified using cluster analysis and indicator species analysis. Three groups were representative of isoetid-rich lakes displaying a high frequency of occurrence of Isoetes lacustris. Lobelia dortmanna or Eriocaulon aquaticum together with the almost ubiquitous Littorella uniflora. Canonical variates analysis indicated that alkalinity. total phosphorus (TP), catchment area, altitude, moors and heathlands, mean transect depth. colour and lake area were significant variables discriminating among the eight groups. Soft-water lakes with high amounts of isoetids tended to be less exposed, have broad shallow littoral zones with a high transparency and be situated in smaller catchments. Total phosphorus and alkalinity were typically low, although one group of isoetid-rich lakes had higher mean TP and alkalinity values. This group may contain lakes under threat from nutrient enrichment and alkalinization and also lakes that have higher TP and alkalinity naturally.
   3. Lakes with a prevalence of isoetids supported a greater diversity of macrophytes and chironomids indicating that Such lakes may represent suitable conservation targets as they act as surrogates for soft-water lakes of high biodiversity. Other factors favouring a focus on isoetids in conservation strategies are their importance as a functional component in soft-water lakes and their sensitivity to lake and catchment environmental change.

AB  - In Costa Rica, the environmental flow corresponds to 10% of the average river flow. This percentage has lacked of scientific basis in relation to the fluvial conditions suitable for preserving the ecosystems present in the river. Water concessions for the main uses (human, agricultural and hydroelectric) have caused environmental damages, transforming the physical and chemical conditions of the channels. Of the water flow of the Birris River, 20% is granted for consumptive use as agricultural, human and irrigation production, and the rest is used for hydroelectric generation. Due to the low quality of its waters to date there are no indicator species that makes it impossible to use approaches that take into account ecosystems to generate preference curves. The present work used a hydrological approach to determine the environmental flow of the Birris River using the flow duration curve methodology. It is based on the analysis of series of climate data obtained for 10 years and series of daily flows from a period of three years. Three outflows of biota and flow were made in three points distributed along the main channel distributed over a period of one year. Finally, the environmental flow was determined based on the flow regime of the average monthly values.

AB  - The submerged macrophyte vegetation of lakes created after enclosing former estuaries, situated in the central and south-western part of the Netherlands, has been monitored annually from 1992 onwards. Between 1992 and 2004, pronounced changes in overall cover and species composition of the submerged vegetation have occurred, resulting from changes of water quality and morphology in the lakes. In most cases vegetation cover and species diversity increased or remained stable, with the exception of two lakes in the southwest part of the country. Abundance and species composition were assessed according to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, using the assessment procedure proposed to assess macrophytes in natural water bodies in the Netherlands. The assessment procedure included calculation of the 'ecological quality ratio' (EQR) for each of eleven water bodies in each of 13 years, based on transect monitoring data. The EQR indicating Good Ecological Status for Macrophytes was achieved in only three of the lakes. The consequences of hydromorphological modifications, and measures necessary to achieve the desired condition are discussed. Nutrient concentrations should be reduced further, while additional management measures are necessary to improve conditions for macrophytes.

AB  - Uncertainty in projections of future climate, along with a need for policy makers and management to respond to change in climate, highlight the importance of the detection of trends in climatological time series. Selected indicators of regional climate status and change may well be related to indicators of ecological condition. Climate factors are known to stress ecosystems. With the identification and description of trends in biologically important climate descriptors this knowledge could be used to provide scenarios of biological changes. One aspect of climate which stresses forest ecosystems is described by the annual date of the last hard spring-freeze (minimum temperature less than or equal to -2.2 degrees C). Averaged for New England, there was a significant linear trend indicating an earlier initiation of frost-free conditions (negative slope) for the period 1961-1990.
   Significant time trends were detected locally at stations throughout much of the New England regions as well. Temporal discontinuities in trend, spatial relationships, and urban influence were considered. The presence of trends in time does not appear to be related to geographical location. The direction of trend (positive or negative) exhibits some geographical coherency, which may be related to climatological variables such as percentage of possible sunshine and cloud cover.

AB  - Although many studies have described the influence of bivalve aquaculture on the benthic environment, effects on benthic functional diversity are poorly known, as are links with ecosystem processes. We investigated the response of a benthic ecosystem in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity (infauna >500 mu m), biogeochemical indicators (organic matter content, redox potential, sulfides level, bacteria) and metabolism (nutrient fluxes), subjected to various levels of mussel biodeposition as a general model of organic enrichment. Results show that local benthic conditions may recover fairly quickly depending on environmental conditions whereas modifications of the benthic community structure persist over a longer time scale with an impact on benthic ecosystem functioning. Fauna-mediated oxidation of the sediment likely increased nitrogen recycling through nitrification whereas binding and release of phosphorus to the water column seems to be driven by more complex processes. Results highlight the importance of species identity (ecological traits) on biogeochemical cycling and solute exchange across the sediment-water interface, with implications for the ecological functioning of exploited areas.

AB  - Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and, more recently, potassium (K) have been examined in ecological stoichiometry because they are the most abundant elements in organic matter. An increasing number of studies are investigating the potential responses of plants to future global climate change scenarios, and although warming and drought may greatly influence ecosystem function and services, their combined effects on C:N:P:K stoichiometry remain unknown. In the present study, we assessed the stoichiometry of a major subtropical tree species Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook, in southern China in terms of its responses to warming and drought stresses. To measure C, N, P, and K concentrations, C:N:P:K stoichiometric ratios, and stable isotope abundance, we sampled C. lanceolata needles from seedlings subject to four treatments: control (CT), warming (W, with 5 degrees C increase in temperature), drought (D, with 50% decrease in precipitation), and the abovementioned warming and drought conditions combined (WD). The warming and drought conditions applied simulated the climate changes predicted for the next decades in southern China. We found that variations in foliar C:N:P:K stoichiometric ratios were driven by changes in nutrient concentration, season, and treatment. Unexpectedly, differences in foliar intrinsic water use efficiency across sampling seasons were not significant. The WD conditions increased foliar N concentration (57%) and the delta N-15 value (111%) across the different seasons, and significant interactive effects between warming and drought on foliar N concentration and delta N-15 were clearly demonstrated. The N cycle is likely to accelerate in subtropical forests, with more of the "heavier" N being mobilized for plant use, and thus the combination of warming plus drought may alleviate plant N restrictions in the future. Thus, foliar delta N-15 might be used as an indicator of the changes in N cycling in C. lanceolata forests.

AB  - Newly abandoned rain-fed lands, due to soil quality decline, are the main sources for soil erosion in semi-dry lands agricultural hill-slopes. However, adopting compatible environmentally friend measures have not been adequately implemented. Following various resultful laboratory studies, in this paper, we assessed the effect of field inoculation of cyanobacteria in an abandoned rain-fed land on controlling the natural rainfall-induced soil loss and improving the biological soil crust (BSC) quality mixture of two cyanobacteria (viz. Nostoc sp. and Oscilatoria sp.). The cyanobacteria were inoculated on 22.1 m x 1.83 m-sized plots located on the study hill-slope. The experiment was carried out for a rainfall period of 6 months under natural conditions. Measurements of 7 erosive rainfalls showed a considerable soil loss (i.e., 0.88 +/- 0.10 to 9.79 +/- 1.60 g m(-2)) from the un-inoculated plots (control), while cyanobacteria decreased the soil loss by 36 to 57% in comparison with those recorded for the control. Soil losses in the inoculated plots were 2.39 +/- 0.24, 4.8 +/- 0.58, 3.32 +/- 0.33, 1.49 +/- 0.12, 0.87 +/- 0.12, 0.52 +/- 0.05, and 0.56 +/- 0.08 g m(-2), from the first to last rainstorms, respectively. Our results, therefore, showed a poor linear relationship between soil loss (from both treatments) and rainfall properties. Cyanobacteria also improved organic carbon and nitrogen contents as two important BSC quality indicators to the tunes of 32 and 56%, respectively, in comparison to the control, during the study period. In winter, when environmental conditions were inappropriate for growing vegetation, the effect of cyanobacteria on soil loss reduction was found to be more tangible in comparison with spring. On the whole, our field soil inoculation under uncontrolled conditions, as pioneering research, facilitated to promising results for large-scale use of cyanobacteria to rapidly restore abandoned rain-fed lands.

AB  - Mid- to high-latitude peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon stock but become carbon sources during droughts, which are increasingly frequent as a result of climate warming. A critical question within this context is the sensitivity to drought of peatland microbial food webs. Microbiota drive key ecological and biogeochemical processes, but their response to drought is likely to impact these processes. Peatland food webs have, however, been little studied, especially the response of microbial predators. We studied the response of microbial predators (testate amoebae, ciliates, rotifers, and nematodes) living in Sphagnum moss carpet to droughts, and their influence on lower trophic levels and on related microbial enzyme activity. We assessed the impact of reduced water availability on microbial predators in two peatlands using experimental (Linje mire, Poland) and natural (Forbonnet mire, France) water level gradients, reflecting a sudden change in moisture regime (Linje), and a typically drier environment (Forbonnet). The sensitivity of different microbial groups to drought was size dependent; large sized microbiota such as testate amoebae declined most under dry conditions (-41% in Forbonnet and -80% in Linje). These shifts caused a decrease in the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). We related microbial enzymatic activity to PPMR; we found that a decrease in PPMR can have divergent effects on microbial enzymatic activity. In a community adapted to drier conditions, decreasing PPMR stimulated microbial enzyme activity, while in extreme drought experiment, it reduced microbial activity. These results suggest that microbial enzymatic activity resulting from food web structure is optimal only within a certain range of PPMR, and that different trophic mechanisms are involved in the response of peatlands to droughts. Our findings confirm the importance of large microbial consumers living at the surface of peatlands on the functioning of peatlands, and illustrate their value as early warning indicators of change.

AB  - Decomposition of organic matter, a fundamental ecological process, has been proposed to be used as a functional indicator of stream condition. A recently published protocol for the use of the cotton-strip assay as a standardized measure of decomposition rates provided a basis for the use of decomposition as an indicator. However, some factors that may influence the application of the cotton-strip assay, such as the deployment season, remain largely unexplored. To further establish the technique, we studied temporal and spatial variability in cotton-strip decomposition rates along small upland rivers in SE Australia. We found a consistent longitudinal pattern in decomposition rates throughout the year, in spite of large within-site and site-specific temporal variability. Results from the models of temporal variability in decomposition rates indicate that differences in the duration of incubation might have been a confounding variable. Models of spatial variability in decomposition rates explained 45% and 52% of the variability in decomposition rates across five rivers, with diel temperature range being the most important predictor, accounting for ca. 20% of the variability in decomposition rates. We have shown that additional considerations are needed, if decomposition rates are to be compared across spatial and temporal scales. First, large within-site variability in decomposition rates, found in our and other studies, might prevent comparisons with reference conditions. Second, the length (and therefore the season) of cotton-strip deployment needs to be specified, since the exponential decomposition coefficient appears not to be a constant throughout time. Third, diel temperature range needs to be considered when establishing sampling protocols, since the exponential decay coefficient appears to change non-linearly with changing temperature, and therefore, using only daily mean temperatures does not realistically reflect the effect of temperature. The importance of temperature range also has implications for stream rehabilitation, showing that restoring the temperature regime contributes to the restoration of a fundamental ecosystem process.

AB  - The occurrence and spread of halophilic diatom taxa in freshwater lotic ecosystems are influenced both by natural processes and anthropogenic pollution. Diatom assemblages were regularly monitored in lowland lotic systems in Hungary (Central Europe) during the unusually dry year of 2012. Highly pronounced changes in diatom composition were observed from spring to autumn. Halophilic taxa (especially Nitzschia sensu lato species) appeared in the dry autumn. In addition, the total relative abundances of halophilic species also increased up to autumn. Abundance of Nitzschia cf. lorenziana and Nitzschia tryblionella showed a positive correlation with chloride and phosphate concentration, while that of other taxa like Tryblionella apiculata or Tryblionella calida showed a positive correlation with the concentration of nitrate. Our findings clearly demonstrated that these halophilic and mesohalophilic diatom taxa were sensitive indicators of even short-term changes in lowland lotic ecosystems, such as the increasing salt concentration from spring to autumn caused by the lack of rainfall and/or environmental loads.

AB  - Knowledge of forest functioning is important for sustainable forest management and conservation. The growth variation of standardised plants (phytometers) can serve as a measure of ecosystem functions and provide a link with soil biotic and edaphic conditions.
   We aimed to test experimentally how forest edaphic conditions and different soil symbiotic fungal guilds, their diversity and relative abundance affect the growth of herbaceous phytometer. We explored whether phytometer growth differs among three types of soils: i) natural (established fungal community), ii) sterilised by gamma-irradiation, iii) sterilised and inoculated with natural soil (successional fungal communities). We analysed soil samples from 100 old-growth boreo-nemoral forests in Southern Estonia. We used environmental DNA to evaluate the diversity and relative abundance of the following fungal guilds: arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), ectomycorrhizal (ECM), pathogenic, and saprotrophic fungi. Phytometer (Hordeum vulgare) was grown under controlled greenhouse conditions for three weeks on differently treated (natural, sterilised, inoculated) soils from all sites. Phytometer growth did not differ among treatments. Nevertheless, differently treated forest soils in interaction with fungal diversity measures often had a significant relationship with phytometer growth.
   Phytometer biomass was lower in successional communities with high pathogen diversity, which were counterbalanced by mutualists in established communities of natural soils. A positive relationship of phytometer growth with the diversity of forest-specific symbionts (ECM fungi) likely demonstrated the overall "health" of forest soils. The diversity of AM fungi was surprisingly negatively related to phytometer growth. However, the abundance of AM fungi showed a positive association with phytometer growth in successional communities.
   We demonstrate that phytometer growth was related to soil fungal diversity depending on the presence and successional status of soil biota. Our study highlights that a herbaceous phytometer can be a quick, undemanding and affordable indicator of the status of forest soil biota. Healthy habitat-specific fungal communities are crucial for forest functioning and should be considered in management.

AB  - The cultivation of alfalfa has an essential role in ensuring the required fodder, but the achievement of cropping performances e.g. proper yield persistence, winter hardiness, competition capacity, ecological plasticity, depends on a multitude of technological, environmental, and genetic factors. The selection of suitable varieties for cultivation in pure stands or more perennial and productive mixtures with other perennial legumes and grasses is a key element for a successful crop. The objective of the study was to characterize the bio-productive and forage quality performances of 18 alfalfa varieties available for cultivation in Romania, originating from Romania and abroad. in the eco-climatic conditions specific to the Romanian Plain. The screening of these performances that substantiate the appreciation of the biological yield was based on detailed experiences in the field and laboratory. A set of representative indicators was selected for measurements, determinations, and observations, including growth rate, tillering, leaf:stem ratio, forage quality indicator. average crop yield and canopy height. It was found that Romanian varieties presented improved ecological plasticity compared to the foreign varieties in the eco-climatic conditions of the experimental site.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the efficiency of environmental policies and resource allocations. An assumption of the basic DEA model is that decisionmakers operate within homogeneous environments. But, this assumption is not valid when environmental performance is influenced by variables beyond managerial control. Understanding the influence of these variables is important to distinguish between characterizing environmental conditions and identifying opportunities to improve environmental performance. While environmental assessments often focus on characterizing conditions, the point of using DEA is to identify opportunities to improve environmental performance and thereby prevent (or rectify) an inefficient allocation of resources. We examine the role of exogenous variables such as climate, hydrology, and topography in producing environmental impacts such as deposition, runoff, invasive species, and forest fragmentation within the United States Mid-Atlantic region. We apply a four-stage procedure to adjust environmental impacts in a DEA model that seeks to minimize environmental impacts while obtaining given levels of socioeconomic outcomes. The approach creates a performance index that bundles multiple indicators while adjusting for variables that are outside management control, offering numerous advantages for environmental assessment.

AB  - The knowledge of natural spatial patterns of variability is crucial to discriminate between natural changes and human-induced effects and to plan monitoring programs and impact evaluation studies. The present study aimed at estimating the spatial variability of coralligenous habitat, one of the main important habitats of the Mediterranean Sea, at several spatial scales. Specifically, the following hypotheses were tested: i) the structure of coralligenous assemblage and ii) the abundance of main taxa/groups both changed among different spatial scales differently depending on protection. A hierarchical sampling design was used to study 14 localities (7 Marine Protected Areas and 7 unprotected) at multiple spatial scales through photographic recording. The study suggested that, in protected conditions, the structure of coralligenous assemblages mostly varied at small spatial scale (m apart), while the structure is similar across different localities, sites and areas, even if the abundance of the main taxa/morphological groups changed. In unprotected conditions, variability among localities was higher than among Marine Protected Areas, while an opposite trend was observed at the smaller spatial scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the data processing that led to the definition of ecological classification criteria for the Biological Quality Element (BQE) phytoplankton in the coastal waters (CW) of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas, according to the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). The chosen metric was the annual geometric mean of chlorophyll a concentrations owing to the log-normal nature of chlorophyll a distribution. The sensitivity of this metric to the gradient of pressures was tested by adopting an empirical statistical approach. The dilution factor (F_dil), which is the share of freshwater in a sample of seawater, was introduced as a rough, but realistic proxy of nutrient loads from the continent. Correlations between F_dil and trophic indicators (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in seawater and the respective N:P ratio) were then evaluated. The F_dil approach was also used to derive reference conditions for each typology of coastal waters. Functional relationships between chlorophyll a, as phytoplankton biomass indicator, and nutrient concentrations, as pressure indicators, were computed by means of regression techniques. The classification scale for the BQE phytoplankton was based on the TRIX scale of water quality conditions. Reference conditions, pressure/impact relationships, boundary setting and classification criterion definition were treated separately and discussed for each of the CW Types: Type I, Type II A Adriatic, Type II A Tyrrhenian and Type III W for both the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas. Due to the lack of a functional relationship between the gradient of pressures and chlorophyll a, and a narrow range of annual chlorophyll a concentrations, only one threshold value was set for Type III W instead of the whole classification scale. Specific topics dealing with the log-normal model adopted for chlorophyll a data and the adequacy of classification criteria are discussed in the Appendix.

AB  - Long-term biological and environmental time-series (several decades to centuries) are essential for distinguishing between anthropogenically and naturally induced environmental change as well as for monitoring environmental change over time, irrespective of the causes. Since such long time-series are virtually non-existent for most areas, other methods have to be explored which can provide the best possible analogues. Numerous investigations have shown that benthic foraminifera (meiofaunal protists), which leave a fossil record in most marine sediments, are well suited for this purpose. A prerequisite for performing sound interpretations is an optimal understanding of their biology and ecology.
   Stainforthia fusiformis (Williamson) is one of the most common benthic foraminiferal species in NW European waters and living (stained) populations have been recorded in all clastic, soft bottom intertidal to outer shelf and slope areas with sediments consisting of at least some fines (>4% <63 mum) as long as the salinity is >28. Its predominance in ephemerally dysoxic/anoxic areas has caused it to be used as a proxy for severe oxygen depletion. A strong dominance (even >90%) of this species is, however, also reported from well-oxygenated coastal and shelf settings and, consequently, high abundance of this species occurs in habitats with very different environmental characteristics. A closer examination of these areas suggests that they can be roughly grouped into three categories: (1) beneath hydrographic frontal areas, (2) physically disturbed areas of sediment, and (3) ephemerally dysoxic/anoxic basins. The main characteristic feature that these highly different environments have in common is that they experience rapidly changing conditions. It is concluded that the opportunistic life-strategy of S. fusiformis makes it highly adapted to cope with environmental stress and that this, rather than tolerance to a particular environmental parameter, causes it to predominate in areas subject to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Sustainable management of native pastures requires an understanding of what the bounds of pasture composition, cover and soil surface condition are for healthy pastoral landscapes to persist. A survey of 107 Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture sites in inland central Queensland was conducted. The sites were chosen for their current diversity of tree cover, apparent pasture condition and soil type to assist in setting more objective bounds on condition 'states' in such pastures. Assessors' estimates of pasture condition were strongly correlated with herbage mass (r = 0.57) and projected ground cover (r = 0. 58), and moderately correlated with pasture crown cover (r = 0.35) and tree basal area (r = 0.32). Pasture condition was not correlated with pasture plant density or the frequency of simple guilds of pasture species. The soil type of Aristida/Bothriochloa pasture communities was generally hard-setting, low in cryptogam cover but moderately covered with litter and projected ground cover (30-50%). There was no correlation between projected ground cover of pasture and estimated ground-level cover of plant crowns. Tree basal area was correlated with broad categories of soil type, probably because greater tree clearing has occurred on the more fertile, heavy-textured clay soils. Of the main perennial grasses, some showed strong soil preferences, for example Tripogon loliiformis for hard-setting soils and Dichanthium sericeum for clays. Common species, such as Chrysopogon fallax and Heteropogon contortus, had no strong soil preference. Wiregrasses (Aristida spp.) tended to be uncommon at both ends of the estimated pasture condition scale whereas H. contortus was far more common in pastures in good condition. Sedges (Cyperaceae) were common on all soil types and for all pasture condition ratings. Plants identified as increaser species were Tragus australianus, daisies (Asteraceae) and potentially toxic herbaceous legumes such as Indigofera spp. and Crotalaria spp. Pasture condition could not be reliably predicted based on the abundance of a single species or taxon but there may be scope for using integrated data for four to five ecologically contrasting plants such as Themeda triandra with daisies, T. loliiformis and flannel weeds (Malvaceae).

AB  - Plant carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios are powerful indicators of diverse ecological processes. During plant development and growth, plant C:N:P stoichiometry responds to environmental conditions and physiological constraints. However, variations caused by effects of sampling (i.e. sampling date, leaf age and root size) often have been neglected in previous studies. We investigated the relative contributions of sampling date, leaf age, root size and species identity to stoichiometric flexibility in a field mesocosm study and a natural grassland in Inner Mongolia. We found that sampling date, leaf age, root size and species identity all significantly affected C:N:P stoichiometry both in the pot study as well as in the field. Overall, C:N and C:P ratios increased significantly over time and with increasing leaf age and root size, while the dynamics of N:P ratios depended on species identity. Our results suggest that attempts to synthesize C:N:P stoichiometry data across studies that span regional to global scales and include many species need to better account for temporal variation.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are commonly used as biomonitors to detect pollution impacts in estuaries. The goal of this research was to identify estuarine benthic invertebrates that could be used as indicator species to detect presence or absence of pollution in the Virginian Biogeographic Province using available monitoring data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program. The data were first subdivided by habitat. Then we summarized the benthic community using principal coordinates analysis and projected the results onto a pollution gradient. Then we compared medians and corrected interquartile ranges to identify indicator species that were sensitive to pollution (or lack thereof) and showed low variation in response. Our data set was divided into smaller subsets that ranged from 108 to 532 stations per habitat. Out of 707 species in the Virginian Province, 67 were identified as pollution indicator species; 37 pollution sensitive taxa and 30 pollution tolerant taxa. The pollution sensitive taxa were represented by more phyla than were the pollution tolerant taxa. The pollution tolerant taxa were dominated by deposit feeders while the pollution sensitive taxa were not dominated by animals using any one feeding strategy. The pollution sensitive taxa included many crustaceans, known to be sensitive to pollution, while the pollution tolerant taxa included many tubificid oligochaetes, which are common indicators of pollution. Our empirically based results corresponded well with other studies that identified tolerance values or indicator species. One advantage of this technique is that it can be used on smaller data sets, assuming that there are not major habitat differences among the samples. We believe that this parsimonious technique can be applied to other coastal areas where mid-size (100-500 stations) monitoring data sets are available. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Serum bile acids (SBAs) are suggested as a potentially sensitive and specific indicator of liver function which, accordingly, could provide an early indication of hepatobiliary dysfunction. This offers advantages over more traditional parameters of liver integrity/function. Recent studies have shown that occupational exposure to low levels of halogenated aliphatic or non-halogenated aromatic solvents is associated with significant increases in SEA levels. As this has often been evident in the absence of any effect on conventional parameters of hepatobiliary integrity/function, elevated SEA levels may well be regarded as a sensitive biological marker of exposure/effect of these compounds. In addition, it may be considered that they provide an early indicator of solvent-induced changes in hepatobiliary function. Extensive studies with experimental animals have also provided supporting evidence for these observations in solvent-exposed individuals. Investigations of the mechanisms at cellular and subcellular levels by which these increases occur have suggested that these effects are likely to be the result of selective, dose-related and reversible inhibition of bile acid uptake at the sinusoidal domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Increased concentrations of SEA under low levels of exposure to different solvents have been demonstrated to be a short-lived acid reversible effect which is not accompanied by any other evidence of liver damage. Therefore, it could be assumed that it is unlikely that there would be pathological sequelae to these effects, although the longer term ramifications of such effects have not been thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, the available evidence indicates that investigation of SEA in solvent-exposed workers could provide useful indications of exposure and effect.

AB  - Nanotechnology has brought great advances to many fields of modern science. A manifold of applications of nanoparticles have been found due to their interesting optical, electrical, and biological/chemical properties. However, the potential toxic effects of nanopartides to different ecosystems are of special concern nowadays. Despite the efforts of the scientific community, the mechanisms of toxicity of nanoparticles are still poorly understood. Quantitative-structure activity/toxicity relationships (QSAR/QSTR) models have just started being useful computational tools for the assessment of toxic effects of nanomaterials. But most QSAR/QSTR models have been applied so far to predict ecotoxicity against only one organism/bio-indicator such as Daphnia magna. This prevents having a deeper knowledge about the real ecotoxic effects of nanoparticles, and consequently, there is no possibility to establish an efficient risk assessment of nanomaterials in the environment. In this work, a perturbation model for nano-QSAR problems is introduced with the aim of simultaneously predicting the ecotoxicity of different nanopartides against several assay organisms (bio-indicators), by considering also multiple measures of ecotoxicity, as well as the chemical compositions, sizes, conditions under which the sizes were measured, shapes, and the time during which the diverse assay organisms were exposed to nanoparticles. The QSAR-perturbation model was derived from a database containing 5520 cases (nanoparticle-nanoparticle pairs), and it was shown to exhibit accuracies of ca. 99% in both training and prediction sets. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of our model, three different nickel-based nanoparticles (Ni) with experimental values reported in the literature were predicted. The predictions were found to be in very good agreement with the experimental evidences, confirming that Ni-nanoparticles are not ecotoxic when compared with other nanoparticles. The results of this study thus provide a single valuable tool toward an efficient prediction of the ecotoxicity of nanoparticles under multiple experimental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Okavango River system flows through Angola, Namibia and Botswana. It is in near-natural condition and supports globally iconic wetlands and wildlife. The basin's people are poor and development is inevitable: the next decade is critical. The river could become an example of responsible planning that resolutely addresses the three pillars of sustainable development. Recognizing this, the Member States completed a transboundary diagnostic analysis (TDA) in 2010 funded by the three governments and the Global Environment Facility. A central feature of the TDA was a basin-wide environmental flow assessment using the DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation) holistic approach. This produced scenarios of increasing water resource use that spelled out the costs and benefits in terms of the health of the river ecosystem, associated social structures and local and national economies. The results were used to help create a transboundary strategic action programme, which the Member States are now beginning to act on. This article describes the DRIFT application, the findings and how these could be used to help achieve sustainable development.

AB  - Using empirical data (ca. 7500 phytosociological releves), a simple, probabilistic 'vegetation-site' model was developed, to simulate geographical distribution of 71 forest community types, representing the potential natural vegetation (PNV) of Switzerland. The model was interfaced to a geographic information system (GIS) and used to generate a numerical vegetation map, on the basis of digital maps of 12 environmental variables including climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation), topography (elevation, slope, aspect), and soil parameters (soil pH and physical soil parameters). The predicted distribution of forest communities was compared with several vegetation maps, prepared for some subregions of Switzerland by means of traditional field methods. Similarity ranged from 50 to 80 %, depending on the community type, level of vegetational hierarchy and the geographical region. The current resolution and accuracy of the simulated vegetation map allows us to study the vegetational patterns on the level of the entire country or its major geographical and climatic regions. The simulated vegetation map is potentially an important tool in ecological risk assessment studies concerning the possible impacts of climate change on the ecological potential of forest sites and biological diversity of forest communities.

AB  - The spatial variation in community structure among 30 areas for the management and exploitation of benthic resources (AMEBRs) in central Chile was assessed from surveys conducted during the same spring-summer season. One hundred taxa identified in the subtidal surveys were grouped into 10 functional groups. The influence and relative importance of external factors over benthic associations were assessed through nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and path analysis. Three main categories of external factors were considered: 'terrain traits' (e.g. coastline exposure), 'surface-ocean conditions' (e.g. sea surface temperature, SST), and 'fishery-related variables' (e.g. cumulative landings). The NMDS revealed a strong association between benthic community structure and both terrain and surface-ocean conditions (42% of variance explained by permutational multivariate analysis of variance), but not with fishery-related variables. Assemblages typical of rocky substrates were associated with larger seasonal fluctuations in SST and surface chlorophylla.The presence of soft-bottom functional groups was associated with higher levels of surface fluorescence and larger seasonal fluctuations in a satellite-derived proxy for river-plume influence (nLw645). A path analysis model for hard-bottom communities reached a 49% goodness of fit (GOF), with the presence of epifaunal filter-feeders, grazers, predators, and scavengers being significantly correlated with leathery and corticated foliose algae, which in turn depend on the fraction of rocky substrate in the AMEBR; the fraction of rocky substrate is positively correlated with coastline exposure. The model for soft-bottom communities reached a 52% GOF with the presence of infaunal filter-feeders and epifaunal detritivores depending directly on SST and surface chlorophylla.The fishery-related variables considered in the model had no apparent effect on the structure of either type of subtidal community. These results provide a hierarchy of physical-biological associations determining the functional composition of subtidal benthic communities in management areas along central Chile. This knowledge may improve future assessments of ecosystem response to changes in environmental conditions and management strategies.

AB  - Nymphaea candida J. et C. Presl. is a relict species which is a typical representative of an ecological group of attached aquatic higher plants with floating leaves. The conducted research was meant to evaluate the indicators that characterize the Nymphaea candida growth in different conditions of the Desna River basin and to find out the influence of the leading ecological-cenotic factors on them. Based on the analysis of 12 dynamic metric morphological parameters values and five dynamic allometric values, the information on Nymphaea candida plant growth rate in six communities is provided. The influence on the growth of such environmental factors such as the phytocoenoses Total plant cover, water column, its transparency and nature of bottom sediments was evaluated. The water colum and phytocoenoses overall projective coverage showed statistically significant effects, with a force of 54.4-99.0% and 23.6-90.0%, respectively, on all dynamic morphoparameters of Nymphaea candida plants. The bottom sediments did not show a statistically significant effect on only one morphoparameter, and the factor influence force on the dimensional features of Nymphaea candida plants mainly varies within 8.7-89.5%. Water transparency did not show a statistically significant effect on the three morphological parameters, given the influence of this factor on all other features at the level of 13.2-19.4%. In Nymphaea candida plants, the largest majestic significant proportion (58.8%) of the dynamic morphoparameters were in the population of Nymphaea candida - Potamogeton lucens community, the smallest (in 64.7%) were in Numphoides peltata - Ceratophyllum demersum. The fastest growth of Nymphaea candida plants is in areas where there is no flow, the water columnvaries within 50-100 cm, the water transparency reaches the bottom, the silt bottom sediments are represented, and the phytocoenoses total projective coverage is 60-85%. Nevertheless, the total plant cover of Nymphaea candida can be from 10% to 40%. Within the study area, such habitat conditions are optimal to ensure the continued existence of populations of this species as a whole.

AB  - The conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity requires an understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that condition the presence and survival of organisms in natural habitats. The global distribution and ecological hypersensitivity of pteridophytes have made them ideal candidates for studying the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on levels of biodiversity.
   This study aims to determine the effect of vegetation cover, human disturbance, and climatic factors on the distribution and diversity of pteridophytes in Togo with a view to guide conservation efforts. Our data comprises 130 plots of 500 m(2) representing all ecological zones of the country, complemented by several opportunistic collections. After determining the patterns of pteridophyte distribution, multivariate analysis of variance and the calculation of diversity indicators made it possible to determine the influence of the factors studied.
   We found that pteridophyte species diversity and distribution in Togo are strongly influenced by climatic variables, with more than 90% of species diversity being concentrated in the submontane forest areas. Humidity related variables, insolation, and human disturbances are the main drivers of their distribution. Species diversity is positively associated with an increase in humidity, but decreases with increasing insolation and human disturbance. Importantly, our results emphasize the association of specific species to particular conditions created by climate, land cover, and human disturbances, highlighting the role of pteridophyte species as indicators of environmental conditions or exposure to stress. Within humid forest areas, our analysis of the impact of disturbance indicates that about a quarter of the pteridophyte flora of humid forests is sensitive to minor disturbances, whereas almost all rainforest species decline in the face of high levels of disturbance. Agroforests are a particular case of moderately disturbed rainforests, and have the potential to harbour at least 30.5% of Togolese rainforest pteridophyte species diversity.
   We conclude that the conservation of pteridophytes in Togo requires the protection of submontane rainforests and the adoption of less destructive practices in terrestrial species habitats in coffee/cocoa-based agroforests.

AB  - [1] This study uses time series analysis to examine long-term stream water nitrate concentration records from a pair of forested catchments at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. Monthly average concentrations were available from 1970 through 1997 for two forested catchments, one of which was clear-felled in 1977 and the other maintained as a control. The time series were decomposed into their trend and annual cycle before modeling as an autoregressive (AR) process. AR models were calculated for both an expanding and a shifting window so that prefelling could be directly compared with the effects of tree clearance. In comparison with flow records for both of the catchments, transfer function-noise models were calculated on a moving window basis, and the impulse functions were derived. Analysis shows that both catchments show an annual memory effect but that the clear-felled catchment shows, in addition, a 6-month memory effect. The annual effect in the control catchment responds to drought conditions while in the felled catchment, it reflects the change in vegetation. The 6-month effect in the felled catchment responds to drought conditions independent of both the annual effect and of logging operations. The control catchment shows no significant impulse function with respect to flow, while for the felled catchment a distinct impulsivity develops over time subsequent to logging and coincident with the onset of nitrogen saturation. By examining the nature of the nitrate export, rather than solely the levels of export, a systems approach can be taken to understanding catchment behavior. Such an approach shows that the catchment is in metastable equilibrium with respect to its hydrological pathways and nitrogen reserves but in dynamic equilibrium with respect to long-term temperature change. The onset of nitrogen saturation may represent irreversible changes in the catchment behavior, and impulsivity, with respect to streamflow, represents a new indicator of N-saturated conditions.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive uses the "one-out, all-out" principle in assessing water bodies (i.e., the worst status of the elements used in the assessment determines the final status of the water body). In this study, we assessed the ecological status of two coastal lakes in Italy. Indices for all biological quality elements used in transitional waters from the Italian legislation and other European countries were employed and compared. Based on our analyses, the two lakes require restoration, despite the lush harbor seagrass beds, articulated macrobenthic communities and rich fish fauna. The "one-out, all-out" principle tends to inflate Type I errors, i.e., concludes that a water body is below the "good" status even if the water body actually has a "good" status. This may cause additional restoration costs where they are not necessarily needed. The results from this study strongly support the need for alternative approaches to the "one-out, all-out" principle. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Old-growth studies commonly emphasize structural and age conditions, selecting proxy indicators of long-term ecological processes. Transition dynamics from mature to old-growth status reveal how natural legacies are progressively accumulated in forests after major disturbances, including human ones. In late-successional, multi-aged forests, the chronosequential ranking of developmental stages is a difficult task, as stand age provides little information, and time since last stand-replacing disturbance cannot be easily determined.
   2. Canopy age features, disturbance/suppression history and growth trajectories were reconstructed from ring-width series of canopy trees in a network of 19 old-growth and managed European beech forests in the eastern Alps and central Apennines. A set of tree-ring metrics able to describe the intensity and time distribution of biological and ecological processes (e.g. understorey suppression, canopy accession age) were used to describe the advancement of old-growth status and compared to established metrics of forest structure.
   3. Tree-ring metrics were site dependent, as biogeoclimate affects turnover rates and constrains the onset and recovery rate of old-growth attributes. Under the same environmental conditions (high-mountain, limestone-bedrock beech forests), values of the best indicators (number/duration of growth suppression phases; synchronicity of first release; maximum and range of canopy tree age; canopy accession age of the slowest-growing trees) increased monotonically (two to five times) from managed to secondary and primary old-growth forests. Trees in well-conserved primary old-growth forests experienced several and long suppressions, showing the highest complexity in recruitment history, canopy accession and growth trajectories. The best tree-ring metrics, condensed in a Naturalness Score to provide a synthetic functional ranking of forests, varied coherently with structural complexity, which represented stand dynamics more closely than biomass-related metrics.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We propose a synthetic ranking of forest functional naturalness based on the ecological processes experienced by trees. This ranking helps to overcome the limitations associated with the use of arbitrary size-or age-related thresholds of old-growth status and provides a functional approach to establish chronosequences in ecological studies. The quantitative description of complex processes underpinning the unique biological and ecological features (e.g. extreme tree longevity) found in primary old-growth forests enhances their irreplaceable value in nature conservation. The proposed framework of tree-ring indicators describes functional traits tightly related to forest naturalness and may thus become a tool to identify and protect old-growth forests, benchmark the impact of silvicultural practices, prescribe targets or evaluate the effectiveness of restoration programmes.

AB  - Semi enclosed waters, such as estuaries and lagoons, are vulnerable ecosystems that are experiencing persistent trace element (TE) contamination. Seagrasses have been reported worldwide as valuable bioindicator species for coastal contamination monitoring purpose. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the TE contamination of semi-enclosed ecosystems has been monitored along the full latitudinal gradient of the Moroccan Atlantic coast. In these ecosystems, the dominant seagrass species is Zostera noltei. 23 TEs (Fe, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, V, Cu, Zn, Sr, Li, As, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Mo, Ba, Ti, Pb, U, Bi and Hg) and four major elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca) were measured in sediments and seagrass leaf samples were collected upstream and downstream of five semi-enclosed areas. They contrasted in both climatic conditions and levels of environmental contamination. The Trace Element Pollution Index (TEPI) and the Trace Element Spatial Variation Index (TESVI) were calculated from chemical element concentrations in the samples. Of the five semi-enclosed areas, Sidi Moussa lagoon's sediments were the most contaminated (TEPI=1.18). The TESVI differed highly between chemical elements among the five water bodies for sediments and seagrass leaves, the highest spatial variability being for Ag (TESVI=72.01 and 21.05 respectively). For Z. noltei leaves, a latitudinal gradient of TE accumulation was recorded. A high bioconcentration factor (BCF > 1) for Cd, Mo, Sb, Ag, Zn and U indicated that the sediments were efficiently uptaken by the seagrass. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) between levels of Cd, Ag, Fe, Al, Ba, Hg, Mn and Zn in sediments and in Z. noltei leaves indicated similar contamination occurrences in both environmental matrices and their bioavailability for seagrasses. Overall, leaf TE bioconcentration among and within the study sites resulted from differences in element bioavailability and environmental conditions (climatic context, hydrological conditions and human impact). Ultimately, Z. noltei is a useful bioindicator of Cd, Mo, Sb, Ag, Zn, U, Al, Fe, Mn, Ba and Hg contamination in sediments.

AB  - Understanding of biological responses of marine fauna to seawater acidification due to potential CO2 leakage from sub-seabed storage sites has improved recently, providing support to CCS environmental risk assessment. Physiological responses of benthic organisms to ambient hypercapnia have been previously investigated but rarely at the cellular level, particularly in areas of less common geochemical and ecological conditions such as brackish water and/or reduced oxygen levels. In this study, CO2-related responses of oxygen-dependent, antioxidant and detoxification systems as well as markers of neurotoxicity and acid-base balance in the Baltic clam Limecola balthica from the Baltic Sea were quantified in 50-day experiments. Experimental conditions included CO2 addition producing pH levels of 7.7, 7.0 and 6.3, respectively and hydrostatic pressure 900 kPa, simulating realistic seawater acidities following a CO2 seepage accident at the potential CO2-storage site in the Baltic. Reduced pH interfered with most biomarkers studied, and modifications to lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase indicate that aerobiosis was a dominant energy production pathway. Hypercapnic stress was most evident in bivalves exposed to moderately acidic seawater environment (pH 7.0), showing a decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity, activation of catalase and suppression of glutathione S-transferase activity likely in response to enhanced free radical production. The clams subjected to pH 7.0 also demonstrated acetylcholinesterase activation that might be linked to prolonged impact of contaminants released from sediment. The most acidified conditions (pH 6.3) stimulated glutathione and malondialdehyde concentration in the bivalve tissue suggesting potential cell damage. Temporal variations of most biomarkers imply that after a 10-to-15-day initial phase of an acute disturbance, the metabolic and antioxidant defence systems recovered their capacities.

AB  - The energy stored in coarse particulate organic matter, e.g. leaf litter, is released to aquatic ecosystems by breakdown processes involving microorganisms and leaf shredding invertebrates. The palatability of leaves and thus the feeding of shredders on leaf material are highly influenced by microorganisms. However, implications in the colonization of leaves by microorganisms (=conditioning) caused by chemical stressors are rarely studied. Our laboratory experiments, therefore, investigated for the first time effects of a fungicide on the conditioning process of leaf material by means of food-choice experiments using Gammarus fossarum (Crustacea: Amphipoda). Additionally, microbial analyses were conducted to facilitate the mechanistic understanding of the observed behavior. Gammarids significantly preferred control leaf discs over those conditioned in presence of the fungicide tebuconazole at concentrations of 50 and 500 mu g/L. Besides the decrease of fungal biomass with increasing fungicide concentration, also the leaf associated fungal community composition showed that species preferred by gammarids, such as Alatospora acumunata, Clavariopsis aquatica, or Flagellospora curvula, were more frequent in the control. Tetracladium marchalianum, however, which is rejected by gammarids, was abundant in all treatments suggesting an increasing importance of this species for the lower leaf palatability - as other more palatable fungal species were almost absent - in the fungicide treatments. Hence, the food-choice behavior of G. fossarum seems to be a suitable indicator for alterations in leaf associated microbial communities, especially fungal species composition, caused by chemical stressors. Finally, this or similar test systems may be a reasonable supplement to the environmental risk assessment of chemicals in order to achieve its protection goals, as on the one hand, indirect effects may occur far below concentrations known to affect gammarids directly, and on the other hand, the observed shifts in leaf associated microbial communities may have perpetuating implications in leaf shredding invertebrates.

AB  - Assessments of climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems are generally based on global climate models (GCMs) and ecologically relevant "time-averaged" hydrological indicators derived from long-term records. Although uncertainties from GCMs have been recognized, the influence of downscaling methods remains unclear. This paper evaluates the influence of applying different downscaling methods of increasing complexity (annual scaling, monthly scaling, quantile scaling, and weather generator method) on the assessment of ecological outcomes. In addition to time-averaged indicators, "sequence-dependent" metrics which involve ecological dynamics by considering the impacts of flow sequencing are also adopted. In a case study in Australia, the condition of river red gum forest was assessed. Results show that the choice of downscaling methods can be of similar importance as that of GCMs in ecological impact studies. Where sequence-dependent metrics are adopted, more sophisticated downscaling techniques should be used to better represent changes in the frequency and sequence of flow events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An assessment of environmental issues that might emerge in the 21(st) century suggests that the high priority issues will be:
   Transformations of old issues-continually evolving, and In most cases broadening, in response to increasing scientific and technological knowledge and to changing socioeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions. For example, the issues of sustainable water use, urbanization and natural disasters will change in character as a result of climate warming, economic development and evolving cultural norms. This means that environmental policies ought to be adaptive, and should be supported by early warning systems, using appropriate indicators. -
   Policy issues, the long-term environmental consequences of which may already be of concern, e.g., the growing water shortages in parts of Africa, and the longterm environmental impacts of direct foreign investment and of changing world trade patterns. The implications of many such socioeconomic and cultural trends on the environment are yet to unfold, and need to be given serious attention.
   Accidents waiting to happen, e.g., chemical time bombs. -
   Surprises, in the responses of ecosystems to new and different stresses, as well as in the nature of the socioeconomic drivers of environmental change.

AB  - The article overviews the role of bats in the forest ecosystem (especially the European forest), the impact of environmental pollution on the forest and bats, and the issue of bats indication of the forest environment condition. Existing data on the transfer of pollutants to the environment and between the aquatic and terrestrial environment are reviewed. The water environment is an important receiver of industrial pollution, which then transfer to the terrestrial environment i.a. through insect larvae. Bats as predators hunting for the insects, which undergo part of their life cycle in water (including Diptera: Chironomidae), play an important in this cycle. Another source of bats intoxication are terrestrial insects feeding on plants that transfer toxins that settle on the leaves surface further in the food chain. Bats as predators of the first or even second level store in such a case substances like heavy metals in their bodies. Air pollutants also have a direct impact on forest stands, causing (in zones of strong industrial pollution) the inhibition of tree growth. The result is, among other things, a smaller number of hollows, which in turn is manifested indirectly through weaker settlement by bats (and birds) of these stands. Bats communities inhabiting the forest depend on such factors as the availability of roosting places, the age structure and spatial structure of the stands. All these features (as well as others related to them) are subject to modification through economic forestry, which causes changes in the bat communities. Ecological research of forest bats shows variability of settling of managed stands, as well as diversified species composition, especially smaller presence of typically forest bats connected ecologically with forests (e.g. western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus or lesser noctule Nyctalus leisleri), in favor of bats preferring open spaces and built-up areas (serotine bat Eptesicus serotinus). This is probably the result of changes in the age and spatial structure of the stand. On the basis of the collected information, it was concluded that bats are a valuable indicator of the condition of the forest environment.

AB  - This study explores the probable correlation between degradation in bond line fracture toughness and the changes in the measurable mechanical properties of the adhesive layer due to environmental contamination in adhesively bonded composite structures. Nanoindentation technique is utilized to measure the adhesive Young's modulus and hardness. The proposed framework utilizes the large scale bridging of interfacial fracture proposed by Tvergaard and Hutchinson (Philos Mag A 70(4):641-656, 1994), for considering the significant contribution of plasticity on the macroscopic bond line fracture toughness. A typical adhesive-adherend material system (EA9394/Hexcel IM7-G/8552) exposed to different contaminants at the same concentration is examined. Hardness measurements showed two distinct effects of contamination on the adhesive material; namely (1) softening and (2) hardening depending on the class of contaminants. In addition, macroscopic mode-I fracture toughness is independently measured by double cantilever beam test. Finite element method employing cohesive zone method is used to rationalize the experimental results and the prospective scaling-laws. The combined experimental results of macroscopic properties and the numerical results of the interfacial properties showed the role of contamination in reducing the plastic dissipation within the bond line and the macroscopic deterioration of the bond line effective fracture toughness. The results showed the existence of a correlation similar to Tvergaard and Hutchinson's results. However, the results suggest a scaling between the interfacial cohesive fracture toughness and the measurable flow stress. The scaling correlation has the potential to be utilized in assessing the relative trend between different contaminants. While the proposed scaling is verified for a common adhesive-adherend system in aerospace industry, with additional examination of other systems, the proposed scaling law might facilitate the utilization of the perceived non-destructively evaluated indentation hardness to serve as an indicator for the bond line macroscopic fracture toughness.

AB  - Zooplankton can serve as indicators of ecosystem health, water quality, food web structure, and environmental change, including those associated with climate change and ocean acidification (OA). Laboratory studies demonstrate that low pH and high pCO2 associated with OA can significantly affect the physiology and survival of zooplankton, with differential responses among taxa. While laboratory studies can be indicative of zooplankton response to OA, in situ responses will ultimately determine the fate of populations and ecosystems. In this perspective, we compare expectations from experimental studies with observations made in Puget Sound (Washington, United States), a highly dynamic estuary with known vulnerabilities to low pH and high pCO2. We found little association between empirical measures of in situ pH and the abundance of sensitive taxa as revealed by meta-analysis, calling into question the coherence between experimental studies and field observations. The apparent mismatch between laboratory and field studies has important ramifications for the design of long-term monitoring programs and interpretation and use of the data produced. Important work remains to be done to connect traits that are sensitive to OA with those that are ecologically relevant and reliably observable in the field.

AB  - Among the natural prerequisites that affect the recreational appeal of the region, along with the geomorphological, landscape and biological features of the terrain, the hydroclimatic conditions of the region play a decisive role. The paper analyses the hydroclimatic features of the Russian part of the transboundary Altai and their impact on the prospects for recreational use of the region. It contains the analysis of the literature data on the climate and hydrology of the region supplemented with the results of the author's field studies. The hydro-environmental tension for each natural and recreational area was established. The data were compared with an assessment of the recreational attractiveness of the region's water resources. The results of the research can be used at the stage of the creation of tourist and recreational projects, when developing and carrying out the excursion, ecological and sports activities, as well as and health tourism.

AB  - The EU directive to quantify ecological quality by deviation from pre-impacted conditions often fails to be implemented because past information is usually incomplete or missing. Molluscan death assemblages, representing long-term accumulation of shells on the sea floor, average out short-term variability and can serve as a baseline for quality assessment. AMBI, Bentix and Shannon Wiener indices were calculated for live and dead assemblages from polluted and control stations on the highly oligotrophic Levantine shallow shelf of Israel. Bentix successfully tracked deterioration over time, from moderate EcoQS in the dead to poor in the live assemblage. Additional modification of the ecological classification of species by scoring the naturally abundant Corbula gibba as pollution-sensitive improved the utility of the Bentix index in monitoring in this part of the Mediterranean. This adjustment of Bentix, and use of death assemblages for an ecological baseline, should therefore be incorporated in monitoring for compliance with EU directives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the potential of diatoms and ostracods as bioindicators for environmental quality assessments of the Odra river mouth. Over the course of the study period (2005-2006), 27 ostracod taxa and 255 diatom taxa were identified. The most frequent and most abundant diatoms were Navicula gregaria, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata and Tabularia fasciculata. Additionally, Amphora pediculus, Cocconeis pediculus, C. placentula, Planothidium engelbrechtii and P. delicatulum were important species in this sampling area. Cypria ophtalmica, Cytheromorpha,fuscata and Cyprideis torosa were dominant amongst the ostracod fauna. Diatoms and ostracods proved to be useful and complementary indicators of ecological conditions in the Odra mouth. The taxonomic composition of both groups indicated that the Odra mouth waters were strongly eutrophic, with temporal and spatial variations in salinity (ranging from oligohaline to beta-mesohaline), and with a slightly alkaline pH. The southern part of the study area was influenced by fresh, nutrient rich waters of the Odra river, while the northern part was more impacted by the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Habitat loss through development is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. The increasingly common legal requirement to first avoid, then reduce and, if necessary, offset impacts of plans and projects on biodiversity has however not always been appropriately enforced. The blame lies mainly in bad governance such as patchy monitoring or poorly defined liabilities. Biodiversity offsets also suffer from the lack of formal methods for designing and sizing offset requirements. We address this gap by reviewing different tools, methods and guidelines that have been developed in different regulatory contexts. We then formulate a typology of approaches that variously combine these methods and guidelines. We discuss how these relate to the objectives of offset policies and the components of biodiversity and ecosystems to which they apply. Together, these perspectives should contribute to improving existing methods (e.g. by incorporating time-related issues) and our typology should support the development of offset policies.

AB  - Environmental monitoring is performed on seafloor communities since these organisms are relatively stationary and integrate the environmental conditions over many years. Standard practices involve sampling by grab. Epifaunal taxa, often missed by grab sampling, are likely to have different ecological functions. We investigate how current environmental assessments represent the benthic community as a whole by comparing taxonomic and functional components sampled by grabs and epibenthic trawls. Faunal communities sampled by trawl (filtrating or predator, epifauna) and grab (infaunal, detrivore) differs widely by sampling distinct functional components, and these may be expected to respond to different human-induced stressors. Neither component appears to be a good surrogate for the community as a whole. We suggest a benthic monitoring by combining both techniques. Sustainable ecosystem functioning is intimately tied to the health of both components of the benthic community, and is recognized as an important goal by signatories of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB  - This paper presents a foundation for improving the risk assessment process for freshwater wetlands. Integrating wetland science, i.e., use of an ecosystem-based approach, is the key concept. Each biotic and abiotic wetland component should be identified and its contribution to ecosystem functions and societal values determined when deciding whether a stressor poses an unreasonable risk to the sustainability of a particular wetland. Understanding the major external and internal factors that regulate the operational conditions of wetlands is critical to risk characterization. Determining the linkages between these factors, and how they influence the way stressors affect wetlands, is the basis for an ecosystem approach. Adequate consideration of wetland ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, and soils can greatly reduce the level of uncertainty associated with risk assessment and lead to more effective risk management. In order to formulate effective solutions, wetland problems must be considered at watershed, landscape, and ecosystem scales. Application of an ecosystem approach can be greatly facilitated ii wetland scientists and risk assessors work together to develop a common understanding of the principles of both disciplines.

AB  - The model EFIMOD 2 was developed for the description of tree (stand) growth and biological turnover of elements in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The model has the following features. (i) It is a spatially explicit stand-level simulator for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and Pendula birch (Betula pendula L.) on different forest soils growing under different climatic conditions in Europe; each stand consists of individual trees for which growth is modelled depending on the tree's position within the stand and local light, water and available nutrient conditions. (ii) The model has a tree-based submodel for total biomass distributed between several biomass compartments. (iii) The calculations include natural regeneration as well as ground vegetation dynamics. (iv) The soil submodel (ROMUL) is used to assess organic matter dynamics and nitrogen availability for tree growth as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture content and litter quality. (v) EFIMOD 2 calculates nitrogen cycling and accounts for atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation and leaching, vegetation uptake, litter fall and nitrogen redistribution within and between trees and soil horizons. (vi) Monte-Carlo simulations are done to simulate the extent of naturally oscillating variability.
   EFIMOD 2 allows for short-term and long-term simulations of natural and managed forest ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of forest sites, climatic conditions and silvicultural regimes. The model calculates dendrometric parameters for every tree, including undergrowth and seedlings, total growing stock, and pools of coarse woody debris and soil organic matter, with special reference to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The model is effective for assessing wood productivity and evaluation of forest management regimes to meet criteria and indicators of Sustainable Forest Management. This includes a general evaluation of biodiversity and soil sustainability. The model system allows for the direct use of standard forest inventory data. Output variables include carbon and nitrogen pools in the stand and soil, CO2 emissions, and tree (stand) growth and yield. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - HSP70 are the most studied proteins and among all HSPs are highlighted due to their high sensitivity and abundance, as well as being ubiquitously expressed and associated with all subcellular compartments. For this reason, this work specifically approaches HSP70, since its multiple responsibilities actively participate in the homeostasis of all living organisms and its rapid response to any agent stressor is efficient in assessing environmental pollution/contamination processes. HSP70, heat shock proteins thus classified according to their molecular weight of 70 kDa, are proteins that have maintained their structures conserved from the most primitive to the most complex organisms. They belong to the chaperone family, which comprises proteins with different structures that share a common function. In general, they participate in the process of correct folding of proteins; however, it has been described that they also participate in numerous complex processes of metabolism; its synthesis can usually be increased or decreased under stressful conditions. The classical activation of this protein is due to the increase in environmental temperature, but several factors can trigger the gene expression process of this protein, not only as the increase or decrease of heat or cold, but also the exposure to substances of a chemical nature, physical or biological (metals, metabolism inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents, inflammatory and infectious processes, processes leading to cell death, the cycle of cell division itself and growth factors, cellular mechanisms considered normal). Given the broad repercussion of these proteins in metabolic processes and in organism physiology, numerous studies have evaluated the HSP70 production under adverse conditions, highlighting their connection to pollution and environmental contamination. Hence, this work aimed to literature review the vast array of HSP70 metabolic functions and its possible applications as biomarkers in the evaluation of contaminated environments by compiling the different physiological responses observed in various animal groups exposed to different conditions.

AB  - Orange lily Lilium bulbiferum subsp. bulbiferum occurs in the mountains of Western and Central Europe. Within almost the entire area of distribution, it is considered to be rare and endangered. The main purpose of the present study is to analyse the variability of environmental conditions of sites of the orange lily that are considered natural on its north-eastern border of occurrence. Using vegetation databases from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia and our material collected during field work in the Western Carpathians and the Sudetes, we analysed the variability of species composition within communities with the occurrence of L. bulbiferum subsp. bulbiferum. The classification was performed using a modified TWINSPAN algorithm in the JUICE software. Ecological analysis was performed on the basis of Ellenberg indicator values with a Zeleny-Schaffers modified permutation test. In general, the findings indicate that in the study area there are at least seven plant communities, within three separate classes, with the occurrence of the orange lily. All vegetation units distinguished here are semi natural communities, which are maintained through extensive and traditional agricultural practices. Microclimatic conditions, which indicate a narrow ecological tolerance of the species to light availability and temperature, may have a crucial effect on the distribution of L. bulbiferum subsp. bulbiferum on the north-eastern border of its range in Europe. These factors significantly reduce the possibility of penetration of the species into forest or scrub communities. On the other hand, owing to far wider ranges of tolerance to moisture conditions and soil reaction than previously considered typical of the species, the orange lily can occur in different light-demanding communities, from acidic pastures up to calcareous thermophilous grasslands. An almost exclusive presence of L. bulbiferum subsp. bulbiferum in semi-natural habitats suggests that active management and protection are crucial to protect its full genetic variation on the European continent.

AB  - Why have ecological targets for the majority of water bodies in Europe not been met despite decades of water protection programs? We hypothesize that restoration strategies have not adequately accounted for whole-river network perspectives, including interactions between stream orders, spatial patterns of pollutant sources, and ecoregion-dependent susceptibility. We used high-resolution data from Germany to identify relationships between urban wastewater-river discharge fraction (UDF), agricultural land use fraction (ALF), and ecological status by stream order across three ecoregions. Low-flow UDF values were used to reflect the strong vulnerability of low-order streams under these conditions. We found ecological status of good or better in less than 8% of all river sections with the highest proportions in low-order streams and complete disappearance at higher orders. Increasing ALF impaired the ecological status for river reaches across all stream orders. In contrast, relationships between UDF and ecological status impairment were significant only in low-order streams, independent from ecoregion. Concentrating integrative restoration efforts in low-order streams would maximize the potential to mitigate anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - The article considers the most important aspects of ecosystem approach implementation in mining. It requires the integrated economic assessment of the environmental consequences and the entire list of ecosystem services supplied by forest ecosystems most subjected anthropogenic impact of mineral mining. The authors identify the main ecosystem services supplied by forests and indirectly providing economic benefits to their consumers: maintenance of air composition in the atmosphere (carbon sequestration and oxygen production); air purification and water protection associated with an increase in precipitation and soil protection from erosion. The scientific novelty consists in the improvement of guidelines for economic assessment of ecosystem services generated by natural capital of the territories under consideration. The guidelines are developed for assessing the ecosystem service on air composition maintenance at various degree of detalization. The introduction of the decrease in precipitation due to rainfall retention by forest canopy in the economic assessment of water protection service is substantiated.

AB  - This paper presents the results of investigations on the suitability of Euplotes crassus, an interstitial marine ciliate, to be used as model organism in ecotoxicology and thereafter to evaluate the toxicity of estuarine and coastal sediments upon laboratory exposure. Nowadays, anthropogenic activities have resulted in accumulation of metals and organic pollutants in the environment as well as in the food chain hence leading to serious ecological and human health problems. This may pose a risk to benthic and epibenthic organisms and it is crucial to discover toxicity tests that will identify adverse effects of sediment-associated chemicals on benthic organisms. Due to their nature as a eukaryotic cell/organism and their position in the food web, ciliated protozoa are suitable models for evaluating the effects of pollution on aquatic communities. Lethal and sublethal effects of exposure to inorganic and organic pollutants were tested on the cell mortality, replication rate, lysosomal membrane stability and endocytosis rate of E. crassus. Increasing nominal concentrations of individual and mixtures of mercury, copper, and benzo(a)pyrene were investigated in this study as they might be bioavailable in naturally occurring polluted sites. A significant decrease in the mean replication rate (p < 0.05) was found after 24 h exposures to m/mu M concentrations of all tested pollutants. At the same time, significant decreases of lysosomal membrane stability (p < 0.05) were observed for Cu (5 mu M), Hg (10 nM), and B(a)P (200 nM). Among the entire suite of tests, endocytosis rate test demonstrated the highest sensitivity. Exposures to binary mixtures of all studied pollutants were performed showing both inorganic-organic and inorganic-inorganic additive and/or antagonist effects. Moreover, medium salinity was also varied to mimic estuarine-like environmental conditions linking biological response to ionic strengths. Under these conditions significant increases of both endocytosis rate and lysosomal membrane stability were observed and related to the increment of some Hg- and Cu-related toxic complexes. The studied biomarkers were always able to discriminate between the effects of organic and inorganic pollutants. Together with the short time and simplicity of the test procedures, results obtained in this study indicate that E. crassus is a promising and convenient bioindicator for evaluating the toxicity of different environmental matrixes like pore water, sediments and wastewaters - polluted by metals and organic pollutants.

AB  - Vibration-based damage assessment approaches use modal parameters, such as frequency response functions, mode shapes, and natural frequencies, as indicators of structural damage. Nevertheless, these parameters are sensitive not only to damage but also to temperature variations. Most civil engineering structures are exposed to varying environmental conditions, thus hindering vibration-based damage assessment. Therefore, in this article, a new damage assessment algorithm based on pattern recognition is proposed to scrutinize the healthy state of a structure in the presence of uncertainties such as noise and temperature. The algorithm adopts a combination of couple sparse coding and deep neural network as an ensemble system to assess damage. The proposed method is validated using a numerical model of a truss bridge and experimental data of the I-40 bridge. The results demonstrate its efficiency in the localization and quantification of damages under varying temperature conditions.

AB  - Agriculture and pastureland for cattle grazing are common land uses in Mediterranean landscapes. These activities significantly alter the habitat conditions, affecting the body conditions of wild communities, especially those with low vagility, such as small mammals. We aimed to evaluate how cattle grazing and the habitat composition affected the body condition of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus in a southern Mediterranean agroforestry system using the Scale Mass Index (SMI) as an indicator of individuals condition. To assess variation in body condition, wood mice were live-trapped in a gradient of grazed sites with different stocking intensities, as well in sites excluded to grazing at different time periods (1998, 2004, and 2008). Wood mice body conditions were influenced by both microhabitat and macrohabitat drivers, with sex-biased patterns, while for the females, only the shrub species had an influence (a microhabitat variable); for the males, both the shrub species and the undercover density (and specifically their interaction) were the important drivers (microhabitat and macrohabitat variables). Unexpectedly, the physical condition variation detected between periods was not directly proportional to the exclusion period, but rather, a certain degree of similarity was found between the different sites (sites excluded since 2004 paired with grazed sites). These results suggest that the presence of food and shelter are determinants to the wood mouse's physical condition: for females, securing food sources enhance the body condition, while for males, the degree of cover, and consequently refuge against predators, seems to be determinant. These results reinforce the need for sustainable landscape management to assure the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity.

AB  - The concept of "reference conditions" describes the benchmark against which current conditions are compared when assessing the status of water bodies. In this paper we focus on the establishment of reference conditions for European lakes according to a phytoplankton biomass indicator-the concentration of chlorophyll-a. A mostly spatial approach (selection of existing lakes with no or minor human impact) was used to set the reference conditions for chlorophyll-a values, supplemented by historical data, paleolimnological investigations and modelling. The work resulted in definition of reference conditions and the boundary between "high" and "good" status for 15 main lake types and five ecoregions of Europe: Alpine, Atlantic, Central/Baltic, Mediterranean, and Northern. Additionally, empirical models were developed for estimating site-specific reference chlorophyll-a concentrations from a set of potential predictor variables. The results were recently formulated into the EU legislation, marking the first attempt in international water policy to move from chemical quality standards to ecological quality targets.

AB  - A study into the topical issue of environmental quality assessment by a range of indicators is given a review in the paper. An integrated approach is made use of in the research which is based on the case study of the Odessa industrial-and-urban agglomeration (IUA).
   Quality assessment of the natural components of the Odessa IUA environment by means of integrated indices of the natural environmental status and the natural component quality revealed that the studied urban ecosystem is impersistent on the whole, however, the environmental quality is quite favorable and the technogenic load is low. The environmental reliability of the studied area was classified as low.
   Prospects for development of Odessa Agglomeration, despite the complicated environmental situation, are quite favorable, due to the advantageous economic and geographical location, and the well-developed research, technical and recreational potential. Application of the structural analysis approach to definition of the adaptation strategy for the area makes it possible to suggest the ways for optimization of the natural environment component in the Odessa IUA.
   The assessment criteria for the area under study and the suggested adaptive governance tools constitute the research outcomes.

AB  - Soil condition or quality determines its ability to deliver a range of functions that support ecosystem services, human health and wellbeing. The increasing policy imperative to implement successful soil monitoring programmes has resulted in the demand for reliable soil quality indicators (SQIs) for physical, biological and chemical soil properties. The selection of these indicators needs to ensure that they are sensitive and responsive to pressure and change, e.g. they change across space and time in relation to natural perturbations and land management practices. Using a logical sieve approach based on key policy-related soil functions, this research assessed whether physical soil properties can be used to indicate the quality of British soils in terms of their capacity to deliver ecosystem goods and services. The resultant prioritised list of physical SQIs was tested for robustness, spatial and temporal variability, and expected rate of change using statistical analysis and modelling. Seven SQIs were prioritised: soil packing density, soil water retention characteristics, aggregate stability, rate of soil erosion, depth of soil, soil structure (assessed by visual soil evaluation) and soil sealing. These all have direct relevance to current and likely future soil and environmental policy and are appropriate for implementation in soil monitoring programmes.

AB  - Testate amoebae are valued for their functional significance and application as indicators of environmental conditions, particularly in peatland ecosystems. Research on testate amoebae has increased dramatically in recent years but there are still large parts of the world which have seen very little research. Here we consider testate amoeba communities of the West Siberian Lowland, the world's largest peatland region and therefore one of the largest potential habitats for testate amoebae. Extensive sampling identified 89 taxa and showed that testate amoeba communities are structured by their physical and biological environment. We identified significant relationships between amoeba communities and both moisture content and vegetation composition. Despite the assemblages containing many widely-distributed species, some taxa considered typical of peatlands (e. g. Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio) were comparatively rare or absent, paralleling findings further south in Asia. We suggest that testate amoebae in this region deserve further study and may have useful applications in palaeoecological reconstruction and as bioindicators of the impacts of oil and gas extraction.

AB  - Mining is an important economic activity that can have severe impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Plankton communities are commonly used as bioindicators of human-related threats to freshwater environments due to their rapid response to environmental conditions changes. Here, we used zooplankton functional diversity to understand the recovery patterns of an Amazonian lake impacted by mining activity (input of bauxite tailings) after 30 years of natural attenuation and active restoration processes. Zooplankton species richness and functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy-FDQ and community-level weighted means of trait values-CWM) were compared in impacted and reference areas during the flood period, in March 2015. We found a significant negative influence of turbidity on zooplankton FDQ, and similar FDQ and CWM values between the active restoration area and the reference area. These results suggest a positive effect of vegetation restoration efforts for the zooplankton community of Batata Lake. We demonstrated the utility of zooplankton functional diversity metrics as bioindicators of freshwater restoration, the response of the aquatic ecosystem to vegetation restoration and, consequently, water quality.

AB  - The farming-pastoral zone of northern China plays a dual role in ecological conditions and production and occupies an important position in the national economy. In this paper, the methodology of system engineering is introduced to construct and optimize an eco-productive paradigm system for the typical areas of the farming-pastoral zone. The system was constructed in the following steps: (1) design the framework of the paradigm system based on the data of physical site characteristics, biocommunities, production and economy, social culture and historical changes; (2) analyze the vegetation patterns, the interactions between vegetation and environmental factors (natural, social, economic, etc.) and the contributions of vegetation to the area, including the synthesis of the existing researches; and (3) provide the spatial arrangements of ecosystems and planning of each area, raise a comprehensive indicators of evaluation, evaluate the feasibility and soundness, and determine the optimum eco-productive paradigms for policy-makers which were land-use patterns within the threshold of ecological conservation. Three primitive paradigms of Maowusu (Mu Us) Ssandy Land, Loess Plateau and Huailai Basin in the farming-pastoral zone of northern China were proposed according to this paradigm system.

AB  - In Europe there is an extensive history of the derivation and use of benthic indicators which parallels similar developments in North America and elsewhere. Most recently, this has increased because major European Union Directives require that indicators of marine benthic change are used to confirm good ecological status quality (as in the Water Framework Directive) and favourable conservation status (as in the Habitats and Species Directive). Furthermore, these indicators have to fit within the current philosophy of the Ecosystem Approach requiring the development and use of Ecological Quality Objectives and Standards. Despite this, comparisons of families of indicators derived by differing methods have not been carried out such that the robust nature of the indicators on differing spatial scales and under differing benthic conditions has not been rigorously assessed. Using case studies from the Portuguese coasts and estuaries, this paper compares and contrasts univariate and multivariate macrobenthic indicators to quantify comparisons of change. The studies indicate the relative value of those indicators at contrasting spatial scales, e.g. in the transition from small areas around coastal submarine outfalls, to the local and regional estuarine and coastal scale. The analysis indicates the difficulties of deriving and using qualitative and quantitative indicators from benthic communities in stable, and in moderately and highly variable environmental conditions in estuarine, coastal and open sea habitats. In some areas, the variability in the indicators and indices within a station and site is as large as that between stations and sites. For those areas studied, there is an adequate quality and quantity of benthic data available for making management decisions but this is unlikely to be the case for all areas. Similarly, the interrogation of the methods shows that while their use and interpretation rely on a good understanding of the biology of the individual species and their responses to physical and polluting stress, that understanding is not yet available for many of the species. Most notably, while the indices and integrative indicators are becoming increasingly sophisticated, many are still dependent on the Pearson-Rosenberg model for organic enrichment hence they require to be validated for physical disturbance and for chemical pollution. Because of these features, the outcome of the analysis has repercussions for the management of coastal and estuarine areas. Although the present study indicates the value of indicators of benthic change for making management decisions at the various scales, further validation is required especially, for example, where one indicator over-estimates the ecological status for poor areas and underestimates it for good areas.

AB  - The condition-dependent model of optimal clutch size assumes body reserves required to initiate egg production include those for subsequent breeding phases. The threshold is expected to be similar among individuals, and hence postlaying condition should be independent of clutch size and lay date. Alternatively, the cost of incubation hypothesis predicts that females laying larger clutches should secure extra resources for incubation, and the expected fitness hypothesis suggests females adjust their condition according to the anticipated fitness benefits of the clutch. In these 2 cases, postlaying condition is predicted to be positively related to clutch size. We tested these predictions in common eider (Somateria mollissima), a precocial bird that produce eggs mostly from stored lipids and partly from endogenous proteins and rely extensively on reserves to incubate. We collected females at incubation onset and measured body condition indicators. Clutch size (number of eggs laid or number found in the nest at incubation onset) was not related to postlaying fat stores but females that laid fewer eggs maintained extra protein reserves. Timing of breeding was not related to postlaying body mass or protein reserves, whereas lay date's relationship with fat stores varied annually. Our results are generally consistent with the condition-dependent model and indicate variation in postlaying condition is mostly driven by factors other than clutch size and lay date. These data are inconsistent with the cost of incubation and the expected fitness hypotheses and suggest body store differences at incubation onset are mostly caused by environmental conditions encountered by laying females.

AB  - Large carnivores are ecologically important, but their behaviour frequently put them in conflict with humans. I suggest that a spatial co-occurrence of suitable habitat and relatively poor socioeconomic conditions in rural areas may contribute to inflated human-carnivore conflict. Here, I test if there is potential for such an explanation for the human-wolf conflict in Sweden, a conflict that is arguably not congruent with the costs and damages imposed by the wolf population. I found negative correlations between wolf habitat suitability within Swedish municipalities and indicators of their relative socioeconomic conditions. I argue that geographic socioeconomic inequality may contribute to the Swedish human-wolf conflict, partly by the use of wolves as symbols for socioeconomic dissent and partly by using them as scapegoats for socioeconomic conditions. Therefore, regional policies aimed at alleviating geographic socioeconomic inequities may create a more favourable environment for solving the human-wolf conflict in Sweden.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the ability of an animal to maintain its immune system and (or) mount an immune response depends on its nutritional health and energetic condition. Migration is a period within an animal's annual cycle when energetic condition varies, especially after a long, nonstop flight over a large ecological barrier. Our objective was to determine if measures of immune function in migrating Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus (Nuttall, 1840)). Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus (Lafresnaye, 1848)), and Veery (Catharus fuscescens (Stephens, 1817)) were related to the energetic condition of the birds at a stopover site during spring migration. We present data on total leukocyte, lymphocyte, an heterophil counts, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. serum immunoglobulin gamma G (IgG) concentration, and immune response to phytohemagglutinin. Thrushes arriving at the stopover site in poor energetic condition had low leukocyte and lymphocyte counts. Heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, heterophil count, and IgG concentration were not related to energetic condition. Furthermore, immune response to phytohemagglutinin was positively related to change in mass and days spent in captivity, suggesting that immune function may improve during stopover. We suggest that migrating thrushes arriving at a stopover site in poor energetic condition may also be in poor immunological condition and may have increased Susceptibility to disease or parasite infection.

AB  - As the water requirement for food production and other human needs grows, quantification of environmental flow requirements (EFRs) is necessary to assess the amount of water needed to sustain freshwater ecosystems. EFRs are the result of the quantification of water necessary to sustain the riverine ecosystem, which is calculated from the mean of an environmental flow (EF) method. In this study, five EF methods for calculating EFRs were compared with 11 case studies of locally assessed EFRs. We used three existing methods (Smakhtin, Tennant, and Tessmann) and two newly developed methods (the variable monthly flow method (VMF) and the Q(90)_Q(50) method). All methods were compared globally and validated at local scales while mimicking the natural flow regime. The VMF and the Tessmann methods use algorithms to classify the flow regime into high, intermediate, and low-flow months and they take into account intra-annual variability by allocating EFRs with a percentage of mean monthly flow (MMF). The Q(90)_Q(50) method allocates annual flow quantiles (Q(50) and Q(90)) depending on the flow season. The results showed that, on average, 37% of annual discharge was required to sustain environmental flow requirement. More water is needed for environmental flows during low-flow periods (46-71% of average low-flows) compared to high-flow periods (17-45% of average high-flows). Environmental flow requirements estimates from the Tennant, Q(90)_Q(50), and Smakhtin methods were higher than the locally calculated EFRs for river systems with relatively stable flows and were lower than the locally calculated EFRs for rivers with variable flows. The VMF and Tessmann methods showed the highest correlation with the locally calculated EFRs (R-2 = 0.91). The main difference between the Tessmann and VMF methods is that the Tessmann method allocates all water to EFRs in low-flow periods while the VMF method allocates 60% of the flow in low-flow periods. Thus, other water sectors such as irrigation can withdraw up to 40% of the flow during the low-flow season and freshwater ecosystems can still be kept in reasonable ecological condition. The global applicability of the five methods was tested using the global vegetation and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land (LPJmL) hydrological model. The calculated global annual EFRs for fair ecological conditions represent between 25 and 46% of mean annual flow (MAF). Variable flow regimes, such as the Nile, have lower EFRs (ranging from 12 to 48% of MAF) than stable tropical regimes such as the Amazon (which has EFRs ranging from 30 to 67% of MAF).

AB  - Since the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the ecological status of European running waters has been evaluated using a set of harmonised ecological indicators that should guide conservation and restoration actions. Among these, the restoration of the natural flow regime (ecological flows) is considered indispensable for the achievement of the good ecological status, and yet the sensitivity of the current biological indicators to hydrologic parameters remains understudied. The Italian Star_ICMi well represents similar WFD indicators; it is a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index officially adopted to assess the ecological status of running waters at the national level. Recent legislation has also included the Star_ICMi as one of the indicators used to assess and prescribe ecological flows in river reaches regulated by water abstraction. However, the relationship between river hydrology and the Star_ICMi index is so far virtually unknown. Using data from the Trentino Alto Adige Alpine region, we first assessed the relationship between the Star_ICMi and synthetic descriptors of the physico-chemical (LIMeco) and morphological (MQI) status of respectively 280 and 184 river reaches. Then, we examined the relation between the Star_ICMi and a set of ecologically-relevant hydrologic parameters derived from discharge time-series measured at 21 hydrometric stations, representing both natural and regulated river reaches. Although the Star_ICMi showed significant and linear relationships with the physico-chemical character and, slightly, with the morphological quality of the reaches, its response to flow parameters appeared weak or non-existent when examined with linear models. Mixed quantile regressions allowed the identification of flow parameters that represented limiting factors for macroinvertebrate communities and the associated Star ICMi scores. In particular, the index showed 'negative floors' where lower values were observed in reaches with large temporal variation in flow magnitude as well as frequent low and high flow events, The modelled quantiles also tracked the transition of the index from acceptable to unacceptable conditions.
   The results suggest that while the central tendency of the Star_ICMi index is not strongly influenced by river flow character, some key flow parameters represent limiting factors that allow the index to reach its lowest values, eventually 'pushing' the site towards unacceptable ecological conditions. The identification of limiting flow parameters can aid the setting of hydrologic thresholds over which ecological impairment is likely to occur, Overall, however, results imply caution is needed in using biological indicator like the Star_ICMi for the quantitative assessment and design of ecological flows.

AB  - A comparison of assemblages of Branchiopoda and Copepoda living in lakes and wetlands in two very distant territories in the Palaearctic Region, the Iberian Peninsula and Mongolia, is presented. Both territories have significant similarities in the hydromorphological and physicochemical characteristics of their water bodies and in the structure and composition of their fauna of branchiopods and copepods. Some species occur in both areas, others are taxonomically closely related, and others behave as geographic vicariants. Most of these microcrustaceans are used as indicators of ecological quality of standing water bodies in industrialized European countries, where reference sites are frequently difficult to find. Taking into account the undisturbed conditions of Mongolian water bodies, the alternative of using their branchiopods and copepods, after setting the proper, statistically-based equivalence between Mongolian and Iberian species, as references to assess ecological status in Spain is discussed.

AB  - Topography creates contrasting microclimates, especially between northern and southern slopes in drylands, which result in clear differences of tree cover patterns in the landscape. These local-scale differences in tree cover patterns may result from limitations occurring at different plant development stages, such as seed germination, seedling establishment, tree growth rate and survival, all crucial for the maintenance and expansion of plant populations through natural regeneration. Holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia Lam.) is a key tree species in Mediterranean drylands. We aim at measuring the impact of microclimatic conditions on holm oak trees regeneration success using traits as indicators of adult tree performance in an average climatic year and tree's distribution pattern at the landscape level as an indicator of tree establishment success. We hypothesize that under contrasting microclimatic conditions, seedlings performance is limiting the regeneration potential of holm oak trees rather than adult trees physiological performance. To quantify the microclimatic conditions originated by topography, two indicators were used: i) Potential Solar Radiation, as the amount of potential solar energy reaching the site above tree canopy; and ii) functional lichen diversity, as ecological indicators of microclimatic conditions under the tree canopy. The performance of holm oak was assessed on 40 adult trees growing in contrasting microclimatic conditions (high and low Potential Solar Radiation sites). Several indicators based on leaf, tree and stand response traits, frequently used as ecological indicators to evaluate tree performance and susceptibility to drought stress, were selected: specific leaf area, leaf reflectance indices, tree size, tree growth rate, tree age and tree density. We found that leaf physiological performance was similar under contrasting microclimatic conditions. However, in areas with higher Potential Solar Radiation tree age and density were significantly reduced. These results suggest that microclimatic differences located in southern slopes with high Potential Solar Radiation are limiting for germination and sapling establishment. Thus, forest regeneration, restoration and nature conservation practices aiming at increasing forests resilience in Mediterranean dryland climates should account for the importance of microclimate in defining the niche of seedlings and of adult trees.

AB  - Wetlands serve critical functions including natural flood control and providing wildlife habitat, yet despite these values they remain highly threatened systems. Here we present a landscape-scale geospatial assessment of wetlands in Wyoming. Areas containing high densities of wetlands were identified and mapped, and wetland complexes were quantified as a function of their biological diversity, protection status, susceptibility to climate change, and proximity to sources of impairment. Our results indicate there are 280591 wetlands in Wyoming, totaling 371758 surface hectares, and 222 wetland complexes. The majority (67%) of wetlands are classified as temporary. Low elevation wetland complexes are the least protected, in the poorest current condition, and the most vulnerable to future land use changes. This fundamental information will provide a tool decision-makers can use to more effectively allocate limited resources to conserve, manage, and restore Wyoming's wetlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Monthly skeletal extension rates were measured in colonies of Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata growing at Mahahual and Chinchorro Bank, in the Mexican Caribbean. Temperature, light extinction coefficient (k(d)), sedimentation rate, dissolved nutrients and wave energy were used as indicators of environmental conditions for coral growth. Zooxanthella density and mitotic index, nitrogen, phosphorous and protein in coral tissue, and living tissue thickness were measured during periods of high-density-band (HDB) and low-density-band (LDB) formation. To test their value as indirect measures of competition between zooxanthellae and host, as well as coral health and performance in both species, these biological parameters were also measured, during the HDB-formation period, in corals collected at La Blanquilla. This reef is located in the Gulf of Mexico, in an area of suboptimal environmental conditions for coral growth. M. faveolata had a significantly higher skeletal extension rate than M. annularis. Corals growing in Mahahual had significantly higher skeletal extension rate than those living in Chinchorro Bank. This is consistent with inshore-offshore gradients in growth rates observed by other authors in the same and other coral species. This is probably due to less favorable environmental conditions for coral growth in near shore Mahahual, where there is high hydraulic energy and high sedimentation rate. Contrary to observations of other authors, skeletal extension rate did not differ significantly between HDB and LDB-formation periods for both species of Montastraea. Both species produced their HDB between July and September, when the seawater temperatures are seasonally higher in the Mexican Caribbean. Tissue thickness indicated that environmental conditions are more favorable for coral health and performance during the HDB-formation period. Mitotic index data support the idea that zooxanthellae have competitive advantages for carbon over the host during the LDB-formation period. So, corals, during the LDB-formation period, with less favorable environmental conditions for coral performance and at a disadvantage for carbon with zooxanthellae, add new skeleton with little or no opportunity for thickening the existing one. This results in an equally extended skeleton with lower density, and the stretching response of skeletal growth, proposed for M. annularis growing under harsher environmental conditions, also occurs during the LDB-formation period.

AB  - This study analyzes wage differentials among Russian regions, focusing on two long-term factors shaping them: different regional economic structures and different living conditions. To examine the role of these factors we use microdata from the Rosstat's enterprise sample surveys conducted in 2005-2015, combined with data from the aggregated regional-level statistics. By estimating mincer-type wage equations extended with regional-level variables we show that regional differences in employment composition explain no more than a third of the total interregional variation in nominal wages. Wage compensations for relatively worse living conditions (higher price levels, colder winter, and worse environmental conditions) account for about a half of the remaining variation. Both factors together explain about 60% of the total variation in nominal wages among Russia's regions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the nature of interregional wage differentials in Russia and have important implications.

AB  - The concept of soil quality gives rise to more controversy than that of water or air quality. However, despite the difficulty in providing a definition, the maintenance of soil quality is critical for ensuring the sustainability of the environment and the biosphere. Literature exhibit a great number of soil quality indices for both agro-ecosystems and natural or contaminated soils. The objective of this work was to make a review of some of the soil quality indices established up to date as well as of the parameters that make up them, and to offer a reflection on the lack of consensus concerning the use of these indices. We will focus in those indices including biological parameters. The most straightforward index used in the literature is the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) (respiration to microbial biomass ratio), widely used to evaluate ecosystem development, disturbance or system maturity. However, qCO(2) and other indices integrating only two parameters provide insufficient information about soil quality or degradation. For this, lately there has been a wide development of multiparametric indices that clearly establish differences between management systems, soil contamination or density and type of vegetation. These indices integrate different parameters, among which the most important are the biological and chemical ones, such as pH, organic matter, microbial biomass C, respiration or enzyme activities. The major part of multiparametric indices has been established on the basis of either, expert opinion (subjective), or using mathematical-statistics methods (objective). Molecular indicators have not yet been used for soil quality indices establishment. However, the development of genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic methodologies could have importance in the evaluation of soil quality, not only in a diversity sense but also in a functional way. These methods can provide information about what is the role of specific microorganisms and their enzymes in key processes related to soil functionality. Despite of the great diversity of indices, they have never been used on larger scales, nor even in similar climatological or agronomic conditions. The lack of applicability of soil quality indices resides on: i) poor standardization of some methodologies; ii) some methods are out of reach in some parts of the world; iii) spatial scale problems (soil heterogeneity); iv) poor definition of soil natural conditions (climate and vegetation); and v) poor definition of soil function to be tested for soil quality.

AB  - The body condition of birds may be influenced by intrinsic (e.g., sex, age, migratory and breeding status) and extrinsic factors, such as anthropic activities (e.g., livestock raising). We described the biometry and body condition of Vermilion Flycatchers (VEFL) according to sex and age, and evaluated which factors best predict their body condition during the breeding season in the phytogeographic province of Espinal in central Argentina. The study area included Parque Luro Provincial Reserve and two nearby private ranches with livestock. We captured and banded VEFL using mist nets between October and February, from 2015 to 2019. We calculated scaled mass indices, which relates body mass to biometric measures (culmen, tarsus and tail lengths, and wing chord) to choose the best indicator of body condition. As explanatory variables, we used the breeding condition of females in one model, breeding condition of males in another model, and in a final model we used date, year, and site, and included all individuals. We banded 93 VEFL that did not vary according to age-dependent body size or reproductive condition. Nevertheless, females weighed more, had higher fat levels, and shorter wings than males. Body condition was only explained by breeding site, being smaller in one ranch than at the other ranch and the reserve. We highlight the importance of protected nature reserves to maintain bird populations and the need for further research to establish the mechanisms that modulate the body condition of Neotropical austral migrant birds to promote their conservation.

AB  - Although the maintenance of biodiversity has become one of the goals in ecosystem management, the relationships of diversity to ecosystem characteristics such as level of herbivory, productivity, and vegetation structure are still poorly understood, We examined these relationships in 8 native grassland sites differing in grazing histories and range condition in the Mixed Grassland (6), Moist Mixed Grassland (1) and Aspen Parkland (1) ecoregions of southern Saskatchewan. Range condition, assessed using standard methods, ranged from fair to excellent. The Shannon's diversity index followed a curvi-linear relationship with range condition, increasing from fair to good, but decreasing from good to excellent condition, within a range between 0.66 and 2.58. Species evenness was affected by range condition in a similar manner ranging from 0.44 to 0.86, Species richness varied among sites and plots between 4 and 28 plants 0.25 m(-2), but changed little with range condition. Most structural parameters, such as the cover, height, or thickness of standing plants (live or dead) and litter, increased with range condition especially from good to excellent. The Shannon's diversity index was positively correlated with forb biomass, but not with biomass of any other group or their combination. Grazing regimes that maintain good range condition also maintain species and structural diversity of grasslands.

AB  - The monitoring of resource condition is receiving renewed attention across several levels of government in Australia. This interest is linked to substantial investment in environmental remediation and aquatic ecosystem restoration in particular. In this context, it is timely to consider principles which ought to guide the development and implementation of monitoring programmes for wetland ecosystems. A framework is established which places monitoring in the context of the strategic adaptive management of wetlands. This framework requires there has to be clear goals for the extent and condition of the resource, with these goals being defined within thresholds of acceptable variability. Qualitative and, where possible, quantitative conceptual models linking management interventions to management goals should be the basis of indicator selection and assessment. The intensity of sampling ought to be informed by pilot surveys of statistical power in relation to the thresholds of acceptable variability identified within the management plan.

AB  - We examined the effect of agrochemical pollution/fertilisation of the soil and climatic conditions at high altitudes on fluctuating asymmetry (FA) level in hindfemur and forewing lengths of the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus (Zetterstedt). All traits and samples exhibited ideal FA. Forewings. which are less functionally significant in this species, generally exhibited greater FA than the more functionally significant femora. Forewing FA was also more affected by stress induced by climatic conditions at high altitudes than femur FA. The high altitude sample was the most asymmetric sample for both traits, followed by the two control samples. The two samples from agrochemically contaminated habitats showed the lowest asymmetry in femora and forewings of C. parallelus. These results suggest that high altitude imposes more stress on this grasshopper species than does agrochemical contamination although the stress response was more dramatic in the less functional trait.

AB  - The paper presents a method of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image processing to assess the condition of forests in the Tatra National Park (southern Poland). Selected images were acquired on 1987/09/01, 2005/09/02 and 2011/09/03 from the same sensor with maximum time interval for the first and last scene and from similar phenological period. Firstly, the data were radiometrically corrected using the ATCOR 2/3 software and Digital Terrain Model from the ASTER mission. Quality of the correction was assessed calculating RMSE for reflectance values from images and resampled spectral characteristics collected in terrain. RMSE was in range 3-10%. Next, basing on Landsat images, Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and a Maximum Likelihood supervised classificatory, following dominant land cover types were identified: forests (including dwarf pine), grasslands, rocks, lakes, shadows (additionally clouds were distinguished on data from 1987/09/01). It allowed to select forest areas with producer accuracy not worse than 97.69% and user accuracy not worse than 98.31%. On corrected Landsat images Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, an overall vegetation state) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI, canopy water content) were calculated. Vegetation indices discriminated forest state using the decision tree method. The worst overall condition was observed for the 1987 (about 21% of forest stands were in the worst condition and 87% were in medium condition), while the best one in 2005 (75.51% forest stands were in good condition and 10.66% were in the best condition). In case of 2011, the overall condition was quite good, but there were large areas with poor condition caused by bark beetle outbreaks. Proposed method allows for a fast and objective assessment of forest condition. It is possible to detect damaged areas or stands in poor condition. It can be complement for traditional methods of monitoring and management in forestry and nature protection.

AB  - Body condition is a useful measure of the nutritional status and performance in ungulates. The most widely used indicators of body condition are based on fat reserves, mainly those surrounding the kidneys. To estimate the body condition in large herbivores, researchers often collect and pool the data from both kidneys and their perirenal fat in order to compensate for potential differences between the body condition indicators obtained from the left and right kidneys. Since these differences do not seem to be properly established in wildlife, we checked for the potential differences between the body condition indicators, derived from both kidneys, in wild ungulates. In the present study, we used red deer Cervus elaphus, both under experimental and field conditions, as a model to analyse the patterns of response of the body condition indicators, calculated from left and right kidneys, to supplementary feeding, sex, age class and season. By considering two analytical approaches - kidney fat index and fat weight (including kidney weight as a covariate) we consistently obtained similar statistical results and the same ecological interpretations by using left, right and average indicators for all the factors tested. In the experimental study, supplementary feeding had a significant effect on all the body condition indicators of red deer hinds. Under field circumstances, the condition indicators were statistically higher in females than in males and they increased with age. Sex related differences were significant in the winter. Taking into account our results, we hypothesize that information from only one kidney will be enough to assess the body condition in red deer and probably in other wild ungulates. However, a standardized sample (i.e. always using the same kidney and associated fat) should be used, while a better understanding regarding possible asymmetries in the amount of the energy reserves on each side of the animals' bodies has not been reached. Our study has clear implications concerning wildlife monitoring since it represents a considerable reduction of time and effort, both in the field (collecting the samples) and in the laboratory (processing and weighing the samples) when evaluating the body condition of individuals and populations.

AB  - Line transect surveys are widely used in Neotropical rainforests to estimate the population abundance of medium-and large-sized vertebrates. The use of indices such as encounter rate has been criticized because the probability of animal detection may fluctuate due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions among sites. In addition, the morphological and behavioral characteristics (biological traits) of species affect their detectability. In this study, we compared the extent to which environmental conditions and species' biological traits bias abundance estimates in terra firme rainforests in French Guiana. The selected environmental conditions included both physical conditions and forest structure covariates, while the selected biological traits included the morphological and behavioral characteristics of species. We used the distance sampling method to model the detection probability as an explicit function of environmental conditions and biological traits and implemented a model selection process to determine the relative importance of each group of covariates. Biological traits contributed to the variability of animal detectability more than environmental conditions, which had only a marginal effect. Detectability was best for large animals with uniform or disruptive markings that live in groups in the canopy top. Detectability was worst for small, solitary, terrestrial animals with mottled markings. In the terra firme rainforests that represent similar to 80% of the Amazonia and Guianas regions, our findings support the use of relative indices such as the encounter rate to compare population abundance between sites in species-specific studies. Even though terra firme rainforests may appear similar between regions of Amazonia and the Guianas, comparability must be ensured, especially in forests disturbed by human activity. The detection probability can be used as an indicator of species' vulnerability to hunting and, thus, to the risk of local extinction. Only a few biological trait covariates are required to correctly estimate the detectability of the majority of medium-and large-sized vertebrates. Thus, a biological trait model could be useful in predicting the detection probabilities of rare, uncommon, or localized species for which few data are available to fit the detection function.

AB  - We contend that traditional approaches to forest conservation and management will be inadequate given the predicted scale of social-economic and biophysical changes in the 21st century. New approaches, focused on anticipating and guiding ecological responses to change, are urgently needed to ensure the full value of forest ecosystem services for future generations. These approaches acknowledge that change is inevitable and sometimes irreversible, and that maintenance of ecosystem services depends in part on novel ecosystems, i.e., species combinations with no analog in the past. We propose that ecological responses be evaluated at landscape or regional scales using risk-based approaches to incorporate uncertainty into forest management efforts with subsequent goals for management based on Achievable Future Conditions (AFC). AFCs defined at a landscape or regional scale incorporate advancements in ecosystem management, including adaptive approaches, resilience, and desired future conditions into the context of the Anthropocene. Inherently forward looking, ACFs encompass mitigation and adaptation options to respond to scenarios of projected future biophysical, social-economic, and policy conditions which distribute risk and provide diversity of response to uncertainty. The engagement of science-management-public partnerships is critical to our risk-based approach for defining AFCs. Robust monitoring programs of forest management actions are also crucial to address uncertainty regarding species distributions and ecosystem processes. Development of regional indicators of response will also be essential to evaluate outcomes of management strategies. Our conceptual framework provides a starting point to move toward AFCs for forest management, illustrated with examples from fire and water management in the Southeastern United States. Our model is adaptive, incorporating evaluation and modification as new information becomes available and as social-ecological dynamics change. It expands on established principles of ecosystem management and best management practices (BMPs) and incorporates scenarios of future conditions. It also highlights the potential limits of existing institutional structures for defining AFCs and achieving them. In an uncertain future of rapid change and abrupt, unforeseen transitions, adjustments in management approaches will be necessary and some actions will fail. However, it is increasingly evident that the greatest risk is posed by continuing to implement strategies inconsistent with current understanding of our novel future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pathogens may be important for host population dynamics, as they can be a proximate cause of morbidity and mortality. Infection dynamics, in turn, may be dependent on the underlying condition of hosts. There is a clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition and so on. To provide empirical data that support this notion, we measured haematological indicators of infection (neutrophils and monocytes) and condition (red blood cells (RBCs) and lymphocytes) in field voles from three populations sampled monthly for 2 years. Mixed-effect models were developed to evaluate two hypotheses, (i) that individuals with low lymphocyte and/or RBC levels are more prone to show elevated haematological indicators of infection when re-sampled four weeks later, and (ii) that a decline in indicators of condition is likely to follow the development of monocytosis or neutrophilia. We found that individuals with low RBC and lymphocyte counts had increased probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in neutrophils, and that high indices of infection (neutrophilia and monocytosis) were generally followed by a declining tendency in the indicators of condition (RBCs and lymphocytes). The vicious circle that these results describe suggests that while pathogens overall may be more important in wildlife dynamics than has previously been appreciated, specific pathogens are likely to play their part as elements of an interactive web rather than independent entities.

AB  - Conservation adequacy is defined as the ability of conservation measures to sustain biodiversity. Although river network connectivity is important for maintaining key ecological processes and ensuring persistence of biodiversity, it also facilitates the propagation of threats along river networks, which may compromise the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity and therefore conservation adequacy. This study aims to introduce two modifications to river conservation planning related to connectivity and catchment condition that together can improve the adequacy of the priority areas identified. This will establish an operational framework for end-users, such as policy makers and NGOs. We operationalize the connectivity framework that has recently emerged in systematic river conservation planning by using a GIS coding system for catchment location in the conservation software package marxan. Additionally, we use a landscape measure of catchment disturbance to direct the conservation plan to the least-disturbed area while still meeting targets for the conservation of fish species used as surrogates for overall biodiversity in our study catchment, the Daly River in northern Australia. This proxy for condition aggregates information on land-use, extractive industries, point-source pollution, and water infrastructure. We successfully modelled the distribution of 39 fish species based on GIS-derived landscape descriptors (most important descriptors were; discharge, distance to river mouth, geology and conductivity). Results from the systematic planning analysis identified a portfolio of watersheds that delivered close to optimal upstream protection with around 4700 stream kilometres (30% of the total network). When using upstream disturbance as an extra penalty, most of the network stayed intact; however, a replacement area was found for a major tributary, which only added an extra 1% of the stream network to the total area. Synthesis and applications. Improving conservation adequacy by accounting for upstream connectivity and condition using this easy-to-implement framework and software package has the potential to facilitate further application of systematic methods in river conservation planning. Furthermore, integrating condition as a discounting factor can also improve conservation adequacy in a broad range of environments (including terrestrial and marine), while not necessarily increasing the management costs.

AB  - The urgency and various hypotheses about the nature and causes of destructive forms of behavior (hetero- and autoaggression, suicidal and addictive behavior) are grounded and presented. The aim of the study was to analyze the destructive behavior of adolescents in different social conditions (the parents' family, educational institutions, peers, an educational colony for juvenile offenders). Mater ials and methods. Four groups of adolescents were examined: 1 - serving sentences in educational colonies (n = 265); 2 - located in the regional camp " Sibextrom" (n = 113); 3 - students of vocational schools and lyceums (114); 4 - students of general secondary schools (1032). Psychodiagnostics of destructive manifestations, including aggressive and autoaggressive tendencies, was carried out using the Bassa-Darka questionnaire (Buss A. H., Durkee A., 1957). Resul ts. Socio-psychological parameters of destructive behavior in 265 male and female adolescents aged between 14 and 18 (mean age 17.08 +/- 0.8 years) with drug and alcohol addiction under different socialization conditions, including in penitentiary environment with the serving of punishment in educational colonies are analyzed. Aggressiveness of adolescents in the conditions of the penitentiary system is transformed from open forms of aggression into passive (indirect aggression, irritability, guilt and hostility). Analysis of suicidal actions of juvenile delinquents revealed: girls significantly more often than young men attempted suicide (61.8% and 22.0% respectively, p< 0.05). The main method of suicide in girls is self-cutting (29.1%), for young men - self-propagation (12.0%). Aggressiveness of adolescents in the conditions of the penitentiary system is transformed from open forms of aggression into passive (indirect aggression, irritability, guilt and hostility). The most significant correlations in young men are obtained between suicide attempts and indicators of indirect aggression (p=0.012), suspicion (p=0.001) and hostility (p=0.005); in girls - between suicide attempts and indicators of feelings of guilt (p=0.034). Conclusions. The peculiarities of the formation of destructive forms of behavior (hetero-, and autoaggression, suicidal and addicted behavior) are revealed, taking into account gender-age differences, characterological characteristics of the individual, the conditions of upbringing. The specification and modifying effect of penitentiary aggression on formation of parameters of suicidal behavior in delinquent adolescents is established.

AB  - Calcareous shales and black limestones of the Jurassic Amran Group, located in the Sharab area (SW Yemen), were analysed based on organic and inorganic geochemical methods. The results of this study were used to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions during Jurassic time and their relevance to organic matter enrichment during deposition of the Amran calcareous shale and black limestone deposits. The analysed Amran samples have present-day TOC and Stotai content values in the range of 0.25-0.91 wt % and 0.59-4.96 wt %, respectively. The relationship between Stotal and TOC contents indicates that the Jurassic Amran deposits were deposited in a marine environment as supported by biomarker environmental indicators. Biomarker distributions also reflect that the analysed Amran deposits received high contributions of marine organic matter (e.g., algal and microbial) with minor amount of land plant source inputs. Low oxygen (reducing) conditions during deposition of the Jurassic Amran deposits are indicated from low Pr/Ph values and relatively high elemental ratios of V/Ni and V/(V + Ni). Enrichment in the pyrite grains and very high DOPT and high Fe/Al ratios further suggest reducing bottom waters. This paleo-redox (i.e., reducing) conditions contributed to preservation of organic matter during deposition of the Jurassic Amran deposits. Semi-arid to warm climatic conditions are also evidenced during deposition of the Amran sediments and consequently increased biological productivity within the photic zone of the water column during deposition. Therefore, the increased bioproductivity in combination with good preservation of organic matter identified as the major mechanisms that gave rise to organic matter enrichment. This contradicts with the low organic matter content of the present-day TOC values of less than 1%. The biomarker maturity data indicate that the analysed Amran samples are of high thermal maturity; therefore, the low present-day TOC is attributed to the thermal effect on the original organic matter. This high thermal maturity level is due to the presence of volcanic rocks, which have invaded the Jurassic rocks during Late Oligocene to Early Miocene. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Donax trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the most common bivalve molluscs inhabiting the sandy shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This species, which is preferentially distributed on sediments at depths between 0 and about 2 m, is considered to be a substrate-sensitive organism because of its sensitivity to sediment grain size variations during its life cycle, in particular during its early growth stages. This study aims at investigating the relationship between D. trunculus' density distributions and sediment grain size, in order to evaluate its use as a biological indicator of grain-size variations in beach sediment. For this purpose, a specific environmental study was performed by ISPRA (Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research) along six beaches located in the Central Tyrrhenian Sea between Ladispoli and Anzio (Rome, Italy). On each beach, samples of D. trunculus and superficial sediments were collected in the infra-littoral zone at 3 different depths (0, 0.5, and 1 m) between June 2002 and March 2004. The results pointed out that the distribution of D. trunculus populations is strongly influenced by the sediment's grain size variations. A significant positive correlation was found between species density and the 2.00-phi and 2.50-phi grain size classes; but, in particular, the predominance of the 2.00-phi grain size class in the beach's sediment seems to positively influence the species density and distribution.
   This study suggests that sediment grain size is the chief factor controlling the distribution of D. trunculus populations: suitable grain sizes allow the settlement and the subsequent growth of well-structured populations. Generally, species density declined in areas subjected to grain-size variations in beach sediments, suggesting a predictable biological response to both natural and human-caused stressors. The present study also highlighted that where nourishment was carried out using suitable sediments, the species reappears on the beach after a few months, as it finds an optimal substrate for settlement. In this case, finding D. trunculus specimens a few months after replenishment indicates that the nourishment operations have been successful from an environmental point of view. As reported by Carignan and Villard (2002), a species that is strongly associated with particular habitat features could be a useful indicator: in particular, a species - like D. trunculus - that is negatively associated with human disturbances could be considered a "positive" indicator of ecological integrity.
   Long-term monitoring of D. trunculus abundance or density on sandy beaches (adequately carried out during the species' recruitment period, e.g. between July and September), could help pinpoint the presence of natural or human-made phenomena that are leading to grain-size variations in the sediment. In conclusion, we can assume that D. trunculus can be used as a practical biological indicator to detect grain size variations on sandy beaches in coastal monitoring programmes; it could be a useful tool for researchers, managers and administrators to assess erosion phenomena while minimizing times and costs, also in view of an integrated coastal zone management.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Mammary infections in dairy cattle are still a major problem which impair animal health and jeopardize breeders' efforts to attain sustainable production. The first natural protection against pathogens 'access to udder tissue is the teat canal. Teat canal morphology can be influenced by several environmental factors but the present study confirmed the existence of a genetic component. Moreover it was observed that the teat canal morphology is related to milk production and somatic cell count, the latter being an indirect indicator of mammary infections. Considering that the current selection objectives implemented in dairy cattle worldwide have shifted toward a more balanced breeding goal, with a larger emphasis on health traits, a further genetic deterioration in teat condition is not expected.
   In spite of the impressive advancements observed on both management and genetic factors, udder health still represents one of most demanding objectives to be attained in the dairy cattle industry. Udder morphology and especially teat condition might represent the first physical barrier to pathogens' access. The objectives of this study were to investigate the genetic component of teat condition and to elucidate its relationship with both milk yield and somatic cell scores in dairy cattle. Moreover, the effect of selection for both milk yield and somatic cell scores on teat condition was also investigated. A multivariate analysis was conducted on 10,776 teat score records and 30,160 production records from 2469 Italian Holstein cows. Three teat scoring traits were defined and included in the analysis. Heritability estimates for the teat score traits were moderate to low, ranging from 0.084 to 0.238. When teat score was based on a four-classes ordinal scoring, its genetic correlation with milk yields and somatic cell score were 0.862 and 0.439, respectively. The scale used to classify teat-end score has an impact on the magnitude of the estimates. Genetic correlations suggest that selection for milk yield could deteriorate teat health, unless more emphasis is given to somatic cell scores. Considering that both at national and international level, the current selection objectives are giving more emphasis to health traits, a further genetic deterioration in teat condition is not expected.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the allocation of energy to growth, condition and reproduction was examined in juvenile and adult Atlantic cod Gadus morhua inhabiting the southern Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada. The study period included both the warmest and coldest environmental conditions in the area over the past 60 yr. Temperature did not influence growth in length or weight, perhaps because growth at higher temperatures was limited by prey availability. Temperature significantly influenced both gutted body condition and liver condition (observed weight divided by predicted weight at length), but the effect was not consistent between the 2 measures of condition. Gutted body condition was highest at warm temperatures, whereas liver condition was highest at low temperatures. Measures of reproductive investment showed clear temperature effects. Fish matured earlier at both low and high temperatures than at intermediate temperatures. Fecundity of southern Grand Bank cod was highest at low temperatures, while the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was highest at warm temperatures. The lack of correlation with fecundity indicates that GSI may not be a good metric of reproductive investment but may be an indicator of how close fish are to spawning. The lower maturity and fecundity at intermediate temperatures could indicate a decrease in reproductive potential under these environmental conditions. Temperature throughout the entire year influenced fish condition, but only temperature during October to May affected reproductive investment. Most of the metrics were highly correlated between males and females, suggesting that both sexes make similar decisions about energy allocation over the observed temperature range.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating on the importance of plant cover and plant species composition on the control of ecosystem processes. In this study we examined a gradient considering the proportional contribution of the key species Bouteloua gracilis H.B.K. Lag. to assess its influence on the average and dynamic changes in soil water content in the shortgrass steppe from Central Mexico. We chose 4 sites with the following proportions of the key species: < 25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75%, and > 75%, ascribing each proportion to the range condition categories poor, fair, good, and excellent, respectively. Soil water measurements were carried out during 14 months at the 4 sites. Our results showed that range condition had a significant effect on soil water content (P < 0.01). The excellent condition was overall 14.5% and 12.5% lower soil moisture content compared to the poor and good range conditions (P < 0.01), respectively. Our results indicated a negative correlation between the gradient of soil water content with the range condition classes. Soil water content dynamics also differed among range condition classes, with the excellent condition showing both faster water recharge and extraction patterns than the other 3 range condition categories. Differences in soil water content among the range condition classes appeared to be related to morphological and physiological traits associated with the dominant species cover observed at each site. These results offer insights into the importance of vegetation characteristics as potential indicators of thresholds in grazing ecosystem processes such as soil water dynamics.

AB  - Polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) are a class of Persistent Organic Pollutants extremely hard to remove from soil. The use of plants to promote the degradation of PCBs, thanks to synergic interactions between roots and the natural soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere, has been proved to constitute an effective and environmentally friendly remediation technique. Preliminary microcosm experiments were conducted in a greenhouse for 12 months to evaluate the capacity of the Monviso hybrid poplar clone, a model plant for phytoremediation, to grow in a low quality and PCB-contaminated soil in order to assess if this clone could be subsequently used in a field experiment. For this purpose, three different soil conditions (Microbiologically Active, Pre-sterilized and Hypoxic soils) were set up in order to assess the capacity of this clone to grow in the polluted soil in these different conditions and support the soil microbial community activity. The growth and physiology (chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, ascorbate, phenolic compounds and flavonoid contents) of the poplar were determined. Moreover, chemical analyses were performed to assess the concentrations of PCB indicators in soil and plant roots. Finally, the microbial community was evaluated in terms of total abundance and activity under the different experimental conditions. Results showed that the poplar clone was able to grow efficiently in the contaminated soil and to promote microbial transformations of PCBs. Plants grown in the hypoxic condition promoted the formation of a higher number of higher-chlorinated PCBs and accumulated lower PCBs in their roots. However, plants in this condition showed a higher stress level than the other microcosms, producing higher amounts of phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbate contents, as a defence mechanism.

AB  - Various forms of human activity in large cities contribute to the creation of a specific climate and new environmental conditions for plants. One of the most important results is the so-called atmospheric urban heat island (UHI). The aim of this study was to compare the thermal conditions in the Lublin City center with those of suburban areas, and so confirm the existence of the UHI and then analyze the influence of thermal conditions on features of the flora. The analysis of the air temperatures was based on data from 2000 to 2014 provided by meteorological stations in the Lublin City center and its nearest surroundings. Floristic data were collected during field studies between 2012-2014 and included species richness and frequency, life forms, and synecological groups of the flora and its elements. The thermal requirements of species were defined on the basis of ecological indicator values (EIVs). Our research confirmed the presence of the UHI in the Lublin City center. Over the study period, the mean temperature in the city center was by 0.87 degrees C higher than that in the suburban areas. The largest differences in mean annual air temperature between the city center and the suburbs were recorded in 2007 and 2011-2013. In total, 552 species were recorded, including six life-form and synecological groups, 246 thermophilous and 436 heliophilous species. The species richness, proportion of therophytes, alien, thermo- and heliophilous species decreased with distance from the city center. The thermal conditions expressed by the EIV L and T ranged from L = 4.5, T = 3.8 in the city center, to L = 3.1, T = 3.4 in the suburbs. An ordination analysis facilitated determination of the relationships between characteristics of the flora, the EIV values, and land use classes. An increasing level of anthropopressure was found to be positively correlated with thermal conditions and the flora traits.

AB  - As reported in several studies, the presence of Abies alba Mill (silver fir) has been declining throughout its natural range over a large part of mountainous belt in the Mediterranean area. In such a context, regeneration establishment depends mainly on the occurrence of a suitable combination of water and light availability. Thus, before planning any forest management practice, it is essential to investigate on the optimal microclimate conditions influencing the success of natural regeneration of silver fir. To this aim, changes in growth and photosynthesis together with C, N and O isotope compositions have been investigated on silver fir naturally recruited saplings, growing in mixed stands with Fagus sylvatica on Apennine mountains (southern Italy). The apical dominance ratio (ADR, ratio between apical shoot length and length of first whorl lateral twigs) has been used as an indicator for microclimate conditions in which saplings grow. Based on the range of ADR values (i.e. from 0.10 to 1.30), saplings were distributed in four classes. As expected, increases in height, root collar diameter and radial growth correspond to enhancing ADR values, gaining the optimal conditions in class IV. This latter also displayed the best performance in terms of maximum CO2 assimilation at saturating light (A(max)) and water-use efficiency as assessed by carbon isotope discrimination analysis. Conversely, class I and II seem to display the highest performance in terms of CO2 respiration rate (R-d) and absolute water loss saving as assessed by the application of oxygen isotopes. We conclude that, in relatively mild Mediterranean areas, forest managers should promote silvicultural treatments favouring light conditions and migration of saplings towards class IV of ADR.

AB  - Ground water systems dominated by iron- or sulfate-reducing conditions may be distinguished by observing concentrations of dissolved iron (Fe2+) and sulfide (sum of H2S, HS-, and S-= species and denoted here as "H2S"). This approach is based on the observation that concentrations of Fe2+ and H2S in ground water systems tend to be inversely related according to a hyperbolic function. That is, when Fe2+ concentrations are high, H2S concentrations tend to be low and vice versa. This relation partly reflects the rapid reaction kinetics of Fe2+ with H2S to produce relatively insoluble ferrous sulfides (FeS). This relation also reflects competition for organic substrates between the iron- and the sulfate-reducing microorganisms that catalyze the production of Fe2+ and H2S. These solubility and microbial constraints operate in tandem, resulting in the observed hyperbolic relation between Fe2+ and H2S concentrations. Concentrations of redox indicators, including dissolved hydrogen (H-2) measured in a shallow aquifer in Hanahan, South Carolina, suggest that if the Fe2+/H2S mass ratio (units of mg/L) exceeded 10, the screened interval being tapped was consistently iron reducing (H-2 similar to 0.2 to 0.8 nM). Conversely, if the Fe2+/H2S ratio was less than 0.30, consistent sulfate-reducing (H-2 similar to 1 to 5 nM) conditions were observed over time. Concomitantly high Fe2+ and H2S concentrations were associated with H-2 concentrations that varied between 0.2 and 5.0 nM over time, suggesting mixing of water from adjacent iron- and sulfate-reducing zones or concomitant iron and sulfate reduction under nonelectron donor-limited conditions. These observations suggest that Fe2+/H2S mass ratios may provide useful information concerning the occurrence and distribution of iron and sulfate reduction in ground water systems.

AB  - Accurate and precise detection of anthropogenic impacts on stream ecosystems using macroinvertebrates as biological indicators depends on the use of appropriate field and laboratory methods. We assessed the responsiveness to anthropogenic disturbances of assemblage metrics and composition by comparing commonly employed alternative combinations of field sampling and individuals counting methods. Four datasets were derived by, in the field 1) conducting multihabitat sampling (MH) or 2) targeting samples in leaf packs (single-habitat sampling - SH) and, in the laboratory A) counting all individuals of the samples, or B) simulating subsampling of 300 individuals per sample. We collected our data from 39 headwater stream sites in a drainage basin located in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used a previously published quantitative integrated disturbance index (IDI), based on both local and catchment disturbance measurements, to characterize the intensity of anthropogenic alterations at each site. Family richness and % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (% EPT) individuals obtained from each dataset were tested against the IDI through simple linear regressions, and the differences in assemblage composition between least- and most-disturbed sites were tested using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA). When counting all individuals, differences in taxonomic richness and assemblage composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages between least- and most-disturbed sites were more pronounced in the MH than in the SH sampling method. Leaf packs seemed to concentrate high abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates in highly disturbed sites, acting as `biodiversity hotbeds' in these situations, which likely reduced the response of the assemblages to the disturbance gradient when this substrate was targeted. However, MH sampling produced weaker results than SH when subsampling was performed. The % EPT individuals responded better to the disturbance gradient when SH was employed, and its efficiency was not affected by the subsampling procedure. We conclude that no single method was the best in all situations, and the efficiency of a sampling protocol depends on the combination of field and laboratory methods being used. Although the total count of individuals with multihabitat sampling obtained the best results for most of the evaluated variables, the decision of which procedures to use depends on the amount of time and resources available, on the variables of interest, on the availability of habitat types in the sites sampled, and on the other methods being employed in the sampling protocol.

AB  - The objective of the study is to develop favourable environment's assessment and forecasting methodology for social entrepreneurship development in market economies. Methodology. Econometric method to build regression model of country's favourable conditions for social entrepreneurs' relationship to its determinants is applied in the research. The research is based on previously developed multi-step algorithm: statistical data systematization, regression model building and relevant variables' selection, new regression model building excluding insignificant variables, type of regression model setting and scenario forecasting. The type of regression model that best describes the correlation nature has been determined. Scenario forecasting of country's favourable conditions' changes for social entrepreneurs based on "state policy support of social entrepreneurship development" implementation has been carried out. Three scenarios of social entrepreneurship development have been designed: pessimistic, inertial (basic) and optimistic. Research data comes from statistical databases of "The best countries to be a social entrepreneur" poll conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2016 and 2019. Study results revealed that country's favourable conditions for social entrepreneurs' development are mostly affected by government policy support and investment access which form particular environment aimed at successful economic performance inside a country. Practical implications. Assessment and forecasting of favourable development of social entrepreneurship reveals its strengths and weaknesses that need to be improved through implementation of centralized "government policy for the development of social entrepreneurship." This enables countries not only to keep scores of "the best country for the development of social entrepreneurship", but also to improve their position in the future. Value/originality. Nowadays social entrepreneurship is becoming a tool to overcome current challenges and preserve human potential by the resurgence of innovative forms of business. One of the ways to achieve the objective is proposed in our study.

AB  - 1. AusRivAS (Australian River Assessment Scheme) models were developed, using macroinvertebrates as indicators, to assess the ecological condition of rivers in Western Australia as part of an Australia-wide program. The models were based on data from 188 minimally disturbed reference sites and are similar to RIVPACS models used in Britain. The major habitats in the rivers (macrophyte, channel) were sampled separately and macroinvertebrates collected were identified to family level.
   2. Laboratory sorting of preserved macroinvertebrate samples recovered about 90% of families present when 150 animals were collected, whereas live picking in the field recovered only 76%.
   3. Reference sites clustered into five groups on the basis of macroinvertebrate families present. Using seven physical variables, a discriminant function allocated 73% of sites to the correct classification group. A discriminant function based on seven physical and two chemical variables allocated 81% of sites to the correct group. However, when the same reference sites were re-sampled the following year, the nine variable discriminant function misallocated more sites than the seven variable function, owing to annual fluctuations in water chemistry that were not accompanied by changes in fauna.
   4. In preliminary testing, the wet season channel model correctly assessed 80% of reference sites as undisturbed in the year subsequent to model building (10% of sites were expected to rate as disturbed because the 10th percentile was used as the threshold for disturbance). Nine sites from an independent data set, all thought to be disturbed, were assessed as such by the model. Results from twenty test sites, chosen because they represented a wide range of ecological condition, were less clear-cut. In its current state the model reliably distinguishes undisturbed and severely disturbed sites. Subtle impacts are either detected inconsistently or do not affect ecological condition.

AB  - The Lower Green Bay and Fox River Area of Concern (LGB&FR AOC) is one of the most ecologically diverse but demonstrably impaired AOCs in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We outline a transparent, quantitative process for setting targets to remove two fish and wildlife-related beneficial use impairments (BUIs). The method identifies important habitats and species/species groups and weights them according to ecological and socioeconomic criteria. These weights are paired with standardized estimates of current condition ranging from 0 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible). A weighted average of the condition scores gives an overall AOC condition for each BUI, creating a baseline for setting future restoration or BUI removal targets. Weighted averages for the LGB&FR AOC yielded a current condition of 3.60 for fish and wildlife habitats and 4.65 for species/species groups. Based on achievable restoration scenarios and discussions with local experts and stakeholders, we propose removal targets of 6.0 for the "loss of fish and wildlife habitat" BUI and 6.5 for the "degradation of fish and wildlife populations" BUI. This quantitative approach illuminates multiple pathways for reaching restoration targets and facilitates informed discussions about cost effective restoration projects. According to our results, species and species groups in this AOC are generally in better current condition than habitats when compared on the same 0-10 scale. This suggests that many (though not all) desirable fish and wildlife populations in the LGB&FR AOC are able to survive in relatively degraded habitats or are able to use these habitats productively during part of their life cycle.

AB  - 1. Pathogens have been proposed as potentially important drivers of population dynamics, but while a few studies have investigated the impact of specific pathogens, the wealth of information provided by general indices of health has hardly been exploited. By evaluating haematological parameters in wild populations, our knowledge of the dynamics of health and infection may be better understood.
   2. Here, haematological dynamics in natural populations of field voles are investigated to determine environmental and host factors associated with indicators of inflammatory response (counts of monocytes and neutrophils) and of condition: measures of immunological investment (lymphocyte counts) and aerobic capacity (red blood cell counts).
   3. Individuals from three field vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. Comparisons with individuals kept under controlled conditions facilitated interpretation of field data. Mixed effects models were developed for each cell type to evaluate separately the effects of various factors on post-juvenile voles and mature breeding females.
   4. There were three well-characterized 'physiological' seasons. The immunological investment appeared lowest in winter (lowest lymphocyte counts), but red blood cells were at their highest levels and indices of inflammatory response at their lowest. Spring was characterized by a fall in red blood cell counts and peaks in indicators of inflammatory response. During the course of summer-autumn, red blood cell counts recovered, the immunological investment increased and the indicators of inflammatory response decreased.
   5. Poor body condition appeared to affect the inflammatory response (lower neutrophil and monocyte peaks) and the immunological investment (lower lymphocyte counts), providing evidence that the capacity to fight infection is dependent upon host condition.
   6. Breeding early in the year was most likely in females in better condition (high lymphocyte and red blood cell counts).
   7. All the haematological parameters were affected adversely by high population densities.

AB  - During 1995-2011, annual production of winter-spring cohort of Ommastrephes bartramii for Chinese squidjigging fishery has greatly fluctuated, which is closely related to the environmental conditions on the spawning and fishing grounds. To better understand how squid recruitment and abundance were influenced by ocean environmental conditions, biological and physical environmental variables including sea surface temperature (SST), SST anomaly (SSTA), chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and the Kuroshio Current were examined during years with the highest (1999), intermediate (2005), and lowest (2009) catches. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the squid-jigging vessels was used as an indicator of squid abundance. The results indicated that high SST and Chl a concentration on the spawning ground in 1999 resulted in favorable incubation and feeding conditions for squid recruitment. Whereas the suitable spawning zone (SSZ) in 2009 shifted southward and coincided with low SST and Chl a concentration, resulting in a reduction in the squid recruitment. The small difference of SSZ area in the three years suggested the SSZ provided limited influences on the variability in squid recruitment. Furthermore, high squid abundance in 1999 and 2005 was associated with warm SSTA on the fishing ground. While the cool SSTA on the fishing ground in 2009 contributed to adverse habitat for the squid, leading to extremely low abundance. It was inferred that strengthened intensity of the Kuroshio force generally yielded favorable environmental conditions for O. bartramii. Future research are suggested to focus on the fundamental research on the early life stage of O. bartramii and mechanism of how the ocean-climate variability affects the squid abundance and spatial distribution by coupling physical model with squid biological process to explore transport path and abundance distribution.

AB  - P>1. Meteorological conditions are critical determinants of bird migration. However, response to weather should vary among species as well as between males and females, as phenotypic traits relevant to migration are also shaped by natural selection acting differentially on species and either sex in other life cycle phases.
   2. We studied the covariation between capture frequencies and meteorological conditions at departure and at a stopover site during northward spring migration in 21 species of migratory birds. The stopover site is a small island located at the northern end of a wide ecological barrier (the Mediterranen Sea), that is crossed with non-stop flights by migrants departing from North Africa.
   3. Head and crosswinds at departure, and tail and crosswinds at stopover reduced the number of birds captured, although the strength of these effects varied among species. In the subset of 10 sexually dimorphic species, males and females were not differentially susceptible to weather conditions.
   4. Because sexual and natural selection pressures on traits relevant to migration vary among species, we investigated whether body mass and wing morphology predicted species susceptibility to weather in analyses controlling for phylogenetic effects, using wing loading, wing aspect ratio, the 'brachial index', and wingtip roundedness and convexity as indicators of the morphology of the flight apparatus.
   5. Captures of species whose wing morphology is more typical of long-distance migrants were less affected by tail and crosswinds, suggesting that long-distance migrants are less susceptible to weather.
   6. Meteorological conditions at departure independently concurred with those at stopover in determining capture frequencies. The effect of weather on migration covaried with wing morphological traits that co-evolved with migratory strategies. Changes in meteorological conditions driven by current climate change thus have the potential to differentially affect migration phenology in relation to migratory strategy and morphology of individual species.

AB  - The present study was carried out at ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru to assess biomass accumulation, nutrient distribution, nutrient/water/energy use, plant available soil nutrients and carbon storage in different categories of roses in open-grown and protected systems. In open-grown roses, biomass of leaves, stalk and flowers represented 31.9%, 41.1% and 26.95%, respectively. In protected condition, flower biomass accounted for 17.62% of the total compared to leaf (51.0%), and stalk biomass (31.4%). The carbon stocks in plant biomass and soil accounted for 22% and 78% of total in open-grown rose system. In protected condition, plant and soil carbon stocks accounted for 11% and 89% of the total carbon stocks. Soil carbon stocks increased from 2.214 to 3.958 kg m(-2)during 4-year period in open field. In protected condition, soil carbon stock was increased from 3.315 to 5.104 kg m(-2)registering an increase of 1.789 kg m(-2). In rose production system, leaves registered highest levels of macronutrients while flowers acquired more micronutrients. The water use was 45% higher in protected cultivation (344 L yr(-1)m(-2)) than in open condition (232 L yr(-1)m(-2)). Based on nutrient use indicators and energy use of nutrient inputs, Arka Savi and Arka Swadesh were identified as efficient nutrient use and energy use (74.6% and 37.3%) genotypes in open and protected conditions, respectively. Plant available nutrient stocks in soil were optimum to above optimum in rose system. The results imply that precision nutrient application is most important to save inputs/energy, avoid environmental pollution and to develop sustainable land use system.

AB  - The potential replication of somatic coliphages in the environment has been considered a drawback for their use as viral indicators, although the extent to which this affects their numbers in environmental samples has not been assessed. In this study, the replication of somatic coliphages in various conditions was assayed using suspensions containing naturally occurring somatic coliphages and Escherichia coli WG5, which is a host strain recommended for detecting somatic coliphages. The effects on phage replication of exposing strain WG5 and phages to a range of physiological conditions and the effects of the presence of suspended particles or other bacteria were also assayed. Phage replication was further tested using a strain of Klebsiella terrigena and naturally occurring E. coli cells as hosts. Our results indicate that threshold densities of both host bacterium and phages should occur simultaneously to ensure appreciable phage replication. Host cells originating from a culture in the exponential growth phase and incubation at 37 degreesC were the best conditions for phage replication in E. coli WG5. In these conditions the threshold densities required to ensure phage replication were about 10(4) host cells/ml and 10(3) phages/ ml, or 10(3) host cells/ml and 10(4) phages/ml, or intermediate values of both. The threshold densities needed for phage replication were higher when the cells proceeded from a culture in the stationary growth phase or when suspended particles or other bacteria were present. Furthermore E. coli WG5 was more efficient in supporting phage replication than either K. terrigenae or E. coli cells naturally occurring in sewage. Our results indicate that the phage and bacterium densities and the bacterial physiological conditions needed for phage replication are rarely expected to be found in the natural water environments.

AB  - The growth of landscape-scale land management necessitates the development of methods for large-scale vegetation assessment. Field data collection and analysis methods used to assess ecological condition for the 47 165-h North Spring Valley watershed are presented. Vegetation cover data were collected in a stratified random design within 6 Great Basin vegetation types, and the probability of detecting change in native herbaceous cover was calculated using power analyses. Methods for using these quantitative assessment data are presented to calculate a departure index based on reference condition information from LANDFIRE (an interagency effort to map and model fire regimes and other biophysical characteristics at a mid-scale for the entire United States) Biophysical Setting models for the mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) vegetation type. For mountain big sagebrush in the North Spring Valley landscape, we found that the earliest successional classes were underrepresented and that mountain big sagebrush moderately invaded by conifers was more abundant than predicted by the LANDFIRE reference based on the historic range of variability. Classes that were most similar to the reference were mountain big sagebrush with the highest conifer cover and late development mountain big sagebrush with perennial grasses. Overall, results suggested that restoration or approximation of the historic fire regime is needed. This method provides a cost-effective procedure to assess important indicators, including native herbaceous cover, extent of woody encroachment, and ground cover. However, the method lacks the spatial information that would allow managers to comprehensively assess spatial patterns of vegetation condition across the mosaics that occur within each major vegetation type. The development of a method that integrates field measurements of key indicators with remotely sensed data is the next critical need for landscape-scale assessment.

AB  - The effects of agricultural intensification on vertebrate populations could vary depending on whether species are habitat specialists or habitat generalists. Organic farming practices are generally considered to be less intensive and more environmental friendly than conventional farming practices and, as a result, these two managements may impact on habitat specialists and habitat generalists in different ways. The effect of environmental and/or genetic stress on populations can be assessed using fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and body condition of animals. We predicted that populations of a specialist species, the Pampean grassland mouse (Akodon azarae) would have higher levels of FA and poorer body condition on conventional farms compared to populations of A. azarae on organic farms. In contrast, we predicted that populations of generalist species, the corn mouse (Calomys musculinus) and the small vesper mouse (Calomys laucha) would not show differences in FA or body condition between conventional and organic farms. We examined the expression of FA in the hind foot and used the scaled mass index as a surrogate for body condition. As predicted, we found higher FA in the habitat specialist (A. azarae) on conventional farms compared to organic farms, and found no differences in FA among the two generalist species (C. musculinus and C laucha). However, we found no differences in body condition for the three studied species between the two managements. Our results suggest that the effect of farming practices on small mammals varies between habitat specialists and habitat generalists. The results of this study provide important insights for the study of asymmetries, both from biological and methodological perspectives. Our results support the idea that the level of FA may be used as an index to assess the effects of farming practices on vertebrate populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a cost-effective natural wastewater treatment and reuse technology. It is an environmentally friendly technology that does not require chemical usage and is applicable to both developing and developed countries. However, the presence of organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens poses a major health threat to the population exposed to partially treated wastewater or reclaimed water through SAT. Laboratory-based soil column and batch experiments simulating SAT were conducted to examine the influence of temperature variation and oxidation-reduction (redox) conditions on removal of bulk organic matter, nutrients, and indicator microorganisms using primary effluent. While an average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal of 17.7 % was achieved in soil columns at 5 A degrees C, removal at higher temperatures increased by 10 % increments with increase in temperature by 5 A degrees C over the range of 15 to 25 A degrees C. Furthermore, soil column and batch experiments conducted under different redox conditions revealed higher DOC removal in aerobic (oxic) experiments compared to anoxic experiments. Aerobic soil columns exhibited DOC removal 15 % higher than that achieved in the anoxic columns, while aerobic batch showed DOC removal 7.8 % higher than the corresponding anoxic batch experiments. Ammonium-nitrogen removal greater than 99 % was observed at 20 and 25 A degrees C, while 89.7 % was removed at 15 A degrees C, but the removal substantially decreased to 8.8 % at 5 A degrees C. While ammonium-nitrogen was attenuated by 99.9 % in aerobic batch reactors carried out at room temperature, anoxic experiments under similar conditions revealed 12.1 % ammonium-nitrogen reduction, corresponding to increase in nitrate-nitrogen and decrease in sulfate concentration.

AB  - Low-temperature oxidation (LTO) of magnetite is an alteration process which occurs under normal atmospheric conditions, causing maghemitization. The use of magnetic properties as palaeoclimate proxies requires improved understanding of how humidity and temperature affect such processes. We exposed natural magnetite, with grain size ranging from <1 to similar to 30 mu m, to different humidity conditions at room temperature and 70 degrees C for 1 yr. Changes in room temperature setups were very minor, but in all 70 degrees C setups alteration was detected by magnetic and mineralogical properties. Lowering of the Verwey transition temperature (T-v) turned out to be the most sensitive indicator of LTO, and also lattice constants correlate well with the shift of T-v. Thermomagnetic curves and XRD-results indicate that LTO affects the entire volume of the particles rather than only surface layers. The sample exposed to high relative humidity (rH) >90 per cent at 70 degrees C showed the strongest degree of LTO with an increase of the oxidation degree by similar to 3 per cent according to T-v, and it was the only setup where partial alteration to hematite was indicated by Mossbauer analysis. The sample with extremely dry conditions (rH of similar to 5 per cent) at 70 degrees C, and the sample that was exposed to cycles of high and low humidity in 2-weeks alternation at 70 degrees C, both revealed a smaller degree of LTO. The smallest change of the high temperature setups was observed for the sample with intermediate rH of similar to 13 per cent. The results suggest a non-linear sensitivity of magnetite alteration to humidity conditions, high humidity strongly favours alteration, but alteration is strongly reduced when extreme humidity alternates with dry conditions, suggesting an importance of seasonality in natural weathering.

The three-level system of the description of mechanical characteristics of geotechnical system that managing of multiple parameter network of qualifiers of the elements description of computing area is received. Parameters of calculations of contact tasks in difficult structured geomechanical models are qualitatively improved that is provided by increasing in accuracy of the description of geotechnical system elements. Accounting of nonlinear characteristics allows performing optimization of schemes of bolting systems for various mine conditions that based on a computing experiment. The presented studies were carried out on example of conditions of the "Almaznaya" mine, southern conveyor drift, coal seam 11, depth 550m. As a result, preservation of operational characteristics of extraction mine workings of Western Donbas that were drived in complicated mining-and-geological conditions is reached by the choice of optimum parameters of bolting systems that allowing to minimize production expenses. Results that based on the executed computing experiments using the considered procedure allowed to keep operational characteristics of extraction workings with economy of materials and labor costs at the level of 9-17%.

AB  - While many studies have explored how previous and current environmental conditions affect the performance of individual organisms, their relative importance as drivers of current diversity and composition of communities is virtually unknown. We evaluated the response of herbaceous communities to previous (experienced during early establishment) and current environmental conditions by comparing their composition and diversity in an abandoned Mediterranean cropland planted with Quercus ilex subsp. ballota L. seedlings. These seedlings received different experimental treatments (summer irrigation and artificial shading) during the first three years after planting, and were interrupted from then on. We tested two complementary hypotheses: (i) the previous environments experienced by the herbaceous communities during their establishment have a long-term carry-over effect on diversity and composition of species assemblages and (ii) these communities are influenced by their current environment, particularly by the woody layer and the soil conditions. Overall, we observed an important contribution of initial environmental conditions in determining the current diversity and composition of herbaceous communities. Amelioration of environmental conditions, particularly water stress, during community establishment resulted in a decrease in alpha and beta diversity, possibly as a consequence of decreasing environmental heterogeneity. Previous environments accounted for 26.3% of the explained variance in current community composition. Annuals, legumes and forbs also responded significantly to previous environments, which explained 27.9%, 36.2% and 30.1%, respectively, of the variance in their composition. Our results suggest that those species present at a particular site early in succession pre-empt the site and influence vegetation dynamics on that site for a long time. This study provides important insights for understanding the mechanisms underlying the ecological effects of issues like cropland reforestation and woody vegetation encroachment.

AB  - Sediment in rivers is the dominant material source for ecosystems in lower reaches and estuaries, and it is undergoing large variations globally in recent decades. Though we have knowledge that human activities are greatly affecting land surface ecosystem processes and functions, the relationships between sediment transport regime and the intensifying human activities, are still poorly understood. This study was to investigate the changes of sediment transport regime due to the large-scale ecological restoration in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). In this study, we examined the change of the sediment rating curves using daily sediment load and streamfiow data from 30 stations during time periods including pre- and post-ecological restoration in this region. We found the pair-relationship of the rating parameters (coefficient and exponent), denoted as coefficient-exponent pair-line, is a critical indicator that can detect the shift of sediment transport regime due to disturbed land surface conditions, though the changed hydrometeorological condition may just influence the absolute values of the rating parameters. Our analysis indicates there was a significant and interesting change of the sediment transport regime in the MYRB characterized by the consistent shift of the coefficient-exponent pair-line, together with an increasing exponent and a decreasing coefficient.This changed sediment transport regime can tell that sediment delivery would become lower for normal discharge conditions but potentially higher for extreme discharge conditions, and this phenomenon seems more distinct in relatively smaller watersheds, suggesting a higher risk of the potential high sediment delivery for extreme rainfall conditions especially for small watersheds. Our study would be informative and valuable to decision makers for sustainable watershed management in the MYRB when considering the changed sediment delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This brief review focuses on health and biological function as cornerstones of fish welfare. From the function-based point of view, good welfare is reflected in the ability of the animal to cope with infectious and non-infectious stressors, thereby maintaining homeostasis and good health, whereas stressful husbandry conditions and protracted suffering will lead to the loss of the coping ability and, thus, to impaired health. In the first part of the review, the physiological processes through which stressful husbandry conditions modulate health of farmed fish are examined. If fish are subjected to unfavourable husbandry conditions, the resulting disruption of internal homeostasis necessitates energy-demanding physiological adjustments (allostasis/acclimation). The ensuing energy drain leads to trade-offs with other energy-demanding processes such as the functioning of the primary epithelial barriers (gut, skin, gills) and the immune system. Understanding of the relation between husbandry conditions, allostatic responses and fish health provides the basis for the second theme developed in this review, the potential use of biological function and health parameters as operational welfare indicators (OWIs). Advantages of function-and health-related parameters are that they are relatively straightforward to recognize and to measure and are routinely monitored in most aquaculture units, thereby providing feasible tools to assess fish welfare under practical farming conditions. As the efforts to improve fish welfare and environmental sustainability lead to increasingly diverse solutions, in particular integrated production, it is imperative that we have objective OWIs to compare with other production forms, such as high-density aquaculture. However, to receive the necessary acceptance for legislation, more robust scientific backing of the health-and function-related OWIs is urgently needed.

AB  - Atmospheric deposition of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) has decreased steadily in the northeastern U.S. since the federal 1970 Clean Air Act was passed, yet deposition remains elevated above natural background levels throughout the region. Epiphytic macrolichens are highly sensitive to air pollution and their status is a good indicator of ecological health. We used deposition modeling for 2000-2013 and multiple metrics of lichen status (i.e., species composition, species richness, thallus condition, lichen sensitivity indices, lichen elemental analysis) to assess air pollution effects at 24 plots in four federally-mandated Class I areas. The areas (Lye Brook Wilderness, VT; Great Gulf and the Presidential Range-Dry River Wildernesses, NH; and Acadia National Park, ME) encompass a range of high to low deposition sites. We developed thallus condition scores and sensitivity groups and indices for S and N based on species patterns using deposition estimates gleaned from a larger, independent data base. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations differentiated forest structure effects on lichen community composition from more complex deposition and elevation effects. Annual mean and cumulative deposition of N correlated strongly with decreases in lichen species richness and N-sensitive species, and poorer thallus condition. Cumulative dry deposition of S yielded the best fit to decreases in thallus condition, poorer community-based S Index values, and absence of many S-sensitive species. Multiple metrics provided consistent evidence that higher depositional loading was associated with greater adverse effects. In general, stronger correlations between present day lichen metrics and cumulative deposition (post-2000), compared to current deposition, emphasize the long-term nature of emissions impacts and continued need to control S and N emissions to restore the ecological health of lichen communities and linked biota.

AB  - As the largest inland river basin of China, the Tarim River Basin (TRB), known for its various natural resources and fragile environment, has an increased risk of ecological crisis due to the intensive exploitation and utilization of water and land resources. Since the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP), which was implemented in 2001 to save endangered desert vegetation, there has been growing evidence of ecological improvement in local regions, but few studies have performed a comprehensive ecological vulnerability assessment of the whole TRB. This study established an evaluation framework integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy method to estimate the ecological vulnerability of the TRB covering climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic indicators during 2000-2017. Based on the geographical detector model, the importance of ten driving factors on the spatial-temporal variations of ecological vulnerability was explored. The results showed that the ecosystem of the TRB was fragile, with more than half of the area (57.27%) dominated by very heavy and heavy grades of ecological vulnerability, and 28.40% of the area had potential and light grades of ecological vulnerability. The light grade of ecological vulnerability was distributed in the northern regions (Aksu River and Weigan River catchments) and western regions (Kashgar River and Yarkant River catchments), while the heavy grade was located in the southern regions (Kunlun Mountains and Qarqan River catchments) and the Mainstream catchment. The ecosystems in the western and northern regions were less vulnerable than those in the southern and eastern regions. From 2000 to 2017, the overall improvement in ecological vulnerability in the whole TRB showed that the areas with great ecological improvement increased by 46.11%, while the areas with ecological degradation decreased by 9.64%. The vegetation cover and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were the obvious driving factors, explaining 57.56% and 21.55% of the changes in ecological vulnerability across the TRB, respectively. In terms of ecological vulnerability grade changes, obvious spatial differences were observed in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the TRB due to the different vegetation and hydrothermal conditions. The alpine source region of the TRB showed obvious ecological improvement due to increased precipitation and temperature, but the alpine meadow of the Kaidu River catchment in the Middle Tianshan Mountains experienced degradation associated with overgrazing and local drought. The improved agricultural management technologies had positive effects on farmland ecological improvement, while the desert vegetation in oasis-desert ecotones showed a decreasing trend as a result of cropland reclamation and intensive drought. The desert riparian vegetation in the lower reaches of the Tarim River was greatly improved due to the implementation of the EWDP, which has been active for tens of years. These results provide comprehensive knowledge about ecological processes and mechanisms in the whole TRB and help to develop environmental restoration measures based on different ecological vulnerability grades in each sub-catchment.

AB  - With the participation of about 65% in the total growing stock of conifers, silver fir is the most important and the best represented conifer species in Croatia. The increasing share of sanitary felling in the annual felling plans demands that special attention be paid to the health status of fir forests and the quantity of unplanned felling. This is the reason why dieback of silver fir in beech-fir forests in the Dinaric Alps is an acute and topical management-ecological problem. In the past 10 years, the share of total unplanned felling in the overall annual felling for fir has amounted to 57%. Such a high share of unplanned yield (mainly snags) has had a negative effect on sustainable forest management. Determining the spatial distribution of damaged trees and snags, as well as their monitoring is one of the priorities of sustainable management. Hence, it is of utmost importance to detect less healthy stands and apply timely measures for the purpose of maintaining their vitality and productivity at an optimal level. Due to the seriously disturbed stand stability caused by forced canopy opening, which in turn affects the health condition and natural regeneration of the stand, it is necessary not only to detect snags but also determine the causes of dieback. According to the results of past research, increased tree dieback is associated with the impact of different site and stand characteristics (altitude, exposition, slope, soil, structure, etc.), as well as abiotic and biotic factors (fir needle moth, mistletoe); however, the real causes are yet to be discovered. It is difficult to make efficient snag inventories with standard field methods. For large areas, a remote sensing method (the application of CIR aerial photographs) is much more practical, more cost effective and more reliable. All research activities so far have proved that, in terms of accuracy, this method is equal to field working methods, while in terms of speed and objectivity it is far more efficient. Snag inventories by means of CIR aerial photography interpretation and GIS enable efficient enumeration (detection) and spatial distribution (mapping) of snags. The proposed method is highly important not only for the detection and monitoring of the occurrence, distribution and direction of dieback progress, but also for the detection of possible dieback causes, on the basis of which experts will prescribe adequate measures and treatments. The objective of CIR aerial photography interpretation is to determine the current situation and acquire an objective picture of forest condition (database) in as short a period as possible, while mapping on a color infrared digital orthophoto (DOP) is intended to provide the spatial distribution of snags for the surveyed area. An aerial survey of the Lika area with the CIR film (Forest Administration Gospic) was conducted in strips (Fig. 3). The coordinates of the start and finish points of aerial photogrammetric series in the associated zones of the Gauss-Kruger cartographic projection, as well as planned strip lengths, are given in the following survey (Table 1). A total of 88 aerial photographs were taken at an average scale of 1:6000 and longitudinal overlap of 60%, which allows for the interpretation of individual trees in the stereomodel. As the total length of all the three strips amounted to 40,243 m (40.24 km), an area of 5,548 ha was surveyed.
   Since aerial photography provided an insight into the condition of the stands in the investigated area, and since the results obtained by photointerpretation of CIR aerial photograph indicated acute fir damage (the average damaged tree is 61.70%), snag inventory (mapping) was undertaken. In the localities of fir forests, dieback was observed in the form of smaller or bigger groups of trees. Hence, areas of 1 ha (sample plots) were delineated on a random sample in the color infrared DOP (1:5000). All visible snags were then mapped in each area (Fig. 1). The central parts of the images were used to construct a DOP. The pixel size of each orthophoto is 0.5 m. According to the spatial snag distribution, the number of snags (density) per strip ranged between 23 and 105 per ha (Fig. 2). Since the values were not similar for all the plots, all the identified snags were mapped in the color infrared DOP. A total of 17,445 snags were mapped in the study area (Fig. 4). GIS was used to produce a cartographic presentation of spatial snag distribution along the survey strips. In order to produce a digital orthophoto, it was necessary to construct a digital relief model. Data for the DRsM were obtained by vectorizing the contour lines from the associated sheets of the Basic Map of Croatia (BMC) of 1:5000 scale and topographic maps (TM25) at a scale of 1:25000. Since individual tree mortality is a stochastic, rare and irregular event (Eid and Tuhus 2001) and since this is a karst terrain, slope variability in the study area is very high; therefore, it is not advisable to take into account the average slope in an area. As the same was also confirmed by the research of Antonic and Legovic (1999), Pernar (1997), and Bozic et al. (2004), the layers were generated from the DRIVE. Raster-GIS modeling provided the layers of slope and exposition. In this way, the values of altitude (Fig. 5), slope (Fig. 6) and exposition (Fig. 7) obtained by means of the DRM were assigned to every snag, in dependence of the location (position in space). An orthophoto and a digital relief model (DRIVE) were also entered into GIS as one of the layers, which enabled rapid spatial analysis and an efficient access to data (Fig. 8). Next, the obtained results were statistically analyzed and the data of spatial snag distribution and geomorphological features were processed. The most important result ensuing from the presented method of rapid snag inventory is the thematic maps, which present spatial snag distribution for the investigated area. Not only is field work very expensive and long-lasting (Boyle et al., 1998), but it is also extremely difficult in barely accessible terrains or on steep slopes. A method based on remote sensing (aerial or satellite images) considerably contributes to the solution of the afore mentioned problems and provides a more practical, less expensive and more reliable manner of enumerating dry trees and stands over large areas. In combination with GIS technology, the production of a map of spatial snag distribution takes 5-10 minutes per hectare of the inventoried area. Such maps provide an insight into the field condition and spatial snag distribution in a very short time. They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude).
   Variance nalysis (F=278.79; p<0.001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since the participation of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F=102.6; p<0.001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i.e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields.

AB  - Purpose Electrical capacitance (EC) is widely used to measure root traits especially in hydroponic and wet soil environments, but its feasibility was recently questioned due to the possible leakage of electrical current before entering the root system. To investigate whether the current can travel deeper in woody roots, EC was evaluated in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown under different soil moisture conditions (two rounds of pot experiments, one PVC tube experiment and one field experiment). Methods In these experiments, electrical capacitance of the root (ECroot) was recorded before and after severing roots, and immediately afterward, the roots were collected to measure root dry weight, surface area, length, and volume. Results The results showed that ECroot was significantly reduced after root cutting especially under dry conditions in the three experiments. The PVC tube experiment further demonstrated that root cutting did not significantly affect the changes in ECroot measured at different soil layers under dry conditions possibly suggesting that the current could flow into the deep roots under these conditions. Moreover, incorporating root tissue density and soil moisture into the prediction model can improve the predictive accuracy of ECroot. In contrast, ECroot was less affected by root cutting under wet soil conditions, indicating that it may not directly measure roots under these conditions. Conclusions ECroot shows the potential to directly quantify root traits under dry conditions rather than wet conditions.

AB  - A third of South Africa's freshwater flow no longer reaches the coast, yet few systems have shifted from being permanently open to temporarily closed. For the first time since 1969, the Gamtoos Estuary mouth closed in June 2018, because of extensive drought conditions and freshwater abstraction. Accordingly, physico-chemical gradients, microalgal biomass and species composition were sampled during low (closed mouth), normal (open mouth) and high (breaching event) flow conditions. The closed phase was characterised by polyhaline and homogenous salinity structures and a rapid shift towards eutrophic conditions, as evidenced by bottom water hypoxia (<2 mg l(-1)), elevated phytoplankton (>20 mu g l(-1)) and microphytobenthos (>100 mg m(-2)) biomass, and proliferation of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (Prorocentrum cordatum, Dinophyceae). An artificial breaching event in September 2018 restored connectivity with the marine environment and within a month re-established the usual physico-chemical gradients that characterise the open phase. Although the current study demonstrates ecosystem recovery from stochastic events, it also highlights the potential impact (e.g. HABs, hypoxia) of shifting an estuary into a new stable state. This is a concern given that mouth closure events in South African estuaries are likely to increase in the future in response to global change pressures.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive establishes the need to define stream type-specific reference conditions to identify "high ecological status". Methods for selecting reference sites using a priori criteria have been proposed by many authors. A review of these criteria revealed that the most relevant criteria for streams and rivers were those related to riparian vegetation, diffuse and point sources of pollution, river morphology and hydrological conditions and regulation. In this work, we propose 20 criteria that reflect the characteristics of Mediterranean streams and their most frequent disturbances for the selection of reference sites in Mediterranean streams in Spain. We studied 162 sites located in 33 Mediterranean basins belonging to five stream types. Of the locations, 57% were selected as a priori reference sites by having applied the proposed criteria. Reference sites were identified for all stream types except for "large watercourses" which includes the lower reaches of some rivers in this study area. This a priori selection of reference sites was subjected to validation using the macroinvertebrate community by applying of an IBMWP threshold, which is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed sites in Mediterranean streams. This approach determined that whole of this selection (100%) could be considered valid reference sites. Furthermore, we identified differences in the reference conditions for each stream type on the basis of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a North American grass that is being improved through conventional breeding and genetic engineering to create a biofuel feedstock. However, the introduction of novel traits has created concerns about pollen-mediated gene flow and negative environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to model switchgrass pollen dispersal using a Lagrangian approach informed by data on pollen longevity and size. With outdoor exposure, the viability of pollen from three cultivars declined over 60 min, but rare events showed pollen longevity of up to 100 min. To model pollen dispersal, wind fields were measured in two locations and on two dates to create case studies representing light wind conditions with buoyant turbulence or stronger winds with pressure-driven, nonturbulent conditions. In the first case study, switchgrass pollen entrained in light wind conditions with buoyancy-driven turbulence moved up to approximately 3.5 km from the source with a maximum flight time of 6000 s. In the second case study, pollen released in stronger winds with pressure-driven conditions moved up to approximately 6.5 km with a maximum flight time of approximately 1300 s. In both cases, the majority of pollen grains were deposited closer to the source. These case studies provide information helpful for predicting pollen-mediated transgene flow, isolating field trials, creating containment and coexistence strategies, and conserving valued switchgrass populations in coastal areas and prairies.

AB  - Stream and riparian managers must effectively allocate limited financial and personnel resources to monitor and manage riparian ecosystems. They need to use management strategies and monitoring methods that are compatible with their objectives and the response potential of each stream reach. Our objective is to help others set realistic management objectives by comparing results from different methods used to document riparian recovery across a diversity of stream types. The Bureau of Land Management Elko Field Office, Nevada, used stream survey, riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment, repeat photographic analysis, and stream and ecological classification to study 10 streams within the Marys River watershed of northeast Nevada during all or parts of 20 years. Most riparian areas improved significantly from 1979 to 1992-1993 and then additionally by 1997-2000. Improvements were observed in riparian and habitat condition indices, bank cover, and stability, pool quality, bank angle, and depth of undercut bank. Interpretation of repeat photography generally confirmed results from stream survey and should be part of long-term riparian monitoring. More attributes of Rosgen stream types C and E improved than of types B and F. A and Gc streams did not show significant improvement. Alluvial draws and alluvial valleys improved in more ways than V-erosional canyons and especially V-depositional canyons. Stream survey data could not be substituted for riparian PFC assessment. Riparian PFC assessments help interpret other data.

AB  - Mineral deposits on the martian surface can elucidate ancient environmental conditions on the planet. Opaline silica deposits ( as much as 91 weight percent SiO2) have been found in association with volcanic materials by the Mars rover Spirit. The deposits are present both as light- toned soils and as bedrock. We interpret these materials to have formed under hydrothermal conditions and therefore to be strong indicators of a former aqueous environment. This discovery is important for understanding the past habitability of Mars because hydrothermal environments on Earth support thriving microbial ecosystems.

AB  - The influence of light and habitat structure on the predation of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae by the common heteropteran water bug, Diplonychus (= Sphaerodema) annulatus, D. rusticus and Anisops bouvieri was assessed in the laboratory. It was revealed that water bugs predate more in presence of light than in dark conditions. While A. bouvieri consumed more prey in structured conditions, D. annulatus and D. rusticus consumed more prey in open conditions. The selection of prey size as well as the respective numbers varied between predators and treatments significantly. Prey vulnerability (PV), air indicator of predatory efficiency, was highest for D. annulatus, moderate for D. rusticus and low for A. bouvieri. Prey consumption and PV values under different treatment conditions indicate that for belostomatid water bugs D. annulatus and D. rusticus, the order of prey consumption under different habitat and light/dark combinations is light open > dark open > light vegetated > dark vegetated. In the case of the backswimmer, A. bouvieri, the order of prey consumption appeared to be light structured > dark structured > light open > dark open. These findings were consistent with resource-partitioning by water bug species sharing the same guild. If the observed results are extended to natural settings the efficiency of these predators in controlling mosquito populations will vary with the structural complexity of habitats and the intensity of light.

AB  - Understanding habitat quality for birds is crucial for ecologists and managers, but few papers have explored the advantages and disadvantages of different ways to measure it. In this review I clarify terminology and distinguish habitat quality from related terms, differentiate habitat quality at the levels of individual birds and populations, and describe different field methods for measuring habitat quality. As much as feasible, biologists concerned with habitat quality should emphasize demographic variables while recognizing that reproduction, survival, and abundance may not all be positively correlated. The distribution of birds can also reveal habitat quality (e.g., through patterns of habitat selection), but researchers should first investigate how closely their subjects follow ideal distributions because numerous ecological factors can lead birds to select poor and avoid rich habitats. Measures of body condition can provide convenient measures of habitat quality, but to be useful they must be a consequence, rather than a cause, of habitat selection. Habitat ecologists should use caution before relying on shortcuts from more labor-intensive demographic work. To increase the reliability of our habitat quality measurements, we should work to develop new methods to assess critical assumptions of nondemographic indicators, such as whether birds follow ideal distributions under natural conditions and whether spatial variation in body condition manifests in differential fitness.

AB  - C. sativa is a valuable oilseed; it has a wide nutritional and technical use. The purpose of this study is a comprehensive study of C. sativa collection accessions in various ecological and geographical conditions to determine the environmental stability parameters. C. sativa All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) collection accessions served as a material source for the study. The study was conducted in four different ecological and geographical regions of the Russian Federation. In the factor structure of the environmental parameters variability two factors are identified covering 94.8% of the variability. The first factor is associated with the precipitation sum (PS) and the temperatures sum (TS) for the vegetation period (68.7%), the second factor is associated with the average daily temperature (TM) for the same period (26.1%). Analysis of the system of correlations between the parameters of stability and plasticity and the value of regression coefficients for meteorological indicators showed that for all the studied features, indicator b closely correlates with regression coefficients for the temperatures sum (TS) and average daily temperature (TM) for the vegetation period. Indicator S-d-with coefficients for the precipitation sum (PS) and average daily precipitation (PM). The result of the study made it possible to identify collection accessions of C. sativa with a high stable adaptability to the contrasting climatic conditions of the studied regions.

AB  - Estuaries are defined by change; both on a diurnal basis, balancing tidal inflow with riverine outflow, and over hundreds or thousands of years through geomorphic evolution and sea level variability. However, contemporary management and protection underpinned by international agreements, such as the Ramsar Convention, presume that wetlands change within only limited ranges based on their contemporary conditions. Adaptive management strategies for cyclic or even directional change are more robust if underpinned by evidence from longer-term records, such as those obtained from palaeoecological records preserved in sediment cores. Such is the case for the Coorong lagoon in southern Australia; here analysis of assemblage changes of key invertebrates and algae preserved in the sediments reveals the variability of natural conditions well before the instrumental record. During the mid-Holocene to late Holocene and up until the mid-twentieth century, assemblage changes in microfauna and flora indicate variable salinity and water clarity associated with both fresh continental and marine water inputs. By contrast, in the south lagoon, the proxies indicate periodically enhanced salinity. The most significant changes in ecology and sedimentation are apparent after the 1950s; hydrological modifications have changed the influence of both continental and tidal water, producing conditions that are unusual in the long-term history of the site.

AB  - Recently it has been show that in some ecosystems fast rates of change of environmental drivers may trigger a critical transition, whereas change of the same magnitude but at slower rates would not. So far, few studies describe this phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, while it is important to understand this phenomenon in the light of the ongoing rapid environmental change. Here, we demonstrate rate-induced tipping in a simple model of cyanobacteria with realistic parameter settings. We explain graphically that there is a range of initial conditions at which a gradual increase in environmental conditions can cause a collapse of the population, but only if the change is fast enough. In addition, we show that a pulse in the environmental conditions can cause a temporary collapse, but that is dependent on both the rate and the duration of the pulse. Furthermore, we study whether the autocorrelation of stochastic environmental conditions can influence the probability of inducing rate-tipping. As both the rate of environmental change, and autocorrelation of the environmental variability are increasing in parts of the climate, the probability for rate-induced tipping to occur is likely to increase. Our results imply that, even though the identification of rate sensitive ecosystems in the real world will be challenging, we should incorporate critical rates of change in our ecosystem assessments and management.

AB  - Arid regions lack models predicting shifts in biological and environmental conditions, thus precluding the implementation of efficient water policies. The aim of this study was to evaluate how macroinvertebrate communities respond to habitat and chemical conditions in arid-land streams of North Eastern Algeria, and how these communities are affected by human activities. We used Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to classify the sites of the Belezma National Park according to environmental conditions (including habitat and chemical variables), thus generating a template against which biotic conditions could be matched. The macroinvertebrate inventory included 93 taxa covering over 4 phyla, 8 classes, 22 orders and 58 families. Overall, coarse substrates were the most taxon-rich habitats (48 taxa). Wadi Chaaba, located in the integral zone of the park, hosted the most diversified fauna (40 taxa). The SOM delineated 3 clusters of stations (A, B and C), which combined environmental characteristics (altitude, flow velocity, physicochemical descriptors of water, type and substrate surfaces, human pressure) and characteristic benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The distribution patterns of the benthic macroinvertebrates were examined with reference to their pollution-sensitive or pollution-resistant status, and to the associated environmental variables. Wadi Chaaba, which is located in the protected area of the Park, was the healthiest stream, in that it hosted the most pollution-sensitive, indicator species.

AB  - The development of effective monitoring tools depends on finding sensitive metrics that are capable of detecting the most important environmental impacts at a given region. We assessed if metrics derived from stream fish assemblages reflect physical habitat degradation and changes in land cover. We sampled the ichthyofauna and environmental characteristics of 16 stream sites of first and second order in the Upper Tocantins River basin. The streams were classified according to their environmental characteristics into reference (n = 5), intermediate (n = 4), and impacted (n = 7). A total of 4,079 individuals in five orders, 12 families, and 30 species were collected. Of the 20 metrics tested, eight were non-collinear and were tested for their performance in discriminating among groups of streams. Three metrics were sensitive to the gradient of degradation: Berger-Parker dominance index, percentage of characiform fish, and percentage of rheophilic individuals. Some commonly used metrics did not reflect the disturbances and many others were redundant with those that did. These results indicate that the metrics derived from fish assemblages may be informative for identifying the conservation status of streams, with the potential to be used in biomonitoring.

AB  - The present paper examines dental diseases and linear enamel hypoplasia among the Garamantes, a Late Holocene Saharan population, and aims to draw conclusions about nutrition and adaptation to a hyper-arid environment. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Garamantian diet included animal protein and local, Mediterranean and Near Eastern plants. Moreoever, although the Garamantes had developed urban centres, the size of these was not large enough to allow for particularly unhygienic conditions to appear. The above archaeological findings were partly corroborated by the current bioarchaeological study. At an intra-population level, the Garamantes showed limited sex differences in dental disease prevalence, while all dental conditions increased in frequency with age, as expected. At an inter-population level, the frequency of all dental conditions was comparable to that found among other North African groups, with the exception of ante-mortem tooth loss. The low frequency of most dental conditions is an indication that the Garamantian diet was overall balanced, while the high frequency of ante-mortem tooth loss may be related to factors such as oral hygiene, food preparation or eating mode, which cannot be controlled for osteologically. Finally, the low frequency of enamel hypoplasia suggests either that the Sahara did not inflict particular stresses on the population, or, more likely, that the Garamantes had developed effective mechanisms for coping with their natural environment.

AB  - One of the world's largest, but low-grade, sulfide nickel deposits in northeastern Finland has been exploited by a bioheapleaching technology since 2008. Bioheapleaching is a relatively new, cost-effective technology, but humid climate, e.g., in boreal temperate environments, causes challenges to the management of the water balance in the ore heaps with wide catchment area, and the mining effluents have caused substantial metal and salting contamination of the receiving waterbodies. In our study, the impacts of metal-extracting bioheapleaching mine effluents on muscle and liver element concentrations, body condition, liver and testes mass, and sperm count and motility of male perchPerca fluviatiliswere analysed. Liver, testes, and carcass mass of perch in relation to their length were lower in the mining-impacted lakes than in the reference lake, which may be due to the metal contamination, food availability, and energy demand under multistressor conditions. The sperm counts of the males in the mining-impacted lakes were lower, but the endurance of their sperm motility was longer than the endurance of sperm of the reference males. These findings suggested that the condition and sperm characteristics of perch were altered in lakes receiving metal mining effluents. Measured variables seem to be useful indicators for metal mining impacts on freshwater fish but only if high natural variation in these characteristics can be controlled by multiyear monitoring scheme.

AB  - The present study investigated altitudinal variation in sexual size dimorphism of a Tibetan frog Nanorana parkeri. Size dimorphism was female-biased in all populations, although this bias became less at higher altitudes because of a steeper altitudinal decrease in female size than male size. Operational sex ratios, an indicator of the opportunity for sexual selection on larger males, changed independently of altitude. Clutch volume, an indicator of the strength of fecundity selection on larger females, was positively with female size, and tended to decrease approaching high altitudes. Females lived longer and grew more slowly than males, and the mean age in both sexes increased and growth rate decreased altitudinally, although the changes were more rapid in females than males. These results suggest that, relative to males, females (i.e. the sex that typically bears greater reproductive costs and experiences stronger directional selection for larger size to take fecundity advantages) should be more sensitive to environments, attaining a larger size via enhancing growth under favourable lower-latitude conditions but a smaller size as a result of retarding growth when conditions become harsher at higher altitudes. This supports the condition-dependence hypothesis with respect to intraspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism.

AB  - In order to evaluate the heavy metal pollution in the Tiber River and its environmental impact on the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea), eight heavy metals (As, Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were determined in the water dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter and sediment samples collected from 21 sites in different seasons. Total heavy metal concentrations ranged from 34.88 to 4201.23 mu g L-1 in water (as the sum of the water dissolved phase and suspended particulate matter) and from 42.81 to 1686.84 mg kg(-1) in sediment samples. The total selected heavy metal load contribution into the sea is calculated in about 21,257.85 kg year(-1), showing that this River should account as one of the main contribution sources of heavy metals in the Mediterranean Sea. In relation to the ecological assessment, the Tiber River and Estuary would be considered as an area in which the ecological integrity is possibly at risk.

AB  - This article examines watershed cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM) in the Athabasca watershed, Alberta, Canada. Using a focus group and semi-structured interviews with 30 key informants from government, industry, NGOs, and First Nations, watershed CEAM was examined based on eight requisites to support CEAM: the presence of a lead agency; enabling legislation; financial and human resources; data management and coordination; multi-scaled monitoring; CEAM baselines, indicators, and thresholds; mult-istakeholder collaboration; and vertical and horizontal linkages. Results show that while there was broad agreement amongst participants concerning the necessity for these requisites, there was also considerable uncertainty respecting these requisite performances in this watershed. Several contributing factors may help explain this uncertainty. Participants noted a lack of willingness to share data to support CEAM, especially spatial data, as well as a lack of confidence in the integrity of water monitoring data. An absence of coordination and leadership for watershed CEAM has contributed to financial, human, and technical capacity limitations as well as power asymmetries respecting multi-stakeholder engagement. Our results suggest that notwithstanding investment in cumulative effects science and monitoring in the Athabasca, advancing watershed CEAM requires much greater attention to the institutional requisites to implement and sustain CEAM programs.

AB  - In this study, vibration based non-destructive testing (NDT) technique is adopted for assessing the condition of in-service timber pole. Timber is a natural material, and hence the captured broadband signal (induced from impact using modal hammer) is greatly affected by the uncertainty on wood properties, structure, and environment. Therefore, advanced signal processing technique is essential in order to extract features associated with the health condition of timber poles. In this study, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) are implemented to conduct time-frequency analysis on the acquired signal related to three in-service poles and three unserviceable poles. Firstly, mother wavelet is selected for WPT using maximum energy to Shannon entropy ratio. Then, the raw signal is divided into different frequency bands using WPT, followed by reconstructing the signal using wavelet coefficients in the dominant frequency bands. The reconstructed signal is then further decomposed into mono-component signals by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), known as Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF). Dominant IMFs are selected using correlation coefficient method and instantaneous frequencies of those dominant IMFs are generated using HHT. Finally, the anomalies in the instantaneous frequency plots are efficiently utilised to determine vital features related to pole condition. The results of the study showed that HHT with WPT as pre-processor has a great potential for the condition assessment of utility timber poles.

AB  - Sexual cues, including extended phenotypes, are expected to be reliable indicators of male genetic quality and/or provide information on parental quality. However, the reliability of these cues may be dependent on stability of the environment, with heterogeneity affecting how selection acts on such traits. Here, we test how environmental change mediates mate choice for multiple sexual traits, including an extended phenotype--the structure of male-built nests - in stickleback fish. First, we manipulated the dissolved oxygen (DO) content of water to create high or low DO environments in which male fish built nests. Then we recorded the mate choice of females encountering these males (and their nests), under either the same or reversed DO conditions. Males in high DO environments built more compact nests than those in low DO conditions and males adjusted their nest structure in response to changing conditions. Female mate choice for extended phenotype (male nests) was environmentally dependent (females chose more compact nests in high DO conditions), while female choice for male phenotype was not (females chose large, vigorous males regardless of DO level). Examining mate choice in this dynamic context suggests that females evaluate the reliability of multiple sexual cues, taking into account environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Irish and UK uplands and peatlands are of international importance but are under threat from several factors, including heavy grazing pressure. Sheep preferentially graze patches of acid grassland with short dense swards, sometimes referred to as 'grazing lawns', and have been implicated in damage to uplands. The aim of this study was to increase our understanding of resource selection by grazers to further inform the design and implementation of conservation strategies. Grazing lawn frequency and habitat condition were mapped and GPS collars were used to track Scottish Blackface sheep on a hill farm in Ireland. Weighted compositional analysis (multivariate analysis of variance) was used to test for random use of different categories of grazing lawn frequency and habitat condition. Grazing lawn frequency was spatially uneven and habitat condition ranged from undamaged to very severely damaged areas. Typically, selection of differing categories of habitat condition was not significant (P>0.05), although the highest selection rank was consistently for the 'moderate-undamaged' category. Sheep most selected 1 ha grid squares containing numerous/extensive grazing lawns (P<0.05) day, night and year-round. As a simple, efficient indicator of hill use by sheep, which would be a valuable input in models predicting grazing impact on hill vegetation, the mapping of grazing lawn frequency is suggested.

AB  - The issue of sustainable development is critical in globalization, the rapid growth of the industry, technological progress, and climate change. Sustainable development is the realization of economic, social, and environmental goals. It requires all actors of socioeconomic life, including enterprises, organizations, institutions, and countries. Sustainable development of an enterprise means improving the financial and property situation while taking care of employees and local communities' health and development and taking action to protect the natural environment. This paper aims to assess the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the sustainable development of transport enterprises in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) in the period from 2008 to 2018. The selection of transport enterprises for the research sample is related to their high impact on economies in the analyzed countries, their significant negative impact on the natural environment. Moreover, transport enterprises play a vital role in the development of other economic sectors. The authors discuss the fundamental theoretical issues related to enterprises' sustainable development and the research result conducted in CEECs. The study results indicate a statistically significant relationship between the indicator of sustainable development and the hand of the macroeconomic condition in all analyzed countries. The highest correlation was observed in Romania, Hungary, and Slovenia, while the lowest in Croatia. The story of socio-economic development in surveyed countries plays a fundamental role in achieving sustainable development of transport enterprises.

AB  - Aim: Establishment of anthropogenic aerosols change dynamics in the atmosphere of Tbilisi city, their distribution, concentration, under complex orographic and climate conditions.
   Methodology: For the assessment of climate change for Tbilisi city, air pollution monitoring materials were used from the National Environmental Agency where observation was carried out for the background air pollution and also concentrations of aerosols and harmful substances were measured in automatic mode. The results of four stages of indicatorwere presented. Statistical, climatic and graphical analysis were used for research.
   Results: The basic pollutants: (carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, PM2.5 and PM10 (monthly and annual concentrations) in most cases, exceeded MPC. Nitrogen oxides and ground ozone were particularly sensitive, average annual concentrations was 1.4-1.8 times and exceeded the MPC, which affected the health of the population. It is noteworthy, that for last 5 years in Tbilisi, average annual concentration of lead decreased. Climate change expression often have a complex character, which especially complicates the determination of causal relationship between them and requires right approach and proper definition of adaptation measure.
   Interpretation: Meteorological elements play an important role in aerosol's accumulation in the atmosphere. There was a correlation between meteorological elements and atmosphere polluting ingredients. Pollutants concentration on the surface layer frequently exceeded MPC, i.e., promoted by physical-geographic state and meteo-climate conditions due to which urban microclimate change is possible.

AB  - Environmental factors affecting trophic conditions act as stressors on nestling altricial birds. Access of parental birds to a sufficient supply of food in a limited period of the nestling stage differ in time and space, depending on nesting habitat, prey density and weather conditions. Heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H/L) is considered as a reliable indicator of prolonged stress reaction in birds. In this study we examine if variation in H/L shows consistent spatio-temporal patterns in nestlings of two parids, blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus and great tit Parus major. We found that blue tit nestlings had on average higher H/L than great tit nestlings, which corresponds with the ecological sensitivity of these species. In both species H/L was higher in a poor parkland habitat than in a high quality forest habitat. In nestling blue tits, higher H/L values occurred in years characterized by more extreme weather conditions and worse caterpillar availability. Such consistent patterns of variation in the H/L ratio of nestling blue tits and great tits suggest that, when age-dependent effects are controlled, the ratio can be used as an indicator of physiological stress that is generated by food-related stressors differing in space and time. In particular, elevated H/L ratios are indicative of human-induced changes in the structure of breeding habitats.

AB  - Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy detects the presence of radicals of biological interest, such as ascorbyl radical (K) and lipid radicals. A is easily detectable by EPR even in aqueous solution at room-temperature. Under oxidative conditions leading to changes in total ascorbate (AH(-)) content, the A'/AH(-) ratio could be used to estimate early oxidative stress in the hydrophilic milieu. This methodology was applied to a wide range of aquatic systems including algae, sea urchin, limpets, bivalves and fish, under physiological and oxidative stress conditions as well. The A'/AH(-) ratio reflected the state of one part of the oxidative defense system and provided an early and simple diagnosis of environmental stressing conditions. Oxidative damage to lipids was assessed by the EPR-sensitive adduct formation that correlates well with cell membrane damage with no interference from other biological compounds. Probe instability, tissue metabolism, and lack of spin specificity are drawback factors for employing EPR for in vivo determination of free radicals. However, the dependability of this technique, mostly by combining it with other biochemical strategies, enhances the value of these procedures as contributors to the knowledge of oxidative condition in aquatic organisms.

AB  - Redox-sensitive trace metal concentration patterns have been widely used to track redox conditions in aquatic environments. Among redox-sensitive trace metals, molybdenum (Mo) is of interest owing to its speciation behavior and associated changes in particle reactivity that cause significant changes in concentration patterns in oxic versus sulfidic conditions. However, current understanding of how to use Mo geochemistry of marine sediments as a paleoredox proxy is limited to determining presence or absence of, and in some cases the aerial extent of, sulfidic conditions in the past. Here, we present a combination work of field sampling analysis and experiments to link concentration patterns of another redox-sensitive trace metal, tungsten (W), to Mo in order to provide a framework for using these trace metals to track changes in sulfidic conditions in ancient aquatic environments. We analyzed W and Mo concentrations in the water column and sediment pore waters of the Chesapeake Bay. We found that dissolved Mo/W molar ratios varied under different redox conditions. Because concentrations of these trace metals are controlled by their speciation in solution, we defined three sulfidic zones based on W and Mo speciation and their impacts on particle reactivity: the weakly sulfidic zone (0.2 mu M < [H2S] < similar to 15 mu M); the moderately sulfidic zone (similar to 15 mu M < [H2S] < -600 uM); and the strongly sulfidic zone ([H 2 S] > similar to 600 mu M). In all sulfidic zones, dissolved W concentrations were positively correlated with dissolved Mn concentrations. In contrast, the dissolved Mo concentrations were negatively correlated with dissolved Mn concentrations. As a result, Mo/W molar ratios were negatively correlated with dissolved sulfide concentrations in the weakly, moderately, and strongly sulfidic zones. Our sorption experiment results indicate that the negative correlation between Mo/W molar ratios and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the oxic zone is likely due to the stronger adsorption of WO42- onto Mn oxide surfaces compared with that of WO42-. In comparison, the negative correlation between Mo/W ratios and sulfide concentrations in sulfidic waters is attributed to the differences in thiolation processes of W and Mo, with Mo exhibiting a higher degree of thiolation than that of W. Because W and Mo speciation controls their particle reactivities, these results together indicate that both speciation of W and Mo and their particle reactivity with respect to solid phases control the behaviors of Mo/W molar ratios in various reducing environments. Our results also suggest that in both oxic and weakly sulfidic conditions, both WO42- and MoO42- dominate. In contrast, different thiolated anions of W and Mo are likely to be present in the sedimentary records deposited in sulfidic systems. Thus, the results suggest that the dissolved Mo/W molar ratio combined with their speciation information is a strong indicator of redox changes (including oxic and sulfidic changes). Solid phase Mo/W molar ratios increase as sulfide levels increase and thus can be used to track variations in redox conditions (as well as the severity of sulfidic conditions) in ancient oceans.

AB  - Most biopharmaceuticals are produced as sterile parenteral preparations, requiring very strict production conditions. In addition, liquid formulations face stability challenges which is why currently around half of all biologics are freeze dried for preservation. The environmental impact of the fill and finish processes to produce a freeze dried biopharmaceutical (infliximab) was evaluated from two perspectives: (i) considering only process-specific needs and (ii) calculating the overall site needs. An Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment was conducted using both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The process-specific and overall site needs are 6.5 and 39.6 MJ(ex)/vial, respectively. These results reveal that 84% of the cumulative exergy entering the manufacturing plant is non-process-specific. Electricity consumption is the highest footprint driver (86%), dominated by the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system running during non-production hours and/or supporting non-production related areas. If resource efficiency is pursued, the focal target might need to shift towards non-process-specific needs which are not essential for the product functionality/quality (e.g. full HVAC regime during non-production hours). It should be kept in mind that Good Manufacturing Practices conditions always have to be maintained. Currently performed energy saving measures addressing HVAC systems could potentially reduce the overall site needs calculated in this study by up to 16.5 MJ(ex)/vial.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate variation in the structure of a population of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Tod. in N-E Poland depending on its location in a river valley and light availability under tree canopies. Ordination statistical methods and structural equation modeling were used to identify ecological relationships in the population. The analysis showed that optimum growth conditions of M. struthiopteris depend on the canopy cover. As the shading increased, the size of trophophyllous leaves and the production of sporophylls decreased. The relationship between the canopy cover and the optimum growth conditions was best expressed by rootstock diameter and, to a lesser extent, by the number and height of trophophylls. An indirect relationship between the number and height of sporophylls and the canopy cover, by rootstock size and trophophyll quantity, was also identified. This relationship may be caused by the predominance of vegetative forms of reproduction. Based on the correlations between the landscape position vs. rootstock diameter and trophophyll height, a difference in the habitat colonization potential of M. struthiopteris could be detected. Three spatial clusters of M. struthiopteris in the river valley were identified: river bank, river terrace, river valley slopes. These relationships and the distribution of other herbaceous plant species occurring at the plots indicate that the distribution pattern of M. struthiopteris in the study area is determined by diverse environmental conditions, however mainly by light conditions.

AB  - Land-based sources of pollution are a major threat to the health of coral reefs. We report, for the first time, a study that relates coral reef condition to human modifications of the landscape. Stony coral community richness, cover, colony size, and density were assessed along with 3-dimensional coral cover in the near-shore waters of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, in 2006 and 2007. Land use/land cover data (LULC, 2.4 m resolution) and a landscape development intensity (LDI) index, an indicator of human activity calculated from the LULC data, were used to explore relationships with coral indicators. The LDI index was more robust than other indicators of human activity, exhibiting negative correlations with stony coral colony density, taxa richness, colony size, and total coral cover. High variability observed in coral density and taxa richness was better explained when percent natural land and average coral station depth were considered along with the LDI index. Percent impervious surface in the watershed was negatively correlated with 1 coral condition indicator, total coral cover. The LDI index is an effective landscape indicator of human impact on St. Croix corals, highlighting the link between land-based human activity and marine ecosystems. Further development of this tool will aid in land use planning and prioritization of conservation efforts.

AB  - Foraminifera host diverse microbial communities that can shift in response to changing environmental conditions. To characterize climate change impacts on the foraminifera microbiome across life stages, we exposed adult Marginopora vertebralis (Large Benthic Foraminifera) to pCO(2) and temperature scenarios representing present-day, 2050 and 2100 levels and raised juveniles under present-day and 2050 conditions. While treatment condition had no significant effect on the seawater microbial communities, exposure to future scenarios significantly altered both adult and juvenile microbiomes. In adults, divergence between present-day and 2050 or 2100 conditions was primarily driven by a reduced relative abundance of Oxyphotobacteria under elevated temperature and pCO(2). In juveniles, the microbial shift predominantly resulted from changes in the proportion of Proteobacteria. Indicator species analysis identified numerous treatment-specific indicator taxa, most of which were indicative of present-day conditions. Oxyphotobacteria, previously reported as putative symbionts of foraminifera, were indicative of present-day and 2050 conditions in adults, but of present-day conditions only in juveniles. Overall, we show that the sensitivity of the M. vertebralis microbiome to climate change scenarios extends to both life stages and primarily correlates with declines in Oxyphotobacteria and shifts in Proteobacteria under elevated temperature and pCO(2).

AB  - Globally, multiple stressors acting on large rivers strongly influence their ecosystem functions. They do so by altering both their biodiversity and integrity, which may in turn degrade the available ecosystem services. We present the catchment characteristics and discuss different management strategies for the two longest European rivers, the Volga (3531 km) and the Danube (2850 km). Subsequently, we analyze patterns and characteristics of fish fauna of the two rivers based on a review of historical and recent fish surveys. The native fish community of the Danube is characterized by rheophilic species, whereas the Volga has a similar proportion of rheophilic and eurytopic fish, with increasing portions of rheophilic species in the Lower Volga and the Volga Delta. We analyzed the species composition of certain regions of the Volga and the Danube and found a range of 0.515-0.667 for the Jaccard distance. Our review and comparison of fish communities and fisheries between these two largest river systems in Europe indicate that the additive effects of multiple stressors cause impacts on their fish communities. Integrated management taking into account these stressors is needed in order to preserve riverine fish diversity and enhance sustainable fisheries.

AB  - During three consecutive years, two fishing techniques were used to sample fish assemblages in a large river (River Meuse, Belgium). In order to sample both pelagic and benthic species, electrofishing was used along the river banks while gillnet leadlines were placed on the bottom of the main channel. Electrofishing sampled more species (up to 22 species) but principally small individuals (young of the year or small-size species), while gillnet sampled fewer species (up to 16 species), but larger individuals. Capture variability of species richness was lower with electrofishing (CV = 16.6 %). However, gillnet sampled some species (e. g., Abramis brama) better than electrofishing. In order to evaluate the influence of fishing gear on the proportion of species belonging to the different ecological guilds, values of some biological parameters (number of native species, number of tolerant species, etc.) were calculated on the electrofishing and gillnet data. Gillnets caught principally tolerant individuals (i. e. fish belonging to species that are classified as tolerant to water, habitat and chemical degradation) (88 %), but fewer "indicator species" (i. e. species that are indicators of good ecological quality). Such differences in guilds collected by the different gears indicate that consistent methods are needed to make assessments.

We report for the first time the values of the following haematological parameters: number of erythrocytes [10(12)/l]; HGB - haemoglobin [g/l]; HCT - haematocrit [%]; MCV - mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes [fl]; MCH - mean corpuscular haemoglobin of erythrocytes [pg]; MCHC - mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [g/l]; WBC - number of leukocytes [10(9)/l]; LYM - number of lymphocytes [10(9)/l]; MID - number of middle cells [10(9)/l]; GRA - number of granulocytes [10(9)/l]; LY - lymphocytes, measured as percentage of total leukocytes [%]; MI - middle cells, measured as percentage of total leukocytes [%]; GR - granulocytes, measured as percentage of total leukocytes [%]; PLT - number of platelets [10(9)/l]; MPV - platelet volume [fl]. These parameters were obtained from adult male and female individuals of striped mouse Apodemus agrarius. The mice were collected from the Strandzha Mts. in Bulgaria. The statistical analysis of the established haematological parameters has defined the baseline norm of variation of values described by +/- 95% confidence interval. They can be used for the evaluation of the physiological condition of the individuals of the striped mouse as bioindicative markers for evaluating the quality of the environment.

AB  - Urban and industrial developments were the reason for draining peatlands in the past which caused changes in their ecology. Restoration of the water regime aims to bring back their original functions. This study examines the natural recovery of peatland following re-wetting, blocking the drainage ditches. We used soil microbial activity, physicochemical properties and nematode communities as indicator taxa to describe restoration status five years after management. Data were compared to those obtained from adjacent degraded forest and meadow like habitats of former peatlands. Our results indicate that re-wetting had considerable effect to soil indices and nematodes. Soil moisture and organic carbon significantly increased, while pH has not changed. In contrast, soil enzymatic activity significantly decreased after re-wetting in the restored part of the peatland compared to the degraded habitats. These conditions were probably less favourable for small metazoans, because of their abundance; species number and diversity were significantly decreased after re-wetting management. The nematode trophic structure was also significantly degraded; the restored part of peatland had less omnivore and predators as well as plant parasites. We conclude that in respect to both biological indicators and basic soil properties analysed, blocking of drainage ditches creates capable conditions for natural peatland restoration.

AB  - Modifications in the ecological structure of macroinvertebrate communities could reflect changes in environmental conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to identify macroinvertebrate assemblage and evaluating the efficiency of single-criterion and multicriteria indices for determining the ecological health of water quality of the Bakhtegan watershed located in the Eghlid city of Iran. A Surber sampler was used to sample eight sites along the river route. Physicochemical parameters were measured in each site including BOD, COD, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, ammonia and fecal coliform in the laboratory and temperature, pH, EC, DO and hardness at the site of sampling. A total of 8161 macroinvertebrates were identified in 14 orders and 24 families recognized in the studied region and its highest frequency belonged to Gammaridae family (66%). Spearman correlation coefficient (r = 0.81) indicated that the BMWP/ASPT bioindex has a higher performance than other indicators for Bakhtegan area. The results of this study have shown no significant difference between control and non-control sites (Sig. 0.05). It was found that Gammaridae was the dominant major taxon in all sampling sites. Since the river's water is used for farming and also drinking, it is necessary for local managers to be more sensitive to the conditions of the region and try to increase public awareness and other researches to improve the ecological health quality.

AB  - Spatial and temporal distributions of dust fall along with the spatial variation of the biological crust were measured along a cross-section in China's Shapotou railway protective system. The variation of the aeolian environment was evident from the spatial variation of near-surface wind flow and both grain size and accumulation rate of dust fall. These varied greatly along the selected cross-section that extended from the mobile dune through the straw checkerboards and vegetation zone to the gravel platform of the railway. On the temporal scale, the dust fall concentrated from March through May. The grain-size composition changed monthly. These temporal changes were related to the wind-force variation and surface condition. The surface conditions along the cross-section were characterized by crust type, crust thickness, and ground (0-5 cm) compaction. Crust could only be found in a relatively stable environment. The distribution of dust fall and crust indicated the intensity of aeolian activity and the stability of the aeolian environment. Further improvement of the aeolian environment by natural processes or by human construction would promote additional dust fall and accelerate the development of the crust. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pollution from human activities is a major threat to the ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems. Microbial communities are the most abundant organisms in biofilms, and are key indicators of various pollutants. We investigated the effects some human stressors (nutrients and heavy metals) have on the structure and activity of microbial communities in seven sampling sites located in the Ter River basin (NE Spain). Water and biofilm samples were collected in order to characterize physicochemical and biofilm parameters. The 16S rRNA gene was analysed out from DNA and RNA extracts to obtain alpha and beta diversity. Principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the resident microbial community revealed that nutrients and conductivity were the main driving forces behind the diversity and composition. The effects of mining have had mainly seen on the taxonomic composition of the active microbial community, but also at the OTUs level. Remarkably, metal-impacted communities were very active, which would indicate a close link with the stress faced, that is probably related to the stimulation of detoxification. (C) 2019 The Authors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
AB  - The r-nodes (redistribution nodes) are locations in mechanical components and structures that are load-controlled, and therefore insensitive to material constitutive relationships. These locations and their respective equivalent stress values can be approximately determined on the basis of two linear elastic analyses. By invoking equilibrium considerations, a simple relationship can be established between the ''combined r-node equivalent stress'' and the plastic collapse loads. On account of its lend-controlled nature, the combined r-node equivalent stress can be identified with the reference stress, which is extensively used in carrying out pressure component integrity assessments. The concept of r-nodes is also related to the primary stresses in pressure components, and in designing mechanical components and structures for minimum weight, This paper proposes simple phenomenological models in an attempt to characterize the functioning of r-nodes.

AB  - Alteration of flow regimes due to change in climate and its potential impact on habitat and species has become a major cause of concern for riverine ecosystems. Areas that are more vulnerable to such changes are semiarid river systems or regions experiencing intermittent flow and cyclic droughts. Although ecological changes are expected to occur with flow regime alterations, the biological changes cannot be predicted until the flow in such regions is analysed. This study addresses this concern by providing an analysis of flow for a semiarid river basin in the Central Great Plains from a 50 and 100-year projection climate data. The projected data for these two periods are then compared with 30-year historical data to determine changes in flow. Five major components of flow regime, magnitude, duration, and timing of annual extreme water conditions, frequency and duration of high and low pulses, and rate and frequency of water condition changes, were examined with respect to climate change for their impact on the ecology of the basin. This analysis strongly suggests that inter- and intra-annual changes in flow regimes will result in the intensified drying of the basin represented by the increased number of low flow periods followed by higher occurrences of high flow events of shorter duration with expected changes in climate.

AB  - Atanasovsko Lake (7.200 ha, Southeast Bulgaria) incorporates diverse habitats and lies along the Europe's second largest migration route, Via Pontica. The dynamics of environmental conditions, factors controlling water quality and ecological status (water chemical parameters and biological quality elements) were studied for three years. The key factor for the lake is the salt production mechanism (salterns were created in 1906 and divided into two complexes of water bodies known as North Salterns and South Salterns, each being relatively autonomous as a salt production entity) and sea-freshwater exchange. The phytoplanktonbased assessment in the North Salterns in 2015 showed progressive improvement. The same positive development was recorded in the South Salterns and Azmaka River. During this year, Knipowitschia caucasica was represented with small population only in the North Saltern as well as limited assemblages of Ruppia maritima were recorded and Artemia salina was registered. Thus, the freshwater supply in the northern part of the lake was recognized as a key mechanism for diminishing blooms and establishing of a more balanced environment. Nevertheless, the structure of benthic communities at North and South Salterns were disrupted, probably as a result of unstable bottom substrates, anthropogenic activities and predatory press by birds and fish. Baseline information contained in this study will be incorporated into future data analyses of the lake.

AB  - Natural disturbances like drought and wildfires are expected to increase in prevalence, so understanding how organisms are affected is a key goal for conservationists and biologists alike. While many studies have illustrated long-term effects of perturbations on survival and reproduction, little is known of short-term effects to physiology and sexual signal expression. Ornamental traits have been proposed as reliable indicators of environmental health, yet studies are lacking in the context of natural disturbances. Here we present short-term (7-65 days) responses of male red-backed fairywrens Malurus melanocephalus to wildfire near the onset of the typical breeding season. Young males of this species are characterized by plastic expression of sexual plumage phenotypes depending on circulating testosterone and body condition. Using two populations with fairywren captures before and after separate wildfires we illustrate that wildfire suppressed molt into ornamented plumage. Neither baseline plasma corticosterone or furcular fat stores were affected by fire. However, fire seemed to interfere with the termporal increase in plasma testosterone during the pre-breeding season, leading to a lower proportion of males molting into ornamented plumage. Collectively, these findings suggest that wildfires inhibit or greatly delay acquisition of ornamentation in males through enduring suppression of testosterone circulation.

AB  - Latest international directives indicate the need for sustainable development, linking socio-economic and environmental aspects, to reach the goals set by Agenda 2030. In this context, peri-urban agriculture can represent the opportunity to increase cities' sustainability, improving their liveability level, fulfilling a crucial social part since it assures new sources of job opportunities and territorial requalification. This study presents a peri-urban requalification experience, conducted in Milan, Italy, where, within the European funded project OpenAgri, eight agri-food start-ups began their activities in a peri-urban area at the southern gates of the city. The study aims to assess and evaluate these start-ups' sustainability using the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA), which considers four sustainability pillars: Good governance, economic resilience, environmental integrity and social well-being. The application of SAFA indicators to the eight start-ups revealed their positive aspects and some limitations, typical of some not structured enterprises. The research describes a scalable and replicable example of peri-urban agriculture's potentiality in solving environmental, social and economic issues and tests FAO's SAFA framework, which is still unexplored in this sustainability assessment context.

AB  - Female mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were collected from two sites located on the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation that are contaminated with Cs-137, Sr-90, other radionuclides and chemical genotoxicants. Fish from non-radionuclide contaminated environments located off the reservation were also collected. DNA, extracted from liver tissue acid blood cells, was examined by gel electrophoresis for structural damage in the form of strand breakage. In general, the level of DNA strand breaks was elevated in fish from radionuclide-contaminated sites with observed differences in the number and type of strand breaks between liver tissue and blood cells. The number of malformed embryos was higher in fish at the contaminated sites, and varied with season. Fecundity was negatively correlated with the level of double strand breaks in the DNA of fish from one contaminated site. Females with broods that included malformed embryos had more DNA strand breakage than those that did not; and furthermore, a threshold effect was observed between the occurrence of malformed embryos and the presence of double strand breaks in the DNA of the mother. These findings have implications for both ecological risk assessment and evolutionary ecology.

AB  - Four strains of Escherichia coli were examined for response to heat stress (60-degrees-C) as a function of physiological age and antecedent oxygen growth conditions.  Exponential phase cells were more susceptible to heat than cells grown to the stationary phase.  Anaerobically grown, exponential phase cells were more susceptible to thermal stress than were cells grown to a similar physiological state but under aerobic conditions.  In the case of stationary phase cells, differences in response to heat stress as related to prior oxygen growth conditions were equivocal.  Repair characteristics of thermally injured cells were also examined.  Cells grown anaerobically prior to heat stress required 1.5 h longer than their aerobically grown counterparts to complete repair.  These findings suggest that antecedent oxygen growth conditions influence the response of E. coli to thermal stress and perhaps, more generally, that persistence of environmentally stressed enteric microorganisms must be considered in relation to prior oxygen growth conditions in vivo.

AB  - Pollen grain assays in Vicia faba and naturally growing plants indicated increased genotoxic effects in habitats with elevated radiation levels. However, severe cytological damage in test plants could not be attributed solely to in situ genotoxic effect of prolonged irradiation, but to ageing of plants and complex clastogenic effects in the environment, including harsh weather conditions. Pollen grain assay in different plant species indicated that perennials could be used as biological indicators of long-term genotoxic exposure.

AB  - Environmental characteristics and spatial distances between sites have been used to explain species distribution in the environment, through Neutral (space) and Niche theory (environment) predictions. We evaluated the effects of spatial and environmental factors on Odonata larvae distribution along the Suia-Missu River Basin, state of Mato Grosso. We tested the hypotheses that (1) the environment is the main factor structuring the community due to its ecophysiological requirements; and (2) the pattern, if present, is clearer for Zygoptera. Samples were made in 12 sites on the Suia-Missu River Basin in three seasons (2007/2008), with a total of 1.382 Odonata larvae, comprising 10 families, 51 genera and 100 morphospecies. The Anisoptera were more abundant than Zygoptera, comprising 81% of all specimens. The environment affected Zygoptera (R=0.291; p=0.007) and was the main factor structuring the assembly. Thus, Niche theory was confirmed. The absence of this effect on Anisoptera may be due to the ecophysiological adaptations that enable it to occupy different habitats. Zygoptera larvae are indicators of changes in habitat structure. The effects of environmental variables on larvae ecology emphasize the strong relationship between these organisms and environmental integrity.

AB  - The chinch bug Wheelerodemus muhlenbergiae Henry and Sweet was described as a new species in 2015 based on collections from disjunct regions of Oklahoma (Arbuckle Mountains and nearby areas) and Texas (eastern Edwards Plateau). Adults are short winged (micropterous) and flightless. The known host plants are two species of the grass genus Muhlenbergia: M. lindheimeri in Texas and M. reverchonii in Oklahoma and Texas. The present paper provides additional information on the study sites and host plants, adds collection sites not included in the original description, and gives notes on seasonality. Adults overwintered and first instars were observed as early as late April. Second instars were present in late May, third instars in early to mid-June, and fourth and fifth instars in early July. The bug might be univoltine, but the adults observed in late October probably represented those of a second generation. Vascular plants and other insect groups with similar Arbuckle Mountains-Edwards Plateau range disjunctions are noted. As a host restricted, dispersal-limited, and habitat-specialized species, W muhlenbergiae is a potential indicator of the ecological integrity of grasslands on limestone and sandstone substrates.

AB  - The volume, biomass, and carbon and nitrogen content of coarse woody debris were measured on three 1-ha reference plots in old-growth Nothofagus fusca (Hook. f.) Oerst. - Nothofagus menziesii (Hook. f.) Oerst. forest on the South island of New Zealand. Two decay sequences for logs and one for standing dead trees (snags) were recognised from two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) Of UP to 30 variables related to physical characteristics and structural integrity. Wood volume (up to 800 m(3).ha(-1)) and biomass were high (up to 300 Mg.ha(-1)), and the inside-out decay sequence from heartwood to sapwood was unusual compared with that of other temperature hardwood forests. Coarse woody debris represented significant carbon and nitrogen pools, with ca. 150 Mg.ha(-1) and 370 kg.ha(-1), respectively, in one stand. The coarse woody debris component of these broad-leaved evergreen hardwood forests was much higher than that reported for other temperate hardwood forests and approaches that of many northern hemisphere conifer forests. The large coarse woody debris pools are discussed in relation to live stand biomass, natural disturbances and tree mortality, and decomposition processes.

AB  - Since the end of the twentieth century, discussion on dwelling rehabilitation versus its demolition and new construction has been steadily increasing in intensity, which is especially due to the necessity for the regeneration of urban centres. However, rehabilitation is not always considered the most economical solution, and demolition and new construction may constitute a better option. In the present work, a multi-family building in Seville, Spain, is used as a case study. After having suffered damage from a construction failure, it is assessed for its complete rehabilitation. Defective maintenance has worsened the bad condition of the building. A model is proposed, from the project budget perspective, that allows the environmental (Ecological Footprint indicator) and the economic (project's bill of quantities) assessment of the recovery of the dwelling. In the case study, the rehabilitation Ecological Footprint and the project cost are 0.06 gha/m(2) of floor area (457.22 EUR/m(2)) and 0.14 gha/m(2) (576.33 EUR/m(2)) for a new building on the same plot, respectively. It can be deduced that, even with a severely damaged building, the repair and retrofit work incurs a lower economic and environmental impact than that of the total replacement with a new construction.

AB  - Feeding processes and energetic balance of zebra mussels were both related to the quantity and quality of natural seston. Filtration rate and pseudofeces production increased while clearance rate remained constant with increasing seston concentration. Ingestion rate, assimilation efficiency, and assimilation rate all increased with increasing food quality, measured as the ratio of organic to inorganic material in the seston. Respiration rate did not change with either food quantity or quality. As a result, scope for growth declined with decreasing food quality, and fell below 0 cal mg(-1) h(-1) at an organic:inorganic ratio of 0.5. The association between feeding processes and food quality appears related to a breakdown in the ability of zebra mussels to selectively ingest high-quality organic particles when the organic content of the seston is low. Ingestion, assimilation efficiency, assimilation rate and scope for growth were all higher when seston was amended with an addition of a natural assemblage of algae. Food quality may be a better indicator of environmental conditions suitable for growth than food quantity. These results suggest that the conditions of high suspended inorganic sediment concentrations in large turbid rivers represent a difficult growth environment for the zebra mussel.

AB  - Biological water quality indices are increasingly used for coastal water quality assessment. It is not clear, how are anthropogenic disturbances and climate variability captured in the dynamics of different indices. In this study, we evaluate simultaneous contributions of both eutrophication- and climate-related factors to the variability of a benthic invertebrate index ZKI. The index is adopted to classify the coastal brackish waters in the NE Baltic Sea. We found quite similar contributions of climate and eutrophication, which together described on average about 65% of the variability of the ZKI in the study area. These interactions are likely affected by local geomorphology, with the index values being less related to eutrophication on coarse bottoms and more to climate patterns on steep slopes. The relative contribution of eutrophication to index variability did not change across the pressure gradient according to the Baltic Sea Pressure Index. The results indicate that index assessments may easily become misinterpreted if the knowledge about the other sources of variability is missing and advise to account for climatic and hydrographic factors.

AB  - Sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) is the anionic surfactant commonly utilized as the main synthetic chemical component in most foaming agents used in mechanized tunnelling. This produces huge amounts of soil debris which can contain residual concentrations of SLES. The absence of environmental quality standards for soil and water and the limited information about SLES persistence in real excavated soils do not facilitate any re-use of soil debris as by-products. The environmental risk assessment (ERA) of foaming agents containing SLES can be a valid tool for this purpose. In this study, an ERA analysis of SLES in 12 commercial formulations (cf) used for tunnelling excavation was performed. Various soils from different tunnel excavation sites were conditioned with the selected foaming agents containing SLES. Predicted or measured environmental concentrations (PECs, MECs) were determined and then compared with the Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for both the terrestrial and aquatic compartments. The results indicate a reduction of the potential risk over time for these ecosystems, with differences depending on both the commercial foaming formulation and the spoil material characteristics. However, because potential threats to the natural environment cannot be excluded, some risk management and mitigation actions are discussed.

AB  - Effects on sediments of fish farming activity near Vrgada Island was analysed through living and total foraminiferal assemblages and concentration of major, minor and trace elements from three sediment cores. Elemental concentrations of sediments are in accordance with carbonate characteristics of the surrounding area and show mostly natural element variations between sampling locations and throughout the cores, with no significant increases due to fish farming activity. Only phosphorus concentration shows elevate values below the fish cage, assigned to fish pellets. Foraminiferal communities are dominated by epifaunal and stress tolerant species, while diversity indices point to normal marine conditions. The type of substrate and phosphorus content in sediments principally influence foraminiferal community composition, while other elemental concentrations have no perceptible effect on the assemblages. Some foraminiferal species Ammonia tepida, Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium crispum, Elphidium macellum and genus Haynesina are confirmed to be tolerant to elevated nutrient (phosphorus) content, while Ammonia parkinsoniana shows sensitivity to pollution. Postmortem processes cause decrease of foraminiferal density and species richness with core depth. All results point to negligible influence of fish farming and relatively stable environmental conditions at all sampling locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we aim to establish a conceptual and practical framework for investigating sense of place as a category of cultural ecosystem services, drawing upon transdisciplinary research on assessing cultural value and ecosystem change in the Irish Sea. We examine sense of place as a material phenomenon, embedded in and expressive of the relationship between determining ecological conditions of particular locations and the determining social and cultural conditions of human habitation. Our emphasis on sense of place as a material phenomenon contrasts with the prevailing tendency in ecosystem services literature to treat cultural ecosystem services as 'non-material', 'immaterial', or 'intangible', and builds on a call to conceptualize cultural ecosystem services in 'a more theoretically nuanced approach' which yields practical means of researching and assessing cultural benefits (Fish et al., 2016a, p. 215). The paper emerges from a transdisciplinary project on 'The Cultural Value of Coastlines', which seeks to define a mechanism for integrating materialist research on cultural benefits into the ecosystem services framework. We demonstrate the need for a more significant role for sense of place as a category of cultural ecosystem services, and for research practices which can account for the material and socially-produced nature of sense of place.

AB  - Risk-based methods promise improved decision-making for managing of contaminants, such as salinity, sediments, nutrients, and toxicants, that can adversely affect the ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems. Two aspects of ecological risk assessment (ERA) and management-stakeholder involvement and more quantitative approaches to risk analysis-are particularly challenging. Stakeholder involvement is crucial both in the risk assessment process and the development, acceptance, and implementation of a risk management plan. Additionally, a number of quantitative approaches (particularly Bayesian approaches and multi-criteria decision-making) have been identified as having the potential to include expert-based inputs into risk-based decision-making. These offer promise for better inclusion of stakeholder knowledge and preferences into the decision-making process, and for improving the links between stakeholder inputs and potential risks to the ecological condition of the system. A major challenge for ecologists and natural resource managers is to make the ERA process more quantitative. Most ERAs conducted to date have been qualitative assessments that suffer from a number of deficiencies, the most serious being the lack of transparency and a reliance on subjective judgments. This article argues that the most productive way for-ward may be to use Bayesian methods to couple existing process-based models, empirical relationships based on good data, and expert opinion, to make the analysis of ecological risks more robust, consistent, and repeatable.

AB  - Obesity is recognised as the most common multifactorial nutritional disorder of pet cats. Studies from several countries have indicated that between 11.5% and 63% of cats are overweight or obese. Breed, age, sex, reproductive status, the pet-owner relationship, owners' perceptions of their cats' body condition, type of diet, frequency of feeding, and environment have all been identified as potential risk factors for the development of obesity in cats. Obesity has significant implications for feline health and welfare as it has mechanical and metabolic effects and can predispose cats to conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 2, hepatic lipidosis, lameness, oral cavity disease, urinary tract disease, dermatological disease, and neoplasia. An important aspect of preventing and managing obesity is the evaluation of body condition to determine ideal body weight and to formulate an appropriate weight loss plan. Several methods have been developed for this purpose. This review uses recent scientific literature to discuss various aspects of feline obesity, including its prevalence, proposed risk factors, pathogenesis, associated conditions, and methods of assessment.

AB  - Relationships between environmental variables and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were investigated among several sites that varied in disturbance history in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, an Afromontane site in East Africa. Environmental variables were correlated with the level of past catchment disturbance - logging, agricultural encroachment, and present tourism activity. For example, sites in medium and high disturbance categories had higher values of specific conductance and lower water transparency than low disturbance category sites, these environmental variables may therefore act indicators of ecological quality of rivers. Environmental variables such as conductivity and water transparency were found to be good predictors of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with anthropogenically stressed sites having lower diversity than the reference sites. Impacted sites were dominated by tolerant taxa such as chironomid and leeches, while 'Cyclean water' taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera dominated at minimally impacted sites. Comparison of sites with different disturbance histories provided evidence for differences in benthic macroinvertebrate communities that reflect the state of forest restoration and recovery. We recommend quarterly monitoring of water quality to act as an early warning system of deterioration and tracking ecological recovery of previously impacted sites.

AB  - Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the Center) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses the potential environmental impact of a wide variety of animal health products. The FDA considers the manufacture, use, and disposal of these products. Environmental assessments of some products, for example, products that may cause indirect or secondary effects or products used in aquaculture, are particularly challenging. For actions not categorically excluded, sponsors of animal drug products must prepare either complete or abbreviated environmental assessments (EAs), depending upon the nature of the requested action. Complete EAs must address potential impacts caused by manufacture, use, and disposal of the product. Data from environmental testing are used in the development of complete EAs. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and inspections are used to ensure the accuracy and data integrity of environmental information submitted for EAs. Potential impacts from manufacture of the product must be considered in both complete and abbreviated EAs. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspections are used to verify manufacturing information provided in environmental assessments. Efficient development of complete EAs requires making use of the tiered testing system, starting the environmental assessment early in the drug approval pro. cess, and communicating with the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine when questions arise.

AB  - The concentrations of inorganic, organic and total carbon, and some sedimentary parameters (sediment density, fines, pH, and shell fragments), have been analyzed in surface sediments of the Venice Lagoon since 1987. Environmental scenarios, characterized by different anthropogenic impacts, have been considered, especially in the central basin where more information is available. Data collected in 2009 in the lagoons and ponds of Po Delta, in Comacchio Valleys and Pialassa della Baiona have been also considered and analyzed together with those recorded in the whole Venice Lagoon in 2011. The results show a strong correlation of the inorganic carbon (Cinorg) with the carbonatic or siliceous origins of the sediments and changes of both Cinorg and organic carbon (Corg) according to different anthropogenic impacts, especially eutrophication and clam-fishing activities. Higher sediment density, grain-size, and pH were associated to good-high ecological conditions and the higher presence of inorganic carbon of biological origin (shell fragments and calcified macroalgal fragments). Conversely, Corg, which is associated to eutrophic conditions, was strongly affected by the sediment disturbance and the presence of high concentrations of bivalves which enhance its consumption.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is subject to multiple human pressures increasingly threatening its unique biodiversity. Spatially explicit information on the ecological status of marine ecosystems is therefore key to an effective maritime spatial planning and management, and to help the achievement of environmental targets. Here, we summarized scientific data on the ecological status of a selection of marine ecosystems based on a set of ecological indicators in more than 700 sites of the Mediterranean Sea. For Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds, rocky intertidal fringe, and coastal soft bottoms, more than 70% of investigated sites exhibited good to high ecological conditions. In contrast, about two-thirds of sites for subtidal rocky reefs were classified to be in moderate to bad conditions, stressing the need for prioritizing conservation initiatives on these productive and diverse environments. Very little quantitative information was available for the southern Mediterranean Sea, thus monitoring programs and assessments in this area are essential for a representative assessment of the health of marine coastal ecosystems in the whole basin. This overview represents a first step to implement a baseline that, through georeferenced data on ecological status, could help identifying information gaps, directing future research priorities, and supporting improvements to spatial models of expected cumulative impacts on marine ecosystems.

AB  - The restoration of lotic ecosystems as currently practiced is constrained by a limited understanding of the emergence of stream ecosystem functions and their linkages to perceived ecosystem services valued by society. An investigation was made into the connections between ecosystem function and hydraulic structure of a stream impacted by gravel mining operations in western New York. Stream ecosystem metabolic parameters were measured using two-point dissolved oxygen diurnals on multiple reaches of the same stream, and were correlated with geomorphic and hydraulic descriptors of the same reaches. Results showed ecosystem metabolism at the reach scale varied as a function of geomorphic condition, where higher primary production and community respiration (CR) were observed for reaches observed to be unstable vs. those that were stable or restored. The metabolic variance of a stream ecosystem, proposed as a measure of the degree to which a desired ecological functional goal has been achieved post-restoration, is determined as the rate of change of the ratio of primary production to CR. Shifts in the P/R ratio were evident in reaches post-restoration, presumably as a result of changes in hydraulic structure, supporting the utility of the ratio by describing a direct link between instream hydraulic conditions and ecosystem function.

AB  - From the sustainable development management model, cities must seek balance relationships between natural resources and economic and social development in such a way that the environmental conditions inside and outside these urban spaces do not reach undesirable patterns and conditions. This study arises from the need to possess a system for monitoring the socio-environmental sustainability of cities through criteria and indicators. With the participation of national experts, a preliminary list of 327 indicators was generated which were then grouped based on their characteristics into 82 indicators distributed along 9 distinctive criteria, namely: water, energy, fauna, urban green areas, soil, environmental management, solid and liquid waste management, land use planning and society & governance. By means of bibliographic review, only 43 indicators were found to hold complete and operative information to be evaluated. Through a participative workshop involving the national experts, the theoretical feasibility of applying the selected indicators was evaluated. The final result is a compendium of 19 socio-environmental indicators, which comply with at least 80% pertinence, relevance, robustness and data availability. However, the experts point out that cost, scale and quality are all variables that must be used in selecting, adapting or creating indicators that allow for the monitoring of socio-environmental sustainability in Costa Rican cities.

AB  - Feedbacks between seagrass and the local environmental conditions may hinder attempts to restore seagrass by inducing alternative stable states. A one-dimensional physical-biological model was used to identify the conditions under which a feedback between seagrass, sediment and light can yield alternative stable states of seagrass presence and absence (bistability). Based on our model results, a prediction of whether a given seagrass meadow is large enough to promote seagrass growth can now be made. If the water residence time within the spatial area of the meadow is similar to or greater than the sediment settling time, which is calculated from the ratio of water depth to sediment vertical settling velocity, the meadow is large enough for the feedback to potentially reduce the local suspended sediment concentration. This has important implications for seagrass restoration: for a proposed restoration plot, if the water residence time is similar to or greater than the sediment settling time, the scale of restoration is large enough for the feedback between seagrass, sediment and light to locally improve water clarity. More generally, this calculation can be used to identify areas where this feedback is likely to generate bistability, and to estimate the minimum suitable meadow size in such locations.

AB  - It is typically assumed that for species to persist in working landscapes, they must either persist alongside agricultural pressures (i.e. land-sharing) or become restricted to remnant patches of natural habitat (i.e land-sparing). However, a third possibility is that species survive in stable ecological refuges that then supply the surrounding matrix with immigrants. In this study, we examined the potential for refuge-colonisation dynamics across two Key Biodiversity Areas dominated by commercial farmland in South Africa. We combined six years of remote sensing and two years of field surveys to examine mountains and rocky outcrops as ecological refuges using butterflies as indicators of environmental change. Vegetation on mountains and outcrops had higher and less variable productivity and moisture retention than the matrix, even across exceptionally wet and dry years. Moreover, butterflies in the matrix were a nested subset of species from the mountains and outcrops, and there was little evidence that species with certain traits were limited to either habitat. This suggests that species can retreat to ecological refuges during harsh conditions and recolonise the surrounding matrix once conditions improve. Ecological refuges can, therefore, unify land-sharing and land-sparing because their targeted protection would support the persistence of species throughout wider landscapes.

AB  - The modification of the natural environment in beef production can induce behavioral changes in cattle. In order to assess the behavioral response based on indicators of animal welfare of beef cattle in feedlot in warm desert environmental conditions; a prospective observational study was conducted with a duration of four weeks. Behavioral guidelines, environmental temperature, relative humidity and temperature and humidity index (THI), were recorded at 8:00 h, 12:00 h, and 16:00 h. Environmental temperature, relative humidity and THI average was 28.7 degrees C, 24.1 %, and 72.8 units, respectively. During observational period, the beef cattle to be subject at comfort condition (THI <= 74). By environmental effect at 12:00 h the usual indicators: eating and drinking, are inhibited (P <= 0.01), and grooming decreased (8.2 vs. 13.2 x 100; P <= 0.01) Agonist indicators: mounts, threats, Flehmen sign and bumps decrease significantly at 12:00 h (P <= 0.01), when the THI value is greater than 75 units are. The highest panting rate (25 x 10000) was observed at 12:00. The diurnal behavioral response of cattle in feedlot on warm desert climate is due to biological rhythms to adapt to the environment that ensures their survival.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are characterised by strong spatial gradient of environmental parameters, especially hypersalinity, and are prone to anthropogenic disturbance. The Coorong (South Australia) is an inverse estuarine coastal lagoon separated from the sea by sand dunes. It is exposed to extreme water quality changes that affect its aquatic communities. Here, we used plankton as indicators of extreme environmental fluctuations to monitor and manage the environmental health of such complex systems. We defined the relationship of different plankton communities with water quality fluctuations and determined plankton species suitable for monitoring the ecosystem health. Two distinct communities of phytoplankton and zooplankton were identified, with salinity and nutrients being the principal factors impacting species distribution. Thus, two sets of indicator species were selected based on the different communities observed. Polychaete and gastropod larvae were positive indicators, showing salinity range restriction of brackish to marine. The distribution Acartia cf. fancetti represented healthy hypersaline conditions (salinity 40-60), while Cyclophora sp. and Scrippsiella sp. were negative indicators, correlating with extreme salinity and ammonia levels. The implementation of planktonic organisms as environmental indicators provided a constructive tool for the management of ecosystem health of the Coorong and will be applicable to similar coastal lagoons.

AB  - Being a component of atmospheric air, carbon dioxide is widely distributed in nature and constantly exchanged between the atmosphere and ecosystems. It also serves as an indicator of the rate of processes taking place in the soil environment and reflects the rate of organic matter decomposition during industrial waste management and degraded land reclamation. Human activity may increase CO(2) emission to the atmosphere, thus contributing to its higher concentration in atmospheric air. CO(2) content of soil air is modified by a variety of factors, including temperature, humidity, porosity, root respiration, etc. CO(2) emitted to the atmosphere is the product of numerous chemical processes, primarily organic matter decomposition under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and urea decomposition.
   This paper presents experimental results concerning CO(2) emission from light soil deposit in the form of overburden, before and after fertilization with sewage sludge. CO(2) emission was determined in a controlled environment chamber at a temperature of 10, 20 and 30 degrees C and a constant water capacity of 60%. It was found that both higher temperatures and the addition of sludge increased CO(2) emission to the atmosphere. The observed relationships were confirmed by an analysis of variance, and correlations between the tested variables and CO(2) emission were determined.

AB  - The use of artificial substrates for monitoring environmental quality and contaminant impact has been repeatedly suggested, but little information is yet available on the applicability and the sensitivity of this approach. One of the crucial points to be addressed for using artificial substrates, as tools mirroring actual benthic community state, is assessing whether, and how, they reflect in situ conditions characterising natural sediments. In this study we investigated short-term dynamics of meiofaunal colonisation on artificial substrates (bottle brushes) deployed in impacted and "pristine" (control) sites. Meiofaunal colonisation reached a threshold level after 4-6 days in both impacted and control sites but with significantly higher densities in artificial substrates deployed in the control site. Meiofaunal parameters in artificial substrates reflected those of meiofaunal assemblages inhabiting natural sediments where artificial substrates were deployed. Colonised artificial substrates were then transplanted from impacted to control sites. This caused a significant increase of meiofaunal abundance, which after 5 days reached values indistinguishable from the non-impacted control. Given the rapid colonisation time, meiofaunal sensitivity to changing environmental conditions, it can be concluded that artificial substrates can represent an useful tool to be further developed for routine and low-cost monitoring studies aiming at integrating biological indicators of environmental quality.

AB  - This study was conducted in the Taizi River catchment, located in northeastern China. Six representative streams in three regions (upper mountains, middle hills, lower plains) with different levels of anthropogenic disturbances were surveyed to describe the structure of fish assemblages and their relationship to environmental parameters. The results showed that the fish assemblages were significantly different among the three regions in the Taizi River catchment. Indicator species analysis found ten representative fish species in the Taizi River catchment and four species in the upper, four species in the middle, and two species in the lower regions. The ecological traits of the representative fish species were generally in agreement with the physiochemical features of the streams located within different regions. Multivariate analysis indicated that altitude, water temperature, and total nitrogen were the three most significant environmental parameters influencing the fish assemblage structure in the Taizi River catchment. Based on the different environmental features and fish assemblages found in each region, fish management and conservation strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of each region.

AB  - The Thornthwaite moisture index is useful as an indicator of the supply of water in an area relative to the demand under prevailing climatic conditions.  This study examines the effects of long-term changes in climate (temperature and precipitation) on the Thornthwaite moisture index in the Delaware River basin.  Temperature and precipitation estimates for doubled-CO2 conditions derived from three general circulation models (GCMs) are used to study the response of the moisture index for steady-state doubled-CO2 conditions and for gradual changes from present to doubled-CO2 conditions.
   Results of the study indicate that temperature and precipitation under doubled-CO2 conditions will cause the Thornthwaite moisture index to decrease, implying significantly drier conditions in the Delaware River basin than currently exist.  The amount of decrease depends, however, on the GCM climatic-change scenario used.  The results also indicate that future changes in the moisture index will be partly masked by natural year-to-year variability in temperature and precipitation.

AB  - Rhodolith growth and CaCO3 production remain poorly quantified along the SW Atlantic Ocean, and it is difficult to relate the available measurements with biomass estimates. Suboptimal conditions may clarify how harsh environments influence nodule growth and abundance, elucidating their relationship. Off the energetic South American equatorial coast a rhodolith bed (similar to 65 km(2)), formed mainly by Mesophyllum sp. and Lithophyllum sp., alters the regional sedimentary pattern and sustains a diverse biota. Its nodules present fast growth rates (2.8 mm year 1), but small biomasses (18 nodules.m(-2) covering 26 +/- 3% of the substrate), resulting in a CaCO3 production of 163.33 g m-(2).year(-1). Despite the small biomass, the bed seems stable, with living and dead nodules both on and inside the substrate. And the suboptimal environment apparently affects growth and abundance independently. Therefore, fast growth rates and relevant structural roles are not necessarily associated with dense rhodolith assemblages, and ecological assessments of rhodolith beds should consider the dynamics of both individual nodules and the whole population.

AB  - In order to provide adequate guidelines in freshwater management, managers need reliable bioindicators that can respond differently to varied stressors. Managers also have to consider hierarchical structure of environmental factors. Thus, our research aims to test the independence of taxa responses along environmental gradients and to examine in what order natural and anthropogenic factors constrain the structure of littoral benthic assemblages. The rank of explained variance of littoral benthic assemblage's variable group hierarchy was: land use > landscape characteristics > eutrophication > fish stocking > hydromorphological alteration. We determined nine gradients (two natural and seven stressor gradients), separated into five groups based on statistically significant differences in responsiveness of taxa. Apart from responsiveness to natural factors, littoral benthic invertebrates could be used as bioindicators for stressors reflecting urbanization, eutrophication, hydromorphological alteration and fish stocking. The taxonomical composition of littoral benthic invertebrates, especially when taxa with preference for certain relatively narrow environmental conditions along gradients are present, can be used to identify effects of key stressors. Our findings have profound implications for ecological assessment and management of lakes, as they indicate that benthic invertebrates can be used when the effects of multiple stressors need to be disentangled.

AB  - Blackberry is a considerable weed in both antropogenous habitats and semi-natural vegetation, and this results in robust colonization in open sites. Our research investigated the carbon gain and water exchange performance of this species under ecologically contrasted forest gap conditions in temperate deciduous forests. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to assess this species ecophysiological behaviour in response to the functional relevance of light environment, seasons and forest gap character. Our research also confirmed significant relationships between abundance, gap characteristics and light response measures. Light environment plays an essential role in the development of assimilation and water use efficiency. Seasonal variation affects transpiration, and forest type influences stomatal conductance. The amount of precipitation and canopy gap size is linked to the relative abundance of the species. These characteristics integrate with a nitrogen biomass trade-off across forest types. Measures of stomatal conductance and assimilation turned out to be the most significant functional variables including a gas exchange indicator for species abundance. Extended functional leaf phenology can promote successful colonization under adequate abiotic conditions. Our results conclude that environmental-related canopy gap size can be recommended for ecologically contrasted forest types, thus modulating the biomass production of the blackberry.

AB  - The results of zooarchaeological study carried out on the bone remains of armadillos (Mammalia, Dasypodidae) from four Sierras of Cordoba (Argentina) archaeological sites were presented. The radiocarbon dates place chronologically their occupation at the last millennium of the Late Holocene (ca. 970 +/- 110 and 290 +/- 37 C-14 BP). Four taxa were identified: Chaetophractus villosus, Chaetophractus vellerosus, Euphractus sp. and Dasypus sp. The diagnostic characters of their bony dermal scutes or osteoderms were described in order to facilitate their taxonomical identification in other modern collection and/or fossil assemblages. C villosus and C vellerosus show a current distribution in the study area, while Euphractus sp. and Dasypus sp. are absent in the Sierras of Cordoba. Euphractus was determined on the basis of a fragmented movable osteoderm in C.Pun.39. Their presence may be a response to an increase of precipitation and temperature associated with the "Medieval Warm Period". The record of Dasypus sp. during the "Little Ice Age" contrasts negatively with its potential as an indicator of warm and humid condition, showing either their adaptive plasticity or the biological fragmentation of the mountain environment under paleoclimatic conditions. Finally, the possibility that the presence of Euphractus and Dasypus is due to anthropogenic transport was considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a purple non-sulfur bacterium, was recently found throughout the water column in Lake Kinneret.  It was demonstrated to be of a versatile nature, growing under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at different light intensities.  A comparison of C-acetate uptake by R. palustris and Chlorobium phaeobacterioides, a green sulfur bacterium, showed that, under identical growth conditions, C-acetate assimilation by R. palustris was greater.  Furthermore, C-acetate uptake for R. palustris was greater than C-CO2 uptake at all light intensities.  Depending on the prevailing conditions, acetate can be used by R. palustris as both an electron donor and carbon source.  Malate synthase was used as an indicator of activity of the glyoxylic acid cycle.  It was found that enzyme activity was higher (i.e., acetate was used mainly as a carbon source) under anaerobic conditions, in the dark, or in the absence of HCO3-.  Acetate was used preferably as an electron donor under photosynthetic microaerophillic conditions.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) determines that all water bodies must achieve a good ecological status. The solar salterns system of Mata-Torrevieja (Spain) has been designated as Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB). This ecosystem is a transitional water body (TW) largely conditioned by socioeconomic management plan and the related human activities that take place. Thus, WFD establishes as obligatory the determination of their ecological potential, and not their ecological status. In order to define the ecological potential, it is necessary to determine previously the chemical and biological conditions of the water body. This paper is focused on the analysis of physical-chemical parameters of a saltern system during 2008-2016. in order to establish a starting point for the implementation process of the WFD in this type of ecosystem (TW-HMWB). The behavior of salinity and physical-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, nutrients) has been studied. Salinity was the most relevant parameter studied to define pressures for these water bodies. However, total phosphorus turned out to be a good potential status indicator. It would be one of the most suitable chemical parameters to propose a methodology for the determination of the ecological potential in the salterns. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global stressors, such as ocean acidification, constitute a rapidly emerging and significant problem for marine organisms, ecosystem functioning and services. The coastal ecosystems of the Humboldt Current System (HCS) off Chile harbour a broad physical-chemical latitudinal and temporal gradient with considerable patchiness in local oceanographic conditions. This heterogeneity may, in turn, modulate the specific tolerances of organisms to climate stress in species with populations distributed along this environmental gradient. Negative response ratios are observed in species models (mussels, gastropods and planktonic copepods) exposed to changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (p(CO2)) far from the average and extreme P-CO2 levels experienced in their native habitats. This variability in response between populations reveals the potential role of local adaptation and/or adaptive phenotypic plasticity in increasing resilience of species to environmental change. The growing use of standard ocean acidification scenarios and treatment levels in experimental protocols brings with it a danger that inter-population differences are confounded by the varying environmental conditions naturally experienced by different populations. Here, we propose the use of a simple index taking into account the natural p(CO2) variability, for a better interpretation of the potential consequences of ocean acidification on species inhabiting variable coastal ecosystems. Using scenarios that take into account the natural variability will allow understanding of the limits to plasticity across organismal traits, populations and species.

AB  - Restoration of urban streams and rivers has increased rapidly in developing countries in recent years. Estimating river health provides a new perspective on evaluating the ecological conditions of streams and rivers. The Suzhou Creek restoration project in Shanghai, China is a milestone for environmental protection. Based on the environmental and ecological data, including 17 indicators in five categories, collected from March 11 to April 20, 2007, the river health index (RHI) for Suzhou Creek was constructed and analysed to quantify the ecosystem of this urban river after a restoration project. The RHI scores of 34 sites ranged from 19.24 to 33.36, i.e. from poor to good. There were no significant RHI differences among stream orders, while differences in land use resulted in significant differences in channel flow status (B12), channel alteration (B21), channel sinuosity (B22), bank stability (B23), bank profile type (B25) and riparian vegetative zone width (B31). River restoration led to improved hydrological condition and channel physical form, while ammonia nitrogen (B44) and indicator scores of the presence of macro-invertebrate families (B51) were the lowest of any indicator. This case study supports the use of river health assessment as a supplement to water quality analysis in China.

AB  - Developing socioeconomic indicators for ecosystem-based fisheries management is particularly important. This is because socioeconomic factors have direct effects on ecosystems, and ecosystems have direct effects on socioeconomic factors. Therefore, it is imperative that socioeconomic indicators are developed and evaluated in order to predict changes in ecosystems and to provide advice for effective fisheries management. In this study, socioeconomic indicators have been developed to be combined with biological and ecological indicators, in order to conduct the ecosystem-based fisheries assessment. In terms of socioeconomic indicators, five socioeconomic criteria were considered as important attributes of socioeconomic changes. These were economic production, business conditions, levels of income, the state of the market, and levels of employment. In order to establish reference points for the evaluation of indicators, target reference points and limit reference points were set through a comparison with other industries or other fisheries rather than by using the Traffic Light System (TLS) method, which has been used in many previous studies. In addition, on the basis of the application of developed indicators and reference points to the Korean large purse seine fishery, the socioeconomic conditions of the fishery and the usefulness of the indicators were evaluated and management implications were discussed.

AB  - Nitrogen stress plays a critical role in corn yield reduction. Thermal remote sensing has many applications: as an assessment tool for urban heat island, as an ecological indicator of ecosystem development, and as a water-stress-detection tool. In this study, it was hypothesized that corn crops supplied with optimum or high rates of nitrogen would have lower surface temperatures compared to corn grown under nitrogen-stressed conditions. Two experiments were conducted in the greenhouse at the University of Guelph, Canada, from the period between 2015 and 2016, involving three rates of nitrogen (high, medium, and low rates) supplied to corn plants after seed emergence. Leaf and whorl temperatures were collected by using a high-resolution thermal camera, an infrared handheld point measurements gun, and a type T thermocouple, respectively. An approximate difference of 2 degrees C was observed in temperatures between plants receiving high and low rates of nitrogen. These results supported the hypothesis that nitrogen-stressed plants have higher temperatures compared to less stressed plants, at a 0.05 significance level. This study investigated the application of the exergy destruction principle through thermal remote sensing, to detect crop stress at early growth stages under greenhouse conditions, to increase the production and reduce the harmful environmental impact.

AB  - The Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, United States, has demonstrated various symptoms of eutrophication during the past 20 yr. We contributed to an environmental assessment program, through ecological network analysis, a group of algorithms to evaluate networks of material flows within a structured system. Networks of nitrogen (N) cycling for 16 consecutive seasons were constructed based on previous field and laboratory studies. Network analysis provided understanding of the relationship between N loading and recycling, the fates of N and the expected interseasonal variation of both model inputs and outputs. Various indices indicated that recycling of imported N was very high, supporting measured observations. There was little correlation between estimates of loading and N uptake by phytoplankton, although loading of total and particulate N did correlate positively with export. Because of the high degree of recycling of N, the rate of loading of new N is a small fraction of the total processing of N or of the needs for primary production alone. We predict that on a short-term basis the controls on primary production tend to be associated with conditions in the estuary rather than import. This condition is likely to postpone easily observable responses to loading reduction over the entire estuary and in the short term, although improvements in water quality should occur over time.

AB  - Relatively few case studies have been conducted demonstrating the utility of multiple endpoint approaches to sediment quality assessment in areas with moderate contaminant levels and heterogeneous conditions. Because variability is commonplace in natural systems, assessment approaches must be designed explicitly for these conditions. in an assessment of highly heterogeneous freshwater sediments in Lake Champlain, Vermont, USA, we measured multiple endpoints, including physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment, acute and chronic toxicity in three tests (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Chironomus tentans, and Pimephales promelas), and benthic community composition, at 19 sites throughout Inner Burlington Harbor. Multiple regression techniques were used to investigate whether significant relationships existed between biological endpoints and the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediments. Although all three laboratory exposures indicated toxicity at some sites, little correspondence was found among the tests. No changes in the benthic community could be attributed to trace contaminants. Multiple regression was useful in showing associations between contaminants, grain size, toxicity, and benthic community composition. Although not demonstrating causal linkages, these statistical analyses suggested which factors might be important in driving measured responses. In heterogeneous sites, an individualized assessment approach based on a preliminary analysis of variability might provide the most useful information.

AB  - This study calculates a suite of indicators reflecting the spatial extent of fishing and its impact on the seafloor and discusses the usefulness of these indicators to inform future management and the issues to consider. It explores several methods to calculate the indicators and shows that they can be informative to report on both fishing pressure and the status of the seafloor. However, although observed overall trends were robust against the specific method of calculation, the absolute values vary greatly with the calculation method. As both aspects are important from a policy perspective, agreement on the methodology to calculate the indicators is required. This study based on the Dutch Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shows that it is possible to calculate indicators required to inform decision-makers on the pressure of fishing as well as the status of the seafloor pending a decision on the following issues: (i) choice of an appropriate grid cell resolution, (ii) use of interpolated VMS tracks instead of VMS position registrations, (iii) choice of an "intensity threshold" dependent on the benthic community recovery capacity, and (iv) the level of confidence required when assessing if an area is not impacted.

AB  - Sustainable development is a concept, which involves social, ecological and economic objectives, and requires to sustain the integrity of resources exploitation, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development and institutional change. Although there is still much confusion and conflict about exact meaning of sustainable development, many agree that sustainable development is about satisfying social, environmental, and economic goals. While the concept is generally accepted and relatively easy to comprehend, the difficulty arises in trying to apply the principles of sustainable development in practice. One of the difficulties is need to measure the "level of sustainability". The desirable characteristics for sustainability indicators have to include: simple to calculate, useful for decision making, and robust in indicating progress toward sustainability. The exergy analysis approach based on full life cycle assessment (LCA) of the materials and technologies is a useful metrics to evaluate mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with industrial eco materials and technologies. The metrics is used for reducing dimensionality on the input side by combining material and energy streams and output side reducing different characterisation factors to a single "unsustainability" indicator in a theoretically rigorous manner. The adopted approach has been illustrated on a few examples associated with Australian aluminium industry.

AB  - A thorough understanding of long-term temporal social-ecological dynamics at the national scale helps to explain the current condition of a country's ecosystems and to support environmental policies to tackle future sustainability challenges. We aimed to develop a methodological approach to understand past long-term (1960-2010) social-ecological dynamics in Spain. First, we developed a methodical framework that allowed us to explore complex social-ecological dynamics among biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being, drivers of change, and institutional responses. Second, we compiled 21 long-term, national-scale indicators and analyzed their temporal relationships through a redundancy analysis. Third, we used a Bayesian change point analysis to detect evidence of past social-ecological thresholds and historical time periods. Our results revealed that Spain has passed through four social-ecological thresholds that define five different time periods of nature and society relationships. Finally, we discussed how the proposed methodological approach helps to reinterpret national-level ecosystem indicators through a new conceptual lens to develop a more systems-based way of understanding long-term social-ecological patterns and dynamics.

AB  - Intensive agricultural practices have been characterized by an overuse of agrochemicals. The inputs of chemicals in a watershed are likely to alter trophic interactions affecting its ecological integrity. This ecotoxicological study aims to identify warning signals of agrochemicals effects on a plankton community. Eighteen outdoor microcosms were used to establish an experiment with 2 concentrations of copper sulfate above and below the legal limit with six replicates lasting two weeks. Phytoplankton and Zooplankton structure changes were studied. Chlorophyll-a concentration was used as a functional indicator. A rapid change in phytoplankton structural features, abundance and size classes, was detected after both, below and above legal, concentrations. Similarly, Zooplankton structural changes showed an effect of copper exposures on abundance and composition. As Phytoplankton response was so rapid, it could be used as an early and direct warning signal, but also to warn of future indirect effects on zooplankton structural features owing to a change of food resources. In summary, the shifts across both trophic levels could be use as warning signals. Moreover, even legal limits do not protect the plankton community, which emphasises the need of a more ecotoxicological and realistic approach to achieve a balance between agriculture development and ecosystems conservation.

AB  - This work aims to provide insight on the effects of chromium (Cr) uptake in seagrasses at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations; information on this issue can further increase the utility of marine angiosperms as indicators of trace metal contamination. Cr uptake kinetics, effects on physiological and structural cell traits, and the uptake-effects relationship in Halophila stipulacea leaves incubated in 0.01-10 mg L-1 (0.2-200 mu M) of Cr (VI) were examined. An initial uptake was followed by a decrease at 0.01-0.5 mg L-1 (0.2-10 mu M); at higher exposures, the fit of uptake data to a Michaelis-Menten-type equation was significant (p < 0.001). The mean tissue concentration over the exposure period, and the highest tissue concentration attained both increased as exposure concentration (Cw) increased from 0.05 to 10 mg L-1 (1 to 200 mu M); uptake rate generally increased with Cw. Cytotoxic effects occurred even at 0.01 mg L-1 (0.2 mu M). Actin filaments (AFs) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were impacted in a doseand timedependent pattern, while microtubule integrity was not markedly affected even at the highest exposure. AF disruption in differentiating cells initiated at 0.01 mg L-1 (0.2 mu M), while ER disorganization did so at 0.1 mg L-1 (2 mu M); regression equations described the relationships of Cw vs. time required for effect onset, and of Cw vs. AF disturbance progress. Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were detected on the 2d. In addition, a significant reduction in epidermal cell viability appeared at 5-10 or 10 mg L-1 (100-200 or 200 mu M), depending on the leaf age. The lowest tissue concentration associated with effect onset was 31.05 mu g g(-1) dry wt (2d, 5 mg L-1); at lower exposures, higher tissue concentrations did not coincide with impact, implying that the uptake rate rather than the tissue concentration relates to the effect onset. The above suggest that (a) Cr (VI) may pose a high risk to seagrass meadows, (b) H. stipulacea can act as a bioindicator of ambient Cr (VI) bioavailability, mainly at elevated exposure concentrations, (c) AF and ER disturbances in seagrass leaf cells could be considered as sensitive biomarkers of Cr (VI)-induced stress, (d) regression equations describing the relationships Cw vs. time required for effect onset and Cw vs. effect progress increase the utility of AF and ER impairment as biomarkers, and (e) the time frame of the exposure should be considered in the interpretation of tissue residues. Our findings improve the utility of seagrasses as indicators of trace metal contamination and could be utilized in the overall effort for seagrass meadows conservation.

AB  - The DNA-based identification of aquatic insects, which show high species diversity, is becoming increasingly popular because these insects are excellent indicators of the condition of the aquatic environment. Spiny crawler mayflies (Ephemerellidae) are aquatic insects known for their altitudinal stratified distribution patterns and niche partitioning at the microhabitat scale. For these reasons, they are a good bioindicator of the condition of an aquatic ecosystem. Here, we report the results of a study in which we obtained DNA barcoding data on various genotypes of spiny crawler mayfly species collected in various areas. In addition, we discuss the importance of accumulating genetic data collected from a wide area. We conducted molecular analyses of Drunella mayflies based on the mitochondrial DNA COI region and the nuclear DNA H3 region. A total of 101 specimens of 8 spiny crawler mayfly species were collected between 2013 and 2016 from 75 locations of the East Asian region, including the Japanese Archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, and the Russian Far East. We found a total of 86 haplotypes and 57 genotypes of East Asian Drunella mayflies and reinterpreted two cryptic Drunella lineages (Drunella basalis clades I and II and Drunella ishiyamana clades I and II).

AB  - Due to the ever-increasing use of the coastline for industrial purposes, particularly by those activities that take up great amounts of sea water, it is fundamental to understand the composition of the planktonic fauna and its natural spatial and temporal variability in relation to hydrographic variables, in order to understand the potential impact of such undertakings. Totoralillo Norte (similar to 30 degrees S) is an embayment located within a well-known area of recurring upwelling events, as well as a zone with projection for industrial development. Here we performed seasonal surveys (several days sampling within each season) during 2013 and 2014 recognizing an abundant zooplanktonic community with a good representation of the main taxa comprised by at least 166 species. In terms of numbers, copepods dominated the holoplankton (91.7%), whereas meroplankton was mainly composed of larval stages of barnacles, mollusks, decapods, bryozoans and fish. In spite this being a coastal zone normally affected by upwelling events, zooplankton abundance was high throughout the year, even during periods dominated by weak winds and downwelling conditions. Studies such as this can help unveil relevant ecological patterns and their related processes; vital information that must be considered during an environmental impact assessments.

AB  - The Paul do Boquilobo is an important wetland ecosystem classified by Unesco as a MAB Biosphere reserve also awarded Ramsar site status, representing one of the most important habitats for the resident nesting colony of Cattle Egret (Bulbucus ibis). Yet owing to its location, it suffers from human induced impacts which include industrial and domestic effluent discharges as well as agricultural land use which have negatively impacted water quality. The current study reports the results obtained from the introductory monitoring programme of surface water quality in the Nature Reserve to emphasize the detrimental impact of the anthropogenic activities in the water quality of such an important ecosystem. The study involved physicochemical and biotic variables, microbial parameters and biological indicators. Results after 3 years of monitoring bring to evidence a poor water quality further impaired by seasonal patterns. Statistical analysis of data attributed water quality variation to 3 main parameters - pH, dissolved oxygen and nitrates, indicating heavy contamination loads from both organic and agricultural sources. Seasonality plays a role in water flow and climatic conditions, where sampling sites presented variable water quality data, suggesting a depurative function of the wetland. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different national assessment concepts impede the harmonization of river quality classifications using macrophytes in Europe. This study describes a procedure to identify similarities between the national methods for ecological quality assessment of Austria, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, Germany, Great Britain and Poland. Based on an international data set covering three European stream types we identified sites commonly assessed as high status by most methods. A mean index derived from averaging the national assessment results per stream site was then correlated with the abundance of each macrophyte taxon. We defined common macrophyte indicator scores using these correlation coefficients. This enabled the description of type-specific macrophyte communities under near-natural and degraded conditions, and the development of a common metric (mICM) that was correlated with all national methods. The weaker relations of the Flemish and German methods were improved by adjusting national indicator scores of selected macrophyte taxa that deviated from the common indicator scores. The analysis of common high status sites provided mICM reference values. This study offers a general approach to harmonize the national assessment methods for biological elements of any water category.

AB  - There is concern that elevated levels of selenium found in the source water of a newly formed wetland park in Las Vegas, Nevada, may have detrimental effects on local wildlife. In this study, we collected and analyzed water samples monthly for a three year period from the inflow and outflow of the system. We also gathered dominant aquatic plants and selected terrestrial plants and analyzed the water and plant tissues (root, shoot, leaf and flower) for selenium by high resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer. Except for storm events and the introduction of an alternative low selenium content source water during summer low-flow conditions, selenium in the water was relatively stable. The concentration in the outflow tended to be slightly lower than the inflow. Concentrations of selenium in the dominant plant taxa in this wetlands were typical of ecosystems in the western United States and varied by taxa, tissue type, localized conditions (e.g., contact with selenium-laden water), and to a lesser extent, seasons. Selenium in the aquatic plant spiny naiad (Najas marina) was relatively high and may pose an ecological risk to wildlife during the late spring and summer. Additional work is underway investigating aquatic food chain accumulations of selenium as well as mass balance of selenium in the system.

AB  - Understanding the relationship and spatial distribution of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in the context of underlying socio-environmental conditions is an essential element of national ecosystem assessments. Here, we use Germany as an example to present a reproducible blueprint approach for mapping and analysing ecosystem service bundles (ESB) and associated socio-environmental gradients. We synthesized spatial indicators of eleven provisioning, regulating and cultural ES in Germany and used the method of self-organizing maps (SOM) to define and map ESBs. Likewise, we collated data from 18 covariates to delineate socio-environmental clusters (SEC). Finally, we used an overlap analysis to characterise the relationship between the spatial configuration of ESBs and co-occurring SECs. We identified and mapped eight types of ESBs that were characterized to varying degrees by provisioning, cultural and regulating/maintenance services. While ESBs dominated by provisioning ES were linked to regions with distinct environmental characteristics, cultural ESBs were associated with areas where environmental and socio-economic gradients had similar importance. Furthermore, spatial stratification of ESBs indicated hot spots where more detailed analysis is needed within national assessments. Our approach can serve as a blueprint for ESB analysis that can be reproduced in other geographical and environmental settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the increased and widespread usage of benthic indices for environmental health assessment, some methodological ambiguities remain to be solved. We tested the congruence and consistency of the benthic indices ITI, BO2A, BENTIX, AMBI and M-AMBI in a subtropical estuary (Paranagua Bay, Brazil). Indices were applied to non-vegetated tidal flats increasingly contaminated by sewage to test: (i) correlations with molecular biomarkers of sewage (consistency); and (ii) evaluate the overall agreement/similarity of responses (congruence). The responses of the benthic indexes ITI, AMBI and BO2A were congruent among themselves and consistent with molecular biomarkers values. BENTIX and M-AMBI were less consistent and congruent and possibly need a readjustment of boundaries for subtropical habitats. The indices seemed robust to natural background yearly variations not related to contamination. Faecal sterols associated to nutrient contents suitably supported the validation of indices and could integrate reference conditions for sewage impacted coastal habitats. Benthic indices can successfully integrate management guidelines, but their suitable application demands further research on tolerance shifts of key indicator species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Estimating ecosystem-level effects from single species bioassays is a major challenge in environmental risk assessment. Most extrapolation procedures are based on the implicit assumption that species sensitivities are random with regard to their functional traits. Here, we explore how nonrandomness in species sensitivities affects how species-level and ecosystem level effects of chemical exposure correspond. The effect of a correlation between the trait value under control conditions and the sensitivity of the trait to chemical stress is studied for two traits (per capita growth rate and monoculture yield) under constant and temporary exposure. Theoretical model predictions are thereby validated against a 3-week microcosm experiment, in which eight marine diatoms systems with different correlations between trait values and sensitivities were temporary (1 week) or constantly (3 weeks) exposed to two concentrations of the herbicide atrazine (100 and 250 mu g L-1). Negative correlations increased the reduction in ecosystem functioning (productivity) by atrazine for both traits. However, correlations in the per capita growth rate affected productivity only shortly following changes in environmental conditions, whereas correlations in the monoculture yield affected productivity throughout exposure. Correlations between species sensitivities and functional trait values can thus help to identify when ecosystem-level effects are likely to exceed species-level effects.

AB  - The relations between understory vegetation, canopy characteristics and natural regeneration have been studied in natural Scots pine forests growing in sub-Mediterranean conditions in Italy. Multivariate ordination techniques (detrended correspondence analysis, DCA, and detrended canonical correspondence analysis, DCCA) have been applied to extract vegetation gradients. The first four DCA axes accounted for 41% of the total variation in vegetation data and DCA ordination patterns have been interpreted by the variability of forest stands, ranging from pioneer pine communities to closed pine stands mixed with hardwood species. Characteristic indicator values (CIVs), computed by understory species abundance using the ELLENBERG's species scores, have been tentatively used as estimators of. environmental variability. Relating vegetation gradients extracted by DCA to CIVs allowed further interpretation of the multivariate ordination patterns. Geographic and edaphic factors had only a minor effect on plant communities in the present study. The competition exerted in mixed stands by hardwood species seems to be the main limiting factor for Scots pine recruitment in the study area. Multivariate synthetic variable and CIVs were found to predict a large proportion of variation in Scots pine recruitment. The application of CIVs for predicting ecological meaningful conditions and their use as a tool for management decisions is discussed.

AB  - In the process of filling the goaf of Huashugou copper mine, the filling aggregate was the mine's self-produced copper flotation tailings. The physical and chemical property tests showed that the tailings were relatively fine, and the cumulative contents of the 7.5, 15, 80, and 90 mu m particles were 56.99, 79.46, 99.88, and 100%, respectively. PSA42.5 Portland slag cement was selected as the cementing material for the tests. The amount of finely ground blast furnace slag added to the cement was 20-50%. The filling test blocks of all proportions were demolded within 24-36 h, and the integrity of the formed filling bodies was satisfactory. Among them, the uniaxial compressive strength of the test block formed by the filling slurry with a tailings-to-cement ratio of 3/1 and a concentration of 74% after 3, 7, 28, and 60 days reached 0.833, 2.026, 4.520, and 6.560 MPa, respectively. The strengths of the other filling blocks also met the engineering design requirements. Based on the statistical regression analysis method, the influences of the slag cement content chi(1) and the tailings water content chi(2) on the filling body's strength sigma were analyzed. The regression calculation also considered the interaction between chi(1) and chi(2), and the obtained multiple nonlinear regression model successfully predicted sigma. In production and application, the large density of tailings would accelerate their settling, which could easily cause blockage during the transportation of filling slurry through the pipeline. Regarding a series of existing filling materials and technical conditions, the filling process investigated in this study overcomes several unfavorable conditions. Using advanced and reliable technology and an industrial filling pump with a delivery pressure of 10 MPa, the prepared filling slurry concentration was 68-72% and the flow rate was 56-79 m(3)/h. The tailings and PSA42.5 Portland slag cement combined quite well. The filling body in the goaf demonstrated excellent homogeneity, and the various industrial indicators met the technical requirements for mining deposits. The preparation of high-quality filling materials with a smooth filling process has played a positive role in the prevention and treatment of surface mountain cracks and collapse during underground mining in high-altitude areas.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is used to reveal environmental or genetic stress, but the results of some studies are inconsistent. We aimed to give some explanations of possible controversial conclusions, when FA was employed. We measured FA (one dimensional and one meristic traits) in the recognized bioindicators-ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Beetles were sampled in a vast area (four provinces of Russia with the spectrum of the studied sites, which differed in anthropogenic impact, vegetation, and landscape features). On the basis of such measurements (4673 specimen) we created a data base. Subsequent ANOVA showed, that FA was species-specific (out of six species investigated it was expressed in five ones), sex-biased (males had higher levels of FA), and were affected practically by all environmental factors. Besides significant species-sex and factors-sex interactions were found. So, when employing FA as an indicator of stress, overall biological and ecological variation in species-indicator must be investigated before. Sometimes FA (or its absence) may not be due to pollution or another disturbing factor, but be the result of the effect of unaccounted but FA determinative factors.

AB  - In an era of rapid global change, conservation managers urgently need improved tools to track and counter declining ecosystem conditions. This need is particularly acute in the marine realm, where threats are out of sight, inadequately mapped, cumulative, and often poorly understood, thereby generating impacts that are inefficiently managed. Recent advances in macroecology, statistical analysis, and the compilation of global data will play a central role in improving conservation outcomes, provided that global, regional, and local data streams can be integrated to produce locally relevant and interpretable outputs. Progress will be assisted by (a) expanded rollout of systematic surveys that quantify species patterns, including some carried out with help from citizen scientists; (b) coordinated experimental research networks that utilize large-scale manipulations to identify mechanisms underlying these patterns; (c) improved understanding of consequences of threats through the application of recently developed statistical techniques to analyze global species' distributional data and associated environmental and socioeconomic factors; (d) development of reliable ecological indicators for accurate and comprehensible tracking of threats; and (e) improved data-handling and communication tools.

AB  - Aquatic Coleoptera (beetles) play a key role in freshwater ecosystems and are considered as a suitable bioindicator. Despite being widely distributed in China, there are few aquatic Coleoptera-based methods to assess ecological quality and environmental conditions. Changbai Mountain, with its distinct temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, provides an excellent opportunity to explore the influence of environmental features on aquatic beetles along altitude gradients. The objectives of the study were to investigate community structure and to determine the dominant factors controlling aquatic beetles in the montane environment. Study results showed that there were 8 families, 40 genera, and 72 aquatic beetle species on Changbai Mountain, and that Dytiscidae, Hydrophilidae and Haliplidae were the dominant families. Seven sensitive species of aquatic beetles could be considered as the candidate of indicator for environmental monitoring. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that water pH, concentrations of total organic matter and total phosphorus in sediment, water conductivity and water temperature had a significant impact on the community structure of aquatic beetles, and that water pH was the most important factor. Our results suggested that water quality played a key role in species richness of aquatic beetles, and that therefore they could be considered as an indicator organism of freshwater ecosystem health.

AB  - In this study, we present the evaluation of urban land carrying capacity (ULCC) based on an ecological sensitivity analysis. Remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technology are employed to analyze topographic conditions, land-use types, the intensity of urban development, and ecological environmental sensitivity to create reasonable evaluation indicators to analyze urban land carrying capacity based on ecological sensitivity in the rapidly developing megacity of Hangzhou, China. In the study, ecological sensitivity is grouped into four levels: non-sensitive, lightly sensitive, moderately sensitive, and highly sensitive. The results show that the ecological sensitivity increases progressively from the center to the periphery. The results also show that ULCC is determined by ecologically sensitive levels and that the ULCC is categorized into four levels. Even though it is limited by the four levels, the ULCC still has a large margin if compared with the current population numbers. The study suggests that the urban ecological environment will continue to sustain the current population size in the short-term future. However, it is necessary to focus on the protection of distinctive natural landscapes so that decision makers can adjust measures for ecological conditions to carry out the sustainable development of populations, natural resources, and the environment in megacities like Hangzhou, China.

AB  - In 1970 the largest oil refinery in Spain was built on the Muskiz estuary and occupies most of its original surface. An integrated high-resolution microfaunal-geochemical study has revealed the evolution and environmental development of this estuary during the last 120 years, mainly by the identification and assessment of natural processes versus anthropogenic impacts. Benthic foraminifera, trace elements and PAHs data from surface sediment samples and sediment cores from the meagre remaining intertidal. at and marsh areas together with short-life radiometric isotope determinations provide a chronology for environmental changes in this estuary. Concentrations of organic and inorganic pollutant, both in modern and recent materials, are generally low and show no significative variations in space or time, except those associated to sedimentological changes in the core records. Natural processes in the middle estuary indicate the change from previous sandy, normal-salinity conditions to a muddy brackish environment around 1914. Anthropogenic impacts are not related to persistent historical pollution on this estuary but merely to the occupation of the estuary and the elimination of its different original ecosystems, so causing a general impoverishment of its environmental quality.

AB  - Rapid changes are occurring in the natural and socio-cultural environments of the polar regions. A multitude of place-related values and meanings are affected by the current resource exploitation and human development of the Arctic. This poses challenges for management as well as research, particularly in the field of environmental impact assessment. The study explores the concept of sense of place among residents of the Svalbard (Spitsbergen) archipelago in the Norwegian high Arctic Effects of sense of place on perceptions of wilderness, environmental conditions and reactions to potential environmental impacts are analysed to examine whether sense of place can be a useful construct in environmental impact assessments. A typology of Svalbard residents based on the strength of their sense of place was developed. Pew differences were found in perception of environmental conditions among these segments, but sense of place discriminates among types of reactions to environmental impacts. Sense of place is treated as a broad, integrated concept which may be useful for tapping comprehensive views of the environment. Environmental impact assessments often do not capture a sufficient breadth of place meanings. Empirical measures of sense of place could contribute to improved assessments as indicators of salient symbolic and emotional meanings of place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant species may exert a strong influence on soil biological properties, but the linkages between plant and soil responses to severe drought remain unclear. We conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment with five upland grass species and one Mediterranean drought-resistant grass cultivar to investigate the effects of root biomass and rhizosphere conditions on the drought responses of soil microbial biomass in the topsoil. In particular, we assessed whether variation in the drought resistance of microbial biomass could be linked to root biomass, soil inorganic nitrogen (N) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Experimental drought decreased microbial biomass but increased soil inorganic N and DOC across plant species. Root biomass responses to drought were less predictable, and varied depending on species. Microbial biomass resistance to drought showed a negative relationship with the drought resistance of root biomass across species, possibly via changes in rhizodeposition. Moreover, the drought resistance of microbial biomass showed a negative relationship with soil nutrient availability under droughted conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of root biomass as a predictor of soil microbial resistance to drought in grass-dominated systems, and suggest that trade-offs between plant and microbial processes could have significant implications for ecosystem function in a changing environment.

AB  - Since the establishment of Harmonia axyridis in Europe, populations of native ladybirds have decreased. Overwintering survival is one of the aspects of the biology of H. axyridis that may contribute to its firm establishment in and invasion of a new area. In this study winter survival of five wild H. axyridis populations was assessed under natural and semi-natural conditions, with a focus on the potential influence of location and orientation on winter survival.
   Overwintering survival of H. axyridis in the Netherlands is high: 70.8-88.2%. When overwintering at one central site, populations sampled at five locations showed statistically significant different mortality rates. Furthermore, winter survival of H. axyridis at the sample sites was higher when beetles were hibernating at the southwestern sides of buildings, where most aggregations of ladybirds were found. Survival was higher at sheltered sites compared to exposed sites.
   Harmonia axyridis has a comparable or higher overwintering survival than most common native ladybird species. A high overwintering survival results in a large post-hibernation population in spring, leading to a rapid population build-up. Thus, the high winter survival probably contributes to the success of the exotic H. axyridis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction of dams and operation of reservoirs have a significant impact on the interruption of aquatic and riparian ecological systems, by altering natural stream flows in river courses. Recently, the ecological requirements are included as an additional objective in reservoir operation in order to restore the natural stream flows and reduce the negative impacts of reservoir operations on ecosystems that rely on the natural flows. The key challenge involving ecological requirements is to balance the ecological and economic objectives by operation rules, on the basis of quantitatively identifying the objective of ecological flows required to maintain the natural flow regime for ecosystem. This study develops a piecewise-linear multi-objective hedging rule (PMHR) for reservoir operations, with ecologic flow objectives represented by 33 hydrologic parameters from the indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). Variables of the PMHR are obtained through optimization using a vector evaluated genetic algorithm. The results show that the PMHR improves the ecological water releases without reducing economic water supplies in the case river in the context of hydrological uncertainty. It can offer technological references for improving the utility of water resource management under competitive conditions of water resources.

AB  - The Mondego estuary (Portugal) has been under environmental pressure since the early 1990s due to different anthropogenic stresses. The system has been studied following benthic communities' features from an impacted situation until the recovery phase, focusing mostly on macrobenthos. Following the application of mitigation measures in the estuary, this study is focused on the variability of the intertidal meiobenthic and nematode communities in a system that has recovered after different anthropogenic stresses. While at the spatial level (among areas along the eutrophication gradient) no significant differences were observed regarding the structure and function of the nematode communities, at the seasonal level some differences stood out. These results broadly suggest that the system has recovered from the early situations of pressures being, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to investigate the variability of intertidal meiobenthic and nematode communities in the scope of a system's recovery along an estuarine gradient of eutrophication. Even if performed in a short timeline, this study provides a good baseline analysis of conditions, being important for future comparisons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grassland ecosystem is one of the largest ecosystems, which naturally occurs on all continents excluding Antarctica and provides both ecological and economic functions. The deterioration of natural grassland has been attracting many grassland researchers to monitor the grassland condition and dynamics for decades. Remote sensing techniques, which are advanced in dealing with the scale constraints of ecological research and provide temporal information, become a powerful approach of grassland ecosystem monitoring. So far, grassland health monitoring studies have mostly focused on different areas, for example, productivity evaluation, classification, vegetation dynamics, livestock carrying capacity, grazing intensity, natural disaster detecting, fire, climate change, coverage assessment and soil erosion. However, the grassland ecosystem is a complex system which is formed by soil, vegetation, wildlife and atmosphere. Thus, it is time to consider the grassland ecosystem as an entity synthetically and establish an integrated grassland health monitoring system to combine different aspects of the complex grassland ecosystem. In this review, current grassland health monitoring methods, including rangeland health assessment, ecosystem health assessment and grassland monitoring by remote sensing from different aspects, are discussed along with the future directions of grassland health assessment.

AB  - The European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, was introduced into Japan from Europe in 1991 for pollination of tomato plants. Many ecologists had warned of biological invasion by this species, and in 1996 a naturalized colony was found in Hokkaido, indicating that the species had become naturalized. The Ministry of the Environment effected a new law, the Invasive Alien Species Act, in 2005 to protect Japanese native fauna and flora from invasive alien species. Heated arguments arose between conservation ecologists and agriculturalists about whether the law should regulate B. terrestris. To reach a scientific decision, we began a study to reveal the ecological impacts of B. terrestris and to develop methods to control its naturalization. On the basis of our results, the Ministry of the Environment classified B. terrestris as invasive and requiring regulation by law, but its use would be permitted on the condition that it be used only for agriculture and that measures to prevent escape be taken. This legal control of B. terrestris in Japan is a revolutionary trial that aims to achieve a state of mutualism between biodiversity and agriculture.

AB  - Marine organisms are vulnerable to harsh environment where fluctuation in physicochemical conditions including salinity and tides are common. These organisms over the period have evolved different mechanisms to maintain the physiological conditions of the body through metabolic activities. In the present work, we studied accumulation of about 10 heavy metals in about 20 marine organisms from the Gulf of Mannar, Southeast coast of India and also explored the passable relationship between distribution of these inorganic metals and biochemical response of these organisms. The effect on the accumulation of metals over the metabolism in the marine animals was evaluated by the level of antioxidant response. Concentration of metal in the body tissues was analyzed using ICP-AES. Interestingly, it was also observed that genotoxic potential pollutants were less or negligible in the selected sites. Tail DNA in the muscle cells was observed to be <5%. Our study concludes that fishes from the two areas are not heavily burdened with metals, but pollutants should be monitored periodically to avoid excessive intake of trace metals by humans due to bioaccumulation. The work concludes that a multiparameter analysis should be followed to study the ecological status of the aquatic environment.

AB  - In order to document long-term climate cycles and predict future climate trends for the Arctic, geological records archived in ocean sediments can help establish the link between historical and pre-historical sea-surface parameters. Dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) are used as proxy indicators of sea-surface parameters (temperature, salinity, sea-ice cover, primary productivity) jointly with transfer functions and a modern dinocyst reference database, to reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface conditions at decadal and millennial timescales. Here we present the surface distribution of recent dinocyst assemblages in 13 surface samples collected in four Nunatsiavut fjords (northern Labrador, Canada) along a latitudinal gradient, and their relationship with various environmental and biological parameters. Dinocyst concentrations in surface sediments increased from the inner to the outer part of each fjord and also from the northernmost to the southernmost fjords. There was also a southward increase in the species diversity with an occurrence and a dominance of cysts from autotrophic dinoflagellates. The presence of cysts of the calcareous dinoflagellate species Scrippsiella cf. S. crystallina in Anaktalak Fjord, where mining activities are underway, appears to be an indicator of human-related pollution within the fjord. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Samples of agricultural soils were collected across North Carolina in 1992 and Nebraska in 1993 to determine which indices of nematode communities could be applied to distinguish ecological pattern at regional geographic scales. Sampling density was proportional to the area of agriculture in each region of each state. Maturity indices (based on life-history characteristics) were calculated to determine the successional status of nematode communities, and diversity indices were calculated to estimate relative abundance of nematode trophic groups. Population densities of nematode families were also compared between states and among regions within states. The range of maturity-index values for free-living and plant-parasitic nematodes was greater for soils in North Carolina than in Nebraska. The relative distribution of nematode trophic groups (bacterial feeders, fungal feeders, plant parasites, omnivores, and predators) was similar in the two states. Significant differences in maturity-index values for free-living and plant-parasitic nematodes were found between but not within states. We conclude that regional or national assessments of soil ecological condition based on measures of nematode community structure can be made at a geographic resolution of 125 000-200 000 km(2) of land area.

AB  - Although covering less than 1% of the land surface, extraction activities have long-lasting impacts on local ecosystems, inevitably damaging biological diversity and depleting ecosystem services. Many extractive companies are now aware of their impacts and, while pressured by society, demand concrete solutions from researchers to reverse the effects of exploitation and restore biodiversity and ecosystems services. In this article, we compile and synthesize the contributions of the latest available research on quarry restoration. We depict and discuss some of the most pressing issues regarding (1) the challenges of restoring quarries; (2) the opportunities for biodiversity and ecosystem services delivery; and (3) outline further research addressing current gaps. We conclude that quarries pose different abiotic and biotic constraints that act interdependently, hampering the attainment of effective restoration if considered solely. Such constraints need to be addressed holistically to lastly encourage the self-sustainability of the system by reinstating ecological processes. However, a restored site does not have to specifically mimic the pristine situation, as under certain conditions alternative approaches may uphold valuable natural assets contributing to the conservation of rare, restricted, or protected species and habitats.

AB  - Anthropogenically-forced changes in ocean chemistry at both the global and regional scale have the potential to negatively impact calcifying plankton, which play a key role in ecosystem functioning and marine carbon cycling. We cultured a globally important calcifying marine plankter (the foraminifer, Globigerina bulloides) under an ecologically relevant range of seawater pH (7.5 to 8.3 total scale). Multiple metrics of calcification and physiological performance varied with pH. At pH > 8.0, increased calcification occurred without a concomitant rise in respiration rates. However, as pH declined from 8.0 to 7.5, calcification and oxygen consumption both decreased, suggesting a reduced ability to precipitate shell material accompanied by metabolic depression. Repair of spines, important for both buoyancy and feeding, was also reduced at pH < 7.7. The dependence of calcification, respiration, and spine repair on seawater pH suggests that foraminifera will likely be challenged by future ocean conditions. Furthermore, the nature of these effects has the potential to actuate changes in vertical transport of organic and inorganic carbon, perturbing feedbacks to regional and global marine carbon cycling. The biological impacts of seawater pH have additional, important implications for the use of foraminifera as paleoceanographic indicators.

AB  - Urban growth alters environmental conditions with major consequences for climate regulation and the exposure of population to heat. Nature-based solutions may be used to alleviate the increasing urban climate pressures, but the climate regulation services that these solutions can supply for and across different urban conditions remains understudied. We comparatively investigate the urban ecosystem service realization (considering the ecosystem service supply and demand spatial interactions) of local climate regulation by vegetated (green) and water-covered (blue) areas across 660 European cities. Results show relatively robust power-law relationships with city population density (average R-2 of 0.34) of main indicators of ecosystem service realization. Country-wise fitting for city-average indicators strengthens these relationships, in particular for western European cities (average R-2 of 0.66). Cross-city results also show strong power-law relationship of effectiveness in ecosystem service realization with socio-economic measures like Human Development Index and GPD per capita, in particular for the area fraction of city parts with high ecosystem service realization (R-2 of 0.77). The quantified relationships are useful for comparative understanding of differences in ecosystem services realization between cities and city parts, and quantitative projection of possible change trends under different types of city growth so that relevant measures can be taken to counteract undesirable trends.

AB  - To examine the suitability of benthic foraminifera and their test deformations as bioindicators of pollution in coastal marine environments, we studied foraminifera and metal concentrations in 72 marine sediment samples, collected from the inner shelf along the Sicilian coast (Gulfs of Palermo and Termini) and on the south-eastern coast of Lampedusa Island. These areas are characterised by different environmental conditions. On the basis of pollution sources and foraminiferal assemblages, we recognised different zones in the Gulf of Palermo. The most polluted zones showed high metal concentrations, and low diversity of benthic foraminifera with species typical of stressed environments. By contrast, the lowest polluted zones showed a high population density and the highest percentages of epiphytes. Epiphytes were abundant where a Posidonia oceanica meadow was present and decreased in the most polluted zones. Sediments of the Gulf of Termini and Lampedusa exhibited high percentages of benthic foraminifera typical of well-oxygenated waters and low concentrations of metals, with the exception of sites located near sewage outfalls and harbour areas. Furthermore, even though deformed tests are commonly known in natural stressed environmental conditions, this study shows that in the most polluted zones, benthic foraminifera were characterised by the highest percentages of deformed individuals.

AB  - 1. Geographically distinct host populations often experience very different ecological conditions. These variable ecological conditions impact the strength of selection that these hosts experience from their parasites.
   2. Numerous studies have characterized geographical patterns of resistance to infection among natural populations in the context of host-parasite local adaptation, but what other factors might contribute to these differences?
   3. Here, we determined whether 20 naturally isolated populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected along the East Coast of the United States varied for survival after being inoculated with one of two species of bacteria - Lactococcus lactis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We then asked whether host environment accounted for the observed patterns of resistance.
   4. Resistance to both types of infection varied spatially. The hosts' natural environment was predictive of the observed spatial variation in resistance to L. lactis, but not P. aeruginosa, infection. Specifically, hosts exposed to species-rich bacterial communities were more likely to survive the infection.
   5. We conclude that biotic characteristics of the host environment, specifically the number of species of bacteria hosts encounter, shape host resistance to bacterial infection in nature. We discuss our results in the context of what is known about the evolutionary ecology of resistance in invertebrate systems.

AB  - Declining fish health and the occurrence of large fish kills are some of the more publicly meaningful indicators of water quality in the impaired Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina. It is generally believed that such problems are caused by the widespread depletion of dissolved oxygen-an indirect result of anthropogenic nutrient pollution. However, the development of scientific simulation models to predict how improvements in oxygen conditions will improve the health of fish and reduce the frequency of fish kills has proven elusive. As a pragmatic solution to this problem, the expert opinion of estuarine fisheries scientists in possession of relevant data and experience was elicited. The relations between joint and conditional probabilities were exploited to translate quantities that are normally hard to assess into quantities that can be drawn more directly from the experiential knowledge of the experts. A combined model of expert opinion was constructed as an influence diagram, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate predictions of fish health and fish kills in the Neuse River Estuary under current and improved oxygen conditions. Full model results are expressed as probability distributions, capturing the effects of natural variability and knowledge uncertainty-both contributors to total ecological risk.

AB  - Associating a deconstructive approach with metacommunity ecology brings insights into how biological communities are structured. We examined the effects of dispersal, habitat conditions, and grazing pressure on ecological guilds (i.e., deconstructed entire communities by guilds) of freshwater microalgae. The combination of focus on efficient passive dispersers, an extensive sampling survey, large numbers of abiotic explanatory variables, information on grazing pressure, and characteristics (i.e., high connectivity and areal extent) of the study area enabled us to model roles of various metacommunity processes for guild structure and diversity within guilds. We found that water chemistry, physical habitat, and spatial variables all accounted for rather small amounts of variation in the guild structures. Diversity within each guild generally showed clear spatial patterns independent of local environmental conditions. Wave action and slope of the study sites also affected diversity. Grazing had clear effects on some aspects of diversity. Importantly, the guilds showed significant spatial patterns, suggesting that mass effects occurred at different intensities in our highly-connected study system. The intensity of dispersal was partly related to different dispersal potentials among the guilds. Different traits associated with ecological guilds may hence be associated with dispersal processes detected in systems with high connectivity among sites.

AB  - This article assesses the environmental sustainability of cultivation systems in three selected communal wetlands in Zimbabwe using the WET-Health framework developed by Macfarlane et al. (2008). This research was motivated by the desire to provide baseline information critical for effective and robust wetland policy development, as monitoring of wetland ecological conditions is relatively poor despite high community dependence on them. The WET-Health framework is based on indicator and impact scores of (1) extent, (2) intensity, and (3) magnitude of impact of different land-use types on wetlands. Our results show that wetland degradation is caused principally by land-use activities in the wetland instead of those in the upstream catchment. The tillage system of broad ridges and broad furrows (BR/BF) caused wetland drying due to drainage and alteration of vegetation community structure and composition. However, BR/BF is effective in erosion control. It is therefore argued that, in general, the BR/BF tillage system does not contribute to sustainable wetland use as it disrupts the ecosystem's hydrological functioning. Given the inherent subjectivity of the WET-Health method results, this study has shown that integration of spatial mapping techniques, such as high-resolution remotely sensed data, improves the quality of ecological assessment.

AB  - Healthy soils are essential for sustainable agricultural development and soil health requires careful assessment with increasing societal concern over environmentally friendly agricultural development. Soil health is the capacity of soil to function within ecological boundaries to sustain productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and animal health. Physical, chemical and biological indicators are used to evaluate soil health; the biological indicators include microbes, protozoa and metazoa. Nematodes are the most abundant metazoa and they vary in their sensitivity to pollutants and environmental disturbance. Soil nematode communities are useful biological indicators of soil health, with community characteristics such as abundance, diversity, community structure and metabolic footprint all closely correlated with the soil environment. The community size, complexity and structure reflect the condition of the soil. Both free-living and plant-parasitic nematodes are effective ecological indicators, contributing to nutrient cycling and having important roles as primary, secondary and tertiary consumers in food webs. Tillage inversion, cropping patterns and nutrient management may have strong effects on soil nematodes, with changes in soil nematode communities reflecting soil disturbance. Some free-living nematodes serve as biological models to test soil condition in the laboratory and because of these advantages soil nematodes are increasingly being used as biological indicators of soil health.

AB  - Recreational fishing activity has recovered in the Nerbioi estuary (Northern Spain), after water sanitation and environmental improvement. Recreational fishing is important for the local population; therefore, future management measures that could cause changes in the estuary should also consider the impacts on recreational fishing. Our objective was to analyze the effects that future management decisions and unexpected environmental changes, alone or in combination with climate change effects, can produce in recreational fishing in Nerbioi, The current recreational fishing activity was modelled using a System Dynamics Modelling (SDM). Based on those results, seven future scenarios were simulated. Results suggested that the adoption of future management measures to improve the environmental conditions could lead to additional positive changes for recreational fishing, as after water quality improvement, fish stocks will continue to recover, and these better conditions could attract more fishers and increase their satisfaction. Simulation of temporary and unexpected environmental changes resulted in quick estuarine recovery, without dramatic consequences for recreational fishing. In conclusion, analysing future scenarios on cultural ecosystem services such as recreational fishing, using SDM, can produce valuable information for decision making processes, facilitating the selection between environmental management alternatives.

AB  - Over the last three decades, significant investments made to upgrade wastewater infrastructure and manage pollution from diffuse sources have resulted in measurably improved water quality and biological conditions in Ohio's rivers and streams. Conservation measures to reduce soil loss appear to have contributed significantly to the improvement witnessed over the last two decades and should therefore be continued. Within the most recent timeframe examined, little difference was found in either total phosphorus or suspended sediment concentration in relation to conservation measures, indicating that the environmental benefits of measures targeting soil loss may be approaching an asymptote. Conservation measures targeting livestock and forage management, however, appear to have reduced nitrogen concentrations within the recent time frame. An examination of the interrelationships between habitat quality, conservation measures, and land use indicated that water quality was generally mediated by interactions with stream habitat quality. However, the positive effect of habitat quality was reduced in catchments draining fine-textured soils. The implication of these latter two findings suggest that proscriptively adding natural function to the large network of ditched and maintained conveyances draining agricultural lands would substantially improve water quality, but management at the field level is necessary to minimize phosphorus losses.

AB  - In the Yellow-legged Gull Larus cachinnans , males are the larger sex, and show more reproductive variance than females. We predicted that the proportion of male chicks in a brood should increase with female body condition. We investigated brood sex ratio by using DNA markers taken from samples of hatchlings or dead embryos, and female body condition using plasma cholesterol concentration as a reliable indicator. The brood sex ratio of females in good condition was male biased and the sex ratio of females in poor condition was female biased. This relationship was also significant in those nests where all the eggs laid were sexed. Thus, manipulation of embryo mortality cannot explain the biases reported in this study, suggesting that the sex ratio of the eggs was biased prior to laying. These results confirm that sex-ratio manipulation in gulls operates under natural conditions, and supports earlier experimental findings.

T2  - BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY
LA  - English
AB  - The Water Framework Directive is the most important piece of European water legislation to date. It arose front the need to consolidate water policy and to integrate water-resources management, recognising the interrelationships between water quality and quantity, ground-water and surface water, an aquatic ecosystem approach and catchment-based management. The natural drainage-management Units used are called river basin districts (RBDs). Eight RBDs have been established on the island of Ireland, including three international districts. The status of waters is assessed by comparison to undisturbed reference conditions. A range of aquatic biological quality elements are assessed. The directive aims to maintain 'high Status' where it exists, to prevent any deterioration in the existing status of waters and to achieve at least 'good status' in relation to all waters by 2015. The roles of various public authorities in implementing the directive in Ireland and the mechanisms for North-South coordination in relation to international districts are outlined in this paper. The importance of public consultation in the planning process is also described. The success of implementation to date is charted through a series of deliverables, and a brief outline of impending tasks is included. I-lie role of strategic environmental assessment of river basin management plans is Outlined, and progress to date is described.

AB  - This study, the first such attempt in Turkey, aimed to investigate the distribution of diatom species related to the variation of total phosphorus (TP) in eight basins to determine trophic weight and indicator values of diatom species and to develop the Trophic Index-Turkey (TIT) for assessing the ecological status of freshwaters. The distribution of the diatom species in 225 running water bodies from 8 basins of Turkey was determined in 2014 (summer and fall) and 2015 (spring and summer) in association with TP variation. Trophic values for 219 species were determined during this study and many of these are presented for the first time. Optima and tolerance TP values were calculated for each species in the different aquatic ecosystems using weighted average regression. Diatom species such as Clevamphora ovalis, Caloneis amphisbaena, Gyrosigma acuminatum, Navicula tripunctata, and Nitzschia umbonata showed high trophic weight values, while Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cymbella excisa, Didymosphenia geminata, Hannaea arcus, and Meridion circulare had low trophic weight values. These findings provide supplementary information about the biotic integrity of the water bodies and could be used to develop the TIT for the bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems, especially running water bodies.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development from 1980 to the present has evolved into definitions of the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental). The recent economic and financial crisis has helped to newly define economic sustainability. It has brought into focus the economic pillar and cast a question mark over the sustainability of development based on economic progress. This means fully addressing the economic issues on their own merits with no apparent connection to the environmental aspects. Environmental sustainability is correctly defined by focusing on its biogeophysical aspects. This means maintaining or improving the integrity of the Earth's life supporting systems. The concept of sustainable development and its three pillars has evolved from a rather vague and mostly qualitative notion to more precise specifications defined many times over in quantitative terms. Hence the need for a wide array of indicators is very clear. The paper analyses the different approaches and types of indicators developed which are used for the assessment of environmental sustainability. One important aspect here is setting targets and then "measuring" the distance to a target to get the appropriate information on the current state or trend. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Landscape can be defined as a complex of human and natural interactions through time. Therefore, landscape identification requires a complete understanding of social, natural, economic, aesthetic and cultural values. Contributing to the aesthetic-visual integrity of the landscape, plants are a valuable indicator, recording the type and degree of the human-nature relationship over time. Our feelings, imagination and perception often contribute to the cultural dimension of the landscape and the role of plants in mythology can be used as a kind of linguistic code for helping to understand some aspects of cultural landscapes. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how a number of key plants were perceived in ancient cultures using some examples from the Mediterranean landscape and to use them to help to evaluate different dimensions of archaeological landscapes using the case of the ancient city of Side in Turkey. Multi-dimensional approaches in landscape evaluation which use symbolic meaning can generate valuable knowledge about cultural landscapes. This is precisely because cultural landscapes are the sum of biological, physical and cultural components, while plants as natural elements have bridged the biological and cultural dimensions.

AB  - Morphotypes for 67 lakes in the German lowlands were derived, based on maximum depth and mixis type. A threshold of 11 m maximum depth was identified to be the best level to discriminate shallow from deep lake morphotypes. The fish communities in these two morphotypes were significantly different. Indicator species analyses based on fish biomasses found vendace Coregonus albula in deep lakes and ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus, bream Abramis brama, white bream Abramis bjoerkna, roach Rutilus rutilus, pikeperch Sander lucioperca and small perch Perca fluviatilis in shallow lakes to be the most representative species of their communities. Lake productivity was closely related to biomass and in part abundance of the type-indicator species, with vendace declining with increasing chlorophyll a concentration in the deep lakes, whereas biomass of pikeperch, bream, white bream and ruffe increased and biomass of small perch decreased with increasing chlorophyll a. These results indicate that assessment of ecological integrity of lakes by their fish fauna is generally possible, if lakes are initially separated according to a depth-related morphotype before the assessment, and if eutrophication is considered to be the main anthropogenic degradation.

AB  - Constructed waters (e.g. dams and retired quarries) are commonly found to have a different zooplankton composition than are natural waters, and to be more readily invaded by non-indigenous species. Constructed ponds are common on farmland, but zooplankton research in these areas is scarce. Consequently, our aims were to (1) compare zooplankton communities between natural ponds and dams in rural environments and, (2) examine environmental determinants of zooplankton community composition among rural ponds. Thirty-eight ponds on farmland in New Zealand were sampled for zooplankton in winter-spring 2018 and summer 2019. All ponds were eutrophic, and zooplankton taxa typical of such conditions were common in both pond types (e.g.Brachionus,KeratellaandPolyarthraspecies). Zooplankton community composition differed statistically between each type, although we deemed this difference to be ecologically insignificant (one-way ANOSIM,r = 0.09,P = 0.014). Prevalence of non-indigenous species was low, with 7% of farm dams and 2% of natural ponds being invaded, indicating that farm ponds are not acting as 'stepping-stones' for invaders across landscapes. Macrophyte abundance and concentration of humic substances were the dominant environmental variables measured determining zooplankton distribution among ponds.

AB  - Unexpected observation of freshwater invertebrate Daphnia magna in temporary rock pools on a small island off the Norwegian Atlantic coast confirms colonising ability, mediated through avian dispersal. Robust diapausal eggs of D. magna pass the gut of migrating geese and subsequently hatch in environments where such waterfowl forage and rest along migrating routes. The incubation experiment demonstrates that decomposing fecalia of geese constitute sufficient feed to support developing populations of D. magna in experimental oligotrophic conditions. The findings also show that D. magna is highly adapted for colonisation of temporary pools north of the Arctic Polar Circle, with excellent tolerance to low temperatures. Discussion part I relates the findings to published evidence on avian transport of invertebrate propagules, such as correlations between migration patterns of waterfowl and geographical patterns of aquatic invertebrate diversity. Discussion part II reflects on academic cultures, epistemological aspects of natural history reporting, the presence of a whale cadaver as an ecological indicator and the relevance of simple observation as a starting point for further discourse.

AB  - Rangeland management in arid and semi-arid regions requires comprehensive attention to ecological processes and consider the interrelationship of those processes. Considering discard the theory of climax and rangeland succession model in recent years especially in arid regions and shrub lands, the new theory known as the state and transition model is taken into consideration by natural sciences and environmental specialistsb in the world. In present study, state and transition model and its application in rangeland management will be discussed and wil be peresented a case study of Iran for more description. As a case study, Nir rangelands of Yazd province will be introduced. In this rangeland, both status of enclose and grazing livestock evaluated and grazing livestock has been introduced as threshold of these two conditions. Rangelands of arid regions are biologically fragile and in the case of little degradation, a long time will be needed for compensation. The definition of different situations, thresholds, transitions and indicators will help managers to follow change trend among different plant communities and establish an ideal community. But due to very slow and very small changes in arid regions rangelands, use of models in these areas is not possible.

AB  - The National Park Service and the National Biological Service initiated research in Denali National Park and Preserve, a 2.4 million-hectare park in southcentral Alaska, to develop ecological monitoring protocols for national parks in the Arctic/Subarctic biogeographic area. We are focusing pilot studies on design questions, on scaling issues and regionalization, ecosystem structure and function, indicator selection and evaluation, and monitoring technologies. Rock Creek, a headwater stream near Denali headquarters, is the ecological scale for initial testing of a watershed ecosystem approach. Our conceptual model embraces principles of the hydrological cycle, hypotheses of global climate change, and biological interactions of organisms occupying intermediate, but poorly studied, positions in Alaskan food webs. The field approach includes hydrological and depositional considerations and a suite of integrated measures linking key aquatic and terrestrial biota, environmental variables, or defined ecological processes, in order to establish ecological conditions and detect, track, and understand mechanisms of environmental change. Our sampling activities include corresponding measures of physical, chemical, and biological attributes in four Rock Creek habitats believed characteristic of the greater system diversity of Denali. This paper gives examples of data sets, program integration and scaling, and research needs.

AB  - Multiyear data collected in Lithuanian lakes (Europe ecoregion 15) using standardized methods formed the basis for an analysis to determine interrelations between lake fish community composition and environmental variables. Mean and maximum depths have significant impact on fish community structure in Lithuanian lakes, therefore lakes were classified into polymictic, stratified and deep stratified. The relative abundance of stenothermic fishes such as vendace (Coregonus albula) and burbot (Lota lotd) was found to correlate positively with lake depth, while tench (Tinca tinca), rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus) and bream (Abramis brama) correlated negatively. Nutrient concentration in lakes positively correlated with roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bream abundance and negatively with abundance of perch (Perca fluviatilis). In different types of lakes only seven non-redundant candidate fish metrics showed a significant correlation with variables describing human pressure. Those metrics were used to develop fish-based method for the assessment of the ecological status of lakes - the Lithuanianlake fish index LEZI (Lietuvos Ezeru Zuvu Indeksas). In all types of lakes, LEZI values most significantly correlate with the concentration of chlorophyll a and Secchi depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) refers to the ability of a water ecosystem to support and withstand economic and social development. WECC assessments can provide helpful information for resolving water issues. Since WECC involves a wide range of influence factors, indicator-based methods are useful tools for this type of evaluation. However, there are still some imperfections in the existing indicator-based methods for WECC evaluation, primarily in the aspects of index frameworks, indicator selection and evaluation criteria. Based on the pressure-support force-state index framework, this paper presents an indicator-based WECC evaluation method (PSSM). Using PSSM, overall WECC evaluation can be obtained by assessing the pressure of socio-economic development on the water ecosystem, the support from the water ecosystem for human development, and the health status of the water ecosystem. PSSM is directly focused on the pressure-support effect, and fully considers the determinant influence on WECC of the health status of the water ecosystem. The application of PSSM in Tieling City shows that further reduction in the pressure that comes from socio-economic development is still required, and the health status of the water ecosystem should be further improved.

AB  - The major aim of the present study is to identify the relationship of physiological parameters of the photosynthetic system with the elemental content of the naturally growing lichen Pyxine cocoes. The epiphytic foliose lichen P. cocoes was used as biomonitoring indicator and effect of atmospheric pollutants on physiological integrity was examined. Potential quantum yield of Photosystem II (fluorescence ratio Fv/Fm), chlorophyll degradation ratio and quantitative estimation of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Fe and Zn contained in the lichen thallus were ascertained. Statistical analysis revealed significantly positive correlations between Fv/Fm and element contents (Al and Cr). The chlorophyll degradation as well as alteration in the pigment content was found to be the most sensitive parameters to assess the vitality of lichen thallus against polluted environment. The species accumulated higher amounts of elements (Al, As, Cu, Fe and Zn) in the polluted sites as compared to the non polluted sites. It was also evident from this study that vehicular emission played a significant role in the release of elements as pollutants in the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of this lichen could be further investigated by comparing this species with other biomonitors.

AB  - Worldwide concern over threats to natural resources and public hearth has led to increased efforts to monitor and assess environmental conditions. This has stimulated the need for development and application of select biological and ecological measurements, or indicators, that are responsive to environmental stress. Measures of bivalve mollusc defence activities, such as haemocyte density, phagocytic activity, locomotion and production of cytotoxic molecules; and haemolymph constituents, such as agglutinins and lysozyme, have potential as indicators and appear to be responsive to xenobiotic chemical insults in the aquatic environment. However, basic research on the relevance of these measurements in inferring resistance to disease or enhanced survival is currently insufficient, reducing their value as potential biomarkers to address environmental objectives. In addition, variation in defence activities caused by seasonal temperature and reproductive cycling, salinity changes, nutritional status, diseases and parasites, and genetic stocks is high and may limit applicability of bivalve defence-related measurements as indicators. This review examines these sources of variability and their possible implications for interpreting changes in bivalve defence activity as an indicator of stress. Examples of contaminant-induced changes in bivalve defence functions are described.

AB  - The paper describes a method and software package for desktop assessment of environmental flows -a hydrological regime designed to maintain a river in some agreed ecological condition. The method uses monthly flow data and is built around a flow duration curve, which ensures that elements of natural flow variability are preserved in the estimated environmental flow time series. The curve is calculated for several categories of aquatic ecosystem protection -from 'largely natural' to 'severely modified'. The corresponding environmental flows progressively reduce with the decreasing level of ecosystem protection. A non-linear data transformation procedure subsequently converts the calculated environmental flow duration curve into a continuous time series of environmental flows. The software has facilities to zoom on a river basin, calculate a variety of hydrological characteristics, define or select any category of ecosystem protection, calculate the associated environmental flow duration curves and time series and display both. The analyses can be carried out either using default (simulated) global flow data, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, or a user-defined file. The package is seen as a training tool for water practitioners, policymakers and students, and as a tool for rapid preliminary environmental flow assessment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Breeding performance of seabirds reflects conditions in the marine environment, and seabirds are often considered suitable indicators because they are sensitive to variations in food supply and relatively easy to observe. However, any individual parameter (e.g. breeding success of a particular species at one site) may also be affected by drivers other than food supply, and selecting a suitable univariate indicator can be difficult, particularly if independent estimates of food availability on the appropriate scale are unavailable. We propose combining several data sets to overcome this limitation: if a given temporal pattern occurs for several parameters measured at one site, or for the same parameter measured at several sites, it is likely to reflect important spatiotemporal environmental variation, probably linked to food supply. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can be used to extract common signals from a number of intercorrelated time series. Examples from seabirds in the North Sea demonstrate that such common signals are correlated with physical and biological environmental variables. We propose a preliminary 'North Sea seabird index' and discuss how this index could be used in ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Transgenic rice expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) endotoxins (Bt rice) for pest control is considered an important solution to food security in China. However, tests for potential effects on non-target soil organisms are required for environmental risk assessment. The soil collembolan Folsomia candida L. (Collembola: Isotomidae) is a potential non-target arthropod that is often used as a biological indicator in bio-safety assessments of transgenic crops. In the present study, the roots, stems, and leaves of Bt rice were exposed to F. candida under laboratory conditions, with survival, reproduction and growth of the collembolan as ecological fitness parameters. Significant differences in ecological fitness were found among the different treatments, including differences in the plant parts and varieties of non-Bt rice, presumably as the result of three factors: gene modification, plant parts and rice varieties. The fitness of F. candida was less affected by the different diets than by the exposure to the same materials mixed with soil. Our results clearly showed that there was no negative effect of different Bt rice varieties on the fitness of F. candida through either diet or soil exposure.

AB  - Methodologies based on physiological responses and biological community structure, such as the Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) proposed by Blank et al 1988, are required to characterise ecosystem health. The PICT concept is based on the assumption that, when applied at a sufficient concentration for an adequate duration, a toxicant exerts a selection pressure towards a more tolerant community. Assessment of structural and physiological parameters, the latter obtained by exposing a community to increasing amounts ot toxicant, not only demonstrates the effects of exposure, but also allows comparison of the level of toxicant contamination between various sites from which algal communities have been collected. Classical approaches, microscopy and incorporation of C-14, have already been applied to microalgal cummunities in complex experimental systems and in the field. However, environmental conditions may be expected to influence community selection by the toxicant and may hamper the validation of PICT in situ. Development of new methodologies to characterise community structure and tolerance is fundamental for advancement of knowledge of ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Based on suggested interactions of potential tipping elements in the Earth's climate and in ecological systems, tipping cascades as possible dynamics are increasingly discussed and studied. The activation of such tipping cascades would impose a considerable risk for human societies and biosphere integrity. However, there are ambiguities in the description of tipping cascades within the literature so far. Here we illustrate how different patterns of multiple tipping dynamics emerge from a very simple coupling of two previously studied idealized tipping elements. In particular, we distinguish between a two phase cascade, a domino cascade and a joint cascade. A mitigation of an unfolding two phase cascade may be possible and common early warning indicators are sensitive to upcoming critical transitions to a certain degree. In contrast, a domino cascade may hardly be stopped once initiated and critical slowing down-based indicators fail to indicate tipping of the following element. These different potentials for intervention and anticipation across the distinct patterns of multiple tipping dynamics should be seen as a call to be more precise in future analyses of cascading dynamics arising from tipping element interactions in the Earth system.

KW  - ANIMAL ETHICS
AB  - An environmental ethics mirroring the distinctive account given by Raimond Gaita of human ethics offers a number of advantages. By understanding the moral significance of individuals to be related primarily to whether they are intelligible objects of love, a Gaitan environmental ethics clarifies the conceptual connections between experiences familiar to those who affirm environmental value: perception of intrinsic value in nature, love of particular natural things or places, an expanded sense of depth of meaning in life, and the sense that environmental commitment is partially constitutive of identity. It highlights the importance of an attitudinal shift in promoting broader acceptance of environmental ethics, and the need for nature preservation, environmental culture, and environmentally committed people who live with integrity to facilitate such an attitudinal shift. Finally, by explaining (via the critical concept of anthropocentrism) the depth of meaning in life that affirmation of environmental value makes possible, it might play a small role in reducing barriers to such affirmation. A Gaitan approach clarifies the conceptual connections between experiences familiar to many who affirm environmental value, highlights the importance of nature preservation, of environmental culture, and of environmentally committed people, and can provide the advantage of a deeper meaning in life over the current norm of seeing nature instrumentally.

AB  - The relative population numbers of rodents were studied in nine habitats in and outside the N'washitshumbe enclosure site, Kruger National Park, before and after burning the firebreaks that surround the enclosure. Trap success was exceptionally high, and the field work is suspected to have coincided with a Mastomys population explosion. This genus dominated the small mammal communities before and after the burn, and never disappeared from the burnt patches. Its numbers also did not crash directly after the burn, as have been reported in most other studies. Movement from the burnt areas was observed, which may have had a significant impact on the numbers of rodents caught both inside the enclosure and in the more natural areas outside. Our study suggests that fire can be investigated as a tool to keep rodent densities down in areas where they are nuisance animals, especially when used in conjunction with models that forecast outbreaks of Mastomys. It also emphasizes the value of long-term studies informing management strategies for animal damage control and biodiversity and ecosystem conservation.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic impacts such as terrestrial runoff, influence the water quality along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and may in turn affect coral reef communities. Associated bacterial biofilms respond rapidly to environmental conditions and are potential bioindicators for changes in water quality. As a prerequisite to study the effects of water quality on biofilm communities, appropriate biofilm substrates for deployment in the field must be developed and evaluated. This study investigates the effect of different settlement substrates (i.e. glass slides, ceramic tiles, coral skeletons and reef sediments) on bacterial biofilm communities grown in situ for 48 days at two locations in the Whitsunday Island Group (Central GBR) during two sampling times. Bacterial communities associated with the biofilms were analysed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analyses of 16S rRNA genes. Findings revealed that substrate type had little influence on bacterial community composition. Of particular relevance, glass slides and coral skeletons exhibited very similar communities during both sampling times, suggesting the suitability of standardized glass slides for long-term biofilm indicator studies in tropical coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - The Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system is an application framework for knowledge-based decision support of ecological assessments at any geographic scale. The system integrates state-of-the-art geographic information system (GIS) as well as knowledge-based reasoning and decision modeling technologies to provide decision support for a substantial portion of the adaptive management process of ecosystem management. EMDS 3.0 is implemented as an ArcMap((R)) extension and integrates the logic engine of NetWeaver((R)) to perform landscape evaluations, and the decision modeling engine of Criterium DecisionPlus((R)) for evaluating management priorities. Key features of the system's evaluation component include abilities to (1) reason about large, abstract, multi-faceted ecosystem management problems, (2) perform useful evaluations with incomplete information, (3) evaluate the influence of missing information, and (4) determine priorities for missing information. A key feature of the planning component is the ability to determine priorities for management activities, taking into account not only ecosystem condition, but also criteria that account for the feasibility and efficacy of potential management actions. Both components include powerful and intuitive diagnostic features that facilitate communicating the explanation of modeling results to a broad audience.

AB  - Quantifying sediment load is vital for aquatic and riverine biota and has been the subject of various environmental studies since sediment plays a key role in maintaining ecological integrity, river morphology and agricultural productivity. However, predicting sediment concentration in rivers is difficult because of the non-linear relationships of flow rates, geophysical characteristics and sediment loads. It is thus very important to propose suitable statistical methods which can provide fast, accurate and robust prediction of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for management guidance. In this study, we developed coupled models of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), named DWT-ANFIS, and principal component analysis (PCA) with ANFIS, named PCA-ANFIS, for SSC time-series modeling. The coupled models and single ANFIS model were trained and tested using long-term daily SSC and river discharge which were measured on the Schuylkill and Iowa Rivers in the United States. The findings showed that the PCA-ANFIS performed better than the single ANFIS and the coupled DWT-ANFIS. Further applications of the PCA-ANFIS should be considered for simulation and prediction of other indicators relating to weather, water resources, and the environment.

AB  - The article presents the results of the study on the current geoecological condition of the basin of the Zhovtenka River. The study object corresponded to the criteria of a small river, having the length of 42 km and the area of the drainage basin of 293 km(2). According to the geographic peculiarities and the level of anthropogenic impact it is a typical small river of the Ukrainian Steppe zone. At the current stage of water management, the river and its tributaries are significantly regulated by artificial aquatic objects - ponds and a water reservoir. The total number of hydrotechnical facilities that form the water bodies is 34 levees. On the river itself, average density of water bodies equals 1 pond per every 2 km of the river length. Such regulation contradicts the norms of the current water protection legislation of Ukraine. As a result of fragmentation, the river has turned into a cascade of evaporation ponds. Special ecological threat to water use is the quality of water in the ponds. We determined that due to absence of current and low water exchange, the saline content in water undergoes significant changes. During the field surveys, we collected samples and determined the parameters of mineralization, content of chlorides and sulfates in 10 water bodies. Sampling was carried out during the year in different seasons. We determined that the averaged parameters of mineralization level change within the range of 9.000 mg/dm(3) in spring to 13.000 mg/dm(3) in summer and autumn. The content of chlorides varies within 2.600-3.600 mg/dm(3), sulfates - 4.000-4.800 mg/dm(3) according to the similar seasonal dependence. Due to changes in the climatic conditions and current tendencies of warming and dry climate, decrease in the water resources heightens the risks of irreversible geoecological degradation of the river. Significant regulation and evaporation-caused loss of water leads to rapid shoaling of the water bodies and growth of aquatic-marsh vegetation. The authors suggest an approach to assessment of the level of geoecological transformation of the river basin based on determining quantitative parameters of the constituents of the elements of natural ecosystems and elements of negative anthropogenic impact. We proposed calculation of various coefficients (indicators) which alter the natural condition of water ecosystems, particularly: coefficients of fragmentation, coefficients of urbanization, coefficients of alienation, etc. We present a possibility of using them in relation to the length of the river and hydrographic network, as well as the area of drainage. We determined that percentage parameter of geoecological impact was seen in 94.3% of the area of the drainage basin or 87.4% of the river length. We suggest approaches that would minimize the deleterious impact of economic activity and gradually restore the condition of aquatic ecosystem of the river. The article provides recommendations of using coefficients of geoecological transformation of river ecosystems.

AB  - Due to global warming, in the northeastern semiarid coastal regions of Brazil, regional and global drivers are responsible for decreasing continental runoff and increasing estuarine water residence time, which promotes a greater mobilization of bioavailable mercury (Hg) and allows increasing fluxes and/or bioavailability of this toxic trace element and an acceleration of biogeochemical transformation of Hg. In this work, an application of dendrochemistry analysis (annular tree rings analysis) was developed for the reconstruction of the historical pattern of mercury contamination in a contaminated area, quantifying chronological Hg contamination trends in a tropical semiarid ecosystem (Ceara River Estuary, northeastern coast of Brazil) through registration of mercury concentration on growth rings in specimens of Rhizophora mangle L. and using the assessment in sediments as a support for the comparison of profiles of contamination. The comparison with sediments from the same place lends credibility to this type of analysis, as well as the relationship to the historical profile of contamination in the region, when compared with local data about industries and ecological situation of sampling sites. In order to evaluate the consequences of the described increase in Hg bioavailability and bioaccumulation in aquatic biota, and to assess the biological significance of Hg concentrations in sediments to fish and wildlife, muscle and liver from a bioindicator fish species, S. testudineus, were also analyzed. The results of this work reinforce the indicators previously described in the semiarid NE region of Brazil, which showed that global climate change and some anthropogenic factors are key drivers of Hg exposure and biomagnification for wildlife and humans. Considering the Hg concentration present in the top layers of sediment (similar to 20 cm around 15 to 20 years) with the outer layers in the tree ring cores and in the sediment's cores from Pacoti estuary and the Ceara estuary, overall the data indicate an increase in mercury in recent years in the Hg surface sediments, especially associated with the fine sediment fraction, mainly due to the increased capacity of small particles to adsorb Hg. There was revealed a positive and significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Hg trends in sediments and Hg trends in annular tree rings. This shared Hg pattern reflects local environmental conditions. The Hg concentration values in S. testudineus from both study areas are not restrictive to human consumption, being below the legislated European limit for Hg in foodstuffs. The results from S. testudineus muscles analysis suggest a significant and linear increase in Hg burden with increasing fish length, indicating that the specimens are accumulating Hg as they grow. The results from both rivers show an increase in BSAF with fish growth. The [Hg] liver/[Hg] muscles ratio >1, which indicates that the S. testudineus from both study areas are experiencing an increase in Hg bioavailability. Possible climate-induced shifts in these aquatic systems processes are inducing a greater mobilization of bioavailable Hg, which could allow an acceleration of the biogeochemical transformation of Hg.

AB  - The Heteroptera is a group of animals associated with the vegetation cover. The conducted analysis indicates that groups of heteropterans in the urban environment have a pattern of reaction to the environmental factors, determined using the phytoindication method. In the study, we considered the following hypotheses: 1) phytoindicational assessments of ecological factors may explain the patterns of variation of the groups of heteropterans; 2) among Heteroptera species, comparatively homogenous ecological groups could be distinguished which are characterized by similar character of response to the effect of certain environmental factors; 3) these groups could be used for bioindication of the conditions of environment in urban ecosystems. Stationary collection of heteropterans was performed during three years from May to October of 2017-2019 on six plots in Kharkiv. The article describes factors which affect the structure of groups of Heteroptera within the ecosystem of the large city and assess the bioindication possibilities. The data presented in the article, as well as the conclusions drawn, are to a large extent associated with stenotopic species, most of which could be used as bioindicators of the condition of one or another biocenosis. According to the results of a taxonomical survey in the territory of Kharkiv, 180 species of Heteroptera were found, belonging to 120 genera and 17 families. The highest species diversity was seen for the family Miridae, accounting for 50 species (27.0% of the total number of counted species). Fewer species were identified as the representatives of families Lygaeidae - 46 species (24.9%) and Pentatomidae - 23 (12.4%). Family Rhopalidae was represented by 11 species (5.9%). Nabidae and Tingidae - 10 species each (5.4%). Families Coreidae - 8 (4.3%), Cydnidae and Scutelleridae - 4 species each (22%), Anthocoridae - 3 (1.6%). The families Berytidae, Piesmatidae, Pyrrhocoridae and Reduviidae were represented by only 2 species each (1.1%). Families Acanthosomatidae, Alydidae and Aradidae were represented by 1 species each, in total accounting for 1.5%. The reasonably high level of species and ecological diversities of Heteroptera in the tenitory of the city allows them to be used in bioindication studies. We determined comparatively homogenous ecological groups of heteropterans which have a similar pattern of response to the impact of certain environmental factors. The study demonstrates that phytoindicatory assessments of the ecological factors can explain the patterns of variation in groups of heteropterans, We determined the factors which have effects on the structure of the group of heteropterans within the metropolitan ecosystem. The level of their effect on groups of heteropterans within the city is different. The most influential were light and humidity. Comparison of potential and realized projections of ecological space allows us, to a certain extent, to generate hypotheses about the orientations of transformation of the group heteropterans.

AB  - A portion of Arizona's San Pedro River is managed as a National Riparian Conservation Area but is potentially affected by ground-water withdrawals beyond the conservation area borders. We applied an assessment model to the Conservation Area as a basis for monitoring long-term changes in riparian ecosystem condition resulting from changes in river water availability, and collected multi-year data on a subset of the most sensitive bioindicators. The assessment model is based on nine vegetation bioindicators that are sensitive to changes in surface water or ground water. Site index scores allow for placement into one of three condition classes, each reflecting particular ranges for site hydrology and vegetation structure. We collected the bioindicator data at 26 sites distributed among 14 reaches that had similar stream flow hydrology (spatial flow intermittency) and geomorphology (channel sinuosity, flood-plain width). Overall, 39% of the riparian corridor fell within condition class 3 (the wettest condition), 55% in condition class 2, and 6% in the driest condition class. Condition class 3 reaches have high cover of herbaceous wetland plants (e.g., Juncus and Schoenoplectus spp.) along the perennial stream channel and dense, multi-aged Populus-Salix woodlands in the flood plain, sustained by shallow ground water in the stream alluvium. In condition class 2, intermittent stream flows result in low cover of streamside wetland herbs, but Populus-Salix remain abundant in the flood plain. Perennial wetland plants are absent from condition class 1, reflecting highly intermittent stream flows; the flood plain is vegetated by Tamarix, a small tree that tolerates the deep and fluctuating ground water levels that typify this reach type. Abundance of herbaceous wetland plants and growth rate of Salix gooddingii varied between years with different stream flow rates, indicating utility of these measures for tracking short-term responses to hydrologic change. Repeat measurement of all bioindicators will indicate long-term trends in hydro-vegetational condition.

AB  - Stated preference analyses often impose strong assumptions regarding spatial welfare distributions that can influence the validity of welfare analysis and aggregation. These include spatial homogeneity and continuous distance decay. Global assumptions such as these are increasingly questioned by non-economics disciplines in favor of approaches that allow for local patchiness. Drawing from this literature, this article proposes methods to identify and evaluate hot spots in stated preference welfare estimates using local indicators of spatial association. Methods are illustrated using geocoded choice experiment data addressing river restoration. Results suggest the presence of statistically significant, non-continuous patterns overlooked by current approaches.

AB  - Rapid and direct viability assessment of Escherichia coli in filtered, sterile lake water was possible using multiparameter flow cytometry. Fluorescent dyes were used as probes for different cellular functions (membrane potential, membrane integrity and intracellular enzyme activity), which were correlated with the ability of the cells to respond to nutrient addition while in a stressed state, Measurement of several criteria circumvented limitations imposed by other methods, and provided extensive evidence for the validity of the methods for monitoring cell viability during adoption of a viable-but-non-culturable state in starved E. coli. Macromolecular staining was concomitantly used to monitor changes in cellular protein, RNA and DNA as additional indicators of physiological status during starvation/stress.

AB  - Many wetlands harbour highly diverse biological communities and provide extensive ecosystem services; however, these important ecological features are being altered, degraded and destroyed around the world. Despite a wealth of research on how animals respond to anthropogenic changes to natural wetlands and how they use created wetlands, we lack a broad synthesis of these data. While some altered wetlands may provide vital habitat, others could pose a considerable risk to wildlife. This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological traps-preferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual-level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences.
   We conducted a global meta-analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon-specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community- (e.g. richness) and population-level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community- and population-level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat-preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio-indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis-related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality.
   Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human-altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.

AB  - The behavioral effects of cocaine are affected by gene knockout (KO) of the dopamine transporter (DAT), the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The relative involvement of each of these transporters varies depending on the particular behavioral response to cocaine considered, as well as on other factors such as genetic background of the subjects. Interestingly, the effects of these gene knockouts on cocaine-induced locomotion are quite different from those on reward assessed in the conditioned place preference paradigm. To further explore the role of these genes in the rewarding effects of cocaine, the ability of five daily injections of cocaine to induce conditioned locomotion was assessed in DAT, SERT and NET KO mice. Cocaine increased locomotor activity acutely during the initial conditioning session in SERT KO and NET KO, but not DAT KO, mice. Surprisingly, locomotor responses in the cocaine-paired subjects diminished over the five conditioning sessions in SERT KO mice, while locomotor responses increased in DAT KO mice, despite the fact that they did not demonstrate any initial locomotor responses to cocaine. Cocaine-induced locomotion was unchanged over the course of conditioning in NET KO mice. In the post-conditioning assessment, conditioned locomotion was not observed in DAT KO mice, and was reduced in SERT KO and NET KO mice. These data reaffirm the central role of dopamine and DAT in the behavioral effects of cocaine.

TI  - Conditional crisis? Ecological challenges and conditions of growth during the agricultural revolution in southern Sweden, c. 1700-1900
T2  - ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Was there an agro-ecological crisis in Europe which preceded and contributed to pushing forward the agricultural revolution? This article presents a new theoretical and empirical approach to this controversial perspective on agricultural transformation and relates to an ongoing debate on conditions of growth in pre-industrial societies. The results demonstrate that there were indeed indicators of a crisis, which grew stronger during the eighteenth century and culminated in the early nineteenth century. The crisis was, however, not general, but was rather restricted to areas that stand out due to poor natural conditions for agriculture. In other words, the crisis was conditional. Furthermore, the findings show that the crisis could push forward changes that were important for enabling agricultural transformation and growth. However, both the emergence and reversal of the crisis were connected to new opportunities opened up by market development. Enough differences were found between different types of regions to suggest that there were many development paths within the agricultural transformation process, and that they were not necessarily linear.

AB  - This paper identifies the relationship between an active use of EU investment support programs by Polish farmers, on one side, and the local conditions for socioeconomic development and natural and structural characteristics of agriculture, on the other. The research was illustrated by the example of Poland, a country with a remarkably fragmented and territorially heterogeneous agrarian structure. This study was carried out at commune level, and used a series of variables to describe the socioeconomic development levels of communes, natural conditions for farming and the agrarian structure. These characteristics were compared with the farmers' activity in accessing EU funds allocated to farm modernization. The Hellwig's synthetic development indicator was used to represent complex phenomena. A strong relationship was found to exist between the implementation of co-financed investments and the agrarian structure at local level. Other factors proved to be insignificant. This suggests that the agricultural development path is somewhat independent from socioeconomic and environmental conditions.

AB  - Modal parameters such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are sensitive indicators of structural damage. However, they are not only sensitive to damage, but also to the environmental conditions such as, humidity, wind and most important, temperature. For civil engineering structures, modal changes produced by environmental conditions can be equivalent or greater than the ones produced by damage. This article proposes a damage detection method which is able to deal with temperature variations. The objective function correlates mode shapes and natural frequencies, and a parallel genetic algorithm handles the inverse problem. The numerical model of the structure assumes that the elasticity modulus of the materials is temperature-dependent. The algorithm updates the temperature and damage parameters together. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish between temperature effects and real damage events. Simulated data of a three-span bridge and experimental one of the I-40 Bridge validate the proposed methodology. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to assess the experimental damage despite of temperature variations.

AB  - A watershed is a complex ecosystem. Assessment of watershed condition entails consideration of numerous issues and factors. The problem is complex, the issues are not well defined, and data are often lacking. These characteristics suggest that a knowledge-based approximate reasoning approach is especially useful for watershed assessment. This paper describes a knowledge base for watershed assessment for sediment (WAS). The knowledge base is designed for protection of fish habitat and control of excessive sediment, and is evaluated in the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system. The WAS model allows experts from diverse fields to contribute to an integrated assessment of watershed condition. As a decision support tool, the model provides a means to assemble key pieces of information and reasoning that support land use or regulatory decisions, and to communicate among diverse audiences the basis for those decisions. The paper also presents an application of the model to assess the condition of a coastal watershed in northern California. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the responses of submerged macrophytes to environmental conditions in shallow lakes to evaluate the role of macrophytes as bioindicators of water quality and anthropogenic disturbances (such as eutrophication) of shallow lake ecosystems. The studies were conducted on a group of ten shallow lakes situated on the area of Polesie Lubelskie (eastern Poland). The lakes represented five types of macrophyte communities, Chara-Stratiotes-, Myriophyllum-, Potamogeton-and Ceratophyllum-dominated. The total biomass of macrophytes and their distribution were significantly negatively correlated with the trophic status of the lake. Principal component analysis confirms the separation of the lakes with regard to trophic status and macrophyte species richness and biomass. The results of the Monte Carlo permutation test (RDA analysis) indicated the significant effect of Secchi disc depth, pH, conductivity, chlorophyll-a, P-tot, P-PO4, N-NO3 and N-NH4 on the biomass and distribution of submerged macrophytes in the lakes.

AB  - Objective
   Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly comorbid with chronic pain conditions that often co-occur such as migraine headaches, temporomandibular disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and tension headaches. Using a genetically informative sample, the current study evaluated the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the co-occurrence of PTSD and chronic pain conditions. Methods
   Data from 4680 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were examined. Biometric modeling was used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components and genetic and environmental correlations between PTSD and multiple chronic pain conditions. Results
   Heritabilities were estimated at 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15%-63%) for PTSD and 34% (95% CI = 27%-41%) for the combined history of any one or more pain condition. Specific pain condition heritabilities ranged from 15% (95% CI = 0%-48%) for tension headaches to 41% (95% CI = 27%-54%) for migraine headaches. Environmental influences accounted for the remaining variance in pain conditions. The genetic correlation between PTSD and combined history of any one or more pain condition was r(g)= 0.61 (95% CI = 0.46-0.89) and ranged for individual pain conditions from r(g)= 0.44 (95% CI = 0.24-0.77) for migraine headache to r(g)= 0.75 (95% CI = 0.52-1.00) for tension headaches. Conclusions
   PTSD and chronic pain conditions are highly comorbid, and this relationship can be explained by both genetic and environmental overlap. The precise mechanisms underlying these relationships are likely diverse and multifactorial.

AB  - Our aim was to assess the spatial heterogeneity in the abundance and condition of the tellinacean bivalve Nuttallia olivacea in estuarine tidal flats, as well as to reveal the relationships between these variables and abiotic and biotic factors. The intensity of sublethal siphon predation by juvenile stone flounder Platichthys bicoloratus was considered as a possible factor affecting the bivalve condition. A 2-scale sampling of stations at 200 to 800 m intervals and 2 to 5 plots at 5 to 20 m intervals on a transect line at each station was conducted in the Natori River estuary, Japan. Abundance and somatic condition greatly varied at both scales. Densities varied from 0 to 4902 ind. m(-2) among stations and from 2480 to 6448 ind. m(-2) among plots at the station with the highest density. Body mass index varied from 4.0 to 5.0 between stations and from 4.9 to 5.7 between plots at the station with the highest body mass. It was commonly observed that N. alivacea was abundant and that body condition was high at sites with low silt-clay contents and low elevations, as revealed by generalized linear models. A negative influence of siphon predation was detected only on somatic condition, but it accounted for only 1.2% of the variation, whereas environmental variables accounted for 30.2%. These results indicate that environmental variables are key factors affecting bivalve abundance and condition, while sublethal predation is only a potential factor affecting bivalve condition.

T2  - GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Ground water monitoring data collected during the past eight years at a permitted municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal facility located in the midwestern United States indicated fluctuations in typical leachate indicator parameter concentrations. Apparent trends in the data inferred leachate outbreak, generating suspicion as to the integrity of the landfill liner. Eight ground water monitoring wells were installed in three distinct geologic units at the landfill facility, including glacial drift, silurian dolomite, and a post-glacial peat fen, which is downgradient from the landfill. Piezometer nests were used to define ground water gradients at the site. Using boron as an indicator, the occurrence of analytes of concern in the downgradient monitoring wells were shown to be indicative of the natural geochemistry of site ground water. This work emphasizes the importance of understanding site hydrogeology during the interpretation of ground water quality data.

AB  - Criteria for eutrophication related parameters to achieve and preserve good environmental status (GES) of the oligotrophic Israeli Mediterranean coast were proposed for nutrients, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. The criteria were derived from current conditions, the best choice for the area that has undergone large and irreversible ecological changes compared to the pristine background. A five-year data set (2010-2014, ca. 800 data points) was analyzed using statistical methods and best professional judgement. The coastal waters were divided into four provinces, data gaps were identified, and seasonal reference and threshold values for each province determined as the median and 1.5 times the median, respectively. Application of the derived criteria to data up to 2016 showed the coastal waters to be mainly in GES, with a few exceptions. Simplification of the proposed criteria for environmental management was addressed as well.

AB  - Big data are potentially useful for environmental management planning and actions that can be directed toward pollution control. China is using big data approaches to help reduce its current levels of pollution. However, also needed are better environmental indicators, measurement technologies, data management and reporting, and adaptive management and enforcement. Based on continental-extent monitoring and assessment programs in Europe and the USA, we recommend three major programmatic changes for China. (1) Establish long-term systemic environmental and human health objectives and indicators. (2) Adopt national standard methods for survey designs, sampling and analytical protocols, statistical analyses, and collaborative sampling programs. (3) Provide a transparent process for reporting and correcting data errors.

AB  - Endothelial dysfunction (EDF) reflects pathophysiological changes in the phenotype and functions of endothelial cells that result from and/or contribute to a plethora of cardiovascular diseases. We review the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the pathogenesis of EDF, one of the fastest advancing research topics. Conventionally treated as an environment pollutant, H2S is also produced in endothelial cells and participates in the fine regulation of endothelial integrity and functions. Disturbed H2S bioavailability has been suggested to be a novel indicator of EDF progress and prognosis. EDF manifests in different forms in multiple pathologies, but therapeutics aimed at remedying altered H2S bioavailability may benefit all.

AB  - Peatlands are subject to increased pressure from environmental and land-use change, particularly in temperate regions such as the US Midwest. Bryophytes dominate the ground cover of peatlands and play a key role in their functioning. Effective management and restoration of degraded peatlands requires good understanding of their bryophyte communities, and how these are shaped by environmental conditions. Furthermore, bryophytes are sensitive indicators of environmental conditions. We monitored microhabitat characteristics (hydrology, hydrochemistry, abundance of vascular vegetation, microtopography) alongside bryophyte community composition in nine kettle hole mires in Ohio (USA). We found that the most important drivers of bryophyte community composition and diversity were water level and hydrochemistry. Sampling locations showing poor fen characteristics (high water level, pH and electrical conductivity) were associated with generalist pleurocarpous mosses (indicator species: Amblystegium serpens) and lower species richness. Where bog conditions prevailed, Sphagnum species dominated, and Sphagnum fallax and the liverwort Cephalozia sp. were indicator species.

AB  - In a recent issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Michael Jakob and Ottmar Edenhofer argue that the concepts of "green growth" and "degrowth" are inadequate to help find the right balance between human well-being and environmental integrity. Instead, they propose a policy aimed at social welfare. In this issue of GAIA, Irmi Seidl and Angelika Zahrnt as well as Reinhard Loske hold against them that the prevailing growth paradigm cannot be ignored when facing the challenges of sustainable development. The concept of welfare indicators appears difficult to operationalise (Seidl and Zahrnt) and quite apolitical (Loske). As Jakob and Edenhofer claim in their response, welfare diagnostics does not advocate a materialistic world view, but can serve as a guide for public policy formulation.

AB  - The monthly and spatial patterns of chlorophyll concentration have been analysed for the northern Benguela upwelling system, which is characterised by its strong seasonality. Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor data have been used to determine temporal patterns and to identify optimal conditions for chlorophyll production from October 1997 to October 2001. These data have been studied jointly with the sea surface temperature (SST) as an indicator of the physical variability in the region. The chlorophyll concentration did not present the strong seasonality of the physical environment but showed temporal and spatial optimal conditions. The highest chlorophyll concentration areas were found where and when the conditions of the water column were more stable. Although the time series is still too short to allow the designing of any conceptual model of the factors controlling the primary production of this region, it is long enough to permit us to conclude that it is not limited by the nutrient supply but by the stability of the water column.

AB  - We sampled moss and vascular forest vegetation in five ancient beech forests from northwest France, embracing in each a wide array of environmental conditions. Indirect (PCA) and direct (RDA) gradient analysis were used to discern local and regional ecological factors which explain the observed variation in species composition. Our results point to a global factor encompassing a large array of soil and light conditions, unravelled when local particularities of studied forests are singled out. The humus form, numerically expressed by the Humus Index, explains a large part of the observed variation in ground vegetation. Our study confirmed opposite trends in vascular and moss species richness according to humus condition. Ecological factors to which vascular and moss forest species respond at the regional level can be estimated directly in the field by visually inspecting humus forms and vegetation strata despite of the confounding influence of local factors.

AB  - The identification of environmental factors linked to increased risk of local extinction often relies on inference from patterns of distribution. Yet for declining populations, the assumption of population equilibrium that underlies species distribution models is violated. Measures such as individual condition can provide a more direct indication of extinction risk, and can start to be detected before declines commence. We compared distribution-based and condition-based approaches to identifying factors affecting habitat suitability for an area-sensitive passerine, the eastern yellow robin Eopsaltria australis, in eastern Australia. We compared patterns of individual condition between robins and several common, more mobile species (Meliphagid honeyeaters and yellow thornbills Acanthiza nana). Robin presence was not affected by landscape context, but robins avoided sites with a more grassy ground layer. However, robins inhabiting landscapes with less remnant woodland had higher ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes in peripheral blood, indicating higher long-term stress. No clear spatial patterns of condition were detected for the more mobile species. Our findings suggest a hierarchical model of habitat suitability, whereby robins avoid grassy sites, but where they do occur are in poorest condition when inhabiting less-vegetated landscapes. We predict greater rates of local extinction of robins from such landscapes. The use of indicators of individual condition, in addition to distribution data, can unveil otherwise cryptic factors as important influences on habitat quality. As habitat occupancy does not always reflect habitat quality, exploring patterns in condition indices can complement species distribution modelling, potentially revealing threats to persistence before population declines have commenced.

AB  - Assessments of river condition are needed to guide all aspects of river management. Such assessments have evolved over three decades from simply capturing the mosaic of river physical habitats to recognizing that habitat mosaics are dynamic, driven mainly by physical processes and modified by human (indirect) pressures and (direct) interventions. To embrace these broader aspects, riparian as well as in-stream environments need to be evaluated, going beyond subjective assessments to incorporate observations that support understanding of both physical habitat structure and cause-effect relationships. This paper reports on an operational approach to assessing the physical condition of rivers, which attempts to bridge the gap between a physical habitat and a geomorphic condition assessment. The approach forms part of Biodiversity Metric 2.0, a habitat-based methodology for measuring and accounting for biodiversity losses and gains resulting from development or land management change at individual project sites across England. The river condition assessment component adopts a bottom-up multi-scale approach that integrates field observations of physical habitats and of features indicative of geomorphic processes to deliver assessments of longer subreaches, whose condition is then evaluated within the context of the reach-scale geomorphological type of river. By applying the assessment before, immediately after, and following recovery from project implementation, changes in condition and their causes can be evaluated. The assessment method is presented to an international audience, outlining its structure, application and testing, and critically discussing its strengths and weaknesses, because the methodological approach could be helpful for devising methods for application in other environmental contexts.

AB  - The study of metal bioaccumulation in the gills of European chub (Squalius cephalus) was conducted in September 2009 at the medium-sized rural river Sutla, characterized by agricultural and municipal type of water contamination. The concentration ranges were established for the first time in the soluble, metabolically available fractions of chub gills for 12 metals, which are environmentally extremely relevant and yet only seldom studied, as follows in a decreasing order: K, 225-895 mg L-1; Na, 78-366 mg L-1; Ca, 19-62 mg L-1; Mg, 13-47 mg L-1; Rb, 164-1762 mu g L-1; Sr, 24-81 mu g L-1; Ba, 13-67 mu g L-1; Mo, 1.3-16 mu g L-1; Co, 0.7-2.7 mu g L-1; Li, 0.4-2.2 mu g L-1; Cs, 0.2-1.9 mu g L-1; and V, 0.1-1.8 mu g L-1. The concentrations of Fe (1.6-6.4 mg L-1) and Mn (16-69 mu g L-1) were also determined and were in agreement with previous reports. By application of general linear modelling, the influence of different abiotic (metal exposure level) and biotic parameters (fish sex, age, size and condition) on metal bioaccumulation was tested. It was established that bioaccumulation of many metals in fish depended on various physiological conditions, wherein Ba could be singled out as metal exhibiting the strongest association with one of biotic parameters, being significantly higher in smaller fish. However, it was also undoubtedly demonstrated that the concentrations of three metals can be applied as reliable indicators of metal exposure even in the conditions of low or moderate water contamination, such as observed in the Sutla River, and those were nonessential elements Li and Cs and essential element Fe. The results of our study present an important contribution to maintenance of high ecological status of European freshwaters, through enrichment of knowledge on the bioaccumulation of various metals in gills of European chub as frequently applied bioindicator species in monitoring of water pollution.

AB  - Ecological safety of small rivers for the population of the region, their role in the formation of biota is largely determined by the chemical composition of water. The intensity of climatic and anthropogenic factors changes, the chemical composition and, as a consequence, the quality of water can be vary significantly. In this regard, the monitoring studies of the water composition of these sources are very relevant. The features of migration of a number of heavy metals (HM) in the water-soil-plant triad were studied using the example of an annual herbaceous cultural plant-sugar corn (Zea mays L.) growing on the coastal areas of the Shnogh River. As a control plant corn inbred line B73 was used. With a specially equipped air-conditioning system the drought was modeled in climatic room by changing the optimum soil water content in the experimental vases. In the control vases, the optimum soil water content was 54%, in the case of a mild drought-43%, wherein the wilting of leaves of the plant was not visually observed. During the modeling of severe drought, the optimum soil water content was 34%, and leaf wilting was observed during one day. The content of HM in samples of river water, coastal soil and plant grains were carried out using a portable analyzer " Thermo Scientific T Niton T XRF Portable Analyzer. An analysis of the kinetic data of plant growth under simulated drought conditions was carried out. Kinetic parameters of plant growth in three conditions of simulated drought were determined. A correlation was established between the growth rate of biological samples and the drought. The kinetic parameters of plant growth under simulated drought conditions were established. A correlation was found between the water potential and osmotic pressure in the three-day shoots of the fifth maize sheet under conditions of drought. The physiological response of plant growth according to the degree of drought and indicators of water potential and osmotic pressure were considered. A certain spatial dynamics of distribution of some HM in the water-soil-plant triad is revealed. The obtained experimental material will makes it possible to carry out a complex of measures to monitor the degree of contamination of river water which used for irrigation purposes taking into account soil and climatic conditions of growth.

AB  - Posidonia oceanica beds form one of the most important coastal ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin and represent a good indicator of the seawater quality, being strongly sensitive to human perturbations. The aim of the present study is to verify whether changes in cytophysiological features of this seagrass could mark early altered environmental conditions. In this context, we investigated in juvenile and intermediate leaves: (1) the presence and structure of phenolic compounds, due to their role in the defence response against biotic and abiotic stress; (2) the presence and distribution of cytokinins, because of their key role in leaf growth and senescence as well as in relation to their interaction in light signalling. Significant and measurable increases in the amount of phenols as well as changes in cytokinins distribution were detected in Posidonia leaves collected from meadows subjected to disturbed environmental conditions as compared to those of preserved ones. These results clearly indicated that these variables could be used as early biomarkers of environmental quality.

AB  - The current study presents a detailed analysis of the gaseous emissions, focusing on CO2 and NOR, of diesel vehicles under several operating conditions. An assessment is also made on the impact and effectiveness of the Real Diving Emissions (RDE) test, which is mandatory by the European Union (EU) type approval regulation for passenger cars since September 2017. The method followed comprises emissions measurement tests on three Euro 6 diesel vehicles, under laboratory and various on-road operation conditions. Chassis dynamometer tests in the laboratory showed that emissions over the current type approval test (World-wide harmonized Light-duty Test Procedure or WLTP), and over the former one (New European Driving Cycle or NEDC), poorly reflect real world levels. However, the most demanding CADC Lesling comes closer W real drive emissions. Comparison of driving conditions on the chassis dynamometer over different driving cycles and on the road reveals that the emission performance substantially varies between different tests, even for apparently similar operation conditions. The NOx emissions reduction strategy of pre-RDE monitoring Euro 6 vehicles seems to be optimized for the NEDC driving conditions, which are not representative of the real-world driving conditions. The real-world emissions during normal driving conditions are effectively captured with the new RDE test, however driving the vehicle dynamically, at conditions outside the RDE regulation boundaries, results to disproportional high emissions. This is a significant shortcoming which might be critical for populations living on hilly areas or those close to specific micro-environments, such as highway entrance ramps, traffic lights, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The endangered population of southern resident killer whales Orcinus orca is hypothesized to be food-limited, but uncertainty remains over if and when the availability of their primary prey, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, is low enough to cause nutritional stress. To measure changes in body condition, we collected 1635 measurable images from a helicopter hovering 230-460 m above whales, and linked these to individuals with distinctive natural markings. Head width (HW), measured at 15% of the distance between the blowhole and the dorsal fin (BHDF), was measured from images of 59 individuals in 2008 (from a population of 84) and 66/81 individuals in 2013, enabling assessment of between-year changes for 44 individuals (26 females, 18 males). Of these, 11 had significant declines in the ratio of HW/BHDF compared to 5 with significant increases. Two whales with declines died shortly after being photographed, suggesting a link between body condition and mortality. Most (8/11) of the significant declines in condition were from 1 social pod (J-pod), and all the whales that increased in condition were from one of the other 2 pods, K-pod (n = 3) and L-pod (n = 2). Notably, 11/16 whales that changed condition were re productive-aged females and there were no adult males with significant changes. This likely reflects the increased energetic costs of lactation to reproductive females, and the nutritional help provided to adult males through prey sharing. These data demonstrate the utility of aerial photo-grammetry as a non-invasive approach for providing quantitative data on body condition, and support monitoring the condition of reproductive females as key indicators of nutritional stress.

AB  - The effect of exogenous cytokinin ( benzyladenine) was investigated on location specific grains in three contrasting wheat genotypes tolerant or susceptible to post anthesis high temperature conditions. Seeds were sown in earthen pots under natural environment in November and January for normal and late sowings, respectively. Grain weight was increased by the application of benzyladenine at anthesis under late sown stress only in those genotypes, which are known, to posses temperature tolerance in developing grains. However, under normal sowing conditions BA application was effective irrespective of genotype response to late sown stress. The effect was most visible in distal spikelets in the spike and distal grains in the spikelet which resulted in higher increment in weight of younger grains ( c and d) as compared to older grains ( a and b). It has been suggested that the responsiveness of the genotype to BA application under late sown stress is important and may be developed as an indicator to screen wheat genotypes for relative tolerance to late sown stress under irrigated conditions.

AB  - Understanding the trajectory of changes in substrate physicochemical properties is critical for revegetation of mine tailings. The study tracked changes of selected physicochemical properties as proxies of pedogenesis over time and across different topographic positions on a chronosequence of six abandoned gold tailings (10, 17, 35, 82, 92 and 110 years) compared to soils from reference areas. The hypotheses were: (1) plant macronutrients: total and mineral nitrogen (N), plant available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic carbon (OC) and fine particle content significantly increase with substrate age and approach that of natural reference soils, (2) substrate pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density decrease with tailings age, (3) topography (relief) and depth had significant effect on the tailings properties. Substrate samples were collected from four depths (0-5 cm; 5-15 cm, 100 cm and 300 cm) on the tops, upper and lower slope positions of the tailings dumps and two reference sites 200 m and 2 km away. Total N and available P significantly increased with dump age matching reference conditions in the top 5 cm on the oldest (110 years) dump. Organic carbon(OC) and pH initially significantly declined between the disposal time (0 years) and 10 years but fluctuated thereafter. Bulk density significantly decreased with tailings age. Texture and EC did not significantly vary with dump age. Slope position (relief) had significant effect (p < 0.05) on total N, available P, and EC. Available P and EC increased from the dump top to the base while total N fluctuated. Total N significantly decreased with depth and was highest in the 0-5 cm layer. The interactive effect of dump age and slope position was significant for EC only. A PCA based on all measured parameters showed higher similarity of the older dumps (82-110-years) to the two reference sites. Overall, the results suggest that more than 110 years are required for macronutrients on gold mine tailings to match reference conditions while the other parameters require shorter periods and fluctuate above and below reference conditions. Nevertheless, changes in tailings properties appeared to be correlated to dynamics in vegetation and biological crusts that were observed to increase in cover with substrate age.

AB  - Transport can be a stressful experience for animals, and that means ethical and economic consequences. OIE guidelines and the EU new regulation aim at preventing inadequate conditions of transport. making operators fully responsible of animal welfare and requiring specific certificates of competence. In comparison with other farmed species, relatively few papers have been published on sheep transport. This could be due to lower economic significance and to apparently minor impact of poor transport on sheep meat quality. However, in the last decades several researches were produced on this subject, pointing a number of welfare parameters of be clinic. physiopathologic. environmental and inspective nature. In this review different potential stressor agents have been evaluated: animal handling (particularly loading and unloading), stocking density, travel duration, rest times, environmental conditions and personnel skills. Further studies could be useful to improve knowledge about basic welfare parameters regarding this species, such as rnicroclimate conditions on transport means (mostly about different standards for shorn or unshorn sheep) and actual effects on meat quality.

AB  - In order to examine the factors influencing xenobiotic toxicity against larval mosquitoes, the larvicidal performances of two conventional insecticides (temephos and Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis: Bti) and a new potential phyto-insecticide (decomposed leaf litter) were compared under different conditions against three detritivorous larval mosquito types. Bioassays performed under standard conditions indicated differential tolerance levels according to the xenobiotic and the larval type. Bioassays performed under different conditions of xenobiotic dose and geometry of the water column indicated differential effects of those parameters on mortality rates. This allowed us to distinguish the performances of temephos versus those of Bti and leaf litter. These toxicological performances were examined as indicators for analysis of xenobiotic bioavailability for mosquito larvae in environmental water, and also for their comparative interest in field mosquito control.

AB  - Anthropogenic and climatic-induced changes to flow regimes pose significant risks to river systems. Northern rivers and their deltas are particularly vulnerable due to the disproportionate warming of the Northern Hemisphere compared with the Southern Hemisphere. Of special interest is the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in western Canada, a productive deltaic lake and wetland ecosystem, which has been recognized as a Ramsar site. Both climate- and regulation-induced changes to the hydrological regime of the Peace River have raised concerns over the delta's ecological health. With the damming of the headwaters, the role of downstream unregulated tributaries has become more important in maintaining, to a certain degree, a natural flow regime, particularly during open-water conditions. However, their flow contributions to the mainstem river under future climatic conditions remain largely uncertain. In this study, we first evaluated the ability of a land-surface hydrological model to simulate hydro-ecological relevant indicators, highlighting the model's strengths and weaknesses. Then, we investigated the streamflow conditions in the Smoky River, the largest unregulated tributary of the Peace River, in the 2071-2100 versus the 1981-2010 periods. Our modelling results revealed significant changes in the hydrological regime of the Smoky River, such as increased discharge in winter (+190%) and spring (+130%) but reduced summer flows (-33%) in the 2071-2100 period compared with the baseline period, which will have implications for the sustainability of the downstream PAD. In particular, the projected reductions in 30-day and 90-day maximum flows in the Smoky River will affect open-water flooding, which is important in maintaining lake levels and connectivity to perimeter delta wetlands in the Peace sector of the PAD. The evaluation of breakup and freeze-up flows for the 2071-2100 period showed mixed implications for the ice-jam flooding, which is essential for recharging high-elevation deltaic basins. Thus, despite projected increase in annual and spring runoff in the 2071-2100 period from the Smoky sub-basin, the sustainability of the PAD still remains uncertain.

AB  - Molluscan concentrations were abundantly deposited along the coastal area of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina, Southwestern Atlantic) by different sea-level episodes during the late Quaternary. Most of them represent Holocene ridges (highly energetic depositional environments) subparallel to the modern shore where the main associations preserved are parautochthonous, and others (mainly autochthonous associations) occurring in tidal flats seaward of the ridges or coastal lagoon deposits accumulated behind them (low-energetic). Analysis of three physical taphonomic signatures (disarticulation, fragmentation and abrasion) of the molluscan skeletons of four bivalve species (Tagelus plebeius, Mactra isabelleana, Pitar rostratus, Brachidontes rodriguezi), which exhibit different shell shape and thickness conditions, habitats and life habits and represent the most widely distributed and palaeoecologically significant taxa along the area of study, support the distinction of both palaeoenvironments, characterized by low and high taphonomic grades, respectively. The taphonomic alteration (breakage and abrasion) of most shells seems to have been a direct consequence of the amount of reworking of the material especially during periods of exposure along an extensive beach zone, more than a consequence of transport from a distant original habitat. Abrasion signatures are the only probably correlated with after death time span, shells showing a near modern aspect and original luster being most probably younger than those with chalky or polished appearance. The infaunal species analysed typically living on clays and silts or fine sandy bottoms of the infralittoral or intertidal (T. plebeius, M, isabelleana) are better preserved (less fragmented and abraded) than shells of the epibyssate B. rodriguezi, which lives on hard bottoms of the intertidal and supralittoral areas more exposed to highly unstable conditions with longer episodes of exposure. Although these nearshore concentrations may represent a time-averaging of 1000 yr B.P., taking into account the ecological requirements of the most constant and dominant taxa together with the taphonomic analysis of shells from parautochthonous and autochthonous associations, they still represent valid indicators of past marginal marine conditions in the area, but are only reliable to establish long-term palaeoenvironmental variations.

AB  - Eutrophication and anoxia are increasing in lakes worldwide. However, our understanding of variations of primary productivity and anoxia in lakes over thousands of years is limited. Long-term records are needed to understand the natural variability of lake ecosystems and to improve our understanding of drivers of productivity and anoxia. In this study, we used the varved sediment record of Lake Zabinskie, Poland to answer the following research questions: 1) How have primary production and water column oxygen concentrations varied during the past 10,800 years?; 2) what role did natural and anthropogenic forces have in driving changes in primary production or lake mixing regime? Recently developed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) techniques were used to quantify sedimentary chloropigments-a and bacteriopheopigments-a (Bphe-a) at sub-annual resolution. These data, combined with elemental data from micro X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) and pigment assemblage data from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements, were used to reconstruct paleolimnological conditions. Bphe-a was used as an indicator of anoxia, and its presence suggests that an extensive anoxic zone was present nearly continuously from 10.8 to 2.8 ka BP. Anoxic conditions, driven by thermal stratification, were promoted by closed forest cover during that time, which limited wind-driven mixing of the water column. After 2.8 ka BP, water column oxygenation occurred more frequently, particularly during periods of increased human agricultural activity and forest opening. Pronounced anoxia was again present continuously from similar to 610 to 1470 CE, concurrent with a period of reforestation. After similar to 1610 CE, deforestation caused increases in erosion rates, algal production, and water column oxygenation. Pigment assemblages indicate that the algal community during the past 150 years was different from any other time during theHolocene. This study demonstrates a clear link between lake biogeochemical processes and forest cover and shows the potential of HSI to produce extremely high-resolution records of past productivity and redox conditions from varved lake sediments.

AB  - This study was undertaken (i) to investigate the interactions of the activated sludge microbial community in a chemostat with the "environment", such as the substrate composition and variations, (ii) to investigate how these interactions affect the quality of the treated effluent and (iii) to determine the limits or applicability conditions to the indicators and to the prediction potential of the treated effluent quality. This work presents (a) the experimental results obtained from a reactor fed municipal wastewater (Data Set2-DS2) concerning the reactor's operating conditions and the microbial community of the sludge (b) comparisons between DS2 and an older Data Set (DS1) obtained when the reactor was fed synthetic substrate, all other experimental conditions being identical, and (c) simulation results and sensitivity analyses of two model runs (R1 and R2, corresponding to DS1 and DS2). The first trophic level (P(1)) of the DS2microbial community consisted of bacteria, the second trophic level (P(2)) of bacteria-eating protozoa, rotifers and nematodes and the third trophic level (P(3)) of carnivorous protozoa and arthropods. Rotifers were an important constituent of the DS2 microbial community. The DS1 and DS1 communities differed in total size, trophic level sizes and species composition. Correlations between the major microbial groups of DS2 community and either loading rates or effluent quality attributes were generally low, but the correlation of bacteria with SVI and ammonia in the effluent was better. Also, the ratio of rotifers to protozoa in P2 was correlated to BOD in the effluent. The results of this work indicate that predictions of the treated effluent quality based only on protozoa may not be safe. Sensitivity analysis of R2 run indicate that, when variation in Y and K(d) biokinetic coefficients of the sludge are combined with fluctuations in composition and quality of municipal wastewater entering the reactor, then sufficient significant prediction of bacteria in the aeration tank is not possible. In order to avoid erroneous oversimplifications regarding phenomena taking place in the sludge and to understand "unexplained" process failures, more ecologically sound methods for studying wastewater treatment (WWT) processes are needed, since WWT are primarily ecosystems interacting with technological systems.

AB  - Over the past few decades, numerous floodplain restoration projects have attempted to re-establish complex and diverse river floodplains. They often aim to restore lateral connectivity (i.e. interactions between the main river channel and floodplain channels) and rejuvenate floodplain habitats which are no longer maintained or created by fluvial processes. Nonetheless, results of these experiences in terms of hydromorphological conditions and adjustments are rarely shared. The Rhone River is a large, highly regulated system where lateral connectivity has been greatly reduced. We investigated habitat dynamics (using sedimentological indicators as proxies) in 18 floodplain channels that were restored between 1999 and 2006. Environmental data (bathymetry and grain size of surficial fine sediments) were acquired on 3-5 surveys for each channel covering 6-12years after restoration. In addition, a pre-restoration survey was made in 12 of the 18 channels. Using pressure sensors in the floodplain channels and rating curves in the main channel, we quantified the upstream overflow frequency and magnitude (i.e. maximum shear stress) in the channels and tested how these variables explain observed sedimentological patterns. Between-channel diversity accounted for 81% of the sedimentological variability observed after restoration. Time-averaged sedimentological conditions were robust and well predicted from overflow frequency and magnitude. Similarly, an indirect index of lateral connectivity used by hydrobiologists was also predictable from overflow frequency and magnitude. The remaining 19% of the sedimentological variability was attributed to temporal variation within channels and was mainly related to changes in longitudinal grain size gradient. This emphasises that grain size patterns are periodically reworked as a result of the flooding regime (backflow versus overflow) without significantly affecting average grain sizes. However, trajectories of grain size changes were stochastic and not always related to the hydrological regime. Accordingly, the partial pre-restoration data suggest that post-restoration sedimentological conditions were often similar to those observed before restoration, except in a few channels where major restoration works were performed. Our results quantify how changes in upstream overflow frequency and magnitude can modify physical conditions in the floodplain channels. They can be used to design habitats that are infrequent or missing at the floodplain scale. These results also suggest that changes in upstream plug morphology are a primary habitat driver. Such changes could be more frequently implemented in the Rhone and elsewhere to maximise the diversity of physical conditions in floodplains.

AB  - Within the frameWork of the European Environmental Quality Standards Directive, the biota was recognized as a suitable matrix for monitoring water quality. In the Nalon River basin (North Spain), a catchment subject to historical mining activities, ten macroinvertebrate taxa (4 mayflies, 1 perlid stonefly, 2 caddisflies, 2 oligochaete worms, and 1 blackfly) were collected from unpolluted reference sites in the study area, and the sites were assessed as having High or Good ecological status based on their macroinvertebrate communities to establish a metal bioaccumulation reference condition. For each taxon, tissue concentrations of seven metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Hg, and Zn) and two metalloids (As and Se) were measured and interpreted as natural baseline tissue concentrations that reflected the natural variability of the region. The taxa selected as biomonitors represented 5 different feeding styles in the benthic community: deposit-feeders, scrapers, filterers, generalists and predators, and bioaccumulation was analyzed both by taxon and feeding style as well as general habits (endo- vs epi-benthic) and river type. For each taxon, ecological threshold tissue concentrations (ETTC) were calculated as the 90th percentile (P90) of the baseline data distribution. In most instances, the deposit-feeders (aquatic lumbricid and microdrile oligochaetes) showed the highest ETTCs, except for Cu and Zn, which were mainly bioaccumulated by generalist Ephemerellidae, followed by scraper Heptageniidae in the case of Cu. The P90 values were derived from organisms in unaltered reference conditions as estimates of the no-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC), and should provide an approach to ETTCs for the field macroinvertebrate taxa of the region below which the alteration of the benthic community is unlikely. For each metal and metalloid, the P9Os for the 10 taxa were entered in a species-sensitivity-distribution model, and the median hazard concentration (HC50) for the macroinvertebrate community was calculated. The ecological threshold concentrations in the biota calculated in this study are proposed for use as a screening tool in the environmental risk assessment of the Nalon River basin and the Cantabrian region, allowing metal exceedance in the selected biomonitors to further research using other lines of evidence under the European Water Framework directive.

AB  - The success of Limnoperna fortunei as an invasive species is related to its physiological plasticity that allows them to endure adverse environmental conditions. Starvation tolerance is considered to be an important trait associated with bivalve invasiveness. In natural ecosystems, food resources can vary during the year, exposing mussels to variable periods of starvation or limited food availability. Thus, mussels have developed physiological strategies to tolerate fluctuations in food availability. Glycogen concentration has been used in different monitoring studies as an indicator of the nutritional condition of bivalves. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses of L. fortunei based on the glycogen concentrations of specimens under four treatments, comprising different combinations of feeding and starvation, during 125 days. The experiment was carried out in two phases. In the phase I, mussels were divided in two treatments: starvation (S) and feeding (F). After 100 days, tissue samples were collected to quantify glycogen concentrations and, each phase I group was divided in two subgroups: starvation (S) and feeding (F), resulting in four treatments. In the phase II, that lasted 25 days, starvation specimens (S) from phase I were allowed to feed (starvation-feeding treatment, or S-F), or continued to undergo starvation (starvation-starvation treatment, or S-S) and the feeding specimens (F) continued feeding (feeding-feeding group, or F-F), or were subjected to starvation (feeding-starvation treatment, or F-S). Behavior (valve-closing) and mortality were recorded in 24 h intervals. After the 25 days (phase II) all specimens were killed, and their soft tissue was removed to quantify glycogen concentrations. The glycogen concentration of the S-F treatment was lower than that of the F-S treatment, which was initially allowed to feed (phase I) and then subjected to starvation (phase II). Stability in the glycogen concentrations was observed when the phase II feeding conditions were maintained during the experiments, as observed in the S-S (continued starvation) and F-F (continued feeding) treatments. Based on our glycogen concentrations results, the golden mussel shows a higher tolerance to starvation (125 days) than has previously been published, which suggests that its tolerance strongly influences its invasive behavior.

AB  - Despite its role as an essential micronutrient, copper (Cu) can be present in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations able to cause adverse health effects on aquatic organisms. Although Cu is acquired by fish by either water or diet, studies that have investigated Cu impacts in fish have mainly focused on the toxicity of waterborne Cu. Moreover, as the majority of experiments were carried out under simplified conditions, little is known about the effects of natural factors other than competitive ions on Cu toxicity in fish. As temperature is a primary factor that affects the physiological state of poikilotherm organisms, we investigated the individual and combined effects of temperature and waterborne or dietary Cu on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of waterborne or dietary Cu at 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Transcriptional and enzymatic responses of various indicators of metabolic capacities as well as indicators of heat, oxidative and metal stresses were measured in fish muscle. Under our experimental conditions, temperature was the most important factor affecting the general condition of fish. Although no significant Cu accumulation was observed in the muscle of Cu-exposed fish, at 20 degrees C, waterborne and dietary Cu triggered significant changes in the transcription level of genes encoding for proteins involved in energy metabolism, metal detoxification and protein protection. Moreover, the response was quantitatively more important for dietary Cu than for waterborne Cu. Combined exposure to heat and Cu triggered the most significant changes in gene transcription levels and enzyme activities. During combined exposure to heat and Cu, in addition to synergistic effects of the two factors, both waterborne and dietary Cu impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to curb heat stress. Reciprocally, temperature impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to combat Cu toxicity. These results suggest that wild fish populations subjected to elevated temperatures due to seasonal warming or global climate change may become more susceptible to Cu pollution, and vice versa.

AB  - Infauna are an ecologically important component of marine benthic ecosystems and are the most common faunal assemblage used to assess habitat quality. Compared to the shallower waters of the continental shelf, less is known about the benthic fauna from the continental slope, especially how the communities are structured by natural gradients and anthropogenic stressors. The present study was conceived to rectify these data gaps and characterize the natural, baseline structure of the benthic infauna of the upper continental slope (200-100 m) of the Southern California Bight. We aggregated benthic infauna, sediment composition, and sediment chemistry data from different surveys across the Southern California Bight region (750 samples from 347 sites) collected between 1972 and 2016. We defined 208 samples to be in reference condition based upon sediment chemistry and proximity to known anthropogenic disturbances. Cluster analysis of the reference samples was used to identify distinct assemblages and the abiotic characteristics associated with each cluster were then used to define habitat characteristics for each assemblage. Three habitats were identified, delineated by geography, depth, and sediment composition. Across the habitats, there were detectable changes in community composition of the non-disturbed fauna through time. However, the uniqueness of the habitats was persistent, as the fauna from each habitat remained taxonomically distinct from irrespective of the decade of their collection. Within each habitat, subtle, assemblage-scale responses to disturbance could be detected, but no consistent patterns could be identified among the component taxa. As with the non-disturbed samples, there were compositional changes in the fauna of the disturbed samples through time. Despite the changes, fauna from disturbed and non-disturbed samples remained taxonomically distinct from each other within each decade of the dataset. After considering both the spatial and temporal patterns in the fauna of slope ecosystem, it became apparent that there was a high degree of stochasticity in the taxonomic organization of all three habitats. This would suggest that the benthic fauna from these communities may be neutrally organized, which in turn poses interesting challenges for future development of condition assessment tools based upon the benthic fauna in these habitats.

AB  - Montane regions throughout western North America have experienced increases in forest canopy closure and forest encroachment into grasslands over the past century; this has been attributed to climate change and fire suppression/exclusion. These changes threaten ecological values and potentially increase probabilities of intense wildfire. Restoration of landscapes to historical conditions has been proposed as a potential solution. We used historical oblique photographs of an area in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada, to determine the vegetation composition in 1909 and then asked whether restoration to a historical vegetation condition would: (1) reduce the overall burn probability of fire; (2) reduce the probability of high-intensity fires; and (3) change the spatial pattern of burn probabilities, as compared to current conditions. We used the Burn-P3 model to calculate the overall and high-intensity burn probabilities in two scenarios: (1) the baseline (current (2014) vegetation composition) and (2) historical restoration (vegetation in the study area as of 1909 with the surrounding landscape in its current condition). In the baseline, the landscape had 50% less grassland and more coniferous forest than 100 yr ago. Except for the fuel grids, we ensured all input parameters (number and locations of ignitions, weather conditions, etc.) were identical between the two scenarios; therefore, any differences in outputs are solely attributable to the changed fuels. The historical restoration scenario reduced the overall burn probability by only 1.3%, but the probability of high-intensity wildfires was reduced by nearly half (44.2%), as compared to the baseline scenario. There were also differences in the spatial pattern of overall burn probabilities between the two scenarios. While 6.7% of the landscape burned with half (or less) the probability in the restoration scenario (compared to the baseline), other areas (3.2%) had burn probabilities two to five times higher. More than 21.5% had high-intensity burn probabilities that were 20% or less of those in the baseline scenario. Differences in burn probabilities between the two scenarios were largely attributable to the effects of the vegetation difference on rate of fire spread. Restoration to historical vegetation structure significantly lowered wildfire risk to the landscape.

AB  - Intense direct and indirect human pressure has been imposed on grasslands throughout their range. Mostly due to the constant need for more food production or due to changes in environmental conditions, grasslands as habitats are expected to become highly endangered. The aim of this study was to estimate the grasslands' ecological response to future climate and environmental changes.
   The study took place in three ecologically different grassland communities in three protected natural areas of Serbia (Southeastern Europe), following the same methodology. The study sites were: 1) Pestersko polje Special Nature Reserve (SNR), 2) Deliblato sands SNR (its southern part: Labudovo okno) and 3) Zasavica SNR.
   Climate change was simulated for mean temperatures and precipitations using the Eta Belgrade University-Princeton Ocean Model (EBU-POM) climate model, for the A1B Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenario covering the 1951-2100 period and insolation and volumetric soil moisture content for the 1979-2100 period.
   Grassland vegetation was analysed at all three sites. One representative plant community per site was selected for further analysis and simulation of ecological changes. One plot was positioned inside each of the above-mentioned communities, all vascular plant species inside the plot were recorded, and soil samples were taken. Ecological Optima (EO) for moisture and temperature were calculated from modified Ellenberg's plant indicator values of recorded species.
   The plants' response to climate and environmental changes was simulated using the VSD+ model for the 2010-2100 period. The data obtained from the model were further analysed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA).
   Overall results show that the temperature rise, along with the irregular precipitation at all three sites, will lead to a drop of the relative abundance of many native species in the period between 2040 and 2060. The low obtained Habitat Suitability Index for the future means that there will be either unfavourable environmental conditions for the development of grasslands, or the species we analysed were untypical. Cosmopolitans and xerothermic species will be more accustomed to the new conditions. Grasses will be the most resilient functional group according to our study.
   It may be concluded that the functional group of grasses will also play the leading role in future grasslands at the studied sites.

AB  - The object of the study are the socio-economic conditions of cities as the basis of marketing potential. The purpose of the study is to identify the role of socio-economic conditions in revealing the marketing potential of cities. The main methods used for the study are matching, comparison, ranking. Our conclusion is that socio-economic conditions cannot always be perceived as the basis for revealing the marketing potential of a city, which is proved by independent studies of the authors, as well as by the analysis of data obtained in the course of other studies. It was possible to establish that socio-economic conditions do not guarantee permanent population growth for cities: the affordability of a basic set of goods and services, a competitive level of income, the availability of higher education institutions and the saturation with health and cultural facilities are not necessarily highly rated by real and potential local residents. This allows us to speak about the need for marketing efforts to attract consumers of a territorial product (socio-economic conditions of a city), it is not enough to have any advantages - it is important to be able to draw attention to them, to ensure the formation of the necessary attitudes regarding the socio-economic conditions of life in cities. Therefore, we are speaking about the need to take into account the nature of consumer demand for the socio-economic conditions of cities and the use of the appropriate type of marketing. The authors have examined a number of examples of applying city types of marketing, such as conversion, incentive, supportive, synchromarketing, remarketing and demarketing.

AB  - Identifying the ecological and anthropogenic processes that affect wildlife physiology, and that may operate as chronic stressors, is of prime importance to implementing appropriate management and conservation strategies. Although advances have been made in understanding the physiological ecology of wild ungulates, little is known of how multiple intrinsic and ecological factors work, either independently or synergistically, to modulate their stress responses. By using faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) as indicators of stress, a set of environmental and human determinants affecting the stress physiology of wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) was examined in the Mediterranean ecosystems of south-western Europe, where this species is subjected to contrasting weather regimes and hunting management systems. Variation-partitioning techniques were also used to estimate the comparative influence of factors related to an individual's intrinsic characteristics, environmental conditions and management practices in shaping physiological stress levels. Our results showed that factors related to hunting management were the main drivers of FGM variation in red deer, followed by those related to the environmental conditions and individuals' traits, and their effects were closely associated to spatio-temporal variability. Holding massive hunting events involving the use of hounds, as well as high population densities, were related to more long-term stress levels in the populations studied. Evidence was also found that supplementary feeding practices may mitigate the negative effects of reduced food availability in overabundant deer populations. Weather conditions were also significant factors explaining variation in stress levels; accumulated rainfall and an increase in ambient temperatures during the coldest months were associated with a decrease in stress hormone levels. No differences in hormonal concentrations were found between males and females, but higher levels of hormone metabolites were detected in younger animals in both sexes. Our findings provide an integrated perspective of how multiple factors impact on stress physiology in large wild herbivores and highlight the importance of considering management practices, as well as spatio-temporal variation, when assessing stress-inducing factors in wild populations. Given the implications of this study regarding the impact of human activities on physiological stress levels in wild animals, it could be an important basis to support wildlife management decisions.

AB  - In the last decades, large amount of effort and resources have been spent in projects and programs aiming to develop rural communities. The ultimate goal of such projects is supposed to be the improvement of the Quality of Life (QOL) of these communities. Although improving the Quality of the Living Conditions (QLC) is an acceptable strategy to reach that goal, all too often there is significant confusion between the two concepts. In this paper we argue that QLC and QOL can not be dissociated, but they are distinct. Our hypothesis is that we can make this distinction objectively. For that purpose, we develop an Index of the Quality of Living Conditions (IQLC) and an Index of the Quality of Life (IQOL). Each index is obtained by combining partial indicators of the conditions of several aspects in several dimensions (e.g., social, environmental, and economic). While the assessment of living conditions to obtain the IQLC is done by project staff, the IQOL is based on the manifestation of the farmers about their satisfaction in living those conditions. The IQLC and the IQOL result, then, from different views of the same aspects of life in a given context. Therefore, their objective measurement can be a useful instrument to evaluate the effectiveness of improvements on living conditions proposed by institutions and their professionals to improve the quality of life of rural communities.

AB  - Water quality assessment protocols based on the use of diatoms are now well developed and their value substantiated at an international level. The use of diatoms is not designed or intended to be a "rapid" technology. The detailed level of information generated from the procedure outweighs perceived disadvantages of the additional time required for sample preparation and analysis to species level. the method is applicable across a wide range of aquatic ecosystem types, namely freshwater, brackish, and estuarine, and is inclusive of both lentic and lotic environments, wetland and their associated damp, marginal and littoral zones. Details provided by diatom assemblages support palaeoecological investigations, historical reconstruction of water quality and the determination of prevailing water quality conditions. Deliberate determination of responses to management strategies or impacts arising from a variety of anthropogenic activities can be achieved via the simple expedient of retrieving living material from introduced artificial substrates. Previous studies in South Africa and elsewhere have shown that on a site-by-site basis the use of diatoms provides a fine level of diagnostic resolution of the causes underlying changes in water quality and environmental condition.
   The South African Diatom Collection ("the Collection"), a repository of diatom specimens and records that spans the length and breadth of this country, contains an as-yet unutilised wealth of ecological and taxonomic information. More importantly, the historical data analysis records provide an insight into water quality conditions prevailing 40 to 50 years ago - in many cases prior to the "development" of many of our rivers, streams and wetlands. The real value of its existence underpins the great potential for renewed attention to the value of diatom-based approaches to water quality assessments. In addition, the Collection provides a ready-made foundation on which a locally relevant tool for water quality assessment may be established to augment the current use of invertebrate indicators.
   It is now appropriate that the full potential of the use of diatoms in water quality assessments, and the information contained in the Collection, be developed and utilised for water quality assessment in South Africa.

AB  - Wetland peat deposits can be excellent archives of past changes in the depositional and ecological conditions under which they formed. Part of the story of these changes can be obtained from analysis of the palynomorphs preserved in these deposits; however, a more meaningful reconstruction can be achieved by combining organic petrography with palynology. An example of this approach is presented from a study of three sites in the northern Everglades of Florida. The primary purpose of this study was to test these combined methods for their utility in distinguishing between long-term, natural successions and recent, anthropogenically-derived disruptions of the ecosystem (such as diversions of drainage and introductions of contaminants from human sources). The combined palyno-petrographic method (supported by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) was able to establish with some certainty the first appearance of contaminant-driven plant types (such as cattails and duckweeds) into the region, with the organic petrography being more accurate in determining the actual presence of invading plants at a particular site and the palynologic analysis providing a broader picture of regional changes in the ecosystem (such as the direction of the plant invasion). The distribution of petrographic pyrite in these freshwater peats provided an additional new piece of evidence for contamination from the agricultural lands and also supported other evidence relative to the direction of contaminant infusion into the region. Additionally, the occurrence of significant quantities of pyrite at all three sites suggests that, in fact, none of these sites can be said to be totally unaffected by anthropogenic contamination. Longer hydroperiods were generally indicated by both methods for all sites before the early 1900s, confirming persistently wetter conditions in the Everglades prior to manmade changes in drainage. More specific paleohydrologic conditions could also be elucidated by this combined method, with all three sites displaying significant differences in hydrologic histories. Additionally, one of the sitesis hypothesized to have been, until recently, in the center of a surface-water flow pathway, as indicated by the continuous presence at this site of deeper water aquatics (such as water lilies) and the smaller number of zones containing algal-derived carbonates and/or other petrographic indicators of oxidation or bioturbation.

AB  - Organisms found on rocky shores must endure harsh environmental conditions during tidal changes but scientific studies on tropical rocky shores are scarce, particularly in Colombian shores. Here we describe the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates associated to the intertidal rocky ecosystems of Gorgona Island, Colombia (Tropical Eastern Pacific). Sampling was carried out in four localities around the Island: La Ventana and La Camaronera (sampled during October 2010) and La Mancora and El Muelle (sampled during March 2011). Two methodologies were used: rapid ecological assessments for qualitative data and quadrats for quantitative data. The richness, abundance, diversity (Shannon-Wiener H'), and evenness (Pielou J') of macroinvertebrates were determined for and compared between, using one way ANOVA, each locality and the three intertidal zones of La Ventana (see methods). One hundred twenty-one species of macroinvertebrates were found during the sampling period. In all localities, Mollusca was the richest and most abundant taxon (46% of the species and 59% of the individuals), followed by Crustacea (32% of the species and 33% of the individuals). The other groups accounted for the remaining 22% of the richness and 8% of the abundance. Several studies have demonstrated that mollusks and crustaceans are the richest and most abundant taxa in marine benthic communities. Most of the abundant species found were herbivores. The species composition varied among zones. The results of dominant species for each zone are consistent with the ones observed in other tropical rocky intertidal shores. All response variables showed a decreasing pattern from the low to the high intertidal (in La Ventana). Post-hoc results indicated that the high intertidal, the zone with the harshest environmental conditions, had significantly lower values than the other two zones for all response variables. Comparisons between the low intertidal zones of the different localities in Gorgona Island showed higher values in all response variables for localities with intertidal pools. The most topographically homogeneous localities showed the lowest richness, abundance, and diversity. Both, tide pools and substrate heterogeneity and/or micro-topography are known to offer refuge against extreme physical conditions to the intertidal dwelling organisms. Results suggest that environmental stress, heterogeneity, and stability are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate species on intertidal rocky shores of Gorgona Island.

AB  - Juvenile Solea senegalensis were exposed to different concentrations of waterborne copper (Cu) for 15 days ill static conditions with continuous aerated artificial salt water at 20 degrees C (+/- 0.8 degrees C with a normal photoperiod (10 h/14 h light/dark) and daily feeding. Several measures of exposure and effects were determined: 1) biomarkers - metallothioneins and lipid peroxidation level; 2) mass indices - growth rate and morphometric condition indices; and 3) biochemical condition indices - RNA:DNA ratio and lipid and protein content in fish tissues. Copper exposure triggered the response of the biomarkers and resulted in reduced growth and condition (RNA:DNA and lipid content), but the morphometric indices did not vary. The physiological costs of Cu contamination on condition Suggested that lipid reserves were allocated as an energy Source to enable exposed fish to respond to Cu toxicity as well as to maintain positive growth rates and protein synthesis throughout the experiment, although with lower growth rates than the control fish. This study showed the importance of selecting suitable biomarkers according to contaminant source, fish Species and their life-history stage. In addition, the use of several biomarkers of exposure, growth and specific condition indices call improve fish health determination and should be considered in evaluations of the effects of environmental contaminants on fish.

AB  - Morphological degradation constitutes one of the most severe threats to the ecological integrity of lakes. The development of biotic assessment methods for human lake shore alterations using littoral macroinvertebrates requires quantification of the degree of degradation by a stressor index and is complicated through simultaneous physical pressures that alter natural habitat structure.
   The Lake Habitat Survey (LHS) method and macroinvertebrate sampling were used to produce a pan-European dataset of morphological lake shore degradation and macroinvertebrate densities covering 51 lakes in seven countries and across four geographical regions - northern, western, southern and central Europe.
   Lake Habitat Survey parameters that differed significantly among three categories of morphological pressure were combined to develop the stressor index components Number of habitats', Habitat diversity', Total percentage volume inhabited by macrophytes', Sum of macrophyte types', Sum of vegetation cover types', Sum of coarse woody debris/roots/overhanging vegetation', Pressure index' (number of human disturbance sources) and Natural/artificial dominant land cover type'.
   Stressor index components were tested for cross-correlations and for differences among pressure levels. The final composition of the stressor index was optimized for the four studied geographical regions in Europe. The resulting stressor index correlated more strongly with macroinvertebrate metrics than simpler site-specific LHS parameters or the HabQA index developed previously in one lake in north-western Europe.
   The stressor index developed provides deeper insight into the morphological pressures that affect littoral invertebrate communities. The results also support the use of LHS to quantify morphological stressors at sampling site level, which can ease developing other multimetric bioassessment methods.
   The stressor index offers the possibility for wide and regional specific application to assess hydromorphological pressures on lakes to assist conservation planning and management and further global efforts to develop and test biotic assessment methods for lakes.

AB  - Anthropogenic N emissions represent a potential threat for forest ecosystems, and environmental indicators that provide insight into the changing forest N cycle are needed. Tree ring N isotopic ratios (delta N-15) appear as a contentious choice for this role as the exact mechanisms behind tree-ring delta N-15 changes seldom benefit from a scrutiny of the soil-to-tree N continuum. This study integrates the results from the analysis of soil chemistry, soil microbiome genomics, and delta N-15 values of soil N compounds, roots, ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi and recent tree rings of thirteen white spruce trees sampled in five stands, from two regions exposed to moderate anthropogenic N emissions (3.9 to 8.1 kg/ha/y) with distinctive delta N-15 signals.
   Our results reveal that airborne anthropogenic N with distinct delta N-15 signals may directly modify the NO3- delta N-15 values in surface soils, but not the ones of NH4+ , the preferred N form of the studied trees. Hence, the tree-ring delta N-15 values reflect specific soil N conditions and assimilation modes by trees. Along with a wide tree-ring delta N-15 range, we report differences in: soil nutrient content and N transformation rates; delta N-15 values of NH4+ , total dissolved N (TDN) and EcM mantle enveloping the root tips; and bacterial and fungal community structures. We combine EcM mantle and root delta N-15 values with fungal identification to infer that hydrophobic EcM fungi transfer N from the dissolved organic N (DON) pool to roots under acidic conditions, and hydrophilic EcM fungi transfer various N forms to roots, which also assimilate N directly under less acidic conditions. Despite the complexities of & nbsp;soil biogeochemical properties and processes identified in the studied sites, in the end, the tree-ring delta N-15 averages inversely correlate with soil pH and anthropogenic N inputs, confirming white spruce tree-ring delta N-15 values as a suitable indicator for environmental research on forest N cycling.

AB  - In the present study, we performed a large-scale protein analysis based on 2-DE DIGE to examine the effects of ozone on the leaves of juvenile European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), one of the most important deciduous tree species in Central Europe. To this end, beech trees were grown under field conditions and subjected to ambient and twice ambient ozone concentrations during the vegetation periods of four consecutive years. The twice ambient ozone concentration altered the abundance of 237 protein spots, which showed relative ratios higher than 30% compared to the ambient control trees. A total of 74 protein spots were subjected to mass spectrometry identification (LC-MS/MS), followed by homology-driven searches. The differentially expressed proteins participate in key biological processes including the Calvin cycle and photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, defense- and stress-related responses, detoxification mechanisms, protein folding and degradation, and mechanisms involved in senescence. The ozone-induced responses provide evidence of a changing carbon metabolism and counteraction against increased levels of reactive oxygen species.
   Biological significance
   This study provides useful information on how European beech, an economically and ecologically important tree species, reacts on the molecular level to increased ozone concentrations expected in the near future. The main emphasis in the present study was placed on identifying differentially abundant proteins after long-term ozone exposure under climatically realistic settings, rather than short-term responses or reactions under laboratory conditions. Additionally, using nursery-grown beech trees, we took into account the natural genotypic variation of this species. As such, the results presented here provide information on molecular responses to ozone in an experimental plant system at very close to natural conditions. Furthermore, this proteomic approach was supported by previous studies on the present experiment. Ultimately, the combination of this proteomic approach with several approaches including transcriptomics, analysis of non-structural carbohydrates, and morphological effects contributes to a more global picture of how beech trees react under increased ozone concentrations.

AB  - Environmental degradation is a global phenomenon with a high likelihood of influencing human quality of life. Effective management responses are needed to achieve societal goals of sustainability. We develop here a new monitoring protocol (Management Check: MATCH) that comprehensively evaluates management outcomes at the operational level. Using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework, we identified pressures influencing ecosystem integrity inside conservation corridors and commercial compartments of a timber production landscape mosaic. They were 1) domestic livestock grazing (the only exogenous pressure), 2) fire management, 3) invasive alien plants (IAPs), and potential soil erosion from two sources: 4) roads, and 5) harvested timber compartments. We assessed the effects of these on wetland and stream buffers. Environmental incidents accounted for more serious management issues (e.g. oil spills). Management responses were systematically unpacked into point-form questions, which formed the building blocks of our monitoring protocol. We assessed management in twelve plantations in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Answers were compared with Best Operational Practice (BOP), and reworked into a Weighted Index of Compliance (WIC) per section. We found that there was poor management of livestock grazing, but good management of IAPs, roads, and timber compartments. Management of wetland and stream buffers was very good. Fire management presented problems linked to lack of direct effects, measurable at the spatial and temporal scales of operations. We discuss operational outcomes within their respective legislative frameworks, and suggest ways of improving management operations, where needed. MATCH is the first monitoring protocol to comprehensively assess environmental management of commercial forestry at the operational level, and to clearly translate operational activities into measurable progress towards strategic goals. In doing so, MATCH breaks down silos and builds bridges for efficient environmental management in dynamic socio-ecological systems. Moreover, the principles developed here can be applied to build tools that help manage major risks in other economic sectors too. Overall, MATCH strengthened strategic and informed action, which is necessary at multiple levels of an organization, to combat major societal risks, such as environmental degradation.

AB  - Grass-fueled fires accelerate grassland expansion into dry Hawaiian woodlands by destroying native forests and by producing a disturbance regime that favors grass-dominated plant communities. Knowledge of grassland phenology is a key component of ecosystem assessments and fire management in Hawaii, but diverse topographic relief and poor field-sampling capabilities make ground studies impractical. Remote sensing offers the best approach for large-scale, spatially contiguous measurements of dryland vegetation phenology and fire fuel conditions. A 500-m spatial resolution, 8-day temporal resolution Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) satellite time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and exposed substrate conditions was developed for the island of Hawaii between 2000 and 2004. The results compared favorably with similar measurements of drylands from higher-resolution aircraft data. The satellite time series was compared with available environmental data on precipitation, fire history, and grazing intensity. From these analyses, the temporal patterns of PV and its conversion to NPV and finally to bare substrate were observed. An NPV buildup following fire of 7 - 8 yr was projected, and more heavily grazed lands were found to exhibit reduced NPV cover, most notably during the summer fire season. These results demonstrate the effects that land use and disturbance history have on fire conditions, and they support the concept that grazed lands managed to reduce litter buildup pose a lower risk of fire across ample geographic scales. Time series of satellite observations with modern analysis techniques can be used with environmental data to support a regional fire-monitoring program throughout Hawaii.

AB  - Our paper focuses on examination and determination of bioindicators. From their existence, condition or behavior judgments might be carried out on the existence of specific environmental indicators and on environmental conditions and changes. The goal of this study was to investigate if and how plants may be used to indicate some of the emissions of landfill sites. Sampling was carried out in the middle of April 2007, 2008, and 2009. The obtained data were compared with a simple floristic list prepared in 1995. Selected bioindicators were used to estimate impact of the landfill on the close vicinity.

AB  - Two hundred and ten pigs were reared in three groups (according to genotype) under enriched conditions of large open-front sawdust-bedded barns. Eight hundred and twenty pigs were reared under standard conditions of small 15-animal pens in a conventional barn with partially slatted floors and natural ventilation. Production parameters including percentage mortality, feed conversion rate and average daily weight gain were calculated at the end of the fattening period. Stomachs, limbs and lungs were examined at slaughter in order to compare the number and severity of lesions between the enriched environment groups and the standard environment group. There was a significantly greater number of esophagogastric lesions in the standard environment group than in the enriched environment groups. No esophagogastric ulcers were observed in any pigs from the enriched groups, while 17.5% of stomachs from pigs in the standard environment group displayed this condition. There were no significant differences in the number of lung lesions associated with enzootic pneumonia between pigs from the standard and enriched environment groups. The limbs of animals reared in the standard environment had more lesions, especially in floor-contact areas, than those reared in the enriched environment (23.84% versus 1.08%). The production parameters measured were improved in the pigs from the enriched environment. These results suggest that the welfare of fattening pigs may be improved by the provision of enrichment in their housing environment. Evaluation of esophagogastric ulceration could be a useful indicator of welfare in pigs.

AB  - The extent and persistence of anoxia in the South Atlantic Ocean during its early opening phase in the Early Cretaceous is not well constrained, hindering a holistic understanding of the processes and mechanisms that drive past changes in water column redox conditions, as well as the impacts of such changes on marine ecosystems. Here we provide high-resolution geochemical records from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 364 that document variations in redox conditions, chemocline depth, marine productivity, and marine ecosystem dynamics in the northern South Atlantic during the Aptian. We show that many of these parameters varied across discrete sedimentary cycles expressed in the Deep Sea Drilling Project 364 succession. Our data indicate that during the initial stages of basin development, anoxic and euxinic conditions were prevalent and occasionally extended into the upper water column. However, strong cyclicity in sedimentological and geochemical parameters imply that the anoxia/euxinia was not a persistent state. We argue that the water column redox conditions during the Aptian were driven by changes in the hydrological cycle, induced by variations in astronomical forcing. We suggest that the episodically amplified hydrological cycle not only enhanced nutrient availability and marine productivity, but might also have caused density-driven upper ocean stratification. The presence of black shales of similar age in other ocean basins suggests that this mechanism is broadly important for the formation of Early Cretaceous organic-rich successions.

AB  - Contemporary advancements in Information Technology and the efforts from various research initiatives in the AEC industry are showing evidence of progress with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). BIM presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions. Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling framework combining these three indicators in providing sustairiability assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A prototype system is implemented using.NET and linked to the BIM enabled software, Revit Structures (TM). The system appraises alternative design solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the utilized information modelling representations - in the form of a process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations - can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at the early stages of the structural design process.

AB  - Human activities have increasingly impacted rivers globally and influence environmental factors at multiple scales: proximal factors (e.g., light and nutrients) and distal controls (e.g., riparian cover and forest area in the basin) that affect benthic metabolism or algal assemblage structure. Function and structure have been studied separately and thus the linkage between them is not well understood. Furthermore, how much of the variability of benthic metabolism can be explained by changes in the environmental variables is inconclusive. We measured the structural and metabolism of epilithic algae in streams across gradients of catchment forest cover (3.5 to 88.6%) and riparian zone canopy cover (0 to 91.0%) in South East Queensland, Australia. Overall net daily metabolism (NDM) on cobbles was positive (gross primary production, GPP exceeded respiration, R) for all but three of the 34 sites. Chl a biomass of benthic algae on cobbles ranged from 1.37 to 178.05 mg m(-2). Shaded streams had the highest percentage of diatoms (95.4%), while the least shaded streams were dominated by cyanobacteria (82.2%). Partial least squares (PLS) regression modeling showed that most of the variation in GPP, R, and NDM was explained by light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD), phosphorus concentration in water, water temperature, and the percentage of mid-dense forest upstream of the site. Path analysis (structural equation modeling, SEM) indicated that, as a surrogate for metabolism, diatom (Bacillariophyta) density was the best predictor of GPP and NDM when we assessed the environmental process in the streams. In comparison, Chl a, which has been traditionally used as a surrogate for measurements of GPP or NDM, performed well only when the percentage of diatoms in the epilithic algal community exceeded 75%. Our results also indicated that both the structure and function of benthic algal communities were sensitive to anthropogenic modifications, including riparian vegetation and forest cover in the catchment in river ecosystems.

AB  - Ecological regions are areas of similar nature in terms of environmental features. Examination of the correspondence between organismal assemblage structure and function at different levels of spatial scale is crucial regarding pond conservation, especially in unexplored areas as continental austral Patagonia, where the extensive sheep breeding has been the historical land use. We assessed relationships between invertebrate assemblages and environmental characteristics at local (hydrogeomorphology and genesis) and landscape scale (phytogeographical and biozones) on 20 isolated wetland ponds (Southern Patagonia, Argentina). Additionally, we recognized best environmental predictors of invertebrate community attributes using generalized linear models (GLM). Most ponds displayed low anthropogenic stress since most of them were far from urban and rural settlements. Even though a few sites showed strong oxygen depletion (n = 3), most were well oxygenated ( > 85%, > 11 mg/l). Also, ponds had low ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorus contents ( > 60%, 25 mu g/l). A total of 80 invertebrate taxa were found, with Insecta and Oligochaeta displaying the highest richness. Cyanallagma interruptum (Anisoptera), Parapsectrocladius sp. and Parachironomus sp. (Chironomidae) were the most abundant taxa. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed that local environmental factors greatly explained the abundance patterns of invertebrates. In addition, variance partitioning analyses displayed that taxa responded more strongly to pond genesis (7% of variation) than to the other levels of spatial scale analyzed. Structural and functional attributes of communities (metrics) also showed that genesis (local scale) resulted a reliable predictor. Thus, the community composition changed according to fluvial, glacigenic, mass removal or anthropogenic origin of the ponds. Our results suggest that ponds across the austral continental Patagonia area appeared as crucial reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity sustaining several endemic taxa. However, the expansion of new agricultural and land use practices in surrounding areas could impact negatively on pond integrity. Conservation programs should include major constrains at both, local and landscape scale, in which part of the physical complexity is driving by pond origin.

AB  - Aquatic biomonitoring has become an essential task in Europe and many other regions as a consequence of strong anthropogenic pressures affecting the health of lakes, rivers, oceans and groundwater. A typical assessment of the environmental quality status, such as it is required by European but also North American and other legislation, relies on matching the composition of assemblages of organisms identified using morphological criteria present in aquatic ecosystems to those expected in the absence of anthropogenic pressures. Through decade-long and difficult intercalibration exercises among networks of regulators and scientists in European countries, a pragmatic biomonitoring approach was developed and adopted, which now produces invaluable information. Nonetheless, this approach is based on several hundred different protocols, making it susceptible to issues with comparability, scale and resolution. Furthermore, data acquisition is often slow due to a lack of taxonomic experts for many taxa and regions and time-consuming morphological identification of organisms. High-throughput genetic screening methods such as (e)DNA metabarcoding have been proposed as a possible solution to these shortcomings. Such "next-generation biomonitoring", also termed "biomonitoring 2.0", has many advantages over the traditional approach in terms of speed, comparability and costs. It also creates the potential to include new bioindicators and thereby further improves the assessment of aquatic ecosystem health. However, several major conceptual and technological challenges still hinder its implementation into legal and regulatory frameworks. Academic scientists sometimes tend to overlook legal or socioeconomic constraints, which regulators have to consider on a regular basis. Moreover, quantification of species abundance or biomass remains a significant bottleneck to releasing the full potential of these approaches. Here, we highlight the main challenges for next-generation aquatic biomonitoring and outline principles and good practices to address these with an emphasis on bridging traditional disciplinary boundaries between academics, regulators, stakeholders and industry.

AB  - The purposes and intent of the authorities in establishing water quality standards are to provide enhancement of water quality and prevention of pollution to protect the public health or welfare in accordance with the public interest for drinking water supplies, conservation of fish, wildlife and other beneficial aquatic life, and agricultural, industrial, recreational, and other reasonable and necessary uses as well as to maintain and improve the biological integrity of the waters. In this way, water quality controls involve a large number of variables and observations, often subject to some outliers. An outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data or that appears to deviate markedly from other members of the sample in which it occurs. An interesting analysis is to find those observations that produce measurements that are different from the pattern established in the sample. Therefore, identification of atypical observations is an important concern in water quality monitoring and a difficult task because of the multivariate nature of water quality data. Our study provides a new method for detecting outliers in water quality monitoring parameters, using turbidity, conductivity and ammonium ion as indicator variables. Until now, methods were based on considering the different parameters as a vector whose components were their concentration values. This innovative approach lies in considering water quality monitoring over time as continuous curves instead of discrete points, that is to say, the dataset of the problem are considered as a time-dependent function and not as a set of discrete values in different time instants. This new methodology, which is based on the concept of functional depth, was applied to the detection of outliers in water quality monitoring samples in the Nalon river basin with success. Results of this study were discussed here in terms of origin, causes, etc. Finally, the conclusions as well as advantages of the functional method are exposed.

AB  - Ecological indicators are science-based tools used to assess how human activities have impacted environmental resources. For monitoring and environmental assessment, existing species assemblage data can be used to make these comparisons through time or across sites. An impediment to using assemblage data, however, is that these data are complex and need to be simplified in an ecologically meaningful way. Because multivariate statistics are mathematical relationships, statistical groupings may not make ecological sense and will not have utility as indicators. Our goal was to define a process to select defensible and ecologically interpretable statistical simplifications of assemblage data in which researchers and managers can have confidence. For this, we chose a suite of statistical methods, compared the groupings that resulted from these analyses, identified convergence among groupings, then we interpreted the groupings using species and ecological guilds. When we tested this approach using a statewide stream fish dataset, not all statistical methods worked equally well. For our dataset, logistic regression (Log), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), cluster analysis (CL), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) provided consistent, simplified output. Specifically, the Log, DCA, CL-1, and NMDS-1 groupings were >= 60% similar to each other, overlapped with the fluvial-specialist ecological guild, and contained a common subset of species. Groupings based on number of species (e.g., Log, DCA, CL and NMDS) outperformed groupings based on abundance [e.g., principal components analysis (PCA) and Poisson regression]. Although the specific methods that worked on our test dataset have generality, here we are advocating a process (e.g., identifying convergent groupings with redundant species composition that are ecologically interpretable) rather than the automatic use of any single statistical tool. We summarize this process in step-by-step guidance for the future use of these commonly available ecological and statistical methods in preparing assemblage data for use in ecological indicators.

AB  - This field study tested the hypothesis that domestic horses living under putatively challenging-to-welfare conditions (for example involving social, spatial, feeding constraints) would present signs of poor welfare and cooccurring pessimistic judgement biases. Our subjects were 34 horses who had been housed for over 3 years in either restricted riding school situations (e.g. kept in single boxes, with limited roughage, ridden by inexperienced riders; N = 25) or under more naturalistic conditions (e.g. access to freerange, kept in stable social groups, leisure riding; N = 9). The horses' welfare was assessed by recording health-related, behavioural and postural indicators. Additionally, after learning a location task to discriminate a bucket containing either edible food ('positive' location) or unpalatable food ('negative' location), the horses were presented with a bucket located near the positive position, near the negative position and halfway between the positive and negative positions to assess their judgement biases. The riding school horses displayed the highest levels of behavioural and health-related problems and a pessimistic judgment bias, whereas the horses living under more naturalistic conditions displayed indications of good welfare and an optimistic bias. Moreover, pessimistic bias data strongly correlated with poor welfare data. This suggests that a lowered mood impacts a non-human species' perception of its environment and highlights cognitive biases as an appropriate tool to assess the impact of chronic living conditions on horse welfare.

AB  - Using a representative sample of stands from a cross section through the Bavarian portion of the northern Calcareous Alps, this study evaluates the plausibility and significance of causal hypotheses for an explanation of the poor crown condition of Norway spruce in mountain forests: (1) ozone exposure in conjunction with (a) drought and (b) ample water supply; (2) soil-borne nutrient deficiency; (3) drought; and (4) tree age. Site index and, in a subset of stands, foliar nutrient concentrations are considered as additional indicators of tree vigour. According to principal component analysis and multiple regression, crown condition was controlled by soil chemistry (transparency increased towards shallow calcareous soils), stand age and, to a smaller degree, by an interaction between ozone exposure and drought. Site index was best explained by a model including elevation, soil chemistry and drought. Tree nutrition clearly reflected the main soil chemical gradient, and P, N and Fe deficiencies were found in transparent stands, which had markedly smaller needles. The similar distributions of crown transparency, site index and nutrition present a strong argument for the hypothesis that soil chemistry has constrained the vigour of spruce trees in the Calcareous Alps for a long time. By leaving unproductive stands to age naturally, forest management has accentuated the pattern of crown condition. In the heterogeneous alpine landscape, possible effects of recent increases in ozone exposure have to be viewed extremely carefully against the background of these natural and anthropogenic covariables.

AB  - Creation of plant associations with maximum stability of yields in the regional ecological conditions for which they have been designed is key in modern agriculture. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the environment on productivity and stability of six grass associations (red fescue, pure stand; red fescue and birdsfoot trefoil; red fescue, tall fescue and birdsfoot trefoil; red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass; red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and alfalfa; red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and birdsfoot trefoil) in four locations (mountain slope with eastern, western, northern and south-eastern facing direction). Methods of dispersion, regression and nonparametric analysis were used to evaluate the stability of the mixtures. According to the productivity during the 13-year study period and the calculated stability parameters, the triple mixture of red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and alfalfa was the highest yielding mixture, but this mixture also manifested itself as unstable. The lower yielding mixed sward of red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass and the pure stand of red fescue were also distinguished by low adaptive ability. In the conditions of the Middle Balkan Mountains, the mixture of red fescue, tall fescue and birdsfoot trefoil was characterised to have the most favourable combination of productivity and ecological stability, and was considered suitable for growing in a wide range of environmental conditions. As a whole, the swards on the mountain slopes with eastern and south-eastern exposure were more productive but had low stability compared to those grown on western and northern exposure.

AB  - Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the food-energy-water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally.

AB  - 1. Ponds are particularly rich habitats and play an essential role in the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. Therefore it is necessary to develop a specific method for evaluating their biological integrity, and particularly their water quality. Metrics have proved to be efficient for studies on running waters. Such an approach would be particularly useful for ponds and therefore needs to be tested.
   2. Eight metrics based on the richness of invertebrates and amphibians and 73 others derived from the biological/ecological trait categories linked to Coleoptera, Odonata and Gastropoda were tested for their potential as indicators of the trophic state of 94 ponds in Switzerland. The relationships between these metrics and the state of water eutrophication were explored.
   3. Four metrics based on richness responded to excessive nutrient levels in the colline vegetation belt. These were: aquatic Coleoptera species richness; the pooled species richness of aquatic Coleoptera, aquatic Gastropoda, adult Odonata and Amphibia (COGA); the family-level richness of macroinvertebrates and the family-level richness of the combined Megaloptera and Odonata groups (MO). At altitudes above 800 M (i.e. montane-subalpine and alpine vegetation belts), two to four other metrics were identified as pond water-quality indicators.
   4. Furthermore, many trait categories were sensitive to excessive nutrient levels. In the colline belt, 13 out of the 33 metrics derived from the biological/ecological traits responded to an increase in the trophic state (i.e. at least one metric for each of the three invertebrate groups tested). However, the patterns of the relationships are unclear and further investigations are required to identify and select the relevant metrics for an assessment of water quality.
   5. In conclusion, for the future assessment of pond quality, four metrics derived from richness could be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to identify the biological/ecological traits that could be combined with these richness metrics. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Globally, ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic pressure; thus, many are at risk of elimination. This situation has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to propose a quantitative approach to ecosystem-risk assessment. However, there is a need for their proposed criteria to be evaluated through practical examples spanning a diverse range of ecosystems and scales. We applied the IUCN's ecosystem red-list criteria, which are based on changes in extent of ecosystems and reductions in ecosystem processes, to New Zealand's 72 naturally uncommon ecosystems. We aimed to test the applicability of the proposed criteria to ecosystems that are naturally uncommon (i.e., those that would naturally occur over a small area in the absence of human activity) and to provide information on the probability of ecosystem elimination so that conservation priorities might be set. We also tested the hypothesis that naturally uncommon ecosystems classified as threatened on the basis of IUCN Red List criteria contain more threatened plant species than those classified as nonthreatened. We identified 18 critically endangered, 17 endangered, and 10 vulnerable ecosystems. We estimated that naturally uncommon ecosystems contained 145 (85%) of mainland New Zealand's taxonomically distinct nationally critical, nationally endangered, and nationally vulnerable plant species, 66 (46%) of which were endemic to naturally uncommon ecosystems. We estimated there was a greater number of threatened plant species (per unit area) in critically endangered ecosystems than in ecosystems classified as nonthreatened. With their high levels of endemism and rapid and relatively well-documented history of anthropogenic change, New Zealand's naturally uncommon ecosystems provide an excellent case-study for the ongoing development of international criteria for threatened ecosystems. We suggest that interactions and synergies among decline in area, decline in function, and the scale of application of the criteria be used to improve the IUCN criteria for threatened ecosystems.

AB  - Suboptimal animal welfare may affect natural immunity, rendering animals more susceptible to environmentally conditioned diseases, including those requiring antimicrobial treatment, which may promote antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial populations. Herewith, we tested the hypothesis that conventionally raised turkeys have higher levels of AMR in indicator Escherichia coli bacteria, but lower levels of natural immunity, as compared to turkeys reared under organic conditions. Litter and serum samples were collected from 28 conventional and 4 organic turkey farms: E. coli isolates from litter were tested for resistance to 14 antimicrobials, while 3 parameters of natural immunity (i.e., lysozyme, hemolytic complement levels, and serum bactericidal activity) were assessed in the sera. Resistant E. coli isolates were identified in both conventional and organic farms but generally more frequently in conventional farms. High rates of resistance to ampicillin (96%), tetracycline (95%), streptomycin (82%), sulfamethoxazole (80%), ciprofloxacin (73%), and trimethoprim (71%), as well as high rates of multiresistance, were observed in conventional farms. Organically raised turkeys had significantly higher levels of lysozyme and serum bactericidal activity than conventional turkeys, and these levels were also higher in turkeys housed in farms where AMR frequency was lower. Findings support the hypothesis that conventional farming conditions may affect turkeys' natural immunity, rendering the animals more susceptible to environmentally conditioned diseases requiring antimicrobial treatment, which would in turn promote AMR. Reducing AMR in turkey farming is therefore more likely to be successful when considering animal welfare as an option to reduce the need of antimicrobial use.

AB  - In this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the hydrological alterations of a temporary river. In these rivers, it is expected that anthropogenic pressures largely modify low-flow components of the flow regime with consequences for aquatic habitat and diversity in invertebrate species. First, by using a simple hydrological index (IARI) river segments of the Celone stream (southern Italy) whose hydrological regime is significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities have been identified. Hydrological alteration has been further classified through the analysis of two metrics: the degree (M-f) and the predictability of dry flow conditions (Sd(6)). Measured streamflow data were used to calculate the metrics in present conditions (impacted). Given the lack of data from pristine conditions, simulated streamflow time series were used to calculate the metrics in reference conditions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to estimate daily natural streamflow. Hydrological alterations associated with water abstractions, point discharges and the presence of a reservoir were assessed by comparing the metrics (M-f, Sd(6)) before and after the impacts. The results show that the hydrological regime of the river segment located in the upper part of the basin is slightly altered, while the regime of the river segment downstream of the reservoir is heavily altered. This approach is intended for use with ecological metrics in defining the water quality status and in planning streamflow management activities.

AB  - Infauna have an intimate relationship with the sediments they inhabit, and any study conducted upon infauna must, at the very least, describe sediment conditions. Common sediment assessments in intertidal systems include particle size distribution, as well as water and organic matter contents. These measures require extracting and processing a sediment core, and this disturbance may result in data that do not necessarily reflect in situ conditions. Sediment penetrability measured in situ using a penetrometer can circumvent this limitation. However, relationships between sediment penetrability and other sediment variables are poorly understood, especially in coastal systems. We evaluated the relationship between sediment penetrability and depth to the apparent redox potential discontinuity, mean particle size, organic matter content, and water content on tidal flats along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada. We also assessed whether adding penetrability into environmental models of the infaunal community improved model performance. We observed that while penetrability is statistically related to other sediment variables, relationships to covariates were weak. Further, inclusion of penetrability with other sediment variables improved the performance of models predicting infaunal community composition. Therefore, penetrability can be considered a separate variable, and contributes to an integrated assessment of environmental conditions experienced by biota. Finally, since we evaluated this method in different soft-sediment intertidal ecosystems (mudflats to sandflats), this method is applicable to a range of systems in other geographical areas.

AB  - In the United States, rangelands and pasturelands have traditionally been assessed using different methods and indicators. The most commonly used rangeland health assess ment protocol on US rangelands is the Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (HRH) assessment, while pasturelands are usually assessed using the Pasture Condition Score (PCS) system. The IIRH method provides a way of detecting changes in ecological attributes relative to a site's ecological potential. PCS informs managers about the utility of an area for livestock production or factors that could be keeping the area from operating at its full or optimized productive potential. There is a need for an improved grazingland assessment tool that merges the relevant elements of bOth the rangeland and pastureland assessment methods while taking into account the differing ecosystem attributes and management objectives of the grazinglands where these methods are usually applied. We use IIRH and PCS data collected at two locations in the Northern Great Plains of the United States to describe our approach and demonstrate its usefulness. We present an improved grazingland assessment protocol that is applicable to range and pasturelands that highlights the complementarity of the IIRH and PCS approaches. This improved assessment and monitoring protocol allows evaluators to assess site conditions and to make interpretations regarding management based on site-specific attributes. Standardized grazingland assessment and monitoring protocols based on ecological and land management principles will ultimately improve national level assessments and will provide a valuable and efficient tool for assessing, managing, and monitoring grazinglands.

AB  - In this work, real life reclaimed plastic solid waste (PSW) secured from the municipal sector was mechanically recycled and compounded with virgin linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The compounding of the plastic film samples utilised the means of extrusion and blown filming to produce various formulations of the blends containing up to 100% (by weight) of the PSW in the examined specimens. The film samples were compared to market products used in the State of Kuwait where PSW accumulation presents a major obstacle. Natural weathering under arid and harsh climatic conditions was also performed to determine the degradation extent of the film samples. Haze (%), light transmission (%) and the total change in colour (AE) were measured as indicators to the degradation profile of the polymeric materials, in addition to tensile pull mechanical properties. Properties were noted to deteriorate as a function of weathering time and waste content. Statistical analysis was also performed on the properties measured and climatic conditions including airborne pollutants levels. The abundance of the secondary airborne pollutant (ozone) was determined to be a significant variable on the studied properties. This can be attributed to induced photo-oxidation the polymeric matrix is subjected to under such climatic conditions which increases oxygen diffusion throughout the polymeric matrix. Future development of the recycled blends studied in this work can be a route for the decrease of associated environmental stressors with virgin plastic resin conversion.

AB  - Ecological monitoring research relies heavily on signals to detect ecosystem changes, making the selection of indicators a crucial methodological requirement. Over the years, individual species and species assemblages have been widely used, thereby, giving rise to reference methods that support the detection of ecological indicators. One such method, the Indicator Value Analysis (IndVal), has been adapted to identify not only species but also combinations of species, assuming collective responses to environmental factors. However, the IndVal method requires a pre-selection of species before performing the analysis, especially in the case of large datasets (e.g. high species richness), when it becomes ineffective. Species pre-selection might introduce subjectivity and a bias into the database, which can cause possible impacts on the final set of indicators. To address these issues, the authors propose the use of Market Basket Analysis (MBA) - a data mining method - which is mathematically similar to IndVal but designed to handle large amounts of data. Both methods were applied to select indicators from gradually larger datasets of Soil Surface Dwelling Arthropods from the Brazilian Amazon, using threshold-dependent indices to assess concordance between results. In general, the results obtained by applying both methods were found to be similar, with an average Jaccard's distance of 0.432 (+/- 0.346) and an average True Skill Statistic of 0.991 (+/- 0.012). As expected, MBA was able to select ecological indicators without species pre-selection as well as from datasets where IndVal had been unsuccessful. In such cases, and by means of objective association rules, the authors demonstrate that MBA could be used to pre-select ecological indicators, which can then be further processed and summarized with the IndVal method. In this study, the authors briefly outline the potential of MBA to complement IndVal and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using MBA for ecological indicators (pre-) selection.

AB  - Estuaries provide enumerable ecosystem services to mankind in terms of provisional, regulating, supporting, recreational and information services. However, the persistent human-environment interactions for these services altered the ecological integrity of estuaries. Although the small estuaries receive little attraction in scientific studies due to their low surface area and regional importance, these ecosystems are more vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures and require urgent attention from the scientific fraternity. The Terekhol Estuary (TRE) is a small tropical estuary situated along Goa, west coast of India, gaining recognition in recent years due to the pollution risk from tourism activities. Moreover, the estuary also behaves as an extension of the marine realm during the dry season. The food web structure and network flow indices of the TRE was assessed to reveal its present ecological status. The Ecopath modelling approach was employed to delineate the ecosystem structure and trophic functioning of the estuary distributed in 22 ecological compartments from 2018 to 2019. The trophic level of the food web ranged from detritus (TL-1) to sharks (TL-4.53). The ecosystem structure demonstrated a grazing chain (herbivory) based organization over the detritus-based pathway. The proportion of exports to the total flows was 35% for the TRE. The model has a high total system throughput (12,043.6 t km-2 year-1), low system omnivory index (0.17) and connectance index (0.21), and a moderate relative ascendency (45.1%). Finn's cycling index (2.17%) indicated very low recycling in the system. All these indicators along with the eco-exergy index (8567.22 g detritus equivalent m-2), specific eco-exergy (38.25) and robustness index (0.11) classified the estuary as be immature, less stable and less organized and is in the initial stages of its development. The ecological indicators analyzed here point towards a medium to a high level of impact in the TRE due to anthropogenic activities. We also highlight the management measures to be implemented in order to restore the ecological quality of the TRE.

AB  - Fishes are indicators of aquatic ecosystem wellbeing globally and used when understanding impacts from water resources. The behavioural ecology of fishes as a Line of Evidence (LoE) is between 10 and 100 times more responsive to changes in environmental variables, compared with traditional LoEs including standard mortality bioassay LoEs. Fish telemetry methods are available to monitor fish behaviour and the response of tagged fish to altered water quality, flow and instream habitat variability exist globally. Developing regions have relatively poor use of fish telemetry as a methodology to gather behavioural information, compared with developed regions for various reasons. Fish telemetry methods can assist in answering water resource management questions faced in developing regions. For this purpose, we describe the development of the southern African inland fish tracking (FISHTRAC) programme and its use for collecting fish behaviour, and water quality and quantity data in real-time and remotely. We also detail eight case studies that contributed to FISHTRAC over the past decade. The FISHTRAC programme was initially based on internationally recognised radio telemetry methods that were then adapted for application in southern Africa. Developments within the FISHTRAC programme have seen radio telemetry methods expand beyond manual monitoring techniques to incorporate a real-time and remote monitoring feature. The case studies demonstrated the development of FISHTRAC's functionality; data management systems, real-time communications and data evaluations. This included its implementation in five economically important freshwater ecosystems across southern Africa and using eight large charismatic fish species. Following the description of the FISHTRAC programme, we provide a four-phase guideline to successfully implement radio telemetry methods to obtain behavioural information of fishes and contribute to the essential management and monitoring of fisheries and water resources within the southern Africa context, applicable globally with continued anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Water quality is an important determinant for the structural integrity of alloy cladded fuels and assemblies during long-term wet storage. Detailed characterization of a water filled storage basin for spent nuclear reactor fuel was performed following the formation and proliferation of an amorphous white flocculent. White precipitant was sampled throughout the storage basin for chemical and spectroscopic characterization, and environmental DNA was extracted for 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity. Accordingly, spectroscopic analyses indicated the precipitant to be primarily amorphous to crystalline aluminum (oxy) hydroxides with minor associated elemental components including Fe, Si, Ti, and U. High levels of organic carbon were co-localized with the precipitant relative to bulk dissolved organic concentrations. Bacterial densities were highly variable between sampling locations and with depth within the water filled storage basin; cell numbers ranged from 4 x 10(3)to 4 x 10(4) cells/mL. Bacterial diversity that was physically associated with the aluminum (oxy) hydroxide complexes exceeded an estimated 4,000 OTUs/amplicon library (3% cutoff) and the majority of sequences were aligned to the families Burkholderiaceae (23%), Nitrospiraceae (23%), Hyphomicrobiaceae (17%), and Comamonadaceae (6%). We surmise that episodic changes in the physical and chemical properties of the basin contribute to the polymerization of aluminum (oxy) hydroxides, which in turn can chemisorb nutrients, carbon ligands and bacterial cells from the surrounding bulk aqueous phase. As such, these precipitants should establish favorable microhabitats for bacterial colonization and growth. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries across a selection of natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems were performed and microbial community and taxonomic signatures unique to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage basin environment were revealed. These insights could spur the development of tractable bio-indicators that are specific of and diagnostic for water quality at discrete locations and finer scales of resolution, marking an important contribution for improved water quality and management of SNF storage facilities.

AB  - One of the major objective of domestication is the selection of lines with low aggressiveness and a high growth potential. Analyses of domesticated animals traits often illustrate numerous changes in behaviour due to rearing environment. However there are few reports of these changes in fish. In the present paper, we first describe how behaviour is affected by rearing and then discuss how sensory organs and behavioural abilities are modified during development under breeding conditions.
   Rearing conditions modify feeding behaviour particularly because food distribution do not necessary follow biological rhythm and food is often available in larger amount compared to wild-type situations. In particular food distribution mode may favour aggressiveness. Rearing conditions (stream, fish density...) are also susceptible to modify spatial distribution of fish and relationship between fish in their closed environment. In particular, fish often reduce their inter-individual distances which may also have detrimental influences on their aggressiveness.
   Several behavioural abilities seem to be affected by development in breeding conditions and this appears to be related to modification of sensory organs. This includes modification of the lateral line system, eye and smell. These modifications are often associated to a lowering of watchfulness threshold which in turn modifies behaviour and particularly escape responses from potential predators. A modification of chromatic adaptation has also been shown for flat fishes.
   In conclusion, the analysis of behavioural modifications is of utmost importance to identify indicators of domestication progress which must be taken into account to guarantee cultured fish welfare and thus rearing sustainability.

AB  - Coniferous trees at the alpine and polar tree lines of the Northern Hemisphere represent the outermost limit of their ecological range. Under such conditions, even small temperature variations may cause growth responses, which therefore can be used as indicators for changing environmental conditions. In this study we analysed the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient at six locations in the polar and alpine tree-line ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We evaluated the effect of climatic trends on pine growth in relation to tree age and region, specifying a northern and a southern region in the study area. We found a response of Scots pine to climatic variations until the 1980s, but not to the current warming period. Increasing growth trends could be detected since 2000 in the radial growth of southern located trees, predominantly of juvenile ages, while the northern trees did not respond significantly to the current warming. In the north recent warmer and wetter conditions during winter time, inducing snow loads, wind damages, diseases and frost damages possibly masked the benefits of warmer conditions. The missing link between warming and radial growth would affect the use of tree-rings as proxy for past climate and for predittions for forest extension in polar-alpine tree-line sites.

AB  - As the most important indicator of the coastal ecosystem, various studies on phytoplankton have frequently been proposed in coastal waters. In this study, the statistical analysis of phytoplankton biomass (in terms of chlorophyll a) is performed in the Wadden Sea near Lauwersoog (53.4167 degrees N, 6.2000 degrees E), The Netherlands, determined by the 10-year's historical dataset from 2000 through 2009. Boxplot analysis is introduced to give insight in the seasonal variations of phytoplankton biomass and physical-chemical conditions. Annually, a big difference is found in chlorophyll a, showing that the maximum values occur in the months of April and July, and the minimum values occur in winter (December, January, and February). The phytoplankton biomass is positively correlated with the physical conditions (salinity, light intensity, and water temperature), and is negatively correlated with the nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, and silicate). Factor analysis distinguishes the driving variables that represent most of the total variance using three extraction methods (principal component analysis, unweighted least squares, and maximum likelihood). Nitrate dominates the main activity in the first rotated component/factor, and ammonium contributes the most in the second rotated component/factor. The findings of this study are significant for understanding the roles of the environmental conditions upon the phytoplankton variability, and for reducing the overlapping information to characterize the driving variables.

AB  - Assessments of watershed condition for aquatic and riparian species often have to rely on expert opinion because of the complexity of establishing statistical relationships among the many factors involved. Such expert-based assessments can be difficult to document and apply consistently over time and space. We describe and reflect on the process of developing a computer-based decision support application from expert judgments for assessing aquatic and riparian conditions over the 100,000 km(2) managed by the US federal government under the Northwest Forest Plan. The decision support system helped structure and document the assessment process and provided consistency and transparency to the evaluation methodology. However, many decisions and trade-offs were required in the expert engagement and model-building processes. Knowledge elicitation in an interactive group had a number of benefits over nominal group or Delphi processes, but efficient knowledge capture required considerable planning and expertise in the subject matter and modeling process. Communicating model results for validation was problematic and only effectively accomplished via in-person workshops. The choice to use different expert groups for each biophysical province provided more opportunities for participation and promoted greater ownership in the assessment, but it also led to increased variation among the resulting model structures. We propose three possible approaches for better managing the consistency of assessment models when multiple expert groups are involved.

AB  - In the present study, developmental stability of leaf traits was examined in three natural populations of Plantago major L. (ssp. major), representing two polluted environments (Karaburma and Zemun) and an unpolluted area (Crni Lug). Developmental stability was assessed as fluctuating asymmetry (FA). The magnitude of FA is believed to reflect differences in the ability of individuals to buffer their development in natural populations. We hypothesized that there are differences within characters and among characters in response to environmental conditions. Significant patterns of asymmetry correlations and asymmetry changes were detected both within characters and between characters. The manova results revealed a significant effect of individual and a significant individual x environment interaction on actual asymmetry (logLi - logRi) and on the amount of asymmetry |(logLi - logRi)| for leaf width and vein distances within a leaf. Over time, statistically significant and positive correlations of the FA values were detected for each trait separately per sample (population). For both leaf traits, there were differences for (logLi - logRi) and |(logLi - logRi)| asymmetry values among individuals within samples in response to yearly variations. Statistically significant and negative correlations for (logLi - logRi) versus |(logLi - logRi)| asymmetries were detected for both leaf traits. In summary, our results highlight the importance of differences in the ability of individuals to buffer their development under different environmental conditions and point to the concept that developmental stability is character specific.

AB  - Natural fluctuations in flow are important for maintaining the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems. However, the flow regime of many rivers has been modified. We assessed the impact of water chemistry, habitat and streamflow characteristics on macroinvertebrates and benthic algae, comparing 20 regulated with 20 unregulated sites. Flow regime, calculated from daily averaged discharge over the five years preceding sampling, was generally more stable at regulated sites, with higher relative discharges in winter, lower relative discharges in spring and smaller differences between upper and lower percentiles. However, no consistent differences in benthic algal or macroinvertebrate structural and functional traits occurred between regulated and unregulated sites. When regulated and unregulated sites were pooled, overall flow regime, calculated as principal components of discharge characteristics over the five years preceding sampling, affected macroinvertebrate species assemblages, but not indices used for ecosystem status assessment or functional feeding groups. This indicates that, while species identity shifted with changing flow regime, the exchanged taxa had similar feeding habits. In contrast to macroinvertebrates, overall flow regime did not affect benthic algae. Our results indicate that overall flow regime affected the species pool of macroinvertebrates from which recolonization after extreme events may occur, but not of benthic algae. When individual components of flow regime were analyzed separately, high June (i.e. three months before sampling) flow maxima were associated with low benthic algal taxon richness, presumably due to scouring. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness decreased with lower relative minimum discharges, presumably due to temporary drying of parts of the riverbed. However, recolonization after such extreme events presumably is fast. Generally, macroinvertebrate and benthic algal assemblages were more closely related to water physico-chemical than to hydrological variables. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrate and benthic algal indices commonly used for ecological status assessment are applicable also in regulated rivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The freshwater painter's mussel (Unio pictorum) was used as sentinel species to assess the chemical disturbance in an Italian river (the river Cecina) characterized by elevated levels of trace metals of both natural and anthropogenic origin. Organisms were transplanted for 4 weeks in different locations of the river basin and the bioaccumulation of metals was integrated with a wide battery of biomarkers consisting of oxidative, genotoxic and lysosomal responses. Such parameters included the levels of individual antioxidants (catalase, glutathione-S-transferases, glutathione reductase, Se-dependent and Se-independent glutathione peroxidases, total glutathione), the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), metallothionein-like proteins, the assessment of DNA integrity, chromosomal damages and lysosomal membrane stability. Elevated levels of several metals were measured in sediments, but the relatively low tissue concentrations suggested a moderate bioaccumulation, possibly due to a high excretion efficiency, of U. pictorum and/or to a limited bioavailability of these elements, partly deriving from erosion of bedrocks. Among antioxidant responses, those based on glutathione metabolism and the activity of catalase were mostly affected in bivalves showing a significant accumulation of arsenic, mercury and/or nickel. In these specimens, the content of glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidases (H2O2) were respectively 9-, 6- and 4-fold lower than in controls, while a 3-fold increase was observed for catalase. Despite some differences in the response of individual antioxidants, a significant reduction of the capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals was observed in bivalves caged in all the impacted sites of the river basin; these organisms also exhibited a significant impairment at the DNA, chromosomal and lysosomal levels. Considering the mild contamination gradient in the investigated area, the overall results suggested that some oxidative biomarkers, as well as those evaluating chromosomal and cell damages, are highly sensitive and could be profitably applied to caged painter's mussels for environmental quality assessment in freshwater.

AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are considered the model species for the controlled biomineralization of magnetic Fe oxide (magnetite, Fe3O4) or Fe sulfide (greigite, Fe3S4) nanocrystals in living organisms. In MTB, magnetic minerals form as membrane-bound, single-magnetic domain crystals known as magnetosomes and the synthesis of magnetosomes by MTB is a highly controlled process at the genetic level. Magnetosome crystals reveal highest purity and highest quality magnetic properties and are therefore increasingly sought after as novel nanoparticulate biomaterials for industrial and medical applications. In addition, "magnetofossils," have been used as both past terrestrial and potential Martian life biosignature. However, until recently, the general belief was that the morphology of mature magnetite crystals formed by MTB was largely unaffected by environmental conditions. Here we review a series of studies that showed how changes in environmental factors such as temperature, pH, external Fe concentration, external magnetic fields, static or dynamic fluid conditions, and nutrient availability or concentrations can all affect the biomineralization of magnetite magnetosomes in MTB. The resulting variations in magnetic nanocrystals characteristics can have consequence both for their commercial value but also for their use as indicators for ancient life. In this paper we will review the recent findings regarding the influence of variable chemical and physical environmental control factors on the synthesis of magnetosome by MTB, and address the role of MTB in the global biogeochemical cycling of iron.

AB  - Benthic diatoms and water chemistry were sampled from 49 stream sites in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the United States to evaluate the use of diatoms as indicators of environmental conditions in streams across varying geographic and ecoregional areas. Diatom samples were collected from depositional and erosional habitats in a randomly selected reach in each stream site. Patterns of diatom species distributions in relation to environmental variables were determined using canonical correspondence analysis. Diatom species in both habitats were highly correlated with a pH gradient. A second gradient was correlated with variables that were commonly associated with agricultural runoff such as turbidity and total phosphorus.
   The relationship between diatoms and major environmental variables was quantified with regression and calibration models. The correlation between diatom-inferred and observed pH was high (r(2) = 0.90). Cross-validation with jackknifing showed that pH models were reasonably robust (r(2) = 0.69 for depositional habitats, r(2) = 0.67 for erosional habitats). The regression and calibration models for the depositional habitats had only slightly higher predictive powers than those of erosional habitats.
   The relationship between diatoms and important environmental variables was robust and quantifiable, and the sensitivity of diatom assemblages to environmental conditions did not differ between erosional and depositional habitats. Therefore we concluded that diatoms can be used as quantitative indicators of environmental conditions in lotic systems.

AB  - Freshwater turtles are long-lived sedentary organisms used as biological sentinels to assess anthropogenic perturbations in freshwater-ecosystems; notably because pollutants tend to accumulate in their tissues. Pollution has detrimental effects in sea turtles, but studies in freshwater turtles have provided contrasted results: several species have been impacted by habitat perturbation and pollution while others not. It is important to explore this issue since freshwater turtles are threatened worldwide. We compared two populations of the stripe necked terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) in a relatively pristine area (piedmont of the Atlas mountain) versus an extremely degraded-polluted area (sewers of a large city) in Morocco. All morphological and physiological proxies showed that turtles were able to cope remarkably well with highly degraded-polluted habitat. Population density, body size, and body condition were higher in the sewers, likely due to permanent water and food availability associated with human wastes. Stress markers (e.g. glucocorticoids) provided complex results likely reflecting the capacity of turtles to respond to various stressors. Reproductive parameters (testosterone level, indices of vitellogenesis) were lower in the relatively pristine area. The deceptive overall image provided by these analyses may hide the disastrous human impact on rivers. Indeed, Mauremys leprosa is the only aquatic vertebrate able to survive in the sewers, and thus, might nonetheless be a pertinent indicator of water quality, providing that the complexity of eco-physiological responses is considered.

AB  - Molybdenum precipitates preferentially under reducing conditions; therefore, its occurrence in sediment records is used as an indicator Of paleoredox conditions. Although thiomolybdates (MoO4-xSx2- with x = 1-4)supposedly are necessary intermediates in the process of molybdenum precipitation under anoxic conditions, there is no information about their abundance in natural environments, because of a lack of elernent-specific methods with sufficiently low detection limits. Here, we optimized ion-pair chromatographic separation for coupling to an inductively coupled plasma-Mass spectrometry detector (IPC-ICP-MS). 2-Propanol (10%-25% gradient) replaced the previously used acetonitrile (25%-75%) as the solvent, to reduce the carbon load into the plasma. In synthetic solutions, formation of thiomolybdates was found to occur spontaneously in the presence of excess sulfide and the degree of thiolation was highest at pH 7. Excess hydroxyl led to a transformation of thiomolybdates to molybdate. Under addic to neutral conditions, precipitation of Molybdenum and hydrolysis of tetrathiomolybdate were observed. Flash-freezing was found to be suitable to stabilize tetrathiomolybdate, with <4% transformation over more than two months. High ionic strengths matrices (>2 mM) negatively affected, the detection of molybdate, which eluted mainly in the dead volume, but had no negative effed on higher thiolated molybdates. Detection limits were similar to 10 nM With the newly developed IPC-ICP-MS method, thiomolybdates were found to form Spontaneously in euxinic marine waters after adding a molybdate spike and occur naturally in solficlic geothermal waters.

AB  - The study presents the findings of research into the effect oldie variability of site conditions on their floristic composition providing a basis for the identification of lower phytosociological units. Parches of Arrhenatheretum clarions described with the assistance of phytosociological surveys conducted using the Braun-Blanquet method were subjected to multi-criteria evaluation. On their basis, the following parameters were determined: ecological and botanical structure, geographic-historical distribution, the structure of the life-groups of the floristic types identified, as well as natural values by the Oswit method and sward fodder value according to Filipek. In order to determine the causes of the floristic variability observed, the following soil conditions were assessed: moisture content, soil reaction and nitrogen content by Ellenberg's indicator method, as well as potassium, magnesium and phosphorus content by the appropriate laboratory methods. Typical forms of Arrhenatheretum elation's phytocenoses were found to develop on mucky soils in moderately moist sites. Patches of ryegrass occurring in sites with a periodically higher moisture content on organic soils refer to the Alopecuretum pratensis association. On the other hand, the sward of ryegrass meadows developed on dryer, mineral soils was characterised by increased numbers of species characteristic for xerothermic swards from the Festuco-Brometea class and sandy plant communities from the Koelerio glauca-Corynephoretea canescentis. More intensive utilization, primarily-fertilisation, was among the causes oldie development of species-poor phytocenoses of low natural value but sward of a good fodder value.

AB  - The Viburnum Trend lead-zinc mining subdistrict is located in the southeast Missouri portion of the Ozark Plateau. In 2003 and 2004, we assessed the ecological effects of mining in several watersheds in the region. We included macroinvertebrate surveys, habitat assessments, and analysis of metals in sediment, pore water, and aquatic biota. Macroinvertebrates were sampled at 21 sites to determine aquatic life impairment status (full, partial, or nonsupport) and relative biotic condition scores. Macroinvertebrate biotic condition scores were significantly correlated with cadmium, nickel, lead, zinc, and specific conductance in 2003 (r = -0.61 to -0.68) and with cadmium, lead, and pore water toxic units in 2004 (r = -0.55 to -0.57). Reference sites were fully supporting of aquatic life and had the lowest metals concentrations and among the highest biotic condition scores in both years. Sites directly downstream from mining and related activities were partially supporting, with biotic condition scores 10% to 58% lower than reference sites. Sites located greater distances downstream from mining activities had intermediate scores and concentrations of metals. Results indicate that elevated concentrations of metals originating from mining activities were the underlying cause of aquatic life impairment in several of the streams studied. There was general concurrence among the adversely affected sites in how the various indicators responded to mining activities during the overall study.

AB  - The growing human enterprise has sparked greater interest in identifying ecological thresholds in land use conversion beyond which populations or communities demonstrate abrupt nonlinear or substantive change in species composition. Such knowledge remains fundamental to understanding ecosystem resilience to environmental degradation and informing land use planning into the future. Confronting this challenge has been largely limited to inferring thresholds in univariate metrics of species richness and indices of biotic integrity and has largely ignored how land use legacies of the past may shape community responses of today. By leveraging data for 13,069 riverine sites from temperate, subtropical, and boreal climate zones on four continents, we characterize patterns of community change along diverse gradients of urbanization and agricultural land use, and identity threshold values beyond which significant alterations in species composition exists. Our results demonstrate the apparent universality by which freshwater fish communities are sensitive to even low levels of watershed urbanization (range of threshold values: 1%-12%), but consistently higher (and more variable) levels of agricultural development (2%-37%). We demonstrated that fish community compositional thresholds occurred, in general, at lower levels of watershed urbanization and agriculture when compared to threshold responses in species richness. This supports the notion that aggregated taxon-specific responses may better reflect the complexity of assemblage responses to land use development. We further revealed that the ghost of land use past plays an important role in moderating how current-day fish communities respond to land use intensification. Subbasins of the United States experiencing greater rates of past land use change demonstrated higher current-day thresholds. Threshold responses of community composition, such as those identified in our study, illustrate the need for globally coordinated efforts to prioritize country-specific management and policy initiatives that ensure that freshwater fish diversity is not inevitably lost in the future.

AB  - Privately owned forests in Croatia cover an area (1)581,770 ha, which is 22% of the total area of forests and forestland in the Republic of Croatia. The total growing stock in private forests in Croatia amounts to 78 301 000 m(3), or 20% of the overall growing stock of the entire forest management area. The average growing stock is 163 m3/ha and the increment is 4.4 m(3)/ha or 2.7%.
   Privately owned forests in the area managed by Delnice Forest Administration extend over 22,380 ha. These forests are presently classified into uneven-aged forests. which is not conducive to their future management. Bearing in mind their condition regarding the silvicultural form, biological properties and ecological requirements of the tree species participating in their formation. the management of these forests should follow the methods applied to,forests of high silvicultural firm or seed forests, which are regular and selection forests, and to coppices. Forests of high silvicultural fin-in are regular or even-aged seed forests covering an area of 13,264 ha, while selection seed fin rests cover an area of 6,085 ha. Regular coppice forests are found over an area of 3,031 ha.
   Placing these different forest forms into a uniform uneven-aged class prevents, among other things, the application of those necessary silvicultural operations which are aimed at attaining better stability, productivity and sustainability; or sustainable development.
   Based on the above structural indicators, especially the growing stock and increment of these forests, we may conclude that the current condition of private forests in this area is equally bad and worrying as that of other private forests in Croatia.
   Such a situation may be attributed to a number of factory, such us,. for. example, the inexpert application of silvicultural treatments, the disintegration of rural environments,. property fragmentation, the owners' social status, the insecurity of private ownership, the length of. the production cycle, insufficient control and sanctioning, and finally, the disobeyance (illegal regulations.
   Some objective reasons Jar which these forests are difficult to manage are;
   - Fragmentation of property (the average size of a plot is preceded by two zeros). Unsolved ownership-legal relationships, as well as an unstimulating, slow and expensive system of solving ownership problems,
   - Disproportion between the cadastre of cultures and the real condition in the field, and the disproportion between the cadastre and the land registry,
   - Management at the level of cadastre units prevents the application of more complex management with forest resources,
   - Prejudices of forest owners towards pooling resources (Cooperatives) due to negative experiences from the recent past,
   - Movement of the younger more vital part of the population from rural into urban areas.
   Forest owners and forest owners associations should direct their activities concerned with increasing forest quality toward the following fields, treatments and activities:
   - Tending and regeneration treatments in selection forests with selection cuts. Tending and regeneration treatments in regular high forests and coppices.
   - Tending and restocking those areas subject to natural succession of pioneer species with valuable broadleaved and coniferous species.
   - Establishing cultures of valuable, fast-growing and marketable broadleaved and coniferous species over abandoned grasslands and other areas.
   - Organizing timber harvesting and marketing, as well as utilization of timber for bioenergy after the forests have been tended, established and regenerated.
   Selection management is the most suitable method for fir forests or for those forests in which the fir is the dominant species such as, fin. example, Mixed forests of fir and beech, fir beech and spruce, and fir and spruce.
   The management goals in a selection forest are accomplished by selecting and marking the trees to be cut. These management goals are: raise mixed selection stands which will ensure good quality increment, stand stability and plentiful natural new growth; use the productive site capacity to the maximum; and achieve the highest production values.
   Felling operations in a selection forest achieve multiple goals of tending and regeneration, forming the selection structure, utilizing forests and maintaining their hygiene. There are two groups of silvicultural procedures; tending of the young generation - young growth and young, forest, and selection, which includes thinning and harvesting mature trees. All the procedures in a selection forest are temporally and spatially concentrated, thus creating an indelible whole. any of the above activities is omitted, the structure of the selection forest will be disrupted and its inclement, regeneration and stability will be affected.
   Tree marking in a selection forest should always take account oldie goals for which this activity is undertaken. These goals are permanent regeneration, stand tending, continuous maintenance of the selection structure, stand utilization and maintenance of the sanitary-hygienic function.
   In a normal selection forest with normal growing stock, a 10-year annual increment is cut. Under normal circumstances, this is 25% the total growing stock in the stand. lithe growing stock is higher than normal, cutting intensity should not exceed 30%. lilt is lower cutting intensity may be reduced to 15%. This is borderline intensity which should not be exceeded. This means that cutting should be postponed until another cutting cycle is over in this case another 10 years. Higher or lower intensities could endanger the selection structure, i.e. the increment, regeneration and stability of the selection stand. Inappropriately applied intensities cannot maintain a selection stand in the optimal structural conditions which will ensure maximal production and optimal regeneration. Regrettably, this is one of the most serious current problems in selection management and selection forests.
   Beech and spruce stands which have officially been classified as uneven-aged stands and which have not been managed selectively but with selection cuts show a negative developmental trend. This kind of management results in decreased growing stock, absence of natural regeneration, reduced tree quality and lower increment.
   In such stands management based on regular principles should be organized over small areas (each structural unit special silvicultural treatment). Silvicultural treatments are spatially divided over small areas. In other words, each structural unit represents a special part of the stand which requires a special silvicultural treatment. They are spatially separated but temporally concentrated.
   Management with shelterwood cuts in small areas with a longer regeneration period achieves biological diversity of beech and spruce forests. This type of regeneration enables, over a longer time period, a good yield of seeds of the principal,and other tree species and the survival of their young generation.
   Regeneration in regular forests is generally done in 3 cuts (preparatory, seed and fined) and less,frequently in 4 or 5 cuts, where subsequent cuts are introduced. The preparatory cut is Undertaken with 20% intensity and the seed cut with 50% intensity in a good seed year The remaining, wood is cut as needed. either with one or two subsequent cuts or more frequently, with one final cut.
   Regular forests are tended throughout the life cycle of the stand, that until the shelterwood cuts are applied. Tending consists of the following stages: tending of the young growth after the final cut, cleaning in the developmental stage of the young growth and saplings, and tending with thinning.
   Tending of the young growth after the final cut is usually done once only, while cleaning or negative selection is done once or twice until the moment the stand reaches its maximal height increment. At this stage future trees are identified, which in beech and spruce forests takes place around the age of 30. At this age stands may be tended with thinning.
   Coppices of beech, pubescent oak and other hard broadleaves are regenerated with shelterwood cuts. The goal is to convert a coppice into the forest of high silvicultural form or seed finest.
   Regenerating a coppice with clearcutting and planting conifer species is a serious mistake. Conifers may be planted in degraded fives, soils which have lost the properties that provide the parent climatogenic stand with optimal conditions for growth and development.
   Coppices should be tended throughout the rotation period,
   The tending stages in a coppice include reducing the number of poor quality and superfluous shoots on the stump, tending coppices with cleaning or negative selection, and tending coppices with thinning or positive selection,
   In the c:current economic and social conditions in Croatia arable areas are systematically being reduced and the size of. abandoned agricultural laird is increasing. These areas are subjected to the spontaneous expansion of less valuable tree species and shrubs, classified as pioneer species. Being the first to occur they are spontaneously followed by transitional species. The 100-year-long process ends with the occurrence of principal Or climatogenic species (fir beech, oaks).
   Pioneer and transitional tree species gradually convert degraded forest soil into forest soil suitable for climatogenic or principal species. The basic tree species that bear the characteristics of pioneer species an? those,from the genera of alders, willows, poplars, birches and others. Domestic, autochthonous tree species from other genera, with the exception of the genera of oaks, beech and fir belong to transitional tree species. Together with pioneer species. they,gradually colonize abandoned agricultural and other lands.
   Forest cultures should be established on abandoned agricultural areas in order to increase their market and non-market values. These cultures are established by planting broadleaved species from the genera of wild cherry. peal; apple, as well as maple, ash, lime, whitebeam, rowan, service tree, wild service tree, bird cherry, walnut, and others. Coniferous species to be planted include species from the genera of spruces, larches and pines.
   The choice of the tree species depends on the site conditions that prevail in the treated area, where the soil and the climate have a decisive role.
   The pioneer transitional or secondary tree species have an important role in the structure of all Croatian natural forests'. They are particularly suitable for the establishment of cultures which supply good quality and valuable timber Timber of all these species is applied in mechanical and chemical processing industries, and in energy production. The establishment of energy forests with short rotations and small planting distances will gain increasing importance in Croatian forestry.
   Due to the present energy crisis, the share of timber in the energy balance of the most developed European countries is constantly glowing. Timber from forests has been accepted everywhere in Europe as an important and renewable source of bioenergy.
   Although the Croatian forestry is making initial, modest steps in this field, there is no reason that forest owners in Gorski Kotar should not be included in this European trend. They have at their disposal about 3,000,000 m(3) wing stock, the annual increment of 80,000 m(3), and,the prescribed annual yield of about 40,000 m(3), of which 40% or 16,000 m(3) is wood of thinner dimensions suitable fin. energy. At present, the major portion of this wood remains in Me forest and perishes. This alone provides sufficient motive fin. the owners to pool forces,, fight fir,. their place on the market and join the chain of bioenergy producers fin. both the domestic and foreign markets.

TI  - Using information on spatial variability of small estuaries in designing large-scale estuarine monitoring programs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
CP  - 1st Symposium on the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment Program (MAIA)
AB  - In the early 1990s, EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) documented the ecological condition of the overall population of small estuaries along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States. However, the Program did not provide detailed information on the condition of individual estuaries less than 260 km(2) in surface area, a group of estuaries of concern to environmental managers. To address the needs of environmental managers, when EMAP returned to the region in summer 1997, it included a study of the spatial variability of ecological indicators within individual small estuaries. At 127 probability-based sites in 10 estuaries, EMAP measured a variety of parameters of water quality and sediments, including dissolved oxygen (DO), nutrients, grain size of sediments, contaminants in sediments, and community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates. From this information the ecological condition (e.g., percent area with DO concentrations below 5mg L-1) for each estuary, along with 90% confidence interval, was determined. The width of the confidence interval was then recalculated for sample sizes ranging from two stations to the total number of stations sampled in that estuary. Confidence interval widths were then plotted against sample size. These plots can be useful in designing future regional monitoring programs with a goal of describing conditions in individual systems as well as broad geographic regions. Results illustrate that beyond five stations per estuary, the reduction in the width of the confidence interval with increasing sampling intensity is relatively small; however, individual program managers need to determine "how small is small enough."

AB  - Introduction: Conserving terrestrial ecosystems in good condition is a global challenge. In Mexico, forest rehabilitation is a widely used practice to achieve this task.
   Objective: To analyze the effect of forest rehabilitation on avifauna parameters (richness, abundance and diversity) and its relationship with vegetation structure.
   Materials and methods: The study was conducted in El Porvenir, Hidalgo, Mexico, in areas under forest rehabilitation with Pinus greggii Engelm. ex Parl. aged 5(R5), 12(R12) and 14(R14) years, and in a Pinus cembroides Zucc. forest as a reference site (RS). Sampling was done using a systematic grid design. Avifauna presence was monitored under two schemes: fixed-radius point counts and capture by constant-effort mist-netting. The tree structure was characterized by the point-centered quarter method. Differences between conditions were tested with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).
   Results and discussion: The RS had the highest bird richness (34) and showed significant differences (P = 0.0003) with rehabilitation conditions. The distribution of abundance in R5 and R14 was fitted to a geometric model, R12 to a logarithmic model and RS to a log-normal one, exhibiting significant differences among them (P = 0.033). Bird diversity presented differences between conditions (P = 0.005); the maximum similarity was between R14 and RS. The older the forest rehabilitation age, the more the vegetation structure and bird parameters increased.
   Conclusion: The areas under forest rehabilitation function as reservoirs for the maintenance and conservation of avifauna in disturbed environments.

AB  - Rodents are the most abundant experimental nonhuman animals and are commonly studied under standard laboratory housing conditions. As housing conditions affect animals' physiology and behavior, this study investigated the effects of indoor and outdoor housing conditions on body weight and cortisol level of wild cavies, Cavia aperea. The changing housing condition strongly influenced both parameters, which are commonly used as indicators for animal welfare. The transfer from outdoor to indoor enclosures resulted in a body-weight loss of about 8%. In contrast, animals kept indoors showed a substantial weight gain of about 12% when they were transferred outdoors. These effects were reversible. To substantiate a connection between body-weight changes and the health states of the animals, blood basal cortisol concentrations were measured. Animals kept outdoors had significantly lower cortisol levels than did animals kept indoors. These results imply that indoor conditions have a direct effect on the animals' states. The physiological and metabolic consequences as well as potential welfare aspects should be taken into account when planning experimental work, especially on nondomestic animals.

AB  - Primitive campsites located on a paddlers' trail on Lake Champlain in the northeastern USA were assessed for their resource condition quality using standard campsite assessment protocols common to campsite monitoring studies. Site attributes such as vegetation cover loss, campsite size, campsite condition class and several other measures of resource conditions were assessed. Comparative analyses of resource conditions at camping areas using at-large and confinement strategies were conducted. In addition, paddler standards for two important campsite attributes, vegetation loss and campsite size, were determined via paddlers surveys incorporating the use of normative and visual research methods. Findings suggest that the overall quality of campsite conditions is relatively high from both a biophysical and visitor experience perspective. Several differences in resource conditions were observed between campsites in at-large and confinement camping areas. The current at-large camping strategy in place at some areas appears to have been successful in minimizing resource impacts. Results of this study have implications for the management of primitive campsites in general, with particular importance to similar large lake ecosystems.

AB  - Identifying critical aggregation sites and behavioral patterns of imperiled species contributes to filling knowledge gaps essential for their conservation. Manta rays present a prominent example of such species, the populations of which are declining globally due to directed fishery, by-catch, and other anthropogenic stressors. Our goal was to explore manta ray aggregation sites in the Philippines in order to determine the factors governing the mantas' visits - a knowledge gap essential to understand manta ecology, facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management, and promote sustainable manta-based ecotourism. Diving surveys, environmental conditions assessment, and autonomous cameras were employed to study manta behavior and visit patterns to a cleaning station cluster on a commonly fished seamount, visited by both Mobula birostris and Mobula alfredi. Our findings reveal several environmental conditions (e.g., sea state, moon illumination, and flow) that serve as predictors of manta presence/absence at the site. We suggest that these conditions affect both the behavior of the manta's food (i.e., the spatial distribution of plankton) and the cleaning effectiveness of the cleaner wrasse, which consequently influence manta activity. The findings suggest a trade-off between cleaning and foraging: i.e., mantas tend to visit the cleaning stations when environmental conditions are less favorable for foraging but suitable for effective cleaning; while being absent from the cleaning stations when environmental conditions form plankton aggregations, ideal for efficient feeding. This study sheds light on manta behavior and habitat use on dynamic, small spatio-temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of meters to a few kilometers, hours to days). The acquired data may be applied in the planning of marine protected areas and in fishery management (e.g., to reduce the chances of manta bycatch by limiting fishing activities to periods of manta absence) as well as contribute to enhancing sustainable exploitation, such as ecotourism, by increasing the chances of diving encounters with manta rays.

AB  - Improving agricultural soil quality in semi-arid regions is necessary for reducing soil erosion and improving water use. Conservation agriculture (CA) can increase soil quality and biodiversity, and reduce operational costs without losing crop productivity both under irrigated or rainfed conditions. However, few studies on soil chemical and biochemical status in irrigated farms under CA in the Mediterranean region are available. Permanent beds with crop residue retention (PB) have been proposed as an alternative to conventionally tilled beds with residue incorporation into the soil (CB). These two soil management systems combined with controlled traffic were compared during two different seasons (2009 and 2010) in a loamy alluvial Typic Xerofluvent soil under a maize (Zea mais L)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) crop rotation trial established in 2007 in Southern Spain. Total organic carbon (TOC), water soluble carbon (WSC), Kjeldahl nitrogen (Kjel-N), dehydrogenase (DHA) and p-glucosidase (beta-Glu) activities and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were analysed in soil from beds and furrows after crop harvest. Results indicated that Kjel-N, TOC and enzymatic activities were significantly higher in soil from furrows in PB than in CB, but practically no differences were found in soil from the bed zone. Moreover, traffic did not affect chemical and biochemical parameters in spite of its compacting effect. Major differences were found between samplings due to different quantity and nature of the residues (maize vs. cotton). Principal component analysis confirmed that TOC, Kjel-N and beta-Glu (and DHA to a less extend) are useful indicators of soil management impact on soil quality in this irrigated Mediterranean conditions; however, this is not the case of WSC, a common indicator in rainfed conditions. Results confirmed that conservation agriculture is the better option to increase soil biological and biochemical quality in irrigated farms under Mediterranean semi-arid conditions.

AB  - Oasis degradation and terminal lake shrinkage are prevalent consequences of the disputed distribution of water resources in inland river basins, hindering regional sustainable development. The Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) is regarded as an important measure to restore the desert-oasis ecosystem in inland river basins, and thus it is essential to comprehensively evaluate the response of eco-hydrological and socioeconomic systems to the EWDP. Based on multiple indicators, we used trend analysis, linear regression, partial least square regression, and structural equation model to disentangle the quantitative effects of the EWDP on the change of eco-hydrological and socioeconomic conditions in the Ejina Oasis (EO) in the lower reaches of the Heihe River in northwest China. Our results indicate that the ecological deterioration was prevalent before the execution of the EWDP, including the increase of groundwater depth, the disappearance of lakes, the decrease of NDVI. After the EWDP, runoff released to EO increased 69.15%, the mean groundwater depth decreased 0.48 m, 52.28% of the study area showed a significant increase in NDVI, areas of forest and grassland increased 20.17 and 25.65 km(2), respectively. The EWDP improved the hydrological regime and prompted the recovery of the oasis. Besides, socioeconomic development was facilitated under the restoration of the eco-hydrological conditions, characterized by the expansion of farmland and the thrive of the tourism industry. The hydrological variables promoted the improvement of the ecological condition with a direct strength of 0.93 and facilitated the development of the socioeconomic conditions in EO with an indirect strength of 0.84. Runoff was the most important positive contributor both to the NDVI and GDP in EO. This comprehensive evaluation framework can offer valuable insight for water resources management and sustainable development in the inland river basin of arid areas.

AB  - We examined the influence of environmental conditions on walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) early life history in discrete stages at two ecological scales using a 17-year time series from the southeastern Bering Sea. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to quantify relationships between walleye pollock stages (eggs, yolksac larvae, preflexion larvae, late larvae, and juveniles), the fine-resolution environment (temperature, wind speed, salinity, and copepod concentration), and the broad-resolution environment (annual spawning stock biomass, temperature, zooplankton biomass, and wind mixing). Early stages (eggs, yolksac larvae, and preflexion larvae) were associated with high spawning stock biomass, while late stages (late larvae and juveniles) were not associated with spawning stock biomass. The influence of temperature increased with ontogeny: high egg abundance was associated with temperatures from -2 to 7 degrees C and negative annual temperature anomalies and high juvenile abundance was associated with temperatures from 4 to 12 degrees C and positive temperature anomalies. Winds enhanced the transport of early stages from spawning locations to shallower sampling depths, but did not affect feeding stages (preflexion larvae, late larvae, and juveniles) in a manner consistent with the encounter-turbulence hypothesis. Feeding stages were positively associated with localized copepod concentrations but not zooplankton biomass anomaly, suggesting that the localized measurements of potential prey is a better indicator compared to broad-scale conditions measured in areas where these stages do not necessarily occur. Broad-resolution covariates, however, explained a greater portion of the overall variation than did fine-resolution models. Of the environmental conditions examined, temperature explained more variation in abundance of walleye pollock early life stages than any other covariate. Temperature is likely a major driving force structuring variability in populations of walleye pollock in their first year of life, acting directly upon them and indirectly upon their physical habitat and prey community.

AB  - The gain or loss of plant species may alter the development of structural and functional attributes critical to developing or restoring ecosystem services in created mitigation wetlands. A three-year study was conducted in created mesocosm wetlands to determine the role of initial planting richness (IPR) in vegetation community development using five species of plants common to natural and created wetlands in the Virginia Piedmont. The mesocosms were naturally colonized by volunteer species after planting the same as in real-world mitigation wetlands created in the region. At the end of each growing season, all species present were identified, and species richness (S) and cover percentages (i.e., percent total, planted and volunteer species) were measured. Indices for diversity (Shannon-Weiner H') and prevalence (PI) were calculated. After establishment of planted rhizomes, hydrology was maintained solely by precipitation. However, unintended leaking in six mesocosms in the beginning of the study created two distinctively different hydrologic conditions (i.e., wet vs. dry conditions) that were factored into the final data analysis. Both richness (S) and biodiversity (H') varied significantly with initial planting richness (IPR). Differences in these two attributes were mainly due to differences between monotypic mesocosms (IPR = 1) and those with the greatest number of species initially planted (IPR = 5). Hydrologic conditions impacted some of the plant community characteristics, including total percent cover being higher in one year and PI being lower both in "wet" conditions. The mesocosms were becoming typical of wetlands with more hydrophytes present over the course of the study. The outcome of the study showed that the mesocosm wetlands were following a similar pattern found in vegetation community development trajectory of newly created mitigation wetlands. The study showed the positive effect of initial planting richness on species richness and diversity in the early development of plant community. Our findings also reinforce the importance of maintaining adequate hydrologic conditions for the early development of vegetation community in created mitigation wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous studies have reported that the extent of leaf injury in Nicotiana tabacum "Bel-W3'' exposed to environmental conditions in the city of Sao Paulo is influenced by weather conditions. This influence may occur by means of antioxidant responses. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether daily antioxidant responses to environmental variations interfere on the progression of leaf injury on plants of this cultivar during their exposure in a state park of Sao Paulo and to determine a linear combination of variables, among antioxidants and environmental factors, which mostly explain this visible response. Plants were exposed at the mentioned site for 14 days in four different experiments. During each experiment, three plants were daily sampled to determine the accumulated percentage of leaf area affected by necrosis and antioxidant responses (concentrations of total ascorbic acid (AA) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidases (POD)). Ozone concentrations and weather conditions were also daily measured. Pearson correlations and multivariate analyses assessed the relationship between biological and environmental variables. Leaf injury appeared between the 3rd and 6th days of exposure and increased over the exposure periods. The daily concentrations of AA tended to decrease with time of exposure in all experiments, but the activity of SOD and POD oscillated during plant exposure. Positive correlations were observed between AA or SOD and O-3 concentrations, as well as negative correlations between AA and air temperature. The increasing percentage of leaf necrosis across the whole period was explained by decreasing levels of AA 2 days before injury estimation and by higher O-3 concentrations 5 days before (R-2 = 0.36; p < 0.001). The use of N. tabacum Bel-W3 as a bioindicator can be restricted by leaf antioxidant responses to both atmospheric contamination and weather conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental pollution assessment and control are priority issues for both developed and developing countries of the world. The use of plant material for a more complete picture of environmental health appears to be particularly appealing. Here we validate a previous plant-adapted Comet assay on leaf tissues of Nicotiana tabacum cultivars Bel B and Bel W3. The effects Of H2O2 on DNA damage in Bel B and Bel W3 agree with the hypothesis that some component of the machinery that protects DNA integrity from oxidative stress may be impaired in cv. Bel W3. Exposure in the field on sunny summer days (peak ozone concentration >80 p.p.b.) showed significantly higher DNA damage in cv. Bel W3 if plants were collected and subjected to the Comet assay when the air ozone concentration was reaching its peak value, but not when plants were sampled early in the morning and hence after a period of low ozone concentration. The different results suggest that Bel W3 possesses a less efficient recovery apparatus that requires a longer period of activity to be effective and/or is less protected against reactive oxygen species production during exposure to ozone. However, it cannot be excluded that the increase in mean DNA damage is the result of the presence of a genotoxic agent(s) other than ozone. Interestingly, Bel W3 also appears to be more responsive, compared with Bel B, when exposed to ambient indoor pollutants. The use of cv. Bel W3 increases the sensitivity of the assay under both indoor and field conditions. However, different classes of mutagens; should be tested to define the range of profitable utilization of this tobacco cultivar for environmental genotoxicity detection.

AB  - Oocyst prevalence and intensity have been recorded in 349 laboratory infections of Anopheles stephensi with Plasmodium berghei. Intensity and prevalence of infection are shown to be predictably related. The structure and heterogeneity in the infections has been analysed with the objective of describing the biological mechanisms by which the observed negative binomial oocyst distributions are generated. The analysis has revealed that the most likely processes lie within the population dynamic events of malaria within the mosquito, namely gametogenesis, fertilization and mortality. The distribution is similar in all Plasmodium - mosquito combinations examined so far, whether they are of laboratory (P. gallinaceum in Aedes aegypti) or field (P. vivax in An. albimanus and P. falciparum in An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus) origin. Further we conclude that there is competition between parasites in the vector. Oocyst frequency distribution analysis shows that under natural conditions of transmission intensity, and even under the best laboratory conditions, significant numbers (> 10%) of fully susceptible mosquitoes will not be infected under conditions where the mean infection is as high as 250 oocysts. Failure to infect is not therefore an absolute indicator of refractoriness. In assessing transmission data it is shown that sample sizes should not be less than 50, and ideally 100 mosquitoes, if reliable data are to be obtained. In the field it is suggested that difficulties in determining the low natural intensity of oocyst infections indicate that prevalence estimates are a useful and accessible parameter to measure. In determining the impact of transmission blocking mechanisms we predict that under conditions where high oocyst intensities prevail, large reductions in intensity will be required before a reduction in prevalence can be expected i.e. here it will be necessary to measure intensity of infection. Conversely, under conditions where low oocyst intensities prevail, a rapid reduction in prevalence will occur with little concurrent reduction in intensity i.e. prevalence determination will be the more sensitive estimate.

AB  - Cities have become the most important habitats for mankind in most regions of the world. Many researchers and organizations have attempted to evaluate the states of cities from the perspective of their functionalities. However, the comprising components of a city, which provide these functions, have not been evaluated explicitly and systematically. These components include people, infrastructure and environment, all of which are the foundations of city health and sustainability. In this study, we used the analogy of a healthy human and defined a healthy city as a state of complete demographic, infrastructural and environmental well-being, which means that all components are present with integrity and sufficiency and also function effectively, harmoniously and sustainably. Based on this concept, a component-based city health examination framework was constructed and tested in three major cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen) in both 2010 and 2015. A total of 27 indicators (seven for People, ten for Infrastructure and ten for Environment), each with a health reference value, were chosen and calculated. The fuzzy logic method was selected to perform the evaluation task due to its effectiveness in assessing uncertain and relatively subjective objects. Results showed that all three case study cities failed to meet the healthy condition in both years. Shenzhen was, relatively, the healthiest city among the three in 2015 and had the highest health score in Infrastructure and Environment. Shanghai possessed the highest score in People in both years. Additionally, five indicators with the largest potential for improvement were also identified for each city. This component-based city health evaluation model can be applied to better inform urban planning policies and potentially improve the quality of life in cities in the future.

AB  - A radiocarbon-dated sediment sequence from Lake Berkut in the southern part of the Kola Peninsula, northwest Russia, was investigated by means of midge analysis in order to reconstruct the Holocene climatic and environmental history of the region. Past mean July air temperatures at the study site and hypolimnetic oxygen contents of the lake water were inferred from chironomid-based transfer functions. The early Holocene (c. 10 100 - 8400 cal. yr BP) is characterized by summer temperatures and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations broadly similar to present-day conditions. The midge records give evidence of a lake- level fall at c. 7000 cal. yr BP, resulting in weakened thermal stratification of the lake water, and improvement of the hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. After c. 4000 cal. yr BP midge assemblages suggest a lake- level rise related to increased effective moisture. A secondary mid-Holocene climatic optimum with inferred mean July air temperatures of c. 12.1 degrees C was recorded between 6000 and 4400 cal. yr BP, followed by minimum values (c. 11.3 degrees C) between 3500 and 1500 cal. yr BP, accompanied by the onset of natural acidification of the lake. The late-Holocene midge assemblages suggest weakly acidic conditions, low hypolimnetic oxygen contents and a general warming trend during the last c. 1500 years, although paludification and natural acidification may have influenced the temperature reconstruction at this stage. However, the modern chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature (12.5 degrees C) is consistent with meteorological data from a nearby station. In general, the midge records reflect relatively warm and moist conditions at Lake Berkut before c. 7000 cal. yr BP, a relatively warm and dry climate at c. 7000 - 4000 cal. yr BP, and a shift to cooler and wetter climatic conditions in the region after c. 4000 cal. yr BP.

AB  - In order to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of air pollution and other environmental factors on forest ecosystems, a Pan-European Programme for Intensive and Continuous Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems has been implemented in 1994. Results of the Programme must contribute to a European wide overview of impacts of air pollution and the further development of its control strategies, being described in air pollution protocols. Objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme related to air pollution are the assessment of: (i) responses of forest ecosystems to changes in air pollution; (ii) differences between present loads and critical loads (long-term sustainable inputs) of atmospheric deposition; and (iii) impacts of future scenarios of atmospheric deposition on the ecosystem condition. Furthermore, the Intensive Monitoring Programme contributes to the assessment of 'criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management', such as the maintenance of forests as a net carbon sink to reduce the build up of atmospheric greenhouse gasses and the maintenance of species diversity of ground vegetation.
   The Intensive Monitoring Programme, which is carried out on approximately 860 selected plots, comprises monitoring of crown condition, forest growth and the chemical status of soil and foliage at all plots and monitoring of deposition, meteorology, soil solution and ground vegetation in a subset of the plots. In order to meet the major objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme, studies have been or are presently carried out with respect to the assessment of: (i) correlations between site and stress factors and the "forest ecosystem condition"; (ii) trends in stress factors and/or ecosystem conditions; (iii) critical loads, by evaluating the fate of atmospheric pollutants in the ecosystem with input-output budgets; and (iv) large-scale and long-term impacts of climate and deposition on forests and vice versa. Examples of those studies are given and the potential of the Programme to fulfil the objectives is evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gross primary productivity is one of the most important indicators of ecosystem function, which is related to water conditions and shown high interannual variation. Due to the time-lag effect, not only the current water condition but also the previous water conditions (e.g., one year before) impact the gross primary productivity (GPP). Revealing the impacts of current and previous years' water status is currently a hot topic. In this study, we designed a series of water deficit scenarios based on the meteorological dataset of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and then analysed the responses of the remote sensing-based moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity (GPP) in China, from which the role of water deficit in time periods was evaluated. The results indicate that the impact of climate factors (i.e., water, temperature and radiation) on GPP has a high spatial heterogeneity and that water-limited regions that are primarily distributed in North and Northwestern China show a stronger water-GPP relationship than water-unlimited regions. The water deficit that occurred in different periods had a variable impact on GPP. Specifically, GPP was primarily controlled by the current year's water conditions in the water-limited regions, with the importance value of 52.8% (the percentage of Increased Mean Square Error, %IncMSE) and 3.8 (the mean decrease in node impurity, IncNodePurity), but at the same time, it was conditionally affected by the water status in the previous year, with the importance value of 20.4% (%IncMSE) and 0.6 (IncNodePurity). The role of water in previous years is multifarious, which depends on the water conditions of the current year. The results revealed by the scenarios indicate that the influence of water conditions in the previous year was not statistically significant when the water conditions of the current year were in a drought. In contrast, when the current year's water conditions were normal or wetter, the water conditions in the previous year (i.e., one-year time lag) were also important and the increase of GPP significantly depended on the water condition (p < 0.05). The diverse roles of water conditions in previous years on GPP and its non-ignorable time-lag effect revealed in this study imply that not only the current year's water condition but also its dynamic changes in previous years should be considered when predicting changes in GPP caused by climate change.

AB  - The interpretation of local redox indicators in marine sediments relies on their preservation. By their nature, such biogeochemical tracers are susceptible to diagenetic alteration, particularly through post-depositional re-oxidation of the sediment. This can result in the mobilization and loss of distinctive redox dependant signatures, leading to the classical problem that the presence of oxygenated conditions cannot be robustly inferred by the absence of evidence for anoxia. Authigenic uranium enrichments, and their isotope signatures (delta U-238), are widely used to infer bottom-water and pore-water redox conditions but are susceptible to later oxidative diagenetic disturbance. Here we explore the preservation of authigenic delta U-238 signatures in sediment samples from Sapropel S1 at Site 64PE406-E1 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (similar to 1760 m water depth), which was originally deposited under reducing conditions but severely affected by later oxidative diagenesis and the variable loss of authigenic U(IV) from the upper sapropel. To this end, we compare U isotope signatures from bulk measurements (delta U-238(bulk)) with detrital corrected authigenic U (delta U-238(auth)) and carbonate associated U (delta U-238(CAU)). In contrast to open ocean carbonates deposited under fully oxic conditions, sapropelic carbonate leachates yield delta U-238(CAU) similar to calculated delta U-238(auth), thus recording (predominantly) redox dependant isotope fractionation. There is no evidence for significant isotope fractionation resulting from post-depositional oxidative diagenesis, but associated authigenic U(IV) removal results in larger relative detrital contributions to delta U-238(bulk), and hence large uncertainties on delta U-238(auth) estimates. By contrast, delta U-238(CAU) successfully avoids detrital phases, and the uncertainty associated with detrital corrections, providing a primary record of changes in local redox conditions. Thus, we propose that delta U-238(CAU) can be used for accurate reconstructions of benthic de-oxygenation in sediments with low U enrichments, including sediments with post-depositional U(IV) loss and less reducing environments.

AB  - The psycho-pedagogical and social rehabilitation of individuals before dismissal from the places of imprisonment is currently relevant, as it is a qualitative return to normal life that becomes an acute problem for people who are preparing to leave the places of imprisonment. The purpose of the article is to analyze the pilot psychological and pedagogical research of persons who are in places of imprisonment. For introduction of the developed social-pedagogical directions of resocialization of persons who are in the places of detention or getting ready to leave these places, the diagnostics of psychological characteristics which will become key signs of efficiency of the applied directions became relevant, namely: orientation to changing of the social environment; social-pedagogical therapy; professional orientation during teaching and educational process. Diagnostics of structure of intelligence, educational motivation, nonverbal creativity and level of self-assessment of persons who are in places of detention is performed. The analysis of results of motives of educational activity allows saying that educational activity of respondents is defined by motivation on achievement, cognitive motivation, and by motive of external stimulation. The highest indicator of the index of uniqueness that characterizes nonverbal creativity is met at most of respondents. The self-assured personality is guided by development of the his/her potential, he/she subordinates the existence to achievement of a condition of integrity, integration, spontaneity, humour, openness of experience. Creative, motivated, intelligently flexible and selfassured personality can achieve the objectives, far from creativity, for the sake of prospects in his/her life. He/she can be attracted to the activity necessary from some reasons, important for him/her, as, for example, participation of creative people in technical activity, in organizational work, for explanation of his/her purposes for other people.

AB  - The continental shelf of southern California is an important location for the extraction of petroleum and natural gas. Many platforms in the region have been operating for more than four decades and are being targeted for decommissioning. Information on the condition of surrounding habitats to the platforms will be important for regulators. The condition of sediments near (250 m-2 km) four active oil/gas platforms was evaluated with measures of macrobenthic infauna, toxicity, and chemical composition using standardized assessment indices and compared to that of equivalent locations across the region without platforms. Assessment scores indicated that the sediments surrounding the oil platforms were in a relatively good state, with reference-condition in -fauna, minimal levels of chemical exposure, and five instances (25% of samples) of low-level toxicity. Samples from around the oil platforms were in overall similar condition to the region, with slightly better condition infauna, nearly identical chemistry, and slightly worse toxicity.

AB  - Fish have been shown to be sensitive indicators of environmental quality in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Fish composition also reflects aquatic macrophyte communities, which provide them with critical habitat. Although investigators have shown that the relationship between water quality and fish community structure can be used to indicate wetland health, we speculate that this relationship is a result of the stronger, more direct relationship between water quality and macrophytes, together with the ensuing interconnection between macrophyte and fish assemblages. In this study, we use data collected from 115 Great Lakes coastal marshes to test the hypothesis that plants are better predictors of fish species composition than is water quality. First we use canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to conduct an ordination of the fish community constrained by water quality parameters. We then use co-correspondence analysis (COCA) to conduct a direct ordination of the fish community with the plant community data. By comparing the statistic 'percent fit,' which refers to the cumulative percentage variance of the species data, we show that plants are consistently better predictors of the fish community than are water quality variables in three separate trials: all wetlands in the Great Lakes basin (whole: 21.2% vs 14.0%; n = 60), all wetlands in Lakes Huron and Superior (Upper: 20.3% vs 18.8%; n = 32), and all wetlands in Georgian Bay and the North Channel (Georgian Bay: 18% vs 17%; n = 70). This is the largest study to directly examine plant-fish interactions in wetlands of the Great Lakes basin. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indices developed for stream bioassessment are typically based on either fish or macro-invertebrate assemblages. These indices consist of metrics which subsume attributes of various species into aggregate measures reflecting community-level ecological responses to disturbance. However, little is known about the relationship between fish and macroinvertebrate metrics, or about how ecological health assessments are affected by assemblage-specific responses to disturbance. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis of existing fish (n = 371) and macroinvertebrate (n = 442) stream bioassessment data from a multi-source dataset to determine broad scale, within-assemblage metric patterns, and to examine the intercorrelation of fish and macroinvertebrate metrics (n = 246) and their response to watershed area and land use/land cover gradients. Fish and macroinvertebrate metrics expressed as principal components (PCs) accounted for 72.4 and 85.4% of dataset variance, respectively, with PC-metric patterns reflecting aspects of stream impairment including water and habitat quality. Model components predicting fish metric response differed among fish PCs, with watershed area and macroinvertebrate metric response strongly correlated with the first fish PC, and remaining fish PC models consisting of watershed area, land use, and macroinvertebrate PCs. Correlation between fish and macroinvertebrate PCs, and models relating fish and macroinvertebrate PCs generally explained less variation (13-27%) than metric response models of fish (25-34%) and macroinvertebrates (8-38%) to watershed area and land use/land cover variables. Best-response models integrating fish and macroinvertebrate PCs, watershed area, and land use/land cover variables accounted for the greatest variation in fish PCs (32-50%) across sites. Because fish and macroinvertebrate metrics provide different information on ecological condition, integrated use of information from multiple groups may be appropriate when developing monitoring programs.

AB  - Understanding challenges posed by climate change to estuaries and their faunas remains a high priority for managing these systems and their communities. Freshwater discharge into a range of estuary types in south-western Australia between 1990 and 2015 is shown to be related to rainfall. This largely accounts for decreases in discharge in this microtidal region being more pronounced on the west coast than south coast, where rainfall decline was less. Results of an oxygen-balance model imply that, as demonstrated by empirical data for the Swan River Estuary, declines in discharge into a range of estuary types would be accompanied by increases in the extent of hypoxia. In 2013-15, growth and body condition of the teleost Acanthopagrus butcheri varied markedly among three permanently open, one intermittently-open, one seasonally-closed and one normally-closed estuary, with average time taken by females to reach the minimum legal length (MLL) of 250mm ranging from 3.6 to 17.7years. It is proposed that, in a given restricted period, these inter-estuary variations in biological characteristics are related more to differences in factors, such as food resources and density, than to temperature and salinity. The biological characteristics of A.butcheri in the four estuaries, for which there are historical data, changed markedly between 1993-96 and 2013-15. Growth of both sexes, and also body condition in all but the normally-closed estuary, declined, with females taking between 1.7 and 2.9 times longer to attain the MLL. Irrespective of period, body condition, and growth are positively related. Age at maturity typically increased between periods, but length at maturity declined only in the estuary in which growth was greatest. The plasticity of the biological characteristics of A.butcheri, allied with confinement to its natal estuary and ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, makes this sparid and comparable species excellent subjects for assessing estuarine health.

TI  - What drives foreign direct investments into Baltic countries? The case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
KW  - LINKAGES
AB  - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as object of economic analysis have been chosen not accidentally. These neighbour Baltic countries started their transition reforms almost at the same time and from quite similar positions.
   Despite common aims are obvious, each country has chosen rather different way of transition.
   Aim of presented paper is to compare approaches to constructing of tax systems in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and to evaluate their efficiency in terms of attracting foreign investments into country.
   Among some academicians and majority of policy makers an unquestionable belief in special importance of FDI prevails.
   Theoretical framework presented in the paper suggests a list of factors, which may be important in attracting FDI, such as economic distance, market size, agglomeration effects, factor costs, fiscal incentives, business environment climate, economic stability, trade barriers.
   While these factors are likely to affect all types of FDI, the different strategic objectives of different multinationals are implicit.
   Hence, certain factors may affect one multinationals and another factors may more affect another and even more, this combined impact could be different in different regions.
   The focus on legal environment of Baltic countries has been motivated by aim of paper: to verify if different approaches to tax system could be considered as major determinant of FDI for this specific region.
   Methodology of analysis exploits the following approach to considered issue. Tax system is notoriously quite significant tool of regulation of any economy, which affects propensity to invest. Nevertheless, explicit impact of it on investment environment cannot be measured and must, therefore, alas, be traced only indirectly through analysis of major economic indicators.
   The probability is that FDI to transition countries can be attracted not only by favourable investment conditions from the point of taxes but also by other factors. Nevertheless, we need to admit that a lot of indexes characterizing Baltic countries fluctuate within narrow limits, hence, in our paper we have focused on investigation of driving factors embracing legal environment conditioned by different tax systems.
   The rationale of analysis of FDI in the context of valid tax systems is obvious: more favourable than in other countries conditions should attract international investment capital. In its turn additional capital should induce grow of GDP. Hence, another aim of paper is to verify if actually appropriate relationship between FDI and GDP exists.
   The upshot of this comparison should be evaluation of level of actual impact of taxes on. investment propensity in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Considering complexity of a task of evaluation of impact of one factor, especially such as tax system, on displayed propensity to invest, we accept following approach: if growth of FDI is followed by growth of GDP that could be treated as situation when FDI attracted by favourable investment conditions induce GDP growth; if increase in FDI weren't be followed by growth of economy that would mean that FDI for certain reasons don't contribute properly to the growth, so, tax system wasn't major factor stipulating FDI.
   Presented in the paper investigation has led to the following conclusions. Baltic States countries' with more favourable investment conditions, from the point of view of taxes, grow more slowly than ones applying more modest investment stimuli.
   Such situation most likely has been stipulated by intensive processes of privatization, which offered opportunity for developed countries of entering new markets, actually, 0 free from strong rivals. Natural process of expanding activity into not occupied yet markets stipulated FDI. On the other hand, favourable conditions for occupation of monopolistic positions were fostered by governments, which, drastically needed money and offered incredible favourable conditions of privatization. Hence, process of privatization, sometimes followed by signs of corruption, stipulated inadequate growth of GDP. This tendency was especially obvious in Lithuania, where role of privatization in attracting FDI was the greatest and level of corruption the highest. Finally, we conclude that role of tax incentives in young transition countries case is diminished by other, factors, and strongly investment oriented tax policies on the early stage of development of market can lead to diminishing of budget revenues from profit tax.
   Presented comparison of tax systems in Baltic States Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia Yields following tax policy implications: tax system, conditioning especially favourable investment conditions in young transition economies doesn't play the role, which was predetermined to it. So there is no point in introducing special tax incentives in forms of tax concessions on capital invested. As concerns tax rates countries are free to accept, any, tariff. Authors of paper support progressive profit tax tariffs allowing but that is quite subjective matter. The paper argues for development of favourable business conditions despite origin of capital invested.

AB  - Rigorously studied and dated Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental reconstructions from Ranch La Brea (RLB) and the Los Angeles Basin are scarce. Here, we use data from AMS radiocarbon dated insect fragments to infer local climates over the past 50,000 years. Our results indicate: 1) Quaternary insect remains can be located with great accuracy in radiocarbon time, and 2) well-dated and documented climate indicator beetle species are sensitive proxies for environmental change in the Los Angeles Basin. A total of 182 extant RLB ground and darkling beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Tenebrionidae) were radiocarbon dated. The resulting radiocarbon dates form a semi-continuous range from similar to 50 to 28, 16-7.5, and 4 kcal yrs BP to the present. Associated insect climate ranges indicate past conditions consistent with, or very similar to, the current Los Angeles Basin Mediterranean climate. Importantly, these insect data suggest higher temperatures and aridity than inferred previously from other RLB proxies. Furthermore, wider-than-assumed dating spreads for some deposits emphasize the lack of biostratigraphy for RLB, and challenge inferences based on limited sets of radiocarbon dates and assumptions about stratigraphic integrity. Our results demonstrate the necessity to independently radiocarbon date each taxon. The insect paleoclimate interpretations were compared to regional pollen data, primarily from various southern Californian sites including Lake Elsinore and Santa Barbara Basin. These comparisons reveal an important difference in climate interpretations for the last Glacial: the RLB insect data suggest climate similar to the current one, while the regional pollen data have been interpreted as indicating a climate wetter than present.

AB  - Exploring the relative contribution of spatial factors and environmental variables in shaping communities is of widespread interest in biodiversity conservation and environmental management. Stream communities are hierarchically regulated by environmental variables over multiple spatial scales, and the reaction of different organisms to stressors are still equivocal. We sampled both macroinvertebrates and diatom at 80 sites and additional 10 sites for macroinvertebrates, field measured and laboratory analyzed environmental variables, from the tributaries of Qiantang River, Yangtze River Delta China in 2011. We used PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) to generate spatial predictors. We applied redundancy analysis and variation partitioning procedures to identify key spatial and environmental factors, and to quantify their relative roles in shaping diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Our results demonstrated the role of spatial and environmental variables differed in shaping benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate. Diatom assemblage variations were better explained by spatial factors, however macroinvertebrate assemblage variations were better explained by environmental variables. In terms of environmental variables, catchment scale variables (e.g., land use estimators, land use diversity) played the primary role in determining the patterns of both diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas the influence of reach-scale variables (e.g., pH, substrates, and nutrients) appeared less. However, nutrients were the stronger factors influencing benthic diatom, whereas physical habitat (e.g., substrates) played more important role than water chemistry in structuring macroinvertebrates. Our results provided more evidence to the incorporation of spatial factors interpreting spatial patterns of stream organisms, and highlighted the useful of multiple organisms and environmental variables at different spatial scales in diagnosing mechanism of stream degradation and in building a sound stream conditions monitoring program for Yangtze River Delta.

AB  - The study of how different breeds adapt to heat stress and the further understanding of mechanisms underlying pigs thermotolerance is of utmost importance to attenuate the negative effects of heat stress on pigs welfare, physiology, and performance. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the effects of ambient temperature on performance and thermoregulatory responses of Piau purebred pigs. The Brazilian native pig breed Piau is a fat-type breed characterized by adaptability and resistance to diseases. To achieve our goal, Piau purebred pigs (65 kg initial BW) were allocated to one of the two constant ambient temperature conditions: thermoneutral (22 degrees C; n = 11) and heat stress (30 degrees C; n = 11). The experimental period lasted 15 days (days 1 to 15). Pigs were individually weighed at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Body and rectal temperatures, respiratory rate and blood indicators of stress and metabolism were measured throughout the experiment. Piau purebred pigs exposed to 30 degrees C had lower (p < 0.05) feed intake, body weight gain and final body weight than pigs at 22 degrees C. Feed conversion rate was not affected (p 0.05) by ambient temperature. Irrespective of ambient temperature, pigs had similar (p > 0.05) backfat thickness and loin eye area. Piau pigs at 30 degrees C had increased (p < 0.05) nape, dorsal, flank, and rectal temperatures and increased respiratory rate than their counterparts reared at 22 degrees C. In summary, our results show that Piau purebred pigs acclimation to 30 degrees C of ambient temperature is characterized by increased body skin temperature to optimize sensible heat loss to the environment; increased respiratory rate to promote latent heat loss; and by a concomitant reduced voluntary feed intake to reduce heat production associated with digestion and metabolic processes with negative effects on body weight gain.

AB  - Various anthropogenic activities simultaneously alter essential mineral nutrients and contaminant content in the environment. Depending on essential nutrient conditions, the uptake and effects of contaminants in exposed organisms may be altered. The addressing of ecological risk assessment (ERA) of contaminant mixtures has proven difficult. Furthermore, most assessments involving single contaminant exposures do not consider the interaction of essential nutrients on toxicological end points. Hypotheses for toxicological effects of cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and their binary mixture (Cd/As-mix) include alteration under varying dietary and media phosphorus (P) conditions. However, interactive effects and effect size (eta(2)) are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the toxicities of Cd-, As-, and Cd/As-mix-treated media and diets on Scenedesmus acutus ( a primary producer) and Daphnia pulex (a primary consumer), under varied media and dietary P conditions [low (LP), median (MP), and optimum (COMBO)]. Our results showed significant (p < 0.05) interactive effects and concentration dependent growth inhibition of S. acutus. The toxicity (at day 7) of Cd against S. acutus was 2X, 11X, and 4X that of As in LP, MP, and COMBO conditions, respectively, while the joint toxicity effects of Cd/As-mix were partially additive in LP and COMBO, and synergistic in MP media. Furthermore, acute lethal toxicity (96 h) of Cd in D. pulex was, similar to 60X that of As, while Cd/As-mix joint toxicity was synergistic. Chronic toxicity (14 d) in D. pulex showed significant (p < 0.05) interaction of As and P-availability on survival, reproduction, and behavior (distance moved, velocity, acceleration and mobility), while Cd and P availability showed significant interactive effect on rotational behavior. Dose response effects of Cd, As, and Cd/As-mix in S. acutus and D. pulex were either monophasic or biphasic under varying nutrient conditions. This study provides empirical evidence of the interactive effects of media/dietary P and toxic metals (Cd, As, and Cd/As-mix) at environmentally relevant concentrations, emphasizing the need for consideration of such interactions during ERA.

AB  - Desert rodents show a great capacity to concetrate urine.  This physiological condition has been used as an indicator of kidney efficiency for water conservation and as a base for comparative studies on fauna adaptation to deserts.  However, this capacity evaluated under laboratory conditions does not necessarily reflect the actual performance of animals in their natural environment, since the condition of water balance stages depend on the ecophysiological characteristics of the species and the biotic and climatic factors, which are variable in time and space.  To test this hypothesis, the rodents Octodon degus, Abrothrix olivaceus, A. longipilis, Phyllotis darwini, Oryzomys longicaudatus and the marsupial Marmosa elegans were used as experimental model.  All of them are sympatric in the localities of PN Fray Jorge and RN Las Chinchillas (Auco).  Both localities show different precipitation regimes within as well as between years, being Auco more arid, condition more marked in spring and summer.  The water balance stages were evaluated from the urine concentrations of the mentioned small mammals, captured in both localities during two consecutive years (1991 and 1992).  The results indicate that:  1) The water balance stages of the rodents show a clear seasonal rhythm, but in M. elegans, this rhythm is little defined.  2) The water balance is more negative during spring and summer, when herbaceous vegation is less abundant, and in addition there are not evidences of differences to the level of intraspecies in both localities.  3) During the seasons with less water availability, the six species show in average relatively high osmotic concentration values; however these do not reach the maximum concentration values of the kidney of the particular species.
   It is concluded that the five rodent species have a water balance with a marked annual cycle, situation not observed in M. elegans.  This rhythm would be related with the seasonal cycle precipitation, which occurs mainly during fall months.  In general, the water balance stages do not differ seasonally to the interspecific level, except for O. degus; condition presumably given by the special physiological character of this species.

AB  - We tested the influence of population density and of drought intensity (measured as the Gaussen Index in spring and summer of the year of birth) on winter body mass, hind foot length, and body condition of roe deer fawns. Body mass decreased with increasing density and increased with increasing Gaussen Index in summer, in a similar way for both males and females. Hind foot length of males showed the same response. On the other hand, hind foot length of females decreased with increasing density only after dry summers, hence when environmental conditions were very harsh. Body condition was affected neither by density nor by drought intensity. Our results indicate that body mass and size are much better indicators of phenotypic quality than body condition in roe deer. The sex-specific responses of body size to environmental conditions could correspond to a differential allocation in favour of daughters by heavier than average roe deer mothers.

AB  - Climate extremes are becoming more frequent with global climate change and have the potential to cause major ecological regime shifts. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, a coastal wetland in Texas suffered sudden vegetation dieback following an extreme precipitation and flooding event associated with Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Historical salt marsh dieback events have been linked to climate extremes, such as extreme drought. However, to our knowledge, this is the first example of extreme precipitation and flooding leading to mass mortality of the salt marsh foundation species, Spartina alterniflora. Here, we investigated the relationships between baseline climate conditions, extreme climate conditions, and large-scale plant mortality to provide an indicator of ecosystem vulnerability to extreme precipitation events. We identified plant zonal boundaries along an elevation gradient with plant species tolerant of hypersaline conditions, including succulents and graminoids, at higher elevations, and flood-tolerant species, including S. alterniflora, at lower elevations. We quantified a flooding threshold for wetland collapse under baseline conditions characterized by incremental increases in flooding (i.e., sea level rise). We proposed that the sudden widespread dieback of S. alterniflora following Hurricane Harvey was the result of extreme precipitation and flooding that exceeded this threshold for S. alterniflora survival. Indeed, S. alterniflora dieback occurred at elevations above the wetland collapse threshold, illustrating a heightened vulnerability to flooding that could not be predicted from baseline climate conditions. Moreover, the spatial pattern of vegetation dieback indicated that underlying stressors may have also increased susceptibility to dieback in some S. alterniflora marshes. Collectively, our results highlight a new mechanism of sudden vegetation dieback in S. alterniflora marshes that is triggered by extreme precipitation and flooding. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of considering interactions between multiple abiotic and biotic stressors that can lead to shifts in tolerance thresholds and incorporating climate extremes into climate vulnerability assessments to accurately characterize future climate threats.

AB  - Many dragonfly species in The Netherlands declined in the 20th century because of acidification, eutrophication, and desiccation of lotic and lentic habitats and canalization of streams and rivers. These pressures peaked in the 1970s, when 26 of 65 native species had an unfavorable conservation status on the 1997 Dutch Red List. Since the 1980s, environmental regulations have led to improved water quality, and many habitat restoration projects have been carried out. We used standardized monitoring data (1999-2013) and unstandardized observations (1991-2013) to investigate how dragonflies have changed in the last 20 y on a national scale. We compared trends of dragonfly species from different habitat types and with southern vs northern distribution in Europe. Dragonflies recovered strongly in The Netherlands in a period of similar to 20 y, probably because of recent habitat improvements. Lotic species have benefitted more than lentic species, and southern species have more positive trends than northern species, suggesting that climate change has contributed to the recovery. Dragonflies were resilient and able to quickly recover when their habitats were restored. Recovery has led to a better conservation status for many species. Unstandardized data delivered results consistent with those from monitoring data and had greater statistical power to detect trends because many more unstandardized data than standardized data were available. Thus, when the goal is to provide a general overview of changes in dragonflies, unstandardized data can outperform standardized abundance data. However, abundance data may deliver complementary information for individual species. Our results support the suitability of dragonflies as indicators of freshwater habitat condition, but they recover more strongly in The Netherlands than many other insects, possibly because of their higher dispersal abilities or different habitat requirements.

AB  - Fatty acid composition and degree of fatty acid saturation during temperature stress in thermointolerant (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and then-no-tolerant (Chaetoceros muelleri) marine diatoms were investigated. A greater number of fatty acids were observed in C. muelleri than in P tricornutum regardless of treatment. The major fatty acids detected were 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 16:2, 16:3, 18:0, 18:1(n-9)c, 18:2(n-6) and 20:5(n-3) with additional fatty acids 18:1(n-9)t and 20:4(n-6) detected in C muelleri. Short duration (2 h) temperature increase above optimal growth temperature had a greater effect on fatty acid composition in C. muelleri than in R tricornutum and the degree of fatty acid saturation was affected more by temperature in C. muelleri than in P. tricornutum during both short and long duration (24 h) treatments. Total protein assay results suggest that P. tricornutum, but not C. muelleri, was undergoing stress under our growing conditions although lipids in both diatoms were affected by increased temperature. Immunodetection of proteins with anti-rubisco indicates that the rubisco large subunit was undergoing greater turnover in C. muelleri than in P. tricornutum. However, the integrity of rubisco as a suitable indicator of lipid status needs further study. This work supports the hypothesis that a particular temperature, and not treatment duration, has the greater effect on changes in fatty acid composition. Furthermore, changes in fatty acid composition and degree of fatty acid saturation occurred more quickly in the diatoms in response to increased temperature than previously observed in nutrient starvation studies. Since diatom lipids represent an important resource for growth and reproduction of marine animals, the rapid alteration of their lipid composition under temperatures normally encountered in marine environments warrants further study.

AB  - The concept of slow cities - "cities of good life" - promoted among small and medium-sized cities, results directly from the idea of sustainable development, which sets as a primary objective the reduction of poverty and increasing the standard and quality of life. The quality of life is understood as ensuring good housing conditions, access to services, health care and education, care for the natural and cultural environment, increasing economic activity and development with respect for spatial order and sustainable development principles. Housing conditions are one of the main determinants of the quality of life. Other decisions such as getting married, starting a family or changing jobs often depend on having adequate housing. The housing situation in Poland in comparison with the majority of EU countries is unfavorable, both in terms of the number of dwellings as well as their quality. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the housing situation and the factors influencing it in the towns associated in the Polish National Cittaslow Network in Warminsko-Mazurskie Voivodeship. In the majority of cities, housing conditions were classified as medium or mediocre. Additionally, the cities were assessed in terms of their economic, demographic and investment potential, which made it possible to construct a synthetic index of their development. The level of the synthetic indicator was influenced most by the demographic, economic and investment situation. Moreover, a weak positive correlation was observed between the synthetic indicator and the housing situation. This means a weak influence of the synthetic indicator on the housing situation and vice versa. Demography in the examined Cittaslow cities influences the general development potential more strongly than housing. Therefore, city leaders should focus on creating instruments and solutions for improving demographic indicators. This is all the more justified, as the long-term forecast shows that this area may improve. This would make it possible to avoid threats resulting from deterioration of the economic and investment situation, and further on - housing.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is comparison of experimental values of the drawing forces to numerical values in different contact conditions, taking into account the appearance of galling which occurs due to of difficult drawing process conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The following two research approaches are used in this paper - the physical modeling, realized by the laboratory experiment, and the numerical simulation of the ironing drawing process. By analyzing the obtained results, the technique of physical modeling, with help of the laboratory equipment and numerical simulation by application of the finite element method, can be successfully used in studying the thin sheet ironing - strip drawing process.
   Findings - It is significant to compare values of the deformation forces obtained by physical experiment to values obtained by the numerical simulation. In that way, it is possible to compare applied contact conditions (four lubricants in that case) and estimate matching of experimentally and numerically obtained results of the deformation forces. Presented results point out very good technological characteristics of ecologically friendly lubricant (single-bath) and grease based on MoS2. Significant decrease of the deformation force was achieved by its application, as well as maintaining of the lubricant's layer during the forming process and almost complete elimination of galling on the contact.
   Practical implications - Numerical analysis of stresses in the working piece wall, during the thin sheet strip drawing, requires precise values of the friction coefficient. It is an important indicator because one can define the contact conditions as the input data for the numerical simulation, based on its values for each type of lubricants and each value of the compressive lateral force.
   Originality/value - The environmentally friendly lubricant tested exhibits a more favorable distribution of the drawing force during the process, mainly in experimental case. Grease based on MoS2 has good lubricating properties but that lubricant is conventional and environmentally unacceptable. Ecologically friendly lubricant can be successfully used in real ironing strip drawing process especially for high values of holding force achieving an increased tool life.

AB  - Our study focuses on the Holocene hydroclimate long-term trends in southern East Siberia and places them in the context of the adjacent areas of the Siberian taiga in the north and the arid central Asia in the south. We present a new record from the eutrophic mire, in the forest-steppe region, covering the last 9000 years. Our multi-proxy approach includes physiochemical (ash content, grain size, micro-charcoal, peat decomposition) and biological indicators (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, molluscs). The record indicates increased humidity during the Holocene Thermal Maximum at 8150-7400 cal. a BP, and drier conditions with evidence for fires at 7400-5100 cal. a BP. Next, wetter conditions occurred at the coring site at 5100-1400 cal. a BP based on evidence of fluvial influence, which is consistent with other records in the wider region. A short-term dry episode occurred at 1400-1300 cal. a BP, followed by a wet Medieval Warm Period (1300-650 cal. a BP) and Little Ice Age (450-300 cal. a BP) and a moderately wet environment from 300 cal. a BP to the present day. These results are consistent with the previously published palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from the steppe and forest-steppe regions in the south of East and West Siberia and taken together reveal a common trend towards wetter conditions with a maximum wetness between 4500 and 3000 cal. a BP. This differs from the taiga region further north and from the Altai-Sayan Mountains and Kazakhstan Hills further south, which show the trend from dry to wet and then to drier conditions in the Holocene, and from the Trans-Baikal region where the Holocene trend is to drier conditions. This study supports the predominant influence of the North Atlantic on the regional palaeoclimate changes in the forest-steppe region of East Siberia during the Holocene.

AB  - Redox condition is an important factor that controls the behavior of various elements in an aquatic environment. Incorporation of redox-sensitive trace elements in minerals describes redox conditions in water and provides information about past environmental changes, unless it is dissolved or recrystallized during sediment burial. In the present study, we explore the application of arsenate/arsenite ratios (As(V)/As(III)) in barite as a new geochemical proxy for paleo-environmental reconstruction. Laboratory experiments showed that both As(III) and As(V) could be incorporated into barite as As(III)- and As(V)-coprecipitated barite, respectively, which could more or less retain the information of the As(V)/As(III) ratio in coexistent water, if under equilibrium in terms of the redox reactions. Furthermore, the As(V)/As(III) ratios in natural barite collected in (i) Tamagawa Hot Spring and (ii) Okinawa hydrothermal vent were determined by micro-X-ray fluorescence and micro-X-ray absorption fine structure analysis to (a) evaluate the reliability of the As(V)/As(III) ratio in barite as a redox indicator in natural system and (b) estimate the depositional redox condition in water whether barite precipitated below or above the redox boundary of As(V)/As(III), or the suboxic/anoxic boundary. Our previous study showed that barite-selenium oxyanion system could also be used as a proxy for the oxic-suboxic boundary because the selenate/selenite [Se(VI)/Se(IV)] ratio in barite is primarily correlated with the ratio in water. Given that the redox boundary of the Se(VI)/Se(IV) ratio has higher redox potential than the As(V)/As(III) boundary, the combination of these two systems can extend the redox condition, which can be specified by the analysis of one single barite grain to a wide region. Thus, one barite particle can provide information on the As(V)/As(III) and Se(VI)/Se(IV) ratios in water, and whether barite precipitated under oxic, suboxic, or anoxic redox environments.

AB  - The application of molecular systematics to the anisakid nematodes of the genera Anisokis, Pseudoterranova and Contracoecum, parasites of aquatic organisms, over the last two decades, has advanced the understanding of their systematics, taxonomy, ecology and phylogeny substantially. Here the results of this effort on this group of species from the early genetic works to the current status of their revised taxonomy, ecology and evolutionary aspects are reviewed for each of three parasitic groups. It has been shown that many anisakid morphospecies of Anisakis, Contracaecum and Pseudoterranova include a certain number of sibling species. Molecular genetic markers provided a rapid, precise means to screen and identify several species that serve as definitive and intermediate and or/paratenic hosts of the so far genetically characterized species. Patterns of differential distribution of anisakid nematodes in various definitive and intermediate hosts are presented. Differences in the life history of related species can be due both to differential host-parasite co-adaptation and co-evolution, and/or to interspecific competition, that can reduce the range of potential hosts in sympatric conditions. Phylogenetic hypotheses attempted for anisakid nematodes and the possible evolutionary scenarios that have been proposed inferred from molecular data, also with respect to the phylogeny of their hosts are presented for the parasite-host associations Anisakis-cetaceans and Controcaecum-pinnipeds, showing that codivergence and host-switching events could have accompanied the evolution of these groups of parasites.
   Finally, examples in which anisakid nematodes recognized genetically at the species level in definitive and intermediate/paratenic hosts from various geographical areas of the Boreal and Austral regions and their infection levels have been used as biological indicators of fish stocks and food-web integrity in areas at high versus low levels of habitat disturbance (pollution, overfishing, by-catch) are presented.

AB  - An in-depth understanding of car-body vibration characteristics is the key to developing more reasonable operational safety and discomfort evaluation indicators. However, few scholars or research institutions have focused on this topic, and the car-body vibration characteristics that are caused by different complex aerodynamic factors are not clear. Therefore, in this study, different train car-body vibrations under different conditions were investigated using full-scale tests from 2014 to 2016. The results revealed that the car-body vibration for different aerodynamic conditions was mainly low-frequency rolling and traversing motion below 1 Hz, and the primary frequency was close to the car-body lower-centre rolling natural frequency. In addition, the evaluations of the train operational safety and the vibrational comfort could be considered coupled under strong wind conditions. There was a strong line relationship between the car-body roll angle and the train overturning coefficient under strong wind conditions, hence, predicting the train's overturning risk by the car-body roll angle was feasible.

AB  - Based on the Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and As content and grain data from the surface sediments of 56 sampling sites in the coastal waters off the northern Shandong Peninsula, the distribution characteristics of heavy metals in sediments were analyzed, and the sources of these elements were discussed. The results show that the distributions of Cr, Pb, and Zn were similar to each other, while the distributions of As and Cd differed from the other three, with Cr, Pb, Cd, and As all showing high concentrations in the Dengzhou shoal. Cr, Pb, and Zn, which are controlled by fine-grained components of surface sediments, mainly originated from natural processes, As mainly originated from aquaculture, and Cd originated from both natural and human sources. The high concentrations of heavy metals were mostly in areas of residual current convergence and coastal current action, and the distribution of heavy metals can be well correlated to the sedimentary dynamic environment. Human activities, grain size and hydrodynamic conditions are therefore important factors that influence the distribution of heavy metals in this study area. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The quantification of glucocorticoid metabolites in hair is a non-invasive tool that provides important information regarding the endocrine status and represents a valuable method for studying potential stressors that may affect carnivores under both natural and non-natural conditions. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland axis and is considered a standard stress indicator for animal welfare. The current study aimed to compare cortisol levels extracted from hair of both dead, frozen European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) and living feral individuals (Felis silvestris catus) living in different environmental conditions. The results obtained revealed that wild individuals exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) higher cortisol concentration (n = 15, mean +/- SD = 8.91 +/- 4.48 pg/mg) than feral ones (n = 10, mean +/- SD = 3.57 +/- 1.25 pg/mg), probably as a result of both the physiological and/or environmental factors to which each subspecies was subject. This is the first study in which cortisol concentrations have been compared within the Felis silvestris subspecies, thus enriching the scarce information available for the Felidae. Nevertheless, further research is needed to better understand the various physiological and ecological factors affecting the adrenocortical activity of species or populations living in different environmental contexts.

AB  - Erythrocyte micronucleus frequencies in wild fish from two riverine environments and in fish reproduced and reared under controlled conditions (control group) were compared, with the aim to evaluate the suitability of the MN test for the in situ detection of mutagens in freshwaters. Fish were caught in different months in two rivers of central Italy which have different pollution levels. As indicator species, the barbel (Barbus plebejus) was chosen because of its ecological significance. Blood samplings were performed on wild fish immediately after capture and repeated at different time intervals on the same individuals, which were maintained in controlled conditions after capture. A total of 10 000 erythrocytes per specimen were scored. No significant differences in micronucleus frequencies were observed between the control group and fish from the unpolluted river (Mignone). A significantly higher frequency of micronuclei was observed in fish caught in the polluted river (Tiber), in comparison to both the controls and the Mignone river fish. No significant seasonal differences were observed. Barbels examined 50 and 100 days after capture presented a remarkable decrease in micronucleus frequency in comparison with the frequency observed in barbels at capture. The micronucleus test in fish erythrocytes was shown to be a sensitive bioassay for detecting mutagenic pollution in fresh water environments.

AB  - Simple Summary Housing and management conditions strongly influence the health, welfare and activity behaviour of horses. To improve horses' living conditions, it is necessary to establish objective and quantifiable measures that allow for a comparison between environmental living conditions and of how horses of different ages and health statuses are influenced by these environmental conditions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to record and compare time budgets (=percentage of time spent on specific activities) of old (>= 20 years) horses and of horses suffering from chronic orthopaedic disease that are living in different husbandry conditions with an automated tracking device. These horses were found to spend similar percentages of time feeding, resting and moving compared to healthy controls. Horses living on different farms and with different turn-out conditions differed in their time budgets. Horses living in open-air group housing on a paddock had less pronounced peaks in their feeding and movement activities over time compared to horses living in more restricted husbandry systems. The findings of the study can help to identify potential improvements of husbandry conditions of horses to maximise their health and welfare. Housing and management conditions strongly influence the health, welfare and behaviour of horses. Consequently, objective and quantifiable comparisons between domestic environments and their influence on different equine demographics are needed to establish evidence-based criteria to assess and optimize horse welfare. Therefore, the present study aimed to measure and compare the time budgets (=percentage of time spent on specific activities) of horses with chronic orthopaedic disease and geriatric (>= 20 years) horses living in different husbandry systems using an automated tracking device. Horses spent 42% (range 38.3-44.8%) of their day eating, 39% (range 36.87-44.9%) resting, and 19% (range 17-20.4%) in movement, demonstrating that geriatric horses and horses suffering from chronic orthopaedic disease can exhibit behaviour time budgets equivalent to healthy controls. Time budget analysis revealed significant differences between farms, turn-out conditions and time of day, and could identify potential areas for improvement. Horses living in open-air group housing on a paddock had a more uniform temporal distribution of feeding and movement activities with less pronounced peaks compared to horses living in more restricted husbandry systems.

AB  - Countries have made a range of international commitments to compile and use natural capital accounts. While processes and methods for compiling natural capital accounts are now well defined, mainstreaming natural capital accounting (NCA) across public sector decision-making remains a practical challenge. This raises the question: which domains of public sector decision-making are important for a phased introduction of NCA? Here, we address a subset of this evidence gap through systematic analysis of the policy-relevance of natural capital accounts in the United Kingdom (UK). We identify 85 UK public sector bodies whose activities can affect the extent or condition of natural capital assets, and 60 bodies whose policy objectives are qualitatively contingent on natural capital stocks or services. For each of these 60 public sector bodies natural capital management (1) is a core policy priority, (2) impacts on policy objectives by regulating natural hazards, or (3) provides ecosystem goods and services that support policy objectives concerning health and well-being. Our findings highlight the considerable cross-cutting relevance of natural capital for public sector decision-making, and the need to account for natural capital in policy domains beyond those focused narrowly on environmental policy and management, e.g. through coordination structures that feature cross-departmental representation.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive requires ecological status classification and monitoring of surface and ground waters using biological indicators. To act as a component of the "Macrophytes and Phytobenthos" biological quality element, as demanded by the Directive, a macrophyte-based assessment system was developed for application in river site types in Germany. Macrophyte abundance data were collected from 262 sites in 202 rivers. Seven biocoenotic river site types were established using differences in characteristic macrophyte communities reflecting ecoregion, channel width, water depth, current velocity, water hardness, and ground water influence. For four of these river site types, a macrophyte assessment system was developed, for the remaining three river site types data were insufficient for developing an assessment system. Ecological status classification of river sites is based on the calculation of a Reference Index value, in some cases supplemented by additional vegetation criteria. The Reference Index quantifies the deviation of species composition and abundance from reference conditions and classifies sites as one of the five possible ecological quality classes specified in the Directive. The assessment of long river stretches with changing river site types along its course is discussed based on an example from the Forstinninger Sempt River, southeast Germany.

AB  - Analysis and planning of ecological networks is a relatively new phenomenon and is a response to fragmentation and deterioration of quality of natural systems. In urban areas. the problems of land use intransigence, political and jurisdictional issues create a difficult environment for implementing ecological networks. The specific questions addressed in this research program revolve around the viability of planning an ecological network in an urban landscape. The development and articulation of an ecological network plan was undertaken previously and in this paper, a series of assays of landscape structure are used to examine the viability of an ecological network in the Phoenix, Arizona urban area. Three principal analyses were utilized: (1) patch content analysis, (2) corridor content analysis, and (3) network structure analysis. Patch and corridor content analyses examined the internal characteristic and immediate context for each of the 89 ecological network elements. The network structure analysis incorporates a process for aggregating results of patch and corridor analyses and incorporates indicators that describe interrelationships between landscape elements. For each of these analyses the existing condition was compared to the optimal plan to demonstrate the level of change that can be expected. The results and conclusions of this research are that an ecological network plan provides modest but important improvement in ecological systems in the Phoenix urban area.

AB  - The ecodesign of a product implies that different potential environmental impacts of diverse nature must be taken into account considering its whole life cycle, apart from the general design criteria (i.e. technical, functional, ergonomic, aesthetic or economic). In this sense, a sustainability assessment methodology, ecological footprint (EF), and environmental risk assessment (ERA), were combined for the first time to derive complementary criteria for the ecodesign of footwear.
   Four models of children's shoes were analyzed and compared. The synthetic shoes obtained a smaller EF (6.5 gm(2)) when compared to the leather shoes (11.1 gm(2)). However, high concentrations of hazardous substances were detected in the former, even making the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and the Cancer Risk (CR) exceed the recommended safety limits for one of the synthetic models analyzed. Risk criteria were prioritized in this case and, consequently, the design proposal was discarded. For the other cases, the perspective provided by the indicators of different nature was balanced to accomplish a fairest evaluation.
   The selection of fibers produced under sustainable criteria and the reduction of the materials consumption was recommended, since the area requirements would be minimized and the absence of hazardous compounds would ensure safety conditions during the use stage.

AB  - An overall sustainability assessment should include changes in the economic return, the social benefits and the human intervention on the biophysical resources in order to highlight potential trade-off or synergies among them. In this work, we studied the performance of 36 cropping systems (CS) of the Pampa region, Argentina, which include three different crops, three increasing levels of technology adoption in four contrasting site conditions. For each CS, we simultaneously assessed 1) the ecosystem energy flow using the emergy synthesis; 2) the pesticide ecotoxicity using a simple dose-response model; and 3) the economic profit, in order to evaluate the influence of crop identity, technological level, and site location on the indicators values as well as to detect potential trade-offs between indicators. Results revealed that maize crop entailed the most sustainable indicator profile by exhibiting relative high emergy return, low non-renewable emergy use, low pesticide ecotoxicity, and high gross income. In addition, results showed a significant trade-off between economic profit and ecotoxicological risk in the CS studied. Further studies should be conducted for including more contrasting indicators in order to explore the potential trade-off among other ecosystem components as a promising way to identify sustainable crop management regimes for different production zones.

AB  - We predicted 22 years of return rates for wild Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscho as a function of environmental conditions experienced during residency in freshwater, tidal delta, bay, and ocean habitats as well as as an indicator of density dependence (based on egg production) across life stages. The best predictors of return rate included the magnitude of floods experienced during incubation, a principal components factor describing environmental conditions during bay residency, a similar factor describing conditions experienced during the third ocean year, and an estimate of egg production. Our models explained up to 90% of the variation in return rate and had a very high forecasting precision, yet environmental conditions experienced during ocean residency explained only 5% of the variation. Our results suggest that returns of wild Chinook salmon can be predicted with high precision by incorporating habitat residency and that freshwater and nearshore environmental conditions strongly influence the survival of Skagit River Chinook salmon.

AB  - Increasing urbanization in coastal areas has not paralleled with adequate sewage treatment, and the overload of organic matter compromise important economic, ecological and social values supported by these ecosystems. Ocean outfalls may be an effective alternative to the destination of wastewater in coastal regions, provided they are properly installed and monitored. In this study, we investigated the effects of a small outfall on a high-energy sandy shore, southern Brazil, using sedimentary steroids, biochemical composition and nutritional quality of organic matter and free-living nematode biodiversity as indicators. The results showed that physical disturbances prevail near the outfall, affecting the densities of the fauna and phytopigments. The higher concentrations of sedimentary sterols detected at 1000 m NE from the outfall indicated the influence of the local hydrodynamic conditions in the transport and dispersion process of the sewage. In this area, the sewage contamination changed the benthic trophic state from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and lead to a strong decrease in the trophic diversity and increase of opportunistic nematode genera. Overall the results showed a relatively low and limited spatial impact from the outfall. The integrated use of fecal sterols, benthic trophic state and nematodes biodiversity were highly effective in detecting sewage contamination of low input of wastewater in a highenergy sandy shore.

AB  - Materials are presented for route, stationary soil, and ecological studies carried out in the high-mountainous zone of Dagestan with the characteristics of (a) the modern features of the development of the soil cover and (b) the ecological parameters of the soil cover and their changes under the influence of climatic warming. The variety of natural and economic conditions of the object of study resulted in significant diversity of the soil cover. The soil distribution was greatly influenced by the terrain height and the exposure and steepness of slopes. Based on soil erosion studies from previous periods, it can be noted that improper land use and climatic warming have led to radical changes in the composition of the soil cover in terms of defining indicators-soil erosion. In recent years, the area of eroded land has doubled, and the area with heavily eroded soils has increased by a third. This led to a decrease in the thickness of humus horizons in almost all soils to an average of 20 cm, and the loss of humus reserves in soils amounted to 60% of the original content. The presented analysis of soil-cover degradation and the established patterns of soil evolution on the slope lands of high mountains serve as a theoretical basis for the reproduction of soil fertility and preservation of the ecological role of soil protection from erosion and other degradation processes.

AB  - Progressive abandonment of pastoral activities, a common phenomenon in most mountainous economically developed areas worldwide, has been causing continuous land-use changes and inducing rapid ecological succession. Pastures are being abandoned, degraded, reforested, or disturbed by natural events. This study aims to investigate the effects of such change from different perspectives: from plant community and forage value changes, to differences in soil properties and soil stability indicators. Phytosociological releves, forage quality analyses and field measurements of soil properties were carried out in 7 different study sites characterized by different grazing intensity (abandoned/under-grazed, moderately grazed, heavy grazed) and environmental conditions (disturbed by hillslope processes or reforested). Results showed significant discrepancies in terms of soil stabilization and ecological aspects. In particular, an increase in soil stabilization occurred where larches (Larix decidua) recolonized the completely abandoned pastures, whereas a decrease was observed in undergrazed pastures. In both cases, forage composition showed impoverished nutritional value for grazing animals. Conversely, an excellent balance between ecological advantages and contribution to soil engineering properties by roots was provided by the moderately grazed areas, mainly covered by Deschampsia cespitosa. This highlights how pasturing facilitates environmental conservation and combats natural processes such as soil erosion and shallow instabilities.

AB  - In predator-prey interactions, both interactors may benefit from sharing information about prey vulnerability. We examined the relationship between calls used to discourage close predators (distress calls) and the health condition of the caller to test whether these signals are reliable indicators of prey quality. The structure of calls from captured lesser short-toed larks Calandrella rufescens was related to their body condition and T-cell-mediated immunocompetence. Birds in better nutritional and immunological condition utter harsher calls (i.e. they spread the call energy over a wider range of frequency) than birds in poorer conditions. Hence, the harshness of distress calls seems honestly to signal the health status of prey and thus their ability to escape, on which the predator might base its optimal foraging choice. Previous studies have investigated the honesty of songs that have evolved via sexual selection, but this is the first study, to our knowledge, the demonstrates a relationship between individual quality and a vocalization primarily shaped by natural selection.

AB  - The present study evaluated the response of the zooplankton communities from two reservoirs in the Brazilian semi-arid region to water volume reduction during a long dry season (similar to 2 years). Our hypotheses were that (i) these reservoirs, even when exposed to periods of drought and water reduction, exhibit a temporal variation in the structure of the zooplankton community; and (ii) the adverse conditions typical of semi-arid regions favor an increase in the biomass of opportunist rotifers, especially microphagous species, which can be used as ecological indicators. The reservoirs located in the Brazilian semi-arid region were monitored between 2012 and 2014. The zooplankton was characterized by a considerable richness (42 species) and high dominance of rotifers, especially microphages. Microcrustaceans, which were represented by four small cladoceran species and copepods (calanoid and cyclopoid), were rare and exhibited low abundance. These semi-arid reservoirs were characterized by significant indicator species: F. saltator (IndVal = 99.4 %), B. angularis (IndVal = 99.1%), F. longiseta (IndVal = 98.2 %) and B. havanaensis (IndVal = 94.6 %). Changes in the environmental parameters, resulting from low water volumes and sparse rain, were associated with changes in the zooplankton community, revealing the unique responses of these semi-arid aquatic ecosystems to environmental changes. The largest reservoir maintained a pattern of rotifer dominance, while the smallest underwent drastic changes in environmental parameters and attributes of the zooplankton community.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the floristic composition and its ecological characteristics of District Tank during 2007-2011 in different seasons. The floristic diversity consisted of 205 species within 56 families. Based on number of species, Poaceae (34 Spp), Papilionaceae (19 Spp), Asteraceae (14 Spp), Chenopodiaceae (10 Spp) and Brassicaceae (9 Spp), Euphorbiaceae (8 Spp), Boraginaceae and Polygonaceae, (each with 7 species) were the leading families. The other families had less than 7 species. Based on the habitat 140 (68.3%) species were growing wild as mesophytes and xerophytes. While 46 species (22.4%) were classified as hydrophytes, 10 species (4.8%) were found both in wet and dry conditions; and 9 species (4.6%) were cultivated for various purposes. There were 24 species (11.7%) with spiny nature. Spinescence is also an indicator of dry soil and environment. Among the perennial species, 19 were deciduous and 83 evergreen. The leaf lamina was simple in 152 species (74.1%), 5 species (2.4%) were leafless, while in the remaining 48 species (23.4%) had compound leaves. Biological spectrum of flora indicated that therophytes followed by hemicryptophytes were dominant. Leaf spectra revealed that nanophylls, leptophylls, microphylls and mesophylls were the most prevalent leaf sizes. Cuscuta reflexa, Capparis decidua, Periploca aphylla, P. calophlla and Equisetum arvense were aphyllous species.

AB  - Changes in climate and land use can impact natural systems across all levels of ecological organization. Most documented and anticipated effects consider species' properties, including phenologies, geographic distributions, and abundances. Responses of higher-level aggregate community or ecosystem properties have not been considered as they are assumed to be relatively stable due to compensatory dynamics and diversity-stability relationships. However, this assumption may not be as fundamental as previously thought. Here we assess stability in the aggregate properties of total abundance, biomass, and energy consumption for small-mammal communities in the Great Basin, using paired historical and modern survey data spanning nearly a century of environmental change. Results show marked declines in each aggregate property independent of spatial scale, elevation, or habitat type, and a reallocation of available biomass and energy favoring diet and habitat generalists. Because aggregate properties directly reflect resource availability, our findings indicate a regionwide decline in resources of similar to 50% over the past century, which may signal a resource crisis. This work illustrates the power of using aggregate properties as indicators of ecological conditions and environmental change at broad spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Mandibles from separate populations of free-living mouflons (Ovis aries musimon) from Southern Spain, submitted to different ecological conditions, were studied. Searching for ontogenetic shape variations we used geometric morphometrics tools and we explored the use of several mathematical models for describing growth rate variations between populations and sexes. A strong allometry was detected with variations in shape mainly matching with molar and premolar eruption. Mandible shape did not vary significantly with sex nor was sexual size dimorphism detected in adults, whatever the population. By modeling growth we detected differences between populations in all parameters such as the maturity rate describing precocity, and the time it took to reach asymptotic size (varying from 9 up to 18 months). A longer period of growth did not result in a larger asymptotic size, but it led to smaller mandibles. Mouflons with relatively late teeth replacement, lower maturation rate and smaller adult size were those of the population submitted to extreme environmental conditions, like epizootic disease, droughts and ungulate overpopulations. We discuss how a delay in reaching mature size has probably an important subsequent impact on reproductive and life-history traits in this species. Being able to record the effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors, mandibles become a target of interest for ecological and management studies also on mouflons.

AB  - Hydromorphological transformations of small urban streams results in changes in habitat conditions, i. e. increase in water speed current and/or oxygen concentration, and finally changes in aquatic organism structure. The ecological status of two regulated urban streams was determined by diatom-based biomonitoring in their upper and lower sections using selected diatom indices (IO, IPS, IBD, GDI, TDI). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to analyse the structure of diatom assemblages and to reveal the spatial relationships between stream sites. The bioassessment was supported with a chemical analysis of the water. The upper sections were found to be characterised by poor/bad ecological status, and the lower sections below highly-transformed and impacted streambeds by good/moderate status. Since the bioassessment revealed unexpected results, an analysis was performed of the dominant species, with special attention paid to the autecology of diatoms. A new model of bioassessment was implemented where the most frequent and dominant species, Achnanthidium minutissimum, was excluded from the analysis. The results obtained by the new analysis were similar to those of the chemical analysis. Such a critical approach is needed to reveal the true ecological status of flowing water ecosystems, particularly in the case of regulated streams where transformation has resulted in a change in more ` pseudo-mountain' habitat conditions.

AB  - Quantum dots KIDS) are increasingly being used for electronics, solar energy generation, and medical imaging applications. Most QDs consist of a heavy metal core/shell coated with amphiphilic organics that stabilize the nanoparticles and allow conjugation with biological molecules. In this study, QDs were evaluated for their effects on bacterial pure cultures, which serve as models of cell toxicity and indicators of potential impact to ecosystem health. QDs with intact surface coatings decreased growth rates of Gram positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram negative Escherichia coli but were not bactericidal. In contrast weathering of various types of QDs under acidic (pH <= 4) or alkaline (pH : 10) conditions significantly increased bactericidal activity due to the rapid (<1 min) release of cadmium and selenite ions following QD destabilization upon loss of the organic coating. Toxicity was mitigated by humic acids, proteins, and other organic ligands that reduced metal bioavailability. The best available science, which is limited, suggests that QDs are potentially safe materials when used in their intended applications at near-neutral pH. These results forewarn us that even moderately acidic or alkaline conditions could lead to significant and localized organism effects due to toxic exposure to dissolved heavy metals. Thus, biocompatibility and ecotoxicity tests for QDs should consider in vivo and/or in situ transformations to fully characterize the potential risks to environmental health.

AB  - Invertebrate and trace fossil assemblages in wet interdune deposits of the Wahiba Sand Sea record environmental changes associated with the Indian Ocean Monsoon system during the Early Holocene wet period. This period is dated locally by infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from ca. 9300 to 5500 years ago. Lacustrine deposits from interdune areas of the central sand sea developed during peak precipitation 9300 years (IRSL) ago. The deposits represent short-lived but permanent lakes characterized by salinity tolerant freshwater snails and ostracodes. Diverse trace fossils exposed on the present-day surface show that the dried out lake sediments became substrates for the dwelling, feeding, and reproductive activities of insects. This period of continued moist conditions with pronounced vegetation cover is recorded in post-lacustrine, wet interdune deposits from the coastal Wahiba Sand Sea. A 4-m thick succession of interdune deposits was dated to ca. 8500-5500 years (IRSL). This interdune succession shows intense bioturbation by rhizocretions and insect burrows and nests. Both sites of wet interdune deposits show that changes of moist conditions during the Early Holocene wet period can be monitored by a variety of biological indicators. The ecological information of in situ animal species and trace fossil assemblages adds to the understanding how climatic changes are expressed in continental environments. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The following biomarkers were investigated in stream populations of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and gammarids (Gammarus pulex) to determine if crayfish mortality could have been confounded by pollutants: (1) alterations of fish liver ultrastructure, (2) fish gill and kidney histopathology, (3) stress protein (hsp70) expression in fish liver and gills and in gammarids, and (4) changes in various blood parameters of brown trout. In addition, the following measurements were conducted in parallel with the biological sampling: (a) chemical analyses including several pesticides, organochlorines, PCBs, and PAHs in sediment and tissue samples of brown trout and crayfish (Astacus astacus), and (b) limnochemical analyses of nutrients, electrolytes, dissolved oxygen content, temperature and pH. Biomarkers together with chemical and limnochemical analyses concomitantly indicated modern pollution of the stream at all sampling sites. Biological data indicated a transient, episodic event at one sampling site resulting (a) in altered stress protein levels in gills and livers of trout and in whole gammarids as well as (b) in elevated numbers of macrophages in liver tissue. Biomarker responses provided spatial and temporal evidence that a contaminant release was associated with the crayfish mortalities observed in this stream system.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has embraced a new strategy of environmental protection that is place-driven rather than program-driven. This new approach focuses on the protection of entire ecosystems. To develop an effective strategy of ecosystem protection, however, EPA will need to: (1) determine how to define and delineate ecosystems and (2) categorize threats to individual ecosystems and priority rank ecosystems at risk. Current definitions of ecosystem in use at EPA are inadequate for meaningful use in a management or regulatory context. A landscape-based definition that describes an ecosystem as a volumetric unit delineated by climatic and landscape features is suggested. Following this definition, ecosystems are organized hierarchically, from megaecosystems, which exist on a continental scale (e.g., Great Lakes), to small local ecosystems.
   Threats to ecosystems can generally be categorized as: (1) ecosystem degradation (occurs mainly through pollution) (2) ecosystem alteration (physical changes such as water diversion), and (3) ecosystem removal (e.g., conversion of wetlands or forest to urban or agricultural lands). Level of threat (i.e., how imminent), and distance from desired future condition are also important in evaluating threats to ecosystems. Category of threat, level of threat, and ''distance'' from desired future condition can be combined into a three-dimensional ranking system for ecosystems at risk. The purpose of the proposed ranking system is to suggest a preliminary framework for agencies such as EPA to prioritize responses to ecosystems at risk.

AB  - Human pressure can cause a decrease in the abundance of beach macrofauna, especially supralittoral crustaceans. In studying the life history traits of supralittoral crustaceans, human impact and beach features (e.g. beach slope, grain size, swash width) are often considered separately. Ghost crabs are widely accepted as ecological indicators of beach quality and condition since their abundance decreases at disturbed beaches; moreover, ghost crabs can respond to natural drivers. This study aims to determine factors affecting the density of the ghost crab Ocypode quadrata in the Mexican Caribbean. We studied the spatiotemporal variation of the density of ghost crabs at two urbanized and two reference beaches by counting crab burrows on all beaches during six sampling periods. Our results indicate that physical features of the beach are significantly correlated with burrow density, and burrow density varies substantially between urbanized and reference beaches. The greater variation of burrow density accounted for beach disturbance, followed by beach morphodynamic features. Based on these results, our study confirms that the ghost crab is a relevant biological indicator species and is useful for guiding beach management criteria in the Mexican Caribbean. Our findings demonstrate that temporal replications must be included when using ghost crabs as ecological indicators. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, fisheries and forestry have been characterised by substantial ecological and economic problems. Both sectors have become notorious for depleting the stocks on which they depend, eroding the value of harvested natural resources over time and having significant negative by-catch' impacts on non-target natural resources. Problems of resource overuse and potential ecosystem collapse inherently derive from poor decisions influenced by those with undue or excessive economic, political and labour market power. Solutions to problems of unsustainability of resource management will need to engage with these economic drivers and beneficiaries, and require strategies including better and more independent assessments of the status and condition of resources. Deep-seated problems caused by resource over-commitment need more robust approaches to resource assessment that (1) better account for uncertainty (including uncertainty resulting from stock losses due to disturbance), (2) avoid ratchet effects and (3) provide appropriate ecological parameters for resource harvest. The United Nations framework for environmental and economic accounting methods can help assess the economic and other contributions of different resource-based industries and inform decisions about trade-offs between competing interests. Finally, there is value in examining successful and unsuccessful industry restructuring, in which decisions to transition away from demonstrably unsustainable resource industries have been made.

AB  - Bioassessment evaluates ecosystem health by using the responses of a community of organisms that integrate all aspects of the ecosystem. A variety of bioassessment methods have been applied to aquatic ecosystems; however, terrestrial methods are less advanced. The objective of this study was to examine baseline differences in ant communities at different seral stages from clear cut to mature pine plantation as a precursor to developing a broader terrestrial bioassessment protocol. Comparative sampling was conducted at nine sites having four seral stages: clearcut, 5 year recovery, 15 year recovery, and mature stands. Soil and vegetation data were also collected at each site. Ants were identified to genus. Analysis of the ant data indicated that ants respond strongly to habitat changes that accompany ecological succession in managed pine forests, and both individual genera and ant community structure can be used as indicators of successional change. Ants exhibited relatively high diversity in both early and mature seral stages. High ant diversity in mature seral stages was likely related to conditions on the forest floor favoring litter dwelling and cold climate specialists. While ants may be very useful in identifying environmental stress in managed pine forests, adjustments must be made for seral stage when comparing impacted and unimpacted forests.

AB  - The worldwide decline of seabird populations due to the combined effects of global and regional changes is creating immense challenges for managers and conservationists. Predicting population responses to proposed management strategies could provide the most effective tools to prevent, halt and reverse ongoing declines. System dynamic modelling frameworks are considered particularly relevant to interrelate biological, ecological and environmental characteristics and to predict population trends. A system dynamics model was designed, compiling diverse information concerning a relict population of the European Shag located in western Iberia, to outline the most effective management options for its conservation. The simulations demonstrate that mortality caused by invasive animals and bycatch mortality were the main reasons for the current population decline. Without management interventions, a decrease of 8% was projected for the next decade, which could be mitigated by specific conservation actions. The results show the usefulness of dynamic modelling frameworks to understand local cause-effect relationships and species responses to ecosystem management under changing environmental conditions. We highlight that the framework proposed, after specific parameterization, could be easily adaptable to other species within similar socio-ecological systems.

AB  - An investigation of the soil nematode communities in four natural European peatlands of the Protected Landscape Area Horna Orava, Slovakia, was conducted to determine the diversity of the associated soil nematode community structures. A total of 112 nematode species belonging to 66 nematode genera were detected. Nineteen species, including a root-knot nematode species Meloidogyne kralli, were recorded in Slovakia for the first time, increasing the number of soil nematodes recorded from 704 to 723. This high diversity was associated with the occurrence of taxa preferring the wet soil conditions such as Ditylenchus intermedius, Epidorylaimus agilis, Metateratocephalus crassidens, Helicotylenchus hydrophilus, Mesorhabditis irregularis, Semitobrilus pellucidus. The number of species and genera did not correlate with the nematode abundance, as the highest number of species and genera where not found in sites with the highest number of nematodes. Feeding type composition was similar at all of the investigated peatlands and bacteriovores were the dominant trophic group (50 %) with a preponderance of Rhabditis nematodes. The ecological indices (MI, PPI, aMI, MI2-5 and PPI/MI ratio) indicated that the native ecosystems studied were relatively mature and stable, with a B/F ratio indicating a prevalence of bacterial decomposition pathways corresponding to high values of the NCR index.

AB  - Genetic modification (GM) of microalgae to improve commercial production of biofuels is underway. Inevitable governmental regulations will likely address environmental, economic and human health impacts. Proactive addressing of such regulatory protection goals should begin now, during early development of this new, potentially large and transformative industry. We present strategies for ecological risk assessment of GM algae for commercial mass cultivation assuming that escape of GM algae into the environment is unavoidable. We consider the potential ecological, economic and health impacts of GM algae that persist in and alter natural ecosystems. Horizontal gene transfer with native organisms is of particular concern for certain traits, especially when cultivating GM cyanobacteria. In general, we predict that most target GM algal traits are unlikely to confer a selective advantage in nature, and thus would rapidly diminish, resulting in low but nonzero ecological risk. Genetic and mechanical containment, plus conditional matching of GM algal traits to unnatural cultivation conditions, would further reduce risk These hypothetical predictions must be verified through rigorous ongoing monitoring and mesocosm experiments to minimize risk and foster public and regulatory acceptance.

AB  - Wetlands play a very important role in ecosystems. Qixinghe Wetland is a nature reserve area in northeastern China. In this paper, diatom communities and environmental qualities were investigated at eight sites in Qixinghe Wetland. This study was to examine diatom species patterns in relation to environmental variables in wetlands, and to use diatoms as indicators to water quality in wetlands and wetland classification. Diatoms were sampled in summers and autumns in 2002 and 2004, during which 180 taxa were identified. Environmental variations in pH, temperature, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured. The seasonal composition and abundance of diatoms changed greatly during the study period. The relationship between diatoms and chemical water quality was estimated statistically. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests revealed that all water environmental variables changed during the study period (P < 0.05). Among all the parameters, variation in BOD among the sites was a very important determinant of species composition according to the CCA, and BOD decreased from 2002 to 2004. Our results suggest that the water quality had improved during the three-year period because of enhanced environmental protection with less human disturbance. We conclude that diatoms can be used to indicate water quality and habitat conditions in this wetland.

AB  - Ecosystem assessment and monitoring requires the development and application of suitable indicators, i.e. they need to be (i) reliable and capable of simplifying complex relationships, (ii) quantifiable and transparent in order to enable an easy communication, and (iii) fit for the purpose of indication. These requirements are scarcely fulfilled in current ecosystem assessment and monitoring efforts to address the requirements of international biodiversity conventions. Here we present and test a set of seven criteria towards an improved framework for ecosystems indication with particular emphasis on the indication of biodiversity and ecosystem services: purpose of indication, indicator type according to the EEA's Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response scheme, direct/indirect linkages to biodiversity and ecosystem services, spatial scale and scalability across scales, applicability of benchmarks/reference values, availability of data and protocols, and applicability of remote sensing. The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale. Based on the general trends revealed by our evaluation, we present recommendations to streamline and improve ecosystem indication with respect to international biodiversity conventions. The implementation of our recommendations does require concerted international effort, comparable, for instance, to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Europe.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are among the most used biological quality elements for assessing the condition of all types of aquatic ecosystems worldwide (i.e., fresh water, transitional, and marine). Current morphology-based assessments have several limitations that may be circumvented by using DNA-based approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 90 publications on the use of DNA metabarcoding of benthic macroinvertebrates in aquatic ecosystems bioassessments. Metabarcoding of bulk macrozoobenthos has been preferentially used in fresh waters, whereas in marine waters, environmental DNA (eDNA) from sediment and bulk communities from deployed artificial structures has been favored. DNA extraction has been done predominantly through commercial kits, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) has been, by far, the most used marker, occasionally combined with others, namely, the 18S rRNA gene. Current limitations include the lack of standardized protocols and broad-coverage primers, the incompleteness of reference libraries, and the inability to reliably extrapolate abundance data. In addition, morphology versus DNA benchmarking of ecological status and biotic indexes are required to allow general worldwide implementation and higher end-user confidence. The increased sensitivity, high throughput, and faster execution of DNA metabarcoding can provide much higher spatial and temporal data resolution on aquatic ecological status, thereby being more responsive to immediate management needs.

AB  - The soil microbial biomass of soil is being increasing recognized as sensitive indicator of soil quality. Its knowledge is fundamental for sustainable environment management. The soil microbial biomass C, N and P were studied in four different land uses of dry tropical forest of Udaipur, Rajasthan, Western India to assess the influence of abiotic, physico-chemical variables and difference in different land uses (mixed forest, butea plantation, grassland and agricultural lands) on the seasonal variation in soil microbial biomass. Microbial biomass C, N and P were highest during rainy season and lowest during winter in all the four different land use with the exception of microbial N which was lowest in summer in mixed forest and butea plantation. Microbial biomass C and N were shown to be significantly correlated to the abiotic and physico-chemical variables of the soil, such as soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, organic C, total N, clay, and pH. Present study clearly shows that land use has a significant effect on microbial biomass C, N and P in soil by altering natural soil characteristics under the same ecological conditions.

AB  - The sand dune areas in coastal regions of South Korea are very important ecosystems because of their small sizes, habitats of rare species, and beautiful landscape. Our studies aim to investigate vegetation status of sand dunes on representative three sides of Korean peninsula and estimate plant distribution condition. We established plots along line transects perpendicular to the coastal line of sand dunes to estimate cover and enumerate individual number of all species. TWINSPAN (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis) and CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) were performed to classify communities on sand dunes and assess species composition variation. The dominant species at plots of the east, the south, and the west coast were different. Carex kobomugi, Elymus mollis, Lolium multiflorum - Calystegia soldanella, and Fitex rotundifolia communities were classified from TWINSPAN. CCA showed that species composition varied according to sand dune structure, exotic species number, and slack width. Shinduri is considered as representative Korean natural sand dune ecosystem because of undisturbed status composed of primary dune including foredune and slack, and secondary dune and higher species richness than the other sand dunes. Therefore, other disturbed sand dunes should be restored following Shinduri sand dune structure and vegetation composition. The restoration options for sand dune areas in South Korea are as follows: the restoration of other sand dune areas toward the condition of Shinduri sand dune, introduction plant species of Shinduri sand dune into other sand dune areas, prohibition of artificial building and exotic soils, and conservation of sand dune surrounding areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities significantly influence the lake environment and are reflected by the element contents in sediments/soils. The lake fragmentation provides a unique opportunity for comparing the influences of natural/anthropogenic activities of different wetlands systems. In this study, a complex and fragmented lake was investigated, and sediment/soil samples were collected from different systems. The nutrient contents (C, N, and P), stable isotopic compositions (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and trace metal contents (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the sediments/soils were measured to determine the natural and anthropogenic influences and pollution sources. Lake fragmentation was caused by insufficient water input and long-term agricultural and aquacultural activities of local residents. Due to the effect of anthropogenic activities, the enrichment conditions of various elements differed significantly for different wetland systems. Industrial, agricultural, and biological sources significantly influenced the element enrichment in different systems. The results demonstrated that the anthropogenic activities significantly influenced the sediments/soils in wetland systems, and the lake fragmentation reduced the diffusion of the contaminants. These results provide accurate reference information for pollution control, lake management, and ecological restoration.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs), a form of natural or ecological engineering, are used for wastewater clarification as well as water resource conservation and restoration around the world. To assess the ecological and environmental functions of CWs, this paper proposes a systematic index system using a rate-level method to reflect the subjective and objective value of the wetland as well as to quantify its functional capacity. The systematic index framework, consisting of hydrology and ecology, along with landscape, socio-economic and service factors, is developed using the DPSIR (Driving Force, Pressure, State-Impact and Respond) model. Information on wetlands in Taiwan including the construction, operational status, and water purification ability, together with questionnaires, is collected. The results indicate that hydrological conditions and the types of plants in wetlands are the major determinants of the success of constructed wetlands. According to questionnaires answered by experts, the functional assessment system is composed of six oriented components, 13 main indicators, and 29 sub-indicators. The six components are Protection of Water Resources, Landscape and Environmental Maintenance, Ecosystem Health, Cultural Assets, Social/Economic Services, and Operations and Management. This research will provide an assessment of the implementation of constructed wetland efficiency and multi-objective planning of constructed wetlands, and may serve as a reference for the government in amending the wetlands law in Taiwan.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) requires the analysis of biological elements of aquatic ecosystems to assess water quality. Diatoms are the component of the periphyton most commonly used to classify lotic environments. Within the context of the WFD the concept of 'reference conditions' was introduced and biological quality of watercourses is expressed as Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR). This study was carried out in Alto Adige/Sudtirol (Province of Bolzano-Bozen, northern Italy), belonging to the Alpine eco-region, and to the hydro-ecoregion Inner Alps. During 2006-2009, epilithic diatoms were sampled from monitoring and reference sites of seven stream types. Diatom assemblages were analysed with TWINSPAN and CCA analyses to investigate species association and distribution in relation to stream characteristics. Altitude and geology resulted to be the most important factors influencing diatom assemblage composition, and were used to describe new stream types. Indicator species analysis was used to characterize reference assemblages. The biological quality of watercourses was assessed using different diatom indices: Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (IPS), Eutrophication and Pollution Index with Diatoms (EPI-D), Trophic Index (TI). We tested also the Intercalibration Common Metric index (ICM).

AB  - In arid hot dry areas, of southern Tunisia, the intense agricultural development of more than 200,000 tons/year relies on the exploitation of groundwater resources. The scarcity of freshwaters intensifies the abstraction from deep high mineralized groundwater resources to maintain the eco-social security of the local population. However, the emerging impacts of the used water quality elicit the public concern for the likely effects on the sustainability of the agro-systems regarding the climate conditions and the farming practices. Thus, this paper attempts to examine the evolution of irrigation water quality and its relative impacts on the fragile balance between ecosystem healthy functioning and sustainable services and the anthropogenic activities namely farm households and irrigation techniques.
   The outcome of this review indicates that the amplitude of the progressive land degradation is amplified by the inefficient water management. These cumulative impacts induce incurable effects leading to the progressive fertility loss of agricultural lands (about 1.25 ha/yr). The used agro-ecological indicators show that the basin irrigation technique, water distribution management and individual farming practices lead to increasing loss of productivity gain. In these agro-based areas, emergency institutional and political rehabilitation efforts are required to reorganize farm systems and to limit the unintended impacts for securing sustainable eco-environmental services.

AB  - This paper reports the results of biological analyses (pigments, diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, cladocerans, chironomids and ostracods) of a ca. 14 m-long sediment core recovered from Lake Albano (Central Italy) in the course of the EU-funded project PALICLAS (PALaeoenvironmental analysis of Italian Crater Lake and Adriatic Sediments).
   A reconstruction of the environmental evolution and ecosystem response of Lake Albano during the last ca. 30 kyr was possible. Additional information on lake level oscillation is obtained from benthic and planktonic palaeocommunities. Several oscillations in the productivity and the level of the lake were detected in the oldest sediment layers (from ca. 30 kyr BP to ca. 17 kyr BP), followed by a long (ca. 5 kyr BP) period of low productivity in which cold, holomictic conditions prevailed. A period of high biological activity and, probably, meromictic conditions during the early-mid Holocene was detected. A clear impact of human activities in the catchment was found at ca. 4 kyr BP in the form of increased erosion, associated with a decline in the abundance of biological remains. Further signs of human impact on the lake ecosystem are recorded during the Roman period. Although large-scale environmental changes (e.g. regional climate changes) caused many of the observed biological changes, human activities were important during the mid-late Holocene.

AB  - This paper discusses rapid flow and stage fluctuations in a large lowland river downstream from a large hydropower plant (HPP) in Lithuania. The main problem arises when the HPP is operating in peak mode. Such operation of HPP causes rapid flow and stage fluctuations, which can have a certain impact on river ecosystems. The study analyzes general abiotic indicators such as upramping and downramping rates and stage fluctuations downstream of the HPP. The main idea was to assess recorded stage upramping and downramping rates along the river downstream of large HPP. To assess stage fluctuation statistics, COSH software was used. A maximum upramping rate of 1.04 m/h and maximum downramping rate of 0.88 m/h were identified using data from temporary and permanent gauging stations. Obtained results revealed that stage fluctuations exceed ecologically acceptable rates up to 20 km downstream of HPP. The effect of hydropeaking fades out only at a chainage of 45 km downstream of HPP. In mountainous regions, ecologically acceptable rates are reached at much smaller distances. The study shows that the traditional coefficient of variation of stage fluctuation data can be used to describe hydropeaking indicators. The main results of this study can be used for environmental impact assessment downstream from HPPs.

AB  - The National Park Service has developed a long-term ecological monitoring program for 32 ecoregional networks containing more than 270 parks with significant natural resources. The monitoring program assists park managers in developing a broad-based understanding of the status and trends of park resources as a basis for making decisions and working with other agencies and the public for the long-term protection of park ecosystems. We found that the basic steps involved in planning and designing a long-term ecological monitoring program were the same for a range of ecological systems including coral reefs, deserts, arctic tundra, prairie grasslands, caves, and tropical rainforests. These steps involve (1) clearly defining goals and objectives, (2) compiling and summarizing existing information, (3) developing conceptual models, (4) prioritizing and selecting indicators, (5) developing an overall sampling design, (6) developing monitoring protocols, and (7) establishing data management, analysis, and reporting procedures. The broad-based, scientifically sound information obtained through this systems-based monitoring program will have multiple applications for management decision-making, research, education, and promoting public understanding of park resources. When combined with an effective education program, monitoring results can contribute not only to park issues, but also to larger quality-of-life issues that affect surrounding communities and can contribute significantly to the environmental health of the nation.

AB  - We assess the quality of surface water in water bodies located in the Middle Volga region (Russian Federation). The water quality is assessed using 19 chemical compounds and cilioplankton indicators, such as the total number of species, the abundance of each species, and, based on both of them, the saprobity index and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H). We classify the water quality from polluted to extremely dirty by using abiotic indicators, and from conditionally clean to dirty by means of biotic indicators. Using the logistic regression method, we are able to predict the water quality (clean or dirty) in correspondence with the species diversity index (H) and to clarify how the quality of the water is related to its physicochemical properties. The seven most significant chemical predictors of both natural origin (mineralization, hydro carbonates, and chlorides) and natural-anthropogenic origin (organic substances (according to BOD5), nitrates, total petroleum hydrocarbons, iron), identified during the stepwise selection procedure, have a substantial influence on the outcome of the model. Qualitative and quantitative indicators of development of ciliates, as well as indices calculated on their basis, allow assessing with a very high level of accuracy the water quality and the condition of aquatic ecosystems in general. The Shannon index calculated for the number of ciliates can be successfully used for ranking water bodies as "clean/dirty".

AB  - Quality control and traceability of Argan oil requires precise chemical characterization considering different provenances. The fatty acid profile is an essential parameter that certifies the quality and purity of Argan oil. In addition, stable isotopes were recently shown to be accurate as an indicator for geographical origin. In this study, fatty acid composition by gas chromatography (GC) and stable isotope ratio by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) were investigated for classifying Argan oil according to its geographical origin. Forty-one Argan oil samples, belonging to six geographical origins of Moroccan natural Argan population (Safi, Essaouira, Agadir Ida Outanane, Taroudant, Tiznit and Sidi Ifni) were collected and extracted under the same conditions. The results show that the isotope delta C-13, palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) were strongly influenced by ecological parameters. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to discriminate the six studied provenances. Discriminant models predicted the origin of Argan oil with 92.70% success. Samples from Safi, Essaouira and Agadir Ida Outanane presented the highest classification rate (100%). In contrast, the lowest rate was reported for samples from Tiznit (85.70%). The findings obtained for fatty acids and isotope combination might be considered as an accurate tool for determining the geographical origins of Argan oil. Moreover, they can potentially be used as specific markers for oils labeled with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).

AB  - Positive biotic interactions play a significant role in shaping ecological communities. We used an individual-based model to demonstrate that plant facilitation on a microscale may cause ecosystem shifts on a landscape scale that can be announced by generic early-warning indicators. Recruitment of woody plants in harsh environments such as drylands often depends on nurse plants that ameliorate stressful conditions and facilitate the establishment of seedlings under their canopy. We found that these facilitative interactions may cause a treeless and a woodland state to be alternative stable states on a landscape scale if nurse plant effects are strong and if the environment is harsh enough to make facilitation necessary for seedling survival. A corollary is that under such conditions environmental change can bring drylands to tipping points for woody plant encroachment or woodland collapse. We show that the proximity of tipping points may be indicated by slowness of recovery of woody vegetation cover from small perturbations as well as by elevated temporal and spatial autocorrelation and variance. These signs are known to be indicators of critical slowing down. This is the first demonstration that the systemic phenomena of tipping points, announced by critical slowing down as a warning signal, may plausibly arise from microscale individual interactions, such as plant facilitation.

AB  - Fish and lampreys were sampled by electrofishing in the Pilica River tributaries (the Vistula catchment, Poland) in 1992-1994 and 2003-2005. The patterns in fish assemblages were recognized on the basis of fish biomass using Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) technique, combined with the indicator values (IndVal) for assessment of associations of fish species with particular SOM regions (and respective environmental conditions). Although the fish samples were clustered mostly according to the stream features (size, regulation, and pollution), a weaker temporal gradient indicated a recovery of the ichthyofauna in some smaller streams. The larger tributaries served as sources of colonisers for both the Pilica and the smaller streams. The differences between SOM subclusters in the quality of the aquatic environment were effectively presented with certain biological measures, including the dominances of potentially large species and non-psammophilous rheophils, which are proposed as good bioindicators. It is worth mentioning that some closely related species (ide and dace, silver bream and bream, golden loach and spined loach, and Ukrainian lamprey and brook lamprey) were significantly associated with different SOM regions (and respective environmental conditions), perhaps in this way avoiding competition.

AB  - Education opportunities, capacity building and scientific knowledge are poorly studied intellectual ecosystem services (IES), especially as generated by protected areas (PAs). Based on the cascade model of ecosystem services, we use simple indicators to quantify IES generated in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. IES are potentially valuable in guiding and capacitating conservation management and policy. We consider measures and conditions to enhance this important role. Benefits from IES are valued by external researchers and educators, as is evident from their willingness to engage and collaborate in the production and dispersal of benefits. Collaboration was enhanced by measures (subsidized accommodation for visiting scientists, sites for the development of education facilities, administrative support, a culture of shared learning) designed to attract and maintain partnerships between KNP staff and external researchers and educators. These measures enabled the dispersal of IES benefits across scales, and helped to ensure that benefits fed back to park management. Collaborative planning to mainstream ecosystems services is needed to improve alignment between IES production and PA management needs. There is also evidence of wide disparities between individual PAs in the generation of IES, resulting from features that are attractive to researchers. Such disparities can be mitigated by measures to attract research collaboration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In environmental policy in Japan, the benefits derived from agro-ecosystems have traditionally been defined as "multiple functions of agricultural production activities." Even after the concept "ecosystem services" was introduced to Japanese policy, it was not often used for agriculture and forestry where policy mostly evolves around the term "multiple functions." Streamlining the concepts would clarify future policy. This paper aimed to identify future pathways for satoyama as resilient socio-ecological systems based on a review of past and current environmental policy that had an impact on secondary ecosystems in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. From case studies on two diverse satoyama landscapes, natural resource use and the impact of national and prefectural policy were examined. Based on these reviews, two directions to be taken were clarified: the first direction involves the use of grants and other legal support frameworks to ensure that agriculture, forestry, and fisheries industries and the local community conserve and enhance ecosystem services while implementing farmland consolidation and labor-saving measures. The second direction implies efforts to discover and identify values in traditional satoyama structures in areas where the conditions for agricultural activity are relatively unfavorable and unprofitable. The results showed that a better integrated regional policy framework is needed. It should comprise both directions while taking into account the natural and cultural features of each satoyama.

AB  - In the context of riparian wetlands restoration, the cryptogam floras of different alluvial areas of the Rhine were analysed in relation to their location within the hydrographic network. Three study sites were chosen for their particular hydrographic characteristics. The first has been totally disconnected from the Rhine since 1970 and is fed only by groundwater, the second is partly connected, and the third is flooded almost every year. Bryophytic vegetation is already very differentiated between the sites. Connection to the Rhine appears to provide eutrophic conditions that influence waters and soils and generates geomorphological processes such as silt settling and thus influences moss communities. Disconnection is characterized by oligotrophization processes that influence the composition of the flora and which lead to drying-up of the forest climate which is detrimental to the epiphytic cryptogams. The data obtained specify the ecological typology that will be considered in the management plan of the Rhine nature reserves. They provide indicators of the impacts of planned flooding projects which map enable optimization between the influence of the river and conservation of the phreatic streams which currently provide important refuges for many taxa which occurred previously in the high quality waters of the Rhine at the turn of the century.

AB  - This review examines information generated over the past decade on the pollution of rivers in regions with a mediterranean-type climate (med-climate). Pollution has clearly increased in the last 100 years and is correlated with the development of industry, agriculture and human population. Important efforts have been made in some med-climate countries in order to characterise the chemical status of rivers. In addition, the number of chemical substances detectable in mediterranean-climate rivers (med-rivers), as well as the limits of detection, have improved from the development of better analytical methods. New substances detected in rivers are gaining attention. We discuss available knowledge regarding real and potential effects of pollutants on the biota and ecosystems in med-rivers, taking into account natural environmental characteristics of these rivers. The extreme seasonal conditions in med-rivers add to the potential risk because these characteristics can enhance pollutant effects. Efforts and policies to prevent or reduce pollution effects on med-rivers are linked to the knowledge about pollution pressures associated with the degree of economic development. Aquatic communities in med-rivers are more sensitive to pollutants because they are exposed to strong natural and human stressors.

AB  - Directional changes in environmental conditions during individual stages of the succession of lakes should determine the character of the aquatic beetle fauna inhabiting them. Can changes in environmental conditions lead to degradation of fauna and to a deterioration of the ecological quality of lakes? We analysed this problem in 40 lakes. The fauna of the lakes proved to be rich and diverse in terms of species. Deterioration of species richness along successional stages was not observed, but distinct changes were noted in faunal composition. The eurytopic component proved stable, whereas changes in specialised components (i.e. lake and river species and tyrphophiles) were of key importance. The formation of beetle communities in the lakes was influenced to a greater extent by environmental factors, namely substrate, macrophyte structure and Sphagnum mat cover, than by the physical parameters of the water (pH, saturation or conductivity). The lakes proved to be of considerable ecological value. Regardless of the stage of succession, they are a habitat for numerous species, including rare and endangered ones. Hence, on the one hand humic lakes play an important role in local biodiversity, whereas on the other hand they may be perceived as refuges for species in environments that could be restored as a result of beneficial measures.

AB  - Sparsely vegetated habitats of cliffs and screes act as refugia for many regional and local endemic specialized plant taxa most of which have evolved precisely for that type of habitat. The interplay between taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional plant diversity on rock and scree habitats of extreme environmental conditions, enlightens the relations of plant communities and ecosystems and facilitates management planning for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The identification of biodiversity patterns and hotspots (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional) contributes to the integration of the ecosystem services (ES) approach for the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services (MAES) implementation in Greece and the creation of thematic maps based on the MAES reporting format. The overlap among the protected areas' network revealed that almost all areas of cliffs and screes of medium, high, and very high taxonomic and phylogenetic plant endemism are included in the Natura 2000 area network. The results of this study provide the baseline information for ES assessments at sparsely vegetated land of cliffs and screes. Our results contribute to the implementation of certain indicators of the national set of MAES indicators in Greece such as (a) floristic diversity and (b) microrefugia of endemic diversity and support of decision-making.

AB  - To appropriately support green development practices, there is an urgent need to improve Ecosystem Services Valuation (ESV) accounting approaches. This paper establishes a non-monetary accounting framework for ESV, which classifies the ES into direct services (directly related to the stock and flow), indirect services (through the functioning of ecosystem processes that produce the direct services) and existence services (cultural services and global benefit). New framework tries to (1) construct system emergy flow diagram and merging calculation method to avoid double counting; (2) propose new methods for biodiversity and climate regulation; and (3) bridge the non-monetary and economic values. Taking the forest ecosystem in Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration as a case, this study made a detailed calculations of 9 ecosystem services and compared the Em(sic) with economic values based on Emergy Money Ratio. The results show that emergy can be used to record environmental debt and establish a balance sheet to state the economic conditions and the environmental contribution to economic development. However, emergy is not an alternative method to the economic assessment, but a complementary and systemic approach to highlight the donor-side value of ES. The new framework is needed to realize the return of wealth including all "stakeholders" of nature.

AB  - Concentrations of selected trace elements in surface water and fluvial sediment were investigated as possible factors limiting the distribution and abundance of freshwater mussels in the Spring River Basin, a 6600 km(2) watershed overlapping a former Ph and Zn mining and ore processing district in the central USA. Mussel taxa richness surveys and supporting physical habitat assessments were performed in 23 stream reaches dispersed throughout the basin and above and below former mining sites. Quantitative mussel density surveys were performed in the Spring River at one upstream reference location and one downstream location. Concentrations of 16 trace elements in the soft tissues of mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were determined at most survey sites. Comparable analyses were performed on surface water samples collected during base flow and peak flow synoptic surveys and sediment samples collected during base flow periods. Sites on the Spring River immediately upstream of heavily mined areas supported at least 21-25 species of mussels, whereas sites near the lower terminus of the river yielded evidence of 6-8 extant species. Between the upper and lower quantitative survey sites, mean mussel and clam densities declined by 89% and 97%, respectively. Tributary reaches below heavily mined areas lacked evident bivalve communities and contained concentrations of Cd, Ph, and Zn that continually or sporadically exceeded hardness-dependent water quality criteria and consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (probable effect concentrations). In less contaminated stream reaches supporting bivalves, concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in mussels and clams were correlated spatially with the levels occurring in surficial sediment (0.50 <= tau <= 0.64, p <= 0.03). In non-headwater perennial stream reaches, sediment Cd, Pb, and Zn levels were related inversely to mussel taxa richness (-0.80 <= tau <= -0.64, p <= 0.004). Metal contaminant burdens in mussels and clams fluctuated measurably in association with variable stream flow conditions and accompanying changes in surface water and sediment chemistry. Concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in mussels approximately paralleled the levels measured in composite clam samples (0.74 <= tau <= 0.79, p < 0.001), implying C fluminea could serve as a possible surrogate for native mussels in future metal bioaccumulation studies. Overall, streams draining heavily mined areas exhibited depauperate (or fully extirpated) mussel assemblages and correspondingly elevated concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in water, sediment, and bivalve tissue. Other evaluated environmental chemistry parameters, and physical habitat conditions assessed at the stream reach scale, demonstrated little general relationship to the degraded status of these assemblages. We conclude that pollution attributable to former mining operations continues to adversely influence environmental quality and impede the recovery of mussel communities in a large portion of the Spring River Basin.

AB  - Genetic diversity as a basic indicator of biological diversity is extremely important for the characterization of species, for the development of conservation strategies and as an independent measure of environmental conditions. Despite the importance of Batrachium species as an indicator of the sustainability of riverine ecosystems, studies on the genetic variation of Batrachium populations are rather scarce. Therefore, it is crucial to study Batrachium species diversity and population structures to understand the status of Batrachium species and populations and provide measures for evaluating the future risk of diversity loss. Sixteen Batrachium populations were analyzed using morphological characters and molecular markers (inter simple sequence repeats [ISSRs] and tmH-psbA sequences). The study revealed agreement between these types of data in distinguishing separate groups of species found in Lithuanian rivers. Our study revealed a clonal structure and a low level of genetic diversity in most of the studied Batrachium populations. The low degree of genetic diversity, high level of genetic differentiation and low level of gene flow between populations of riverine Batrachium species in Lithuania indicated that a conservation strategy should be adopted. Long-term observations should be carried out, and the condition of Batrachium species and the impact of anthropogenic activities should be evaluated. Finally, we recommend that certain anthropogenic activities should be regulated by legislation in particular river stretches.

AB  - We assessed the probability of three major natural hazards-windthrow, drought, and forest fire-for Central and South-Eastern European forests which are major threats for the provision of forest goods and ecosystem services. In addition, we analyzed spatial distribution and implications for a future oriented management of forested landscapes. For estimating the probability of windthrow, we used rooting depth and average wind speed. Probabilities of drought and fire were calculated from climatic and total water balance during growing season. As an approximation to climate change scenarios, we used a simplified approach with a general increase of pET by 20%. Monitoring data from the pan-European forests crown condition program and observed burnt areas and hot spots from the European Forest Fire Information System were used to test the plausibility of probability maps. Regions with high probabilities of natural hazard are identified and management strategies to minimize probability of natural hazards are discussed. We suggest future research should focus on (i) estimating probabilities using process based models (including sensitivity analysis), (ii) defining probability in terms of economic loss, (iii) including biotic hazards, (iv) using more detailed data sets on natural hazards, forest inventories and climate change scenarios, and (v) developing a framework of adaptive risk management.

AB  - The concept of grazing in general and goat grazing in particular, as the cause of the deterioration of ecosystems in all conditions, has profound roots in society and in the scientific community, mainly ecologists and environmentalists. Many authors have considered goats as destructive animals by nature, and grazing by these animals is considered one of the main reasons for desertification, habitat degradation or loss, extinction and deterioration of native vegetation, sometimes leading to legislative procedures for control and eradication of goat grazing.
   These aspects are of special interest in arid, semiarid or climatic non-equilibrated areas, where ecosystems are more sensitive to biotic and abiotic disturbances, and where stability and sustainability of vegetation resources is a complex equation.
   In this paper different methodologies and impact indicators are analysed to improve the management of goat grazed areas, by discussing different points of view which go from analytical procedures to new indicators and methodologies integrated into a dynamic monitoring scheme in accordance with the complexity of the ecosystems. These methodologies can be able to incorporate trend and condition measurements in the ecosystems, and also be able to detect grazing effects, as well as longer-term trends.
   The importance of local knowledge is also taken into consideration as a key element to achieve the sustainability of goat grazing systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP 2014-2020) on soil management points to the combination of sustainable food production with environmental protection, reduction of CO(2)emissions, and safeguarding of soil biodiversity. In this study, three farms (in the Emilia-Romagna region), managed with both conventional and conservation practices (the last ones with and without sub-irrigation systems), were monitored from 2014 to 2017 to highlight the impact of different crops and soil managements on soil arthropods, in terms of abundance, composition, and soil biological quality (applying QBS-ar index). To do this, linear mixed models were performed, whereas arthropods assemblages were studied through PERMANOVA and SIMPER analysis. Soil communities varied among farms, although most differences were found among crops depending on management practices. Nonetheless, conservation systems and a wider reduction in anthropogenic practices provided better conditions for soil fauna, enhancing QBS-ar. Moreover, arthropod groups responded to soil practices differently, highlighting their sensitivity to agricultural management. Community assemblages in corn and wheat differed between managements, mainly due to Acari and Collembola, respectively. In conservation management, wheat showed the overall greatest abundance of arthropods, owing to the great number of Acari, Collembola, and Hymenoptera, while the number of arthropod groups were generally higher in crop residues of forage.

AB  - Diatom species are good pollution bioindicators due to their large distribution, fast response to changes in environmental parameters and different tolerance ranges. These organisms are used in ecological water assessment all over the world using autoecological indices. Such assessments commonly rely on the taxonomic identification of diatom species-specific shape and frustule ornaments, from which cell counts, species richness and diversity indices can be estimated. Taxonomic identification is, however, time-consuming and requires years of expertise. Additionally, though the diatom autoecological indices are region-specific, they are often applied indiscriminately across regions. Raman spectroscopy is a simpler, fast and label-free technique that can be applied to environmental diagnosis with diatoms. However, this approach has been poorly explored. This work reviews Raman spectroscopy studies involving the structure, location and conformation of diatom cell components and their variation under different conditions. A critical appreciation of the pros and cons of its application to environmental diagnosis is also given. This knowledge provides a strong foundation for the development of environmental protocols using Raman spectroscopy in diatoms. Our work aims at stimulating further research on the application of Raman spectroscopy as a tool to assess physiological changes and water quality under a changing climate. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assessment of ecosystem services through spatial modelling plays a key role in ecosystem accounting. Spatial models for ecosystem services try to capture spatial heterogeneity with high accuracy. This endeavour, however, faces several practical constraints. In this article we analyse the trade-offs between accurately representing spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services and the practical constraints of modelling ecosystem services. By doing so we aim to explore the boundary conditions for best practice of spatial ecosystem accounting. We distinguished seven types of spatial ES modelling methods, including four types of look-up tables, causal relationships, spatial interpolation, and environmental regression. We classified 29 spatial ES models according to a judgement of accuracy and modelling feasibility. Best practice of spatial ES models varies depending on the reliability requirements of different policy applications and decision contexts. We propose that in best practice for ecosystem accounting an approach should be adopted that provides sufficient accuracy at acceptable costs given heterogeneity of the respective service. Furthermore, we suggest that different policy applications require different accuracy and different spatial modelling approaches. Societal investment in higher data availability of ecosystem services make models of a specific accuracy more feasible or would enable achievement of higher accuracy with comparable feasibility.

AB  - Sampling of the demersal ichthyofauna of Guanabara Bay was conducted bimonthly for 2 years at 10 stations distributed along a hydrobiological gradient. A total of 16,081 Tetraodontiformes specimens were collected, representing 10 species distributed among Ostraciidae, Monacanthidae, Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae. Tetraodontiformes appear to be well adapted to hydrological variations and inhospitable conditions prompted by intense eutrophication. However, abiotic factors traditionally considered important in estuarine community structure play a secondary role in the distribution of Tetraodontiformes. The type of sediment appears to be the most important physical factor but acts only as an indicator of ecological domain. The low explanatory power of physicochemical variables, in addition to the relative stability of the bay's ichthyofauna, suggests an influence of biological parameters. The species exhibited wide variation in their use of Guanabara Bay and utilized it as a resting, feeding and growing area. Among the species captured, Stephanolepis hispidus, Lagocephalus laevigatus, Sphoeroides greeleyi, Sphoeroides testudineus, Sphoeroides tyleri, Chilomycterus reticulatus and Chilomycterus spinosus were categorized as marine estuarine opportunists, and Aluterus heudelotii and Aluterus schoepfii were classified as marine stragglers. Acanthostracion sp. could not be categorized. The boom of C. spinosus indicates an ecological misbalance and must be carefully investigated.

AB  - Long-term mining and subsequent processing activities predominantly focused on copper and mercury became the main source of soil pollution in the Middle Spis area. The natural environment of former mining areas is significantly disrupted by toxic elements, which enter the soil and water ecosystem. Total content of toxic elements (Cu, As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Hg), biological (activity of urease (TYRE), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and catalase (CAT) and chemical (soil reaction (pH), organic carbon (C-ox), available content of nutrients (P, K, Mg) soil properties were determined. The research was carried out at the heaps and grasslands in the cadastres of three villages (Krompachy, Rudnany, Slovinky). Extremely high and about the limit value of Cu, As and Hg were determined at all sampling sites. Activity of soil enzymes observed in our study proved, their ability to reflect soil degradation caused by heavy metal pollution. Activity of URE, ACP, ALP decreased with increasing of heavy metal content in soils. Significantly acidic environment on the heaps of waste material was found, compared to the grasslands. Heaps showed lower values of organic carbon and nutrients, but no direct influence of soil pollution to the organic carbon, soil pH and nutrients was found.

AB  - Temporary Mediterranean wetlands are characterized by both intra and interannual variations in their environmental conditions. These inherent fluctuations in limnological features affect the seasonal variation in the structure and dynamics of the aquatic communities. In this study, we hypothesized that zooplankton community is coupled to seasonal changes of the environmental variables along the hydroperiod. To get this purpose, the study was focused in monitoring, by collecting monthly samples during an annual period, seven temporary Mediterranean ponds located in the south-eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula (Alto Guadalquivir region, Andalusia). The relationships between zooplankton community and the different limnological variables were analyzed based on two approaches: a Spearman correlation analysis and a correspondence canonical analysis (CCA). The results have shown that chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi depth, total nitrogen concentration, wetland area and depth were the variables with a greater influence on the zooplankton community, explaining the zooplankton species replacement. Moreover, optima and tolerance of the zooplankton species were obtained from the position of species within CCA diagram, allowing the separation of different groups of zooplankton along the hydroperiod. We finally highlight that the monitoring of zooplankton community and environmental conditions are necessary to evaluate how theses singular and endangered aquatic ecosystems will be affected by anthropogenic activities in the future.

TI  - Enabling conditions for an equitable and sustainable blue economy
T2  - NATURE
LA  - English
AB  - The future of the global ocean economy is currently envisioned as advancing towards a 'blue economy'-socially equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically viable ocean industries(1,2). However, tensions exist within sustainable development approaches, arising from differing perspectives framed around natural capital or social equity. Here we show that there are stark differences in outlook on the capacity for establishing a blue economy, and on its potential outcomes, when social conditions and governance capacity-not just resource availability-are considered, and we highlight limits to establishing multiple overlapping industries. This is reflected by an analysis using a fuzzy logic model to integrate indicators from multiple disciplines and to evaluate their current capacity to contribute to establishing equitable, sustainable and viable ocean sectors consistent with a blue economy approach. We find that the key differences in the capacity of regions to achieve a blue economy are not due to available natural resources, but include factors such as national stability, corruption and infrastructure, which can be improved through targeted investments and cross-scale cooperation. Knowledge gaps can be addressed by integrating historical natural and social science information on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management, thus identifying equitable pathways to establishing or transforming ocean sectors(1,3,4). Our results suggest that policymakers must engage researchers and stakeholders to promote evidence-based, collaborative planning that ensures that sectors are chosen carefully, that local benefits are prioritized, and that the blue economy delivers on its social, environmental and economic goals.

AB  - The evolution of species or ecotypes can occur gradually through neutral and adaptive genetic changes. To explore the influence of natural selection during early phases of divergence, morphological and ecological discontinuity and its adaptive significance were investigated in six pairs of alpine and independently evolved montane populations of Heliosperma pusillum s.l.; the latter are usually taxonomically recognised at the species rank in spite of their highly debatable taxonomic value. We tested whether environmental conditions - characterised by Landolt indicator values from vegetation surveys and temperature measurements - and morphology of alpine and montane populations differ discretely and in parallel across six population pairs. By reciprocal transplantation experiments in natural environments in two population pairs and in climate chambers for five population pairs we compared fitness of native versus non-native individuals. Alpine and montane populations differed in environmental conditions and morphology within each pair. Morphological differentiation occurred in parallel and correlated with environmental, but not with genetic distances. In both environments, native individuals had higher establishment success and plant size. Differentiation of the independently evolved montane populations is driven by natural selection and parallel, independent adaptation in response to drought, lower irradiance and higher, less fluctuating temperatures in montane populations. Our study system exemplifies rapid, parallel evolution leading to morphologically and ecologically strongly divergent, though fully interfertile, ecotypes.

AB  - Environmental flows are an important consideration in licensing hydropower projects as operational flow releases can result in adverse conditions for downstream ecological communities. Flow variability assessments have typically focused on pre- and post-dam conditions using metrics based on daily averaged flow values. This study used subdaily and daily flow data to assess environmental flow response to changes in hydropower operations from daily peaking to run-of-river. An analysis tool was developed to quantify flow variability metrics and was applied to four hydropower projects. Significant differences were observed between operations at the 99% confidence level in the median flow values using hourly averaged flow datasets. Median daily rise and fall rates decreased on average 34.5 and 27.9%, respectively, whereas median hourly rise and fall rates decreased on average 50.1 and 50.6%, respectively. Differences in operational flow regimes were more pronounced in the hourly averaged flow datasets and less pronounced or nonexistent in the daily averaged flow datasets. These outcomes have implications for the development of ecology-flow relationships that quantify effects of flow on processes such as fish stranding and displacement, along with habitat stability. Results indicate that flow variability statistics should be quantified using subdaily datasets to accurately represent the nature of hydropower operations, especially for daily peaking facilities.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of biophysical conditions and hatchery production on the early marine survival of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Due to a paucity of balanced multivariate ecosystem data, we developed a probabilistic network that integrated physical and ecological data and information from literature, expert opinion, oceanographic models, and in situ observations. This approach allowed us to evaluate alternate hypotheses about drivers of early marine survival while accounting for uncertainties in relationships among variables. Probabilistic networks allow users to explore multiple environmental settings and evaluate the consequences of management decisions under current and projected future states. We found that the zooplankton biomass anomaly, calanoid copepod biomass, and herring biomass were the best indicators of early marine survival. It also appears that concentrating hatchery supplementation during periods of negative PDO and ENSO (Pacific Decadal and El Nino Southern Oscillation respectively), indicative of generally favorable ocean conditions for salmon, tends to increase survival of hatchery coho salmon while minimizing negative impacts on the survival of wild juveniles. Scientists and managers can benefit from the approach presented here by exploring multiple scenarios, providing a basis for open and repeatable ecosystem-based risk assessments when data are limited.

AB  - Some plant species are frequently found together under edaphic-climatic conditions, so similarity of presence and association becomes an indicator of ecosystem conditions. The idea of evaluation of the quality of rangelands by breeders in the steppe zone is quite different from those applied by academic methods, so the mentions "good, average, and poor" find a particular meaning for breeders, especially farmers, nomads, and transhumant. Surveys conducted on the sustainability of livestock systems in the steppe zone of Naama have led to the importance of the Pole resources, especially pasture management. A high biomass does not necessarily mean a good pasture course, especially when toxic plants present, which hinder the exploitation of the rangeland. The knowledge of the plants, their stages of evolution, and their distribution, are indices of orientation for the use of the course and the duration of exploitation, of course among the connoisseur breeders. So, a new approach of course evaluation becomes a necessity to give an explanation to the reasoning of the direct operator who is the breeder. With this in mind, we proposed the phytosociometry method, based on the link between BioMarker and other annexations, a new method to determine the nature of phyto-association at the spatial scale in an arid environment, which can correct the vision of evaluation and estimation of the forage potential of a steppe rangeland.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of private investment and protection activities in Natura 2000 areas. In order to determine to what extent private owners are involved in conservation activities and whether the restrictions resulting from protective measures significantly affect the level of investment activity, a survey based on a questionnaire was carried out on a group of farmers with farms within which three areas of the European ecological network are located. It was found, inter alia, that owners rarely undertook investment projects on their farms in recent years, and those that were implemented very often were not subject to environmental impact assessment. The study also shows that the surveyed farmers on a smaller scale engaged in activities directly aimed at the protection of valuable ecosystems, despite the fact that they are obliged to do so by provisions in the plans of protective tasks. Some of the respondents would be willing to consider developing an additional, environmentally friendly service activity, but on condition that they receive appropriate support, especially in the form of tax preferences and training. The general conclusion that emerges from the study is that the functioning of new forms of nature protection does not have to stimulate more pro-ecological attitudes, and perhaps, in the absence of adequate environmental awareness, negatively affect economic and investment activity.

AB  - The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) restores converted or degraded wetlands on private working lands; however, the nature and outcomes of such efforts are undocumented in the Southeastern U.S. Identification of wetland types is needed to assess the program's conservation benefits, because ecological functions differ with hydrogeomorphic (HGM) type. We reviewed > 100 WRP projects across the Southeast Piedmont-Coastal Plain to characterize their wetland types and to evaluate whether restoration practices favored original or modified functions. The projects encompassed four HGM types and diverse pre-restoration conditions. Nearly half were converted wetlands retired from active agriculture; the remainder were either drained vegetated wetlands or forested bottomlands degraded by timber harvest. Hydrology-repair practices varied by wetland type and prior condition, with differing functional implications. Depressions and flats typically were restored, whereas low-order riparian sites and prior-agriculture floodplains were often modified to enhance water retention. Timber-harvested floodplains were restored by removing barriers to water flow and biotic connectivity. Vegetation restoration was generally passive, but tree planting was frequent on prior-agriculture sites. Field surveys suggested that most projects had positive indicators of wetland hydrology, vegetation, and faunal use. The variety of Southeastern WRP wetlands has implications for ecosystem services at local and landscape scales.

AB  - The Kani Barazan and Yadegarlou wetlands in the southern part of Lake Urmia (Iran) have been substantially modified due to human activities and anthropogenic use. In recent years, freshwater-based eco-biological studies to recognize the quality of water resources have been greatly expanded. Microalgae and Cyanophyta are considered important bioindicators for the evaluation of water quality and wetland health worldwide. Herein, 22 microalgae and 5 Cyanophyta genera were identified in both wetlands, in which Cyanophyta has mainly caused blooms. Principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out based on links between the distribution of microalgae and Cyanophyta with physical and chemical parameters. The data showed that depth, turbidity, and the temperature had a significant influence on the microalga and Cyanophyta communities in both wetlands. Based on the biological properties, it seems that the Kani Barazan and Yadegarlou international wetlands experience meso-eutrophic conditions. The integration of the physical, chemical and biological parameters with the water quality index (WQI) revealed that both wetlands were polluted as a consequence of human activities. Moreover, a close relationship between WQI and the biological parameters was documented. Thus, we concluded that microalgae and Cyanophyta communities, their abundance patterns, and water quality changes could provide valuable data for the conservation of the Kani Barazan and Yadegarlou international wetlands.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if an interdisciplinary team using a qualitative proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment protocol could identify and reverse significant detrimental ecological alterations which occurred within Gertie's Creek watershed, Ontario, Canada. At potential, Gertie's Creek supported a woody debris glacial outwash fine gravel substrate fish spawning habitat. The anthropogenic activities on Georgina Island caused a denuded anadromous fish population since the early-to mid-1990's in the Gertie's Creek watershed. The PFC assessment indicated that anthropogenic activities on Georgina Island negatively impacted stream flows in Gertie's Creek. Reduced stream flow resulted in the natural stream (lotic) riparian habitat not advancing out of an early seral silver maple and eastern hemlock vegetated swamp (forested wetland) habitat. The Gertie's Creek interdisciplinary team PFC assessment indicated that the entire watershed is not in balance with the water and sediment being supplied along with a lack of diverse riparian vegetation. Sediment was not being transported to the wetland and lake coastal areas because of chronic reduced flows. Further qualitative assessments by the authors of other smaller lentic and lotic ecosystems on Georgina Island indicate that reduced hydrologic flow is an issue for the entire island. Ecosystem function management planning works with the ecosystem to continually respond as the ecology changes in ways that enhance remarkable natural recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An increasing interest and sensitivity of consumers and public opinion toward high-quality food products obtained with environmentally-friendly production methods has recently been detected. To this end, one of the key roles could be played by an environmental evaluation of the crop production. This research was performed to test a new multi-attribute decision model (DEXi-met) that is able to estimate the environmental sustainability of different agronomic practices in horticultural rotations. The model was used at the cropping system level on the basis of data from a long-term experiment in organic horticulture. It was tested on different cropping managements under climate change conditions. The DEXi-met mixed model (qualitative and qualitative basic attributes) generated four aggregated attributes to assess sustainability indicators (production capacity, soil, water and resources preservation, and biodiversity conservation) and the overall environmental sustainability. The model validation indicated that the introduction of agro-ecological services crops can increase the environmental sustainability of an organic cropping systems by promoting the whole soil-plant system equilibrium. The application of this tool could help maximize the efficient use of agronomical practices and quantify their environmental sustainability. DEXi-met could help agricultural advisors and policymakers schedule their decisions to find the right compromise between crop yield increase and the impact of agricultural activities.

AB  - Land degradation is caused by and has impacts on both the social and natural components of coupled human-environment systems. However, few studies integrate both aspects simultaneously. The main objective of this study is to test a method to evaluate land degradation based on the integration of aggregate metrics of biophysical and socio-economic "degradation". We applied a framework that integrates the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of land degradation to test the hypothesis that macro-economic policies, and in particular agricultural subsidies, are an important driving force of land degradation in marginal regions of the Mediterranean Europe. We analysed the influence of subsidies on the profitability of each crop and livestock type found in a sample of farms in a region of northern Greece. Spatial and socioeconomic data on agricultural households were collected to link remote sensing data and land degradation maps to socio-economic conditions of these households, as measured by the standard gross margin. The results demonstrate that subsidies provide a crucial socio-economic support to maintain the profitability of agricultural activities but may also promote land-use practices with damaging ecological impacts. Different levels of biophysical and socio-economic "degradation" were associated with different land use practices. The integration of the socio-economic and biophysical dimensions of land degradation reveals associations that would not be detectable if indicators along one dimension alone would be used.

AB  - The floc size distribution (FSD) is crucial to predict cohesive sediment dynamics in aquatic environments. Recently, increasing attention has been given to biofilm effects on the FSDs of suspended particles since the presence of biofilms on particle surfaces may lead to larger flocs and thus higher settling velocities. In this study, results from a settling column experiment conducted by Tang and Maggi (2018; ) under nutrient-free and biomass-free, nutrient-affected and biomass-free, and nutrient-affected and biomass-affected conditions, with different suspended sediment concentrations, shear rates, and nutrient concentrations, have been used to validate modeled FSDs that is based on the population balance equation solved by the quadrature method of moments. In addition to the processes of aggregation and breakage, the effects of biofilm are expressed in the growth term of the population balance equation. The logistic growth pattern is used to account for an increase in biomass, which is primarily controlled by the specific growth rate and the carrying capacity. In this study, the biofilm growth rate is assumed nutrient dependent, and the carrying capacity of floc size is hypothesized to be proportional to the Kolmogorov microscale. With eight size classes to interpret a simulated FSD, the predicted and observed FSDs exhibit a reasonable match for all nutrient-free and biomass-free, nutrient-affected and biomass-free, and nutrient-affected and biomass-affected conditions. This simplified bioflocculation model fills the gap between the simulations of the FSDs of cohesive sediments without and with biofilms and has the potential to be included in large-scale models in the future.
   Plain Language Summary In estuaries or adjacent coastal regions, the transport of suspended sediment is responsible for many environmental and engineering issues, for example, siltation and dredging in navigation channels and harbors, water quality, water clarity, pollutants transport, and ecosystem responses. Suspended sediment particles can flocculate and thus can form aggregates with size, shape, density, and settling velocity largely different from the building particles. A challenge to predict the particle behaviors originates from a lack of flocculation models that are able to address the variations in floc size distributions. The aim of this study is to develop a flocculation model that includes besides the classical aggregation and breakage driven by turbulence also a biological process, which is biofilm growth. The biofilm growth and its impact on flocculation and thus floc size are simulated in a similar way as the growth of microbes but with different growth rates. The model is validated with laboratory experiments that have shown that the sizes of flocs made solely with sediment particles largely increase when incubated microbes are present. This model provides a sound basis to simulate the behavior of natural particles (minerals, organic, and biological particles) and particles from human origin (plastics) in future environmental risk assessment studies.

AB  - In a coral reef environment, a slight increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; greater than or equal to 1.0 muM) can alter the ecosystem via macroalgal blooms. We collected seagrass leaves from the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean in five countries and examined the interactions between nutrient concentrations (C, N, P), molar ratios of nutrients, and delta(15)N to find a possible indicator of the DIN conditions. Within most sites, the concentrations of nutrients and their molar ratios showed large variations owing to species-specific values. On the other hand, almost identical delta(15)N values were found in seagrass leaves of several species at each site. The correlations between delta(15)N and nutrient concentrations and between delta(15)N and molar ratios of nutrients suggested that nutrient availability did not affect the delta(15)N value of seagrass leaves by altering the physiological condition of the plants. Increases in delta(15)N of seagrass leaves mostly matched increases in DIN concentrations in the bottom water. We suggest that delta(15)N in seagrass leaves can be a good tool to monitor time-integrated decrease/increase of DIN concentrations at a site, both in the water column and the interstitial water.

AB  - Given the challenges posed to agriculture by future climatic changes, and the need to reduce environmental impacts, a key challenge is to develop resilient food production systems. Ecological intensification is an approach proposed to partially replace external inputs with the provision of biodiversity-derived ecosystems services to either maintain or increase food production. One promising practice is crop diversification, which has the potential to improve the provision of multiple ecosystem services underpinning agricultural production, and to confer resilience to abiotic stresses. This study measured a variety of ecosystem services (yield quantity and quality, soil services, pest regulation), and resistance indicators (canopy temperature and senescence rates) under stressed and controled conditions, at three levels of crop rotational diversity in the third year of the rotations. We found that increased crop diversity can maintain yields with reduced external inputs, under varying climatic conditions, with yield increases of 1 t/ha on average, and that diversifying crop rotations can improve stress resistance resulting in more resilient systems. Higher crop diversity resulted in no trade-offs between our measured ecosystem services and increased synergistic effects between stress resistance and crop production and stress resistance and pest regulation. However, farmers will need to use a combination of management approaches, alongside diversifying crop rotations, to maximise the potential of ecological intensification.

AB  - Hay meadows are an important component of the alpine landscape, which evolved over millennia of human activities. When traditionally managed, hay meadows support a rich flora and are recognized for high species diversity. However, both intensification and abandonment can lead to a loss of biodiversity in this vegetation. In this paper, the focus was on the hay meadows where Narcissus radiiflorus Salisb. forms white mosaic carpets during the blooming period. This vegetation was studied through 26 phytosociological releves, taken in the Venetian Pre-Alps and outer Dolomites (Northern Italy). Releves were numerically classified and analysed in their relationships with site conditions. Moreover, diversity metrics were calculated for detecting the conservation status of hay meadows subjected to different types of disturbance. The results showed that poet's daffodils' dominance brings together hay meadows showing a substantial range of floristic and ecologic variation and that part of the stands dominated by Narcissus radiiflorus could be referred to a habitat type regarded as prioritary for nature conservation. Moreover, management-related variations in functional diversity suggested that the best practice recommended for conservation and restoration of this habitat is the continuation of traditional late mowing. This practice will allow preserving both biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services.

AB  - Sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of "natural" disinfection in waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs). We examined the influence of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and particulate and dissolved constituents in WSP effluent, on sunlight inactivation of faecal micro-organisms, using small reactors operated under controlled physico-chemical conditions. Inactivation of both enterococci and F-DNA phages increased strongly as DO was increased, and also depended on light-absorbing pondwater constituents, but pH was not influential over the range investigated (7.5 to 10). Inactivation of E. coli increased strongly when pH increased above 8.5, as well as being strongly dependent on DO. Inactivation of F-DNA phage was independent of the factors investigated. These results are consistent with the F-DNA phages being inactivated as a result of direct DNA damage by UVB in sunlight, whereas the other three microbiological indicators are inactivated as a result of photo-oxidative damage, although the target of damage is apparently different. Our findings of diverse influences of physico-chemical conditions suggest difficulties in interpreting data for a single micro-organism to indicate WSP effluent quality. However, sunlight remains the factor of over-riding importance, and disinfection in WSPs may be enhanced by increasing sunlight exposure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to fulfil the millennium development goals and to ensure environmental sustainability in Ethiopia, ecological indicator systems can support river managers to analyse the status of watercourses and to select critical restoration actions In order to use macroinvertebrates as river water quality monitoring and assessment tools, Ethiopia needs data from reference as well as disturbed conditions of surface water ecosystems Macroinvertebrates, structural and physical-chemical data were in this context collected in the Gilgel Gibe river basin in South-Western Ethiopia during the period 2005-2008 In the next stage, ecological metrics were compared for their assessment relevance In the present paper, classification trees and support vector machines were used to induce models describing the relation between the river characteristics and the ecological conditions of these streams Greedy stepwise and genetic search algorithms improved the performance and easy interpretation of these models by making a selection of the variables that were used as input of these models The developed models allowed to identify the major variables affecting river quality These tools can support river managers in their decision-making regarding the status of rivers and potential restoration options, for example by providing rules concerning critical values of major river characteristics at which certain actions should be undertaken (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - Natural-production conditions determine operational efficiency of logging machines. This influence needs to be taken into account at different levels of forest management. It is necessary to allocate areas with similar natural-production conditions for effective forest management. It allows simplifying the decision making process for selecting logging technology and machines. The purpose of this study was to establish areas with similar natural and production conditions in the European North of Russia (ENR). In addition, for small enterprises, we recommend logging technologies and logging machines that can be used in established areas. We determined the indicators of the natural-production conditions of ENR regions and compared them. Cluster analysis was used to compare the indicators. We found that ENR can be divided into three main zones A, B, C and two subzones B1 and B2 with similar natural-production conditions. In the zones A, B and the subzones B1 and B2, small logging enterprises should use a harvester and a forwarder. In the zone C, the enterprises can use a logging system including a harvester and a forwarder or a logging system including a feller buncher, a skidder and a processor. The logging system should be based on the light class of logging machines for the zone A, the medium class or the heavy class for the zones B, C and the subzones B1, B2, the heavy class of machines for the zone C.

AB  - Environmental pollution, for example with metals, can significantly affect the ecosystem balance leading to severe changes. Biologically active pigments are relevant for the appearance and condition of birds. Melanin and carotenoid particles are the most frequently deposited pigments in avian integument. They are responsible for the majority of colors of bird plumage. The phenotypic expression can be affected by metal contamination. It can be manifested as color bleaching or differences in the size of plumage badges. In this study, we performed a comprehensive review of related studies in order to estimate the underlying population effect of this potential dependency. The study is based on the review of the literature regarding several avian species. It was designed to identify an area where the effect of the exposure is still poorly known. The analysis was specifically conducted to investigate the correlation between trace element concentration and eumelanin deposition. Moreover, we searched for factors that could affect spectral properties of feathers with carotenoid-based pigmentation. As a result, we found carotenoid-based pigmentation to be of a good use in terms of visual condition assessment. Changes in melanin-based pattern should be analyzed separately for eu- and pheomelanin as well as for a range of essential and toxic elements. Comprehensive studies on the subject are still scarce. Therefore, the issue requires further investigation.

AB  - There is a critical need for tools and methodologies capable of managing aquatic systems within heavily impacted watersheds. Current efforts often fall short as a result of an inability to quantify and predict complex cumulative effects of current and future land use scenarios at relevant spatial scales. The goal of this manuscript is to provide methods for conducting a targeted watershed assessment that enables resource managers to produce landscape-based cumulative effects models for use within a scenario analysis management framework. Sites are first selected for inclusion within the watershed assessment by identifying sites that fall along independent gradients and combinations of known stressors. Field and laboratory techniques are then used to obtain data on the physical, chemical, and biological effects of multiple land use activities. Multiple linear regression analysis is then used to produce landscape-based cumulative effects models for predicting aquatic conditions. Lastly, methods for incorporating cumulative effects models within a scenario analysis framework for guiding management and regulatory decisions (e.g., permitting and mitigation) within actively developing watersheds are discussed and demonstrated for 2 sub-watersheds within the mountaintop mining region of central Appalachia. The watershed assessment and management approach provided herein enables resource managers to facilitate economic and development activity while protecting aquatic resources and producing opportunity for net ecological benefits through targeted remediation.

AB  - Summer legume cover crops (CC) such as Crotalaria juncea, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria ochroleuca, and Cajanus cajan could offer diverse advantages for the environment and productive cropping systems. A low transpiration efficiency (TE) of CC can induce soil water content to levels that present a challenge for the subsequent crop. In a 75-day growth chamber experiment, using the natural abundance of C-13, O-18, and N-15 we evaluated the TE and BNF under two soil water conditions. Our results showed that the four species tested are good candidates for their use as CC because they showed good results in terms of productivity parameters, TE, and BFN. Cajanus cajan had the highest TE, a high shoot dry matter production, and accumulated more N from BFN in the shoot than C. spectabilis, C. juncea, and C. ochroleuca. increment O-18 increased under moderate water deficit and showed an inversely proportional relationship with the amount of transpired water, supporting the use of this isotopic indicator as a proxy for transpiration and stomatal conductance. For the isotopic parameters no interaction between the factors water regimen and species were found. We propose the mass ratio of nitrogen fixed by the volume of transpired water and the isotopic discrimination of C-13 as useful indicators of drought fixing legumes tolerance.

AB  - Environmental assessment using living test organisms contribute to the timely detection of negative for human health pollutants. Hydra is a small freshwater organism that has been widely used in different types of bioassays to study the toxic potential of numerous chemical substances and is recently growing in popularity for assessing the impacts of water pollutants. Under normal conditions, adult hydra has a radially symmetric body of about 5 mm long with 6-8 straightened tentacles. Hydra is an appropriate bioindicator species because of their simple anatomy, clear morphological reactions in response to alterations in the aquatic environment, high reproduction rate and simplicity of laboratory-scale cultivation. Moreover, in the optimal cultivation environment, hydra reproduces by budding that enables in a short time obtaining a large number of genetically and morphologically identical animals for a bioassay. Here we propose a rapid bioassay for the assessment of the quality of aquatic environment including drinking water, water from natural environments sources and aqueous solutions of chemicals. This bioassay is based on the registration of survival and morphological reactions in hydra (Hydra attenuata), and allows us to determine the acute and chronic toxic effect of water pollutants. We also describe the optimal laboratory-scale cultivation conditions of hydra. Hydra attenuata bioassay of an aqueous medium can be recommended as a State Standard of Ukraine for assessing the quality of natural and drinking waters.

AB  - Anthropogenic perturbations impose negative effects on coastal ecosystems, such as increasing levels of eutrophication. Given the biogeochemical significance of microorganisms, understanding the processes and mechanisms underlying their spatial distribution under changing environmental conditions is critical. To address this question, we examined how coastal bacterioplanlcton communities respond to increasing eutrophication levels created by anthropogenic perturbations. The results showed that the magnitude of changes in the bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) and the importance of deterministic processes that constrained bacterial assembly were closely associated with eutrophication levels. Moreover, increasing eutrophication significantly (P < 0.001) attenuated the distance decay rate, with a random spatial distribution of BCCs in the undisturbed location. In contrast, the complexity of interspecies interaction was enhanced under moderate eutrophication levels but declined under heavy eutrophication. Changes in the relative abundances of 27 bacterial families were significantly correlated with eutrophication levels. Notably, the pattern of enrichment or decrease for a given bacterial family was consistent with its known ecological functions. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of changes in BCCs and underlying determinism are dependent on eutrophication levels. However, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton community is limited, with disrupted interspecies interaction occurring under heavy eutrophication. As such, bacterial assemblages are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and could thus potentially serve as bio-indicators for increasing eutrophication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrologic regime plays a major role in structuring biotic diversity within river ecosystems by controlling key habitat conditions within the river channel and floodplain. Daily flow records from seven hydrological stations and the range of variability approach were utilized to investigate the variability and spatial pattern of the hydrologic alterations induced by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Results show that the impoundment of the TGD disturbed the hydrologic regime downstream and directly affected the streamflow variations. The rate of changes and the annual extreme conditions were more affected by the TGD, particularly the low-flow relevant parameters. The alterations in the hydrologic regime were mainly caused by the TGD storing water during early autumn and releasing water during winter and spring. The effects on spatial patterns decreased as the distance from the dam increased, which was mainly attributed to the inflows from large tributaries along the Yangtze River as well as the interaction with the two largest natural lakes (i.e., Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake). These hydrologic alterations not only break the natural balance of eco-flow regimes but also result in undesirable ecological effects, particularly in terms of habitat availability for the fish community.

AB  - Chaetognaths are ubiquitous marine zooplankton strongly influenced by oceanographic conditions. Epi-pelagic plankton samples taken across the Leeuwin Current system, the poleward flowing eastern boundary current of the Indian Ocean, were examined for chaetognath diversity and distribution. Sampling occurred at shelf, shelf break, and oceanic environments at each degree of latitude from 22 to 34 degrees S. Nineteen species were identified, of which six are new records for the region with one an undescribed species. Low-moderate abundances (19.0 +/- 2.4 individuals m(-3)) were observed compared with other eastern boundary currents and can be attributed to the unique oligotrophic nature of the system. The anomalous oceanography of the Leeuwin Current resulted in two distinct zoogeographic regions with distributions of tropical and temperate species separated around 28 degrees S. Here, tropical waters transitioned to cooler, saltier waters and multivariate analyses identified temperature and salinity as the best indicators of community change. Community variation across the continental shelf was largely driven by one species, Flaccisagittaenflata, which was numerically dominant. Despite spatial variations, widely distributed species caused high overall community similarity. As the first system-wide investigation of Leeuwin Current Chaetognatha, this study provides benchmark biological information and highlights an unusual oceanography that produces a distinct planktonic zoogeography.

AB  - The Ria de Aveiro, a lagoon located in the NW coast of Portugal, presents a wide range of changes to the natural hydrodynamical and physicochemical conditions induced for instance by works of port engineering and pollution. In order to evaluate the response of living benthic foraminifera to the fluctuations in physicochemical parameters and pollution (metals and TOC), eight sediment samples were collected from canals and salt pans within the Aveiro City, in four different sampling events. During the sampling events, salinity showed the most significant fluctuations among the physicochemical parameters with the maximum range of variation at Troncalhada and Santiago salt pans. Species such as Haynesina germanica, Trochammina inflata and Entzia macrescens were found inhabiting these hypersaline environments with the widest fluctuations of physicochemical parameters. In contrast, Ammonia tepida dominated zones with high concentrations of metals and organic matter and in lower salinity waters. Parameters related to benthic foraminiferal assemblages (i.e., diversity and evenness) were found to significantly decline in stations polluted by metals and characterized by higher TOC content. Foraminiferal density reduced significantly in locations with a wide range of physicochemical temporal variability. This work shows that, even under extreme conditions caused by highly variable physicochemical parameters, benthic foraminiferal assemblages might be used as valuable bioindicators of environmental stress.

AB  - We aimed to quantify the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure and diversity in deciduous and mixed boreo-nemoral stands, conditioned on potential confounding factors. Based on these results, we created a statistically-supported indicator list of stand "naturalness". We surveyed 50 quantitative and qualitative characteristics of a stand, the understorey and forest floor, and several widely accepted biodiversity indicators in 171 forests in Estonia. Multi-factorial GLM and GLIM analyses showed that many forest structural characteristics were confounded by forest site-type specificity, stand age and/or biogeography. Near-natural old-growth forests had higher proportions of deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris, a higher frequency of logs in each decay class, a denser understorey, and were more homogeneous in the horizontal pattern of each layer than mature managed forests. By improving light conditions, forest management indirectly increased herb layer richness and coverage and the proportion of graminoids. The critical easy-to-apply set of indicators to assess forest ecosystem quality includes the amount and type of dead wood, the canopy closure of a stand and the presence of specially-shaped trees, specific epiphytic indicator lichens, mosses and wood-dwelling insects, and forest site-type specific herb layer species.

AB  - Identification of reference conditions for ecological assessments of coastal ecosystems poses a challenging problem in highly modified landscapes. A method is described for characterizing disturbance in coastal ecosystems using remotely sensed land classification and other publicly available GIS data. Within ecoregions bordering the US Great Lakes coast, aquatic habitats bordering the shoreline were classified into five ecological types: high-energy shoreline, embayments, open-coast, river-influenced and protected wetlands. Degree of anthropogenic disturbance in contributing areas to these ecosystems was assessed using a watershed approach for wetland types or a moving window approach for high-energy shorelines. Anthropogenic stress variables included proportions of agricultural or residential land use, information on population and road density, and distance from the nearest point source. Polygons (wetlands) or pixels (high-energy shoreline) were categorized as 'reference' if the magnitude of the most severe stressor, based on its cumulative frequency distribution within that ecoregion, placed it within the lowest 20th percentile. For shorelines, adjacent 'reference' pixels were agglomerated into polygons and a final ranking of polygons containing at least 2 km of shoreline was used to identify candidate reference areas. A subset of these sites is currently being sampled for fish, macroinvertebrates and physical habitat attributes. This a priori approach to reference area identification will allow managers to identify biological correlates of reference conditions, providing a benchmark for bioassessment and restoration efforts in coastal regions.

AB  - The activity of microorganisms in soil is important for a robust functioning of soil and related ecosystem services. Hence, there is a necessity to identify the composition, diversity, and function of the soil microbiome in order to determine its natural properties, functioning, and operating range as well as to assess eco-toxicological effects due to anthropogenic activities. Numerous microbiological methods currently exist in the literature and new, more advanced methods continue to be developed; however, only a limited number of these methods are standardised. Consequently, there is a need to identify the most promising non-standardised methods for assessing soil quality and to transform them into standards. In agreement with the "Ecosystem Service Approach", new methods should focus more on soil microbial functions, including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emission, pest control and plant growth promotion, carbon cycling and sequestration, as well as soil structure development and filter function. The few existing standardised methods available that focus on the function of the soil microbiome mostly include measurements, like basal respiration, enzyme activities, and biodegradation of organic matter, under well-defined conditions in the lab. This paper sets out to summarise and expand on recent discussions within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Soil Quality - Biological Characterization sub-committee (ISO TC 190/SC 4), where a need was identified to develop scientifically sound methods which would best fulfil the practical needs of future users for assessing soil quality, going beyond the existing test systems. Of particular note is the current evolution of molecular methods in microbial ecology that use quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to produce a large number of new functional endpoints which are more sensitive as compared to "classical" methods. Quantitative PCR assesses the abundance of microbes that catalyse major transformation steps in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, chemical transformations including pesticide degradation, and plant growth promotion pathways based on the assessment of marker gene sequences that drive the related processes. In the assessment of soil quality methods, it was found that most methods focus on bacteria and related endpoints. Techniques to describe fungal communities as well as their functional traits are far less represented. As such, techniques to analyse fungal enzyme activities are proposed. Additionally, methods for the determination of microbial growth rates and efficiencies, including the use of glomalin as a biochemical marker for soil aggregation, are discussed. Furthermore, field methods indicative of carbon turnover, including the litter bag test and a modification to the tea bag test, are presented. However, it is obvious that with increasing developments in high throughput sequencing technologies and big data analyses, including metagenomics analysis, it will be possible to implement these technologies into the standardisation process for assessing the functions of the soil microbiome. Overall, it is suggested that endpoints should represent a potential function of soil microorganisms rather than actual activity levels, as the latter can largely be dependent on short-term variable soil properties such as pedoclimatic conditions, nutrient availability, and anthropogenic soil cultivation activities.

AB  - The soil is three-dimensional and dynamic, formed by solid, liquid and gaseous parts of mineral and organic origin, that are linked to various ecosystem processes. Sand mining causes numerous impacts on the soil, whose recovery requires management with monitoring of the soil quality indicators. In the present work, the mechanical attributes of soil and particle density, macro, micro and total porosity of 3 areas with different management in Fazenda do Pogo were surveyed to establish the efficiency of the recovery process with evaluation by statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student's T-test (p <0.05), Pearson correlation and approximate evaluation of bands from the samples by Fourier Transform mid-infrared spectroscopy with multivariate analysis processing. The forest fragment (A4) presented the best physical indicators, the area A1 presented better conditions than A2, similar to A4. Adverse conditions precluded A3 soil analysis. Macroporosity and soil density were the best degradation indicators. It was possible to nearly assign the major bands in the FTIR. Multivariate analysis demonstrates the soil homogeneity of the area. To reduce the impact of compaction, it is necessary to complement the presence of organic matter, facilitating the action of the soil biota by direct seeding of tree species with aggressive roots to mitigate soil compaction mainly in A2.

AB  - Information on the response of temporary depressional wetland diatoms to human-induced disturbances is a limited and important component for the development of temporary wetland biological assessments in human-modified landscapes. Establishing a reference condition of variation due to natural disturbances in depressional wetlands using diatoms is necessary for further investigations of anthropogenic impacts. We examined the temporal and spatial responses of epiphytic diatom communities to natural environmental disturbances within three least disturbed wetlands in the Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Alkalinity, Na+ and Cl-, water depth and total relative evapotranspiration (ETo) accounted for the highest proportion of temporal variation in composition of epiphytic diatoms, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Alkalinity, Na+, and Cl- explained a much higher proportion of species variation, using partial CCA. A simple WA with inverse deshrinking produced reasonably robust models for Na+ (r (boot) (2) = 0.71), depth (r (boot) (2) = 0.64) and alkalinity (r (boot) (2) = 0.46), not for Cl- and ETo. We determined species optima and tolerances for Na+, depth and alkalinity which can facilitate identification of anthropogenic impacts based on changes of indicator taxa assemblages. Our study provides a basis for newly developed quantitative tools to be used in biomonitoring studies and evaluations of reference conditions for temporary wetland management.

AB  - Grasslands in the Kulawa river valley (ca. 10 ha) were subject to land improvement in the 19(th) century, and remnants of the hydrotechnical system and overgrown ditches are still present. This study aims to:
   (1) evaluate the present meadow ecosystems;
   (2) predict their changes under the influence of the planned restoration of the hydrotechnical system and
   (3) compare results of various methods: phytoindication, phytosociological, floristic, and principal component analysis.
   The applied methods complemented one another. The devastation of the hydrotechnical system and the lack of utilization of the grasslands have led to either drying or waterlogging of the soil, and to changes in vegetation. The plant communities that have developed there represent the intermediate stage of regressive succession, and belong to the orders Arrhenatheretalia, Molinietalia, and the class Phragmitetea. Particularly the patches growing on relatively dry, strongly decomposed peaty soil have lost the characteristics of damp meadows. Meadow species have declined there, and nitrophilous species have replaced them. Only a local depression without outflow, which was earlier drained, is now waterlogged again, with a mosaic of calcareous fen, meadow, and marsh vegetation, including large populations of 11 species that are rare, protected, or listed as indicator species for the Natura 2000 habitat 7210*. Results of this study indicate that the present conditions in the waterlogged depression should be preserved. In contrast, the dry patches should be irrigated and subject to extensive farming.

AB  - Concentrations of a wide range of chemical variables were determined in 206 water samples taken between May 1996 and May 1998 from a set of 25 natural lakes in the French Massif Central. From each lake 6 to 9 samples were collected. Mean and standard deviation of total alkalinity, conductivity, pH, concentrations in K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ Na+ Cl-, SO42 total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen, dissolved silica, chlorophyll a, and water colour were calculated for each lake. These results are briefly compared with those obtained in an earlier study in which chemical analyses were carried out on a reduced set of lakes from the same region. In most lakes and for most elements, concentrations observed in the present study were similar to those observed previously. The seasonal variations of the elements which are most strongly influenced by biological processes were also investigated. Using hierarchical cluster analysis three main lake groups were distinguished : i) alkaline lakes, ii) deep lakes with low alkalinity and iii) shallow lakes with low alkalinity. The major patterns of variation in the data set were also investigated using principal components analysis (PCA), which confirms that total alkalinity and maximum water depth are the main environmental gradients in this set of lakes. In conclusion, the potential of this data-set for building diatom-based transfer functions to reconstruct past limnological conditions is discussed.

AB  - Environmental control strategy via computerized implementation is one of the most efficient approaches to integrate new advanced knowledge in research of human thermal comfort to a mechanical air-conditioning unit. Recently, a new conceptual development in designing air-conditioning systems has indicated that the indoor comfort temperature strongly depends upon changes of the outdoor air temperature rather than to be a conventional fixed temperature set-point. The explanation is due to occupants' adaptability of thermal comfort to a dynamic environment in terms of their clothing and/or activities while the outdoor temperature can be explicitly used as an ultimate indicator of such changes to empirical function of the indoor comfort temperature. In this paper, the first prototype embedded system is developed to emulate such an adaptive algorithm to numerically determine an indoor comfort temperature for a real-time control in an air-conditioning system. From a theoretical point of view, an adaptive comfort model together with grey prediction model is presented for exploring a practical application of a comfort temperature-based control for a single air-conditioned space, so as to show the viability of the proposed methodology by simulated results. The field studies by interview survey of satisfaction on thermal comfort within an air-conditioned reading room of a library confirm the viability of the proposed real-time computerized implementation of adaptive indoor comfort temperature via the embedded system for a conventional air-conditioning unit in practical uses.

AB  - Individual differences in developmental stability are often estimated using individual asymmetry for bilaterally symmetric traits. These are expected to reflect intrinsic abilities to cope with adverse environmental conditions, an important aspect of genotypic quality which should be associated with fitness, but this supposition has never been tested. Two experiments which manipulated environmental conditions were used to investigate whether individual asymmetry under good environmental conditions adequately predicts a genotype's capacity to buffer development across environments, and further to test whether individuals with superior buffering capacity against environmental stress, as reflected in less increase in asymmetry between poor and good environments, had higher fitness than those with poor buffering capacity, after controlling for the influence of asymmetry per se on fitness. Individual asymmetry of the outer tail feathers of male barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, was compared between two different kinds of good and poor environments. Although some individuals changed ranks for asymmetry values between environmental qualities, individual asymmetry under good conditions correlated with this trait in poor environmental conditions. Furthermore, asymmetry under good environmental conditions was positively correlated to change in asymmetry in one of the two experiments, indicating that individual asymmetry is a good predictor of developmental buffering ability. Individuals that increased in asymmetry less under poor environmental conditions had higher reproductive success, even after controlling for asymmetry phenotype, indicating that developmental stability reflects individual quality, as expressed in high relative fitness. These experiments demonstrate that intrinsic differences in developmental stability reliably predict. an important fitness component.

AB  - Concordance among wetland physicochemical conditions, vegetation, and surrounding land cover may result from the influence of land cover on the sources of plant propagules, on physicochemical conditions, and their subsequent determination of growing conditions. Alternatively, concordance may result if differences in climate, soils, and species pools are spatially confounded with differences in human population density and land conversion. Further, we expect that land cover within catchment boundaries will be more predictive than land cover in symmetrical buffers if runoff is a major pathway. We measured concordance between land cover, wetland vegetation and physicochemical conditions in 48 prairie pothole wetlands, controlling for inter-wetland distance. We contrasted land-cover data collected over a four-year period by multiple extraction approaches including topographically-delineated catchments and nested 30 m to 5,000 m radius buffers. After factoring out inter-wetland distance, physiochemical conditions were significantly concordant with land cover. Vegetation was not significantly concordant with land cover, though it was strongly and significantly concordant with physicochemical conditions. More, concordance was as strong when land cover was extracted from buffers <500 m in radius as from catchments, indicating the mechanism responsible is not topographically constrained. We conclude that local landscape structure does not directly influence wetland vegetation composition, but rather that vegetation depends on 1) physicochemical conditions in the wetland that are affected by surrounding land cover and on 2) regional factors such as the vegetation species pool and geographic gradients in climate, soil type, and land use.

AB  - Syrian durum wheat landraces from diverse collection sites were evaluated for agronomic performance under arid conditions over two seasons at four locations, at two levels of nutrient availability.
   Grain yield differed considerably among locations. Within locations, significant population and fertilizer effects were demonstrated. In most cases, maximum yield was achieved by landraces, which demonstrates the breeding value of local germplasm. In a particular environment, the population effect was nonsignificant for total dry matter production, but significant for straw and grain yield. Nitrogen application was ineffective if moisture availability was the dominant growth limiting factor.
   Correlations between plant characteristics at evaluation and collection site characteristics were limited, and therefore, their utilization in germplasm evaluation appear limited. The negative relation between grain yield and soil nitrogen content at the collection site may be caused by the comparative disadvantage that germplasm from regions with favourable growing conditions has under low-yielding conditions.
   Particular environmental conditions at the collection site were no indicator for the response to changed growing conditions. Relatively high grain yields under good and adverse growing conditions excluded each other in all but two cases. Also, it was difficult to relate grain yield to regions of collection, as the response of individual landraces from a certain region to changing growing conditions differed strongly. Differentiation on the basis of landrace groups appears more promising. The Hauran landrace group provided the largest number of populations with relatively high grain yields over diverse environments.

AB  - The paleoclimatic archive held in Lake Baikal sediments is of significant importance, given the lake's position in one of the world's most continental regions where there are few continuous, high quality records spanning the Quaternary. Here I review diatom and associated biogenic silica records from Lake Baikal sediments and provide a paleoclimatic synthesis of changes at various timescales over the Quaternary. I initially highlight major climatic and hydrological aspects of Lake Baikal, as understanding the contemporary system (both regionally and within the lake) are fundamental to understanding past change interpreted from the sedimentary archive. In this respect, special attention is given to factors that can affect the integrity of the diatom record, most notably dissolution processes. These mechanisms are likely to have had a relatively greater impact on the preservation of diatom valves during glacial periods because of overall lower diatom productivity. Lower diatom numbers and relative increased dissolution during cold periods explains the lack of diatoms and low biogenic silica concentrations found in the lake sediments during glacial periods. The biogenic record highlights the nature of the 100 ka cycle especially during the last 800 ka, although there is also a strong precessional component. Further work is needed to reassess biological responses in Lake Baikal with respect to different orbital forcing mechanisms, together with their impacts on evolution and speciation of diatoms. The biological record from Lake Baikal confirms that the last interglacial in central Asia lasted approximately 10.5 ka. Productivity in the lake (as inferred from diatom biovolume accumulation rates) exhibits millennial-scale variability with the occurrence of centennial-scale reductions in diatom biomass throughout the last interglacial period. The most severe reduction in diatom biomass (at c. 120 ka BP) is concurrent with millennial-scale cooling in the North Atlantic region. Links to changes in North Atlantic ocean thermohaline circulation via teleconnections are also evident in the nature of the abrupt ecological changes in the lake throughout the last 60 ka, linked to ice-rafting into the North Atlantic, otherwise known as Heinrich events. New robust radiocarbon chronologies for sediments deposited during the late glacial and Holocene in Lake Baikal allow detailed, multi-decadal records to be constructed for the last 14,000 years. Cooling events associated with millennial-scale cycles are also apparent in the Lake Baikal record, and both the diatom record and oxygen isotope record of the diatom silica highlight that biological responses to these abrupt events are almost simultaneous. Comparisons made between Lake Baikal records with others worldwide highlights that many of the Holocene cooling events are associated with melt-water outburst from the Laurentide ice sheet, and changes in solar insolation. During the last 1000 years, snow cover on Lake Baikal has been inferred from past diatom assemblages, and is closely linked to weakening of the North Atlantic Oscillation, allowing increasing intensity of the Siberian High to develop and during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the last 150 years, diatom species have been shown to be sensitive indicators of recent warming. However, impacts from future global warming will be complex, and are likely to impact not only on the balance between endemic and cosmopolitan diatoms throughout the take, but on the balance between siliceous and non-siliceous algae, and sources of primary productivity.

AB  - Early and accurate assessment of the growth condition of spring maize, a major crop in China, is important for the national food security. This study used a process-based Remote-Sensing-Photosynthesis-Yield Estimation for Crops (RS-P-YEC) model, driven by satellite-derived leaf area index and ground-based meteorological observations, to simulate net primary productivity (NPP) of spring maize in Northeast China from the first ten-day (FTD) of May to the second ten-day (STD) of August during 2001-2014. The growth condition of spring maize in 2014 in Northeast China was monitored and evaluated spatially and temporally by comparison with 5- and 13-year averages, as well as 2009 and 2013. Results showed that NPP simulated by the RS-P-YEC model, with consideration of multi-scattered radiation inside the crop canopy, could reveal the growth condition of spring maize more reasonably than the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator. Moreover, NPP outperformed other commonly used vegetation indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) for monitoring and evaluating the growth condition of spring maize. Compared with the 5- and 13-year averages, the growth condition of spring maize in 2014 was worse before the STD of June and after the FTD of August, and it was better from the third ten-day (TTD) of June to the TTD) of July across Northeast China. Spatially, regions with slightly worse and worse growth conditions in the STD of August 2014 were concentrated mainly in central Northeast China, and they accounted for about half of the production area of spring maize in Northeast China. This study confirms that NPP is a good indicator for monitoring and evaluating growth condition because of its capacity to reflect the physiological characteristics of crops. Meanwhile, the RS-P-YEC model, driven by remote sensing and ground-based meteorological data, is effective for monitoring crop growth condition over large areas in a near real time.

AB  - Seed size is an important indicator of physiological quality, since it may affect seed germination and seedling growth, especially under stress conditions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of seed size on germination and initial seedling growth, under salinity and water stress conditions. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design, in a 3 x 3 factorial scheme: three seed size classes (small, medium and large) and three stress treatments (control, saline or water stress), with four replicates. Water and salt stresses do not reduce the germination rate of medium and large seeds; however, the germination rate of small seeds is reduced under salt stress conditions. Drought stress drastically reduces the shoot growth of seedlings regardless of seed size, whereas root growth is higher in seedlings from medium and large seeds under water stress conditions. Under non-stressful environments, the use of large seeds is preferable, resulting in more vigorous seedlings with a greater dry matter accumulation. Medium-size seeds are more adapted to adverse environmental conditions and, therefore, should be used under conditions of water shortage and salt excess in the soil at sowing time. Seedlings are more tolerant to salinity than to water stress during the germination stage and initial growth under laboratory conditions.

AB  - Coastal areas are facing increasing pressures, mainly caused by the demographic boom, urban sprawl, development of agriculture, fisheries and industries, decline of renewable resources, loss of biological diversity, all potentially threatening the functional integrity of the coastal system. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and Maritime spatial planning (MSP) seek to develop an integrated model for sustainable development that is based on finding points of convergence among these factors. ICZM and MSP are modern concepts, based on the sustainable development principle, which provide for the management and protected of coastal areas taking into account all aspects of maritime uses. The study focuses on identifying new methods for the elaboration of a set of indicators specific for the coastal zone, as sustainable tools for a comprehensive assessment of the Integrated coastal zone management in the Romanian coastal area.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to optimize the current land use for providing sustainable ecological and social development.
   The aim of the study is to develop the sustainable and optimal organization of landscape structure on the level of a small watershed to take into account spatially-distributed microclimatic conditions for the most effective their use in accordance with dynamic of natural processes at watershed area.
   The methods: the synthesis of geophysical research methods, in particular the method of hydro-climatic calculations, with the method of relief quantitative description on the basis of digital elevation models (Geomorphometry). The authors have calculated a number of hydro circulating and solar indicators of relief influence on diversity of landscape conditions of runoff formation. The variety in the growing conditions at different relief forms was accounted on the basis of the method of hydro-climatic calculations with moisture ranges by the Ramenskiy scale integration. They characterize the habitat conditions on the vegetation structure. The automated monitoring of water runoff was organized as well to specify the modelled calculations and some other water-balanced elements at the study area.
   The results. The optimal distribution of land use types was modeled on the basis of detected diversity at the studied watershed. The watershed ecological capacity was defined according to water consumption. The application of the proposed method allows providing the effective using of landscape resources as well as the sustainable development of natural and social systems. This method should be recommended first of all for lands newly introduced in agriculture and buffer zones of conversation areas.

AB  - Droughts in dryland regions on all continents are expected to increase in severity and duration under future climate projections. In dryland regions, it is likely that minimum streamflow will decrease with some perennial streams shifting to intermittent flow under climate-driven changes in precipitation and runoff and increases in temperature. Decreasing base flow and shifting flow regimes from perennial to intermittent could have significant implications for stream-dependent biota, including riparian vegetation. In this study, we asked, how do riparian plant communities vary along wet-to-dry hydrologic gradients on small (first-third order) streams? We collected data on geomorphic, hydrologic, and plant community characteristics on 54 stream sites ranging in hydrology from intermittent to perennial flow across the Upper Colorado River Basin (284,898 km(2)). We found that plant communities varied along hydrologic gradients from high to low elevation between streams, and perennial to intermittent flow. We identified indicator species associated with different hydrologic conditions and suggest how plant communities may shift under warmer, drier conditions. Our results indicate that species richness and cover of total, perennial, wetland, and native plant groups will decrease while annual plants will increase under drying conditions. Understanding how plant communities respond to regional drivers such as hydroclimate requires broad-scale approaches such as sampling across whole river basins. With increasingly arid conditions in many regions of the globe, understanding plant community shifts is key to understanding the future of riparian ecosystems.

AB  - Several forest health indicators that are derived from inventory data can be used to compare changes in stand conditions over a 50-year period and across ownerships and regions. National forests, most of which are in the West, are denser and have higher mortality than other forests. A continuation of today's high growth-to-removals ratio on national forest timberlands portends increased density and mortality, putting various ecological, environmental,,economic, and social values at greater risk of severe wildfire than they are today. National forest managers could improve stand conditions by increasing removals, but public policies tend to inhibit active management of national forests.

AB  - Opponent-process theory occupies an important place in drug conditioning because it accounts for conditioned drug effects which are opposite to those induced by the drug itself. It has not been established, however, whether there is an opponent-process component to stimulant drug induced conditioned effects. In the present study the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model was used to examine this issue. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats with equivalent 6-OHDA lesions were administered five apomorphine treatments (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) either paired or unpaired to a 10-min test chamber placement. Apomorphine induced vigorous contralateral rotation and suppressed all ipsilateral rotation. While the apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation response can be conditioned to the test environment cues, the critical test of opponent-process theory in the present study was whether the opposite response of ipsilateral rotation would also become conditioned as a latent opponent-process response to the exteroceptive test environment cues associated with the apomorphine drug state. The postacquisition saline test for conditioning showed that the paired group exhibited higher rates of contralateral and ipsilateral rotation compared to the unpaired group. In addition, when the animals were subsequently tested with the dopaminergic receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), unexpectedly, contralateral rotation was enhanced in the paired group, whereas, ipsilateral rotation was suppressed in both groups. While these findings are, in part, compatible with an opponent-process mechanism, the data supported a simpler explanation; namely, the mechanism of differential habituation in the two groups due to a blocking effect of apomorphine on habituation selectively in the paired group. The haloperidol enhancement of contralateral rotation in the paired group was attributed to the suppression of ipsilateral rotation which acted as competing response during the saline test for conditioning. Thus, the present results provide no support for an opponent-process effect but are consistent with the development of a behavioral sensitization effect as a consequence of chronic dopaminergic stimulant drug treatment.

AB  - Bacillus subtilis spores are often used as biological indicators (BI) to monitor decontamination processes with gaseous hydrogen peroxide. Results in practical inactivation validation tests, however, vary considerably with no available explanation so far. This study reports on the effect of cultivation pH on spore surface hydrophobicity. Surface hydrophobicity is suspected to have an impact on the decontamination of technical surfaces such as packaging material when gaseous, condensing hydrogen peroxide is applied. It is the aim of this study to examine the impact of different cultivation pH levels on surface hydrophobicity and resistance of B. subtilis spores. Submersed cultivation of B. subtilis in bioreactors at controlled conditions with different static pH levels led to contact angles ranged between 50 degrees and 80 degrees, which was analyzed with water on a homogeneous layer of spores on a filter sheet. Resistance of spores was also affected by the cultivation pH. The results show that the culturing conditions during BI production should be controlled to obtain BI with specified characteristics in inactivation validation tests.

AB  - Variations in pollen spectra observed in sediments from the middle Bartonian-Lower Oligocene of Igualada, Ebro Basin (northeast Spain), have permitted the identification of general trends in floristic and climate change. Detailed investigations of the biological affinities of certain fossil pollen have revealed a number of plant genera previously unidentified in the fossil record.
   The floral diversity and ecological characteristics of the pollen taxa indicates that the middle Bartonian vegetation of the eastern Ebro Basin was characterised by a complex mangrove swamp reflecting warm climatic conditions. During the Priabonian, the greater variety of herbaceous plants suggests the existence of a more open vegetation correlated with the change to a climate with a dry season. During the Priabonian the diversification of Caesalpiniaceae indicates African influence. During the Late Eocene taxa interpreted as indicators of a dry climate are identified, while those indicating humid climatic conditions disappear. Dry climatic conditions characterise the Lower Oligocene, as indicated by the abundance of cupressacean pollen interpreted as evidence of a sclerophyllous forest. A slight climatic cooling is also revealed by the presence of some microthermal taxa.

AB  - Simple Summary: We compared the health status and ecological characteristics of farm-bred and wild frogs using veterinary clinical examinations. Wild frogs showed a better nutritional status and superior traits of locomotory performance than farm-bred frogs. However, wild animals are not necessarily in good health. This comparison can help determine the condition of animals and suggest improvements to the breeding environment.Due to the decline in the population and the difficulty of in situ conservation, several anuran species are being reared in captivity. In this study, we identified physiological and morphological differences between farm-bred and wild frogs. Nine different serum components were used as indicators of osmotic pressure, homeostatic state, organ function, and nutritional status of farm-bred frogs and wild frogs, while radiographic techniques were used to visualize differences in bone mineral density and body composition ratio. Additionally, X-ray skeletal images were used for morphological analysis to estimate differences in locomotory performance between the two groups. Wild frogs harbor traits that aid in better locomotory performance than farm-bred frogs. They also have a relatively lower fat content ratio and higher calcium and phosphorus serum levels than farm-bred frogs, suggesting a difference in nutritional status. However, hepatic stress was higher in wild frogs than in farm-bred frogs. Veterinary clinical examinations allow for the identification of differences in nutritional and morphological conditions between farm-bred and wild frogs. Determining the health of animals can help improve their living conditions, eliminate conditions that can negatively affect them, and effectively manage them on farms, in zoos, and at ex situ conservation institutes.

AB  - The aim of this work is to identify and characterize microtextural signatures in silica glass grains (used as analogous to quartz) that are produced during aqueous transport at different flow velocities, with variable sediment concentrations, transport distances, and time intervals. To achieve this, an open-channel flow experiment was conducted with a mixture of sand and silica glass microspheres in varying conditions-velocity (from 0.67 to 1.4 m/s), duration (1 or 10 minutes), distance (0 to 2.5 m) and sediment concentration (60 or 80%). Experimental conditions were used to replicate natural phenomena such as river superficial velocity or coastal swash processes.
   Before the experiment the microsphere surfaces were imaged and clear of any microtextural imprint. Increasing velocity, distance, and sediment concentration exhibited a strong correlation with higher numbers of surfaces abundantly covered with microtextures of mechanical origin (i.e., craters, abrasion marks, and v-shaped percussion marks). SEM microphotographs of silica were analyzed and classified to provide examples of the specific microtextures produced during the open-channel flow experiment.
   The purpose of the experiment was to characterize surface microscopic signatures in quartz grains replicating hydrodynamic conditions of coastal and fluvial environments. The results demonstrated a strong correlation between higher velocities (and higher sediment concentrations) and a larger presence of microtextural mechanical imprints in the grains analyzed, thus demonstrating a clear relation between microtextural imprints and water flow modes. These results have important implications for future microtextural works analyzing grain imprints and their relation to sediment transport types. An example demonstrated here is that the higher presence of v-marks could be used as an indicator of supercritical flow conditions.

AB  - Seabirds are considered to be good indicators of the marine environment. However, little is known about the effects of environmental variability on the foraging behaviour of tropical seabirds. Red-footed boobies (RFB) nesting on Europa Island (Mozambique Channel) were fitted with GPS devices over four years and different breeding stages. We first show that the durations of foraging trips vary extensively according to the stage of the breeding, being short during brooding, intermediate during incubation and long during fledging. This result highlights the importance of considering breeding stage when conducting comparisons of foraging between sites or years. In addition, we show that RFB adjusted their foraging behaviour between years (2003, 2011, 2012 and 2013) according to the prevailing environmental conditions. During 2011, RFB made longer foraging trips with larger area-restricted search (ARS) zones over a larger total surface area, suggesting that the foraging conditions were probably poor. This year was characterized by a decrease of the major environmental drivers of the Mozambique Channel system, i.e. particularly low chlorophyll concentrations in the northern part of the Mozambique Channel, as well as a weak eddy activity. This observation suggests that environmental conditions may have altered the southward transport and concentration processes structuring the trophic chain, leading to adverse conditions for a central-place forager like the RFB. Our results emphasize that environmental and breeding stage variation should be taken into account to better understand the distribution of these predators in marine tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Lipids and fatty acids (FA) were investigated in 4 species of forage fish: northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax, Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, and whitebait smelt Allosmerus elongatus, for their ability to serve as biological indicators of ocean conditions in the California Current large marine ecosystem (CCLME). Samples were collected during the oceanographically contrasting years of 2005 and 2006. Upwelling was severely curtailed in the spring and early summer of 2005, leading to delayed biological productivity, whereas upwelling was relatively normal in spring 2006. Principal components analysis described 78% of the variance within the lipid and FA dataset using the first 2 principal components. We found significant intra- and interspecific, interannual, and seasonal differences in lipid and FA profiles using univariate and permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance. Indicator species analysis showed distinct lipid and FA properties associated with each fish species. Using the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) to eicosapentaeonic acid (C20:5n-3), we detected a transition from a diet composed primarily of dinoflagellate origin in early 2005 to a diet resulting from diatom-based productivity by late summer 2006. This shift was due to interannual differences in primary production, which was confirmed through phytoplankton sampling. Our study demonstrates that lipid and FA biomarkers in the forage fish community can provide information on ocean conditions and productivity that affect food web structure in the CCLME.

AB  - Although previous studies have demonstrated that heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can be induced by environmental stress, little is known about natural variation in this response over short time scales. We examined how Hsp70 levels varied over days to weeks in two intertidal snail species of the genus Tegula. Sampling was conducted both under naturally changing environmental conditions and in different vertical zones on a rocky shore. The subtidal to low-intertidal T. brunnea was transplanted into shaded and unshaded mid-intertidal cages to assess temporal variation in Hsps under conditions of increased stress. For comparison, the low to mid-intertidal T. funebralis was transplanted into mid-intertidal cages, within this species' natural zone of occurrence. Snails were sampled every 3 to 4 days for one month, and endogenous levels of two Hsp70-kDa family members (Hsp72 and Hsp74) were quantified using solid-phase immunochemistry. Following periods of midday low tides, levels of Hsps increased greatly in transplanted T brunnea but not in T funebralis. Levels of Hsps increased less in T brunnea transplanted to shaded cages than to unshaded cages, suggesting that prolonged emersion and reduction in feeding time per se are factors that are only mildly stressful. Upregulated levels of Hsps returned to base levels within days. In unmanipulated snails collected from their natural zones, Hsp levels showed little change with thermal variation, indicating that these species did not experience thermally stressful conditions during this study. However, under common conditions in the mid-intertidal zone, Hsp70 levels reflected the different thermal sensitivities of the physiological systems of these two species.

AB  - How housing and transport conditions may affect welfare in porcine production is a leading topic in livestock research. This study investigated whether pigs present a different neurological response to management conditions and to ascertain whether pigs living partially outdoors cope differently with road transport-associated stress. Twenty-four female pigs were divided in two groups: one living indoors (ID, n = 12) and the other housed combining indoor conditions with 4 hours per day of outdoor pasture (OD, n = 12). After one month, one set of animals from each housing condition were driven in a truck to the slaughterhouse in low-stress conditions (5 min drive, no mixing groups, soft management, LS group, n = 12) or high-stress conditions (2 hours drive, mixing groups, harsh management, HS group, n = 12). At the slaughterhouse, blood was collected, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HC) dissected. OD pigs had lower serum haptoglobin and increased dopaminergic pathway (DA-system) in the PFC, suggesting that living outdoors increases their wellbeing. HS conditions increased serum creatine kinase (CK) and affected several brain pathways: activation of the noradrenergic (NA-system) and DA-system in the PFC and the activation of the DA-system and an increase in c-Fos as well as a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the HC. The serotonergic system (5-HT-system) was mildly altered in both areas. There was an interaction between housing and transport in serum NA and the DA-system in the HC, indicating that living conditions affected the response to stress. Multivariate analysis was able to discriminate the four animal groups. In conclusion, this work indicates that housing conditions and road transport markedly modifies the neurophysiology of pigs, and suggests that animals raised partially outdoors respond differently to transport-associated stress than animals raised indoors, indicating that they cope differently with unknown environments.

AB  - Nonnative species have minimum ecological conservatism that invariably limits floristic quality scores. This means nonnative species could prevent sites from reaching predefined floristic quality targets in restoration and ecological health applications. Using large datasets from a jurisdictional wetland determination program and the U.S. National Wetland Condition Assessment, we evaluated nonnative species limitation of floristic quality estimates in deciding restoration efficacy and multimetric health. Specifically, floristic quality indexed with and without nonnatives was tested as a stand-alone measure of wetland compensatory mitigation performance, and in a multimetric context of large-scale wetland condition monitoring. In the stand-alone application, nonnative species prevented over 50% of sites from reaching the original high, medium, and low floristic quality targets, and these failure rates remained high (11.7-19.2%) after recalibrating the targets to account for nonnative species. Sites falling below standards contained significantly higher percentages of nonnative species and scored closer to the performance targets. Rates of multimetric condition shift were much lower (4.4% overall), attributable to fewer nonnative records per site ((x) over bar =4.2 species) and to weakening of single-metric influences. Where shifts among health ratings did occur, sites contained about 8-15% nonnative species and scores were already near the rating boundaries. In both examples outcomes clearly depended on percentages of nonnative species and the nearness of initial scoring estimates to predefined targets or adjacent health categories. Nonnative species acting on floristic quality scores may limit wetland mitigation performance and shift ecological health ratings, but with likely muted effect in multimetric situations.

AB  - We explore a goal-oriented as opposed to a problem-oriented approach to DSS development for ecosystem management. Ecosystem management ordinarily is guided by a set of goals that may conflict in various ways. Problems are perceived obstacles to realizing goals. Identifying and resolving conflicts between goals, testing current or projected situations for goal satisfaction, and problem identification all require a robust model of the goal structure for the intended domain. The lowest level of this goal structure must be represented as desirable future conditions consisting of proposed values for observable indicators. A model of the causal, legal, and other institutional relations between these desirable future conditions is also needed. Two projects based on a goal-oriented approach to DSS development are described. The first project has produced an initial prototype that incorporates goals for forest management in rules representing three tiers: management unit goals, stand-level goals, and desirable future conditions. The second, at an initial knowledge acquisition stage, is an attempt to develop a participatory decision-making methodology for socially and environmentally sensitive economic development in Central America.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to verify the benthic macroinvertebrates community responses through environmental factors along a headwater tropical reservoir. Samplings were taken with a Van-Veen grab along the reservoir in littoral and profundal regions and in the headwater, next to the dam and the middle of the reservoir. Samples were taken during both wet and dry seasons. Dissolved oxygen concentrations, electric conductivity, temperature and pH near the sediment have been performed in situ, at every sampling station by using a multiprobe and Secchi disc. Total water phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations were analyzed to determine the trophic state index. Sediment's organic matter, total phosphorus, nitrogen concentrations and granulometric composition were measured. In order to verify which environmental variables would have more influence over the benthic macroinvertebrates community, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed. The total number of recorded taxa was 28. Among them, the family Chironomidae (Diptera) was the richest group (19 taxa). It can be proposed that the benthic macroinvertebrates community may be influenced by environmental conditions such as nutrient and organic matter availability, as well as dissolved oxygen concentration. Macroinvertebrates are adequate bioindicators of water quality due to their sensibility to environmental changes mentioned before. Chironomus sp, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Branchiura sowerbyi comprises a group that can be considered bioindicators of eutrophic conditions. A second group can be considered as indicator of mesotrophic conditions. The presence of two or more members from that group which comprises Tanytarsini spp, Fissimentum sp, Pelomus sp and Goeldichironomus sp, like predominant taxa, may indicates mesotrophic conditions.

AB  - The calculation of critical loads and their exceedance is one method to describe the vulnerability of forests to environmental stress caused by anthropogenic impact. Exceedance of critical loads for acidifying inputs and nitrogen was compared to different indicators of the soil and forest conditions in the German part of the extensive forest monitoring (ICP Forests/EU Level I), including more than 1,800 plots. In addition, an empirical relationship between the C/N ratio of the forest floor humus layer (C/N (Humus)) and the estimated nitrogen output for ten plots of the intensive monitoring (ICP Forests/EU Level II) was established in order to estimate the potential nitrogen output on Level I plots dominated by Norway spruce. Regarding all tree species assessed, the exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and sulphur is negatively correlated with pH and base saturation up to 30 cm soil depth. The sulphur deposition and the exceedance of critical loads are highly correlated with the sulphur content of leaves and needles, whereas the respective relations for nitrogen were lower. The crown condition was weakly positively related to the sulphur content in tree leaves and needles. For Norway spruce sites, high exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and nitrogen deposition corresponded well with low C/N (Humus). In regions with high nitrogen load and low C/N ratios in the humus layer, the calculated nitrogen output was high. The results support the concept of critical thresholds in that way that their exceedance can impair forest ecosystem functions like nitrogen retention.

AB  - Adult male dragonflies were sampled from 42 sites on four variously disturbed rivers and three reservoirs in Kruger National park,South Africa. Fifty-one species and 2671 individuals were recorded. Large flow fluctuations resulted in a high species turnover during sampling. Dragonfly species richness mostly conformed with th intermediate-disturbance hypothesis, with species richness high on the rivers with moderate disturbance and low on the most disturbed ones. Ordination of dragonfly species data separated rivers into clear groups, indicating that the dragonfly assemblages reflected the distinct plant physiognomic and physical environmental conditions of each river system. Species that were abundant on any particular river had biotope preferences that reflected the overall environmental conditions of that river. Aquatic macrophytes, including two exotic invasive species,promoted dragonfly species richness. These species, however, were not rare or threatened. Highly disturbed rivers were characterized by species that preferred highly exposed situations with broad environmental conditions. In contrast, long grass or shady trees were important for some species because they buffered larger-scale, unpredictable environmental changes. Biotic disturbance was also important because trampling by buffalo reduced local species richness and composition. Dragonfly assemblages were highly visible and sensitive indicators of aspects of long-term environmental conditions of the water body. Management recommendations for dragonflies and other aquatic invertebrates include maintaining water and riparian biotope heterogeneity, maintaining constant flow rates and water levels, and allowing some macrophyte cover. A little natural and anthropogenic disturbance encourages much greater species richness than more extreme disturbance. The Sabie River is a major subject for conservation action in the premier protected area of Kruger National Park.

AB  - Continuous measurements of dust reveal the intermittent nature of dust events within the Southern High Plains of North America. Dust events appear as sudden peaks that project outward from a much lower background dust concentration. The measured dust record appears to follow a regular annual cycle with most dust events occurring in spring and considerably fewer during other seasons. The annual dust cycle reflects seasonal changes in environmental factors such as wind speed, surface cover, and moisture conditions. Most dust events are associated with a combination of strong winds, negligible surface cover? and dry conditions, all of which occur most frequently during the spring season. Wind speed alone is found to be an imperfect indicator of dust levels in the Southern High Plains because of the moderating effects of other important environmental factors such as humidity and surface cover. However, if one limits consideration to dry and bare conditions, dust concentration exhibits a positive correlation with daily wind speeds above 4 m s(-1) and a negligible correlation for light winds.

AB  - The persistence of the nematophagous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus Samson strain 251 (PL251) and the effect of application rate, substrate type, as well as the presence of the nematode host on its dynamics after application to the soil were investigated under controlled conditions. In all experiments, increase of P. lilacinus colony forming units after application was not found. In contrast, a gradual decline in fungal densities over time was observed. Application rate had no significant effect on the dynamics of the fungal population. Likewise, P. lilacinus density decline in soil was not significantly affected by the presence of the nematode host. Substrate type had a significant effect on P. lilacinus persistence in soil. The fungal agent persisted longer in silty loam and clay soil, with reduced persistence when sand was added to field soil. Conversely, when organic substrate was added to pure sand, persistence was significantly increased. Although persistence of fungal biocontrol agents in soil depends on various biotic and abiotic conditions, baseline data on persistence such as those reported in this study are helpful for biocontrol and environmental risk assessment and merit further study.

AB  - An analytical method for classifying ecological types was developed and tested for mountain meadows in central Nevada. Six ecological types were identified by plot sampling of vegetation and soil-site variables. Two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis were used to identify ecological types and to compare the discriminating abilities of different ecosystem components. Each ecological type was a characteristic combination of landform, soil, and vegetation. Changes in vegetation and soil conditions were assessed along a gradient of degradation within one ecological type-the dry graminoid/Cryoboroll/trough drainageway type. Direct gradient analysis was used to display changes in plant composition and indicators of site degradation. Plant and soil indicators of degradation were basal cover of vegetation, standing crop production of 3 key grass species, rates of infiltration, and soil compaction. Three states of range degradation were identified along the gradient. The grass-dominated state was the most desirable in terms of forage production, basal cover of vegetation and infiltration, while the grass/forb/shrub state represented the most degraded and least productive state.

AB  - Purpose Using a three-week household activity-travel survey, this paper explores the relationship between individuals' self-reported physical, mental and social health conditions and their time allocation for different types of in-home and out-of-home time activities.
   Methods A path model is developed to investigate the roles of activity-travel time use on the self-reported health conditions, while the socio-demographics and residential environment characteristics are also considered.
   Results The model results reveal heterogeneous impacts of different types of activities and intensities on individual's self-reported health conditions. This study, however, did not find evidence of positive relationship between cycling and walking and self-reported physical health condition, which has been found in many developed countries. Presumably this is because in developing countries like Indonesia the individuals who walk and cycle are likely to be a part of economically disadvantaged groups who have less awareness to their own health conditions.
   Conclusion Beside activity and travel time use factors, age and working status were found significantly affecting the self-reported health conditions, regardless of respondents' gender and income. Neighbourhood characteristics, such as population density, are also found positively correlated to self-reported respondents' physical, social and mental health conditions.

AB  - We estimate physical health, mental health, and healthcare access conditions and behaviours among fishing industry participants from a public health survey in the United States. Human well-being is an increasingly important consideration in ecosystem models and fishery management. We use a standardized public health survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, to estimate health-related aspects of well-being in fishing industry participants (including harvest, processing, and wholesaling sectors) in Washington state and compare to reference populations. We find that physical and mental health outcomes and healthcare access among fishing industry participants are broadly similar to other populations. However, fishing industry participants are more frequently affected by conditions that limit activity and tend to engage in potentially unhealthy behaviour at higher rates. Our work fills a gap on health-related well-being outcomes in the human dimensions of fisheries and demonstrates the role that public health surveys can play in the study of well-being in fishing communities.

AB  - The influence of dredging on the dragonfly assemblages of the small regulated lowland River Krapiel (north-western Poland) was analyzed a short time after the dredging. Dragonfly assemblages were destroyed, but they began to recover rapidly. Many biocoenotic indices reached high values at just six months after the dredging. The recolonization first occurred as a result of larval drift, and then, via dispersion of adult dragonflies. This process took place in conditions different from the prevailing conditions in the period before dredging, in terms of microhabitat availability and physico-chemical conditions. Compared to the previous assemblage, the emerging assemblage was more typical of assemblages found in small, natural running waters. Therefore, dredging (carried out for economic reasons) could be regarded as a process that unintentionally had a positive influence on odonate assemblages. Currently, when most small watercourses are regulated, dredging that is properly planned and controlled has proven to protect the natural fauna. It is worthwhile to apply lessons learned from examples of active fauna protection to what is currently known as "the rotational model" for dredging.

AB  - This paper measures and analyses well-being in the 349 regions in OECD countries. It is argued that the multidimensional nature of well-being and the disparate policy priorities of nations/regions calls for a reconciliatory performance evaluation framework, for which this paper advocates the use of Benefit-of-the-Doubt (BoD) weighting. In particular, using the BoD-model, three multidimensional measures of regional well-being are computed: a material condition measure, a quality of life index and a subjective life satisfaction measure. To account for the presence of certain exogenous conditions in the regional policy environments, the conditional robust order-m version of the BoD-model is applied. Results show considerable between- and within-country disparity in regional performances across the three domains of well-being. Countries such as Australia, Canada, Norway and Iceland show consistently high levels of regional well-being. Consistently low performance levels are observed for Chile, Turkey and Poland.

AB  - Induction of cytochrome P4501A in fish is a well-known indicator of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and determination of PAH metabolites in bile by fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) or synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS), has become an useful method in monitoring programs. In this work the relationship between cytochrome P4501A (EROD activity) and levels of biliary PAH metabolites was measured in the European eel Anguilla anguilla, in both field and laboratory conditions: organisms were sampled on a seasonal basis from the Orbetello lagoon (Tuscany) to characterize the natural variability of these biological parameters, while in laboratory eels were intraperitoneally injected with benzo[a]pyrene to investigate temporal and dose-dependent induction patterns. Results showed that induction of cytochrome P450 and accumulation of PAHs metabolites in bile are not necessarily correlated either in field, or in laboratory investigations; different seasonal changes were measured in natural conditions and slight variations in dose and time response patterns were also obtained in laboratory exposures.

AB  - The present study seeks to establish industry management strategies based on ecosystem-based indicators in an intensive mussel culture area. Spatial differences in the environmental conditions and in the productivity of mussels cultured on hanging ropes were examined at five locations in Ria de Arousa (NW Spain). The environmental conditions of the ecosystem were described on basis of the next ecosystem-based indicators: hydrography (salinity, temperature and chlorophyll a), dynamics (current velocity) and food availability (FA). Mussel productivity was assessed by measuring the biomass per rope, total fresh weight, and length of cultured mussels. Mussel productivity was successfully modeled from empirical relationships with current velocity, chlorophyll a and culture density. Commercial production (in kg) was evaluated from biomass and translated into economic value taking into account mussel commercial category. Finally, economic gross yield of each location was related with environmental conditions and culture densities by means of empirical relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To investigate the environmental impact of anthropogenic activity in the Negev Desert, we monitored the following in order to determine the physiological integrity of the epilithic fruticose lichen Ramalina maciformis: (1) production of ethylene; (2) potential quantum yield of photosystem 11 expressed as chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F-v/F-m; and (3) electrolyte leakage of cell membranes in terms of electric conductivity. The degree of pollution was assessed by measuring the amounts of B, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr and Zn in the lichen thallus. Some of the lichen-carrying stones collected in the relatively unpolluted control site were relocated on the same hill, to test the possible impact of relocation. An additional amount of lichen-carrying stones was marked as controls. The greater part of the lichen-carrying stones was transferred to 10 biomonitoring sites in and around Ramat Hovav, an industrial area in the Negev Desert, Israel. Transplanted lichen in polluted sites contained higher amounts of mineral elements than lichens in the control site after an exposure period of 7 months. Statistical analysis revealed positive correlation of ethylene production and Ni content, negative correlation of F-v/F-m ratios and B, Cu, Mn, Na, Ni, Sr and Zn, and positive correlation of electric conductivity and B, Mn, Ni and Sr. Both elemental content and physiological alterations in transferred samples of R. maciformis point to a high degree of contamination in Ramat Hovav. The present study suggests that the lichen R. maciformis should be classified as a sensitive species endangered by anthropogenic activity in the desert. Furthermore, this lichen species is likely to be suitable as a bioindicator of pollution in other parts of the Negev Desert. Ethylene production and electric conductivity as parameters of lichen-vitality, indicated stress in 5 of the 12 biomonitoring sites (42%) and may therefore be considered as more sensitive than the F-v/F-m ratio, which indicated stress in 3 of the 12 sites (25%).

AB  - The Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR) was developed in 2007, and it was one of the first biological methods developed in Poland under the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to assess the ecological status of running waters. It is based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of 153 indicator taxa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the MIR method to detect trophic degradation in rivers and to compare its efficiency with other macrophyte metrics. Our investigation was based on 100 sites, representing a very clear gradient from near oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. The results showed that macrophytes can be distinguished in terms of their ecological requirements for nutrient concentration in water, and this can be used to develop an effective system of freshwater assessment. The MIR was shown to be the indicator most strongly correlated with various forms of nutrients, and it was demonstrated that calibration of the macrophyte method to local biogeographical conditions resulted in greater effectiveness of the assessment method.

AB  - Modeling of geodynamic risk is a highly relevant scientific issue; its solution requires solving particular problems in creating a model of the geological environment, selecting the risk factors, creating a model of process, acknowledging the scenarios and prognoses. Geodynamic risk in the areas of development of subsident soils can be defined as the possibility of massif deformations during changes in the soil condition (degradation). The limit state is the state of full water saturation, when the possibility of subsidence is low. Application of the three-term gradation to the scale of conditions sets the boundary values of soil moisture - the indicators of mild, average and critical changes. The predicted condition of the massif is set by a system of features - independent variables, input parameters correlated with values of moisture and values of degradation of subsidence properties. The predicted value of subsidence degradation under additional loading and in natural conditions is found using the group method of data handling. Widespread presence of subaerial loess-like formation in the composition of the geological environment in stratigraphic-genetic complexes of different composition and properties, and in water-bearing horizons, leads to intense development of exogenous geological processes and vulnerability of the environment.
   Typification of the geological structure of the massif was performed using the results of analysis of numerous engineering-geological studies (Dnipro, 1960-2007). The total number of wells is 785, the depth varies from 15 to 56 m. The mapping of surfaces of particular horizons, terrain, thickness of aeration zone was developed using a "Surfer" demo-version. Interpolation was made using the Kriege method. Development of models of surfaces of the top of and thickness of horizons and took the erosional washout into consideration. The analysis of cartographic material shows that loess and paleosol horizons have different consistencies.
   The following processes were modeled: the change in the condition in relation to moisture of the subsident soil massif within the zone of low-intensive aeration, the value of additional pressure equals 0.3 MPa; the change in the condition in relation to moisture of the subsident soil massif within the zone of averagely intensive aeration, the value of additional pressure equals 0.3 MPa (Fig. 5 b). The results of the prognosis indicate the importance of predicting the subsidence degradation as a factor of geodynamic risk, maximum values reach 0.24 m. Comparing this value to the value of acceptable settling of constructions may suggest the practicability of introducing the method of predicting subsidence to the practice of engineering-geological studies and planning.

AB  - Since the end of the commercial fur seal hunt in 1984, the economy of the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, has lacked a stable, lasting basis. As a contribution to the effort to understand and promote the effective management of the Pribilof Islands as a social-ecological system, we examined current and recent conditions on the islands to assess local perceptions of, and prospects for, economic, social and environmental well-being. We found few correlations between environmental conditions and socio-economic indicators. The lack of apparent connection between population levels and economic or environmental stimuli is likely attributable to one or more of several factors: (a) modest economic dependence on the environment; (b) predominance of other economic inputs to the economies of the islands; (c) islanders basing residence choices largely on non-economic factors; and (d) the islanders' tolerance for economic fluctuations and uncertainty. These results suggest economic analysis alone is insufficient to explain the dynamics of this social-ecological system, contrary to many other case studies and an expectation of tight coupling and clear connections between society and ecology in the Pribilofs.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) are widely used as tracers of sea surface conditions in late Quaternary marine records. However, paleoenvironmental reconstructions across the Pliocene-Pleistocene climatic transition and beyond are limited because the hydrologic conditions influencing assemblage compositions may not have a modern analogue, and the ecological optima of extinct dinocyst species are not well known. From a study of two cored sites in the central and eastern North Atlantic, we bypass these issues by statistically analyzing the variations in dinocyst assemblage composition and comparing the results directly to paleoecological parameters (delta O-18(bulloides), Omega 18O(salinity), and geochemical proxies for sea surface temperature [SST]) derived from the planktonic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides recovered from the same samples as the dinocysts. Through canonical correspondence analysis we demonstrate the co-variation of seasonality and dinocyst paleoproductivity. We show that Pyxidinopsis braboi is a cold tolerant species with an optimum SST between 12 and 14 degrees C. We extend the use of Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus as an indicator of transitional climatic conditions to the Pliocene, we offer evidence for the correlation of Bitectatodinium tepikiense and Filisphaera microornata to high seasonality, and we reiterate an apparent link between Spiniferites mirabilis and eastern North Atlantic water masses. Finally, we confirm that Habibacysta tectata is cold-tolerant rather than a strictly cold-water indicator, that Operculodinium? eirikianum is a cold-intolerant species favoring outer neritic environments, and that Ataxiodinium confusum and Invertocysta lacrymosa are both warm-water species.

AB  - The degree of anoxia that existed during accumulation of Devonian-Mississippian black shales in central Kentucky has been debated widely. In this study, geochemical data were used to elucidate paleodepositional environments for these units. Using analyses from ten cores collected from the outcrop belt in central Kentucky, sulfur, carbon, and selected trace-element relationships were compared. The Sunbury Shale (Tournasian, Lower Mississippian) and the Cleveland and Huron members of the Ohio New Albany Shale (Fammenian, Upper Devonian) show different relationships between carbon, sulfur, and trace elements. C-S-Fe relationships for the Sunbury suggest anoxic, possibly even euxinic, conditions prevailed during sediment accumulation. Analysis of C-S-Fe data suggests that the Cleveland may have accumulated under anoxic conditions, with intermittent dysoxia, whereas the Huron Member may have accumulated under a relatively wide range of conditions, from anoxic, to dysoxic, to possibly oxic.
   These three units exhibit different degrees of trace-element enrichment, with the approximate order of enrichment relative to an average shale being Mo>Pb>Zn>V>Ni>Cu>Cr>Co. The Sunbury shows the highest levels of enrichment, followed by the Cleveland, with the Huron showing only slight enrichment for most of these trace elements. Differing degrees of enrichment may reflect differences in depositional environment during accumulation. High Mo concentrations in the Sunbury (generally 200-550 ppm) may infer euxinic conditions prevailed during sediment accumulation. The Cleveland and the Huron both show considerably lower Mo contents (averaging around 100 ppm). Geochemical ratios, including Ni/Co, V/Cr, and V/(V + Ni), also indicate variable paleoredox conditions for these shales. Based on previously established thresholds, V/Cr and Ni/Co ratios infer at least anoxic conditions during accumulation of the Sunbury, anoxic to dysoxic conditions during Cleveland accumulation, and dysoxic to oxic conditions for the Huron. V/(V + Ni) ratios tend to indicate consistently lower oxygen regimes than do other paleoredox indicators, and this discrepancy is greatest for the Huron Member. It is suggested that thresholds established for paleoredox indicators in previous studies should not be applied strictly, but that relative differences in these indicators collectively can infer variations in the degree of anoxia. In addition, relationships between C-org and redox elements may help elucidate the role of anoxia in OM accumulation.
   It may be concluded from this study that the Devonian-Mississippian black shales of central Kentucky accumulated under variable bottom-water conditions. At least anoxic conditions prevailed during accumulation of much of the Sunbury Shale and the upper part of the Cleveland Member, and possibly euxinic conditions for the Sunbury. Bottom-water conditions may have been intermittently anoxic and dysoxic during deposition of the lower Cleveland. During accumulation of the Huron Member, it is likely that conditions ranged from anoxic to dysoxic to marginally oxic, possibly being close to normal marine conditions at times during accumulation of the lowermost Huron sediments.

AB  - In situ studies that rely on non-invasive faecal hormone monitoring are subject to problems due to potential changes in hormone concentrations in samples exposed to field conditions. In this study, we conducted an environmental validation for measurement of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) in jaguars (Panthera onca). We collected fresh faeces (e.g. no older than 8 h) from jaguars (six males and four females), housed at the Belize Zoo, and exposed them randomly to two environmental conditions: shade and sun. A control (first sub-sample) was immediately frozen, after which sub-samples were frozen daily over a 5 day period in both the dry and wet seasons. We quantified FGMs using a cortisol enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a corticosterone radioimmunoassay (RIA), both capable of identifying relevant metabolites. Results indicated that FGMs assessed with the cortisol EIA were stable for 5 days during the dry season but for <1 day during the wet season, while FGMs assessed with the corticosterone RIA were stable for 5 days during both the dry and wet seasons. Exposure of jaguar faeces to sun or shade had no effect on FGM concentrations, despite significant differences in weather parameters. Analysis of faecal morphology proved unreliable in identifying faecal age. We conclude that the corticosterone RIA is suitable for assessing FGMs in free-ranging Belizean jaguars by surveying the same transects every 3-4 days in both seasons. The cortisol EIA can be used during the dry season, but there are possible shifts in metabolite immunoactivity in wet conditions. Assessment of adrenal activity in jaguars ranging areas of varying human disturbance is a timely application of this methodology in Belize.

AB  - Coastal saline lagoons are rare in North West Europe and tend to be closed, brackish water systems. In the United Kingdom they are small and isolated, each exhibiting extremely variable habitat conditions, both spatially and temporally. This paper represents the first species-level study of lagoonal nematode assemblages in the UK. Samples were taken from seven ponds in a saline lagoon system on the south coast of England in order to describe the nematode assemblage in relation to habitat type and to assess the possibility of lagoonal specialisation. At each site samples were also taken, or data were already available, for salinity, sediment granulometry, sediment organic carbon content, photosynthetic pigments and lagoon topography.
   A lagoonal specialist nematode fauna was not identified, but it was found that the nematode communities strongly reflected the differences between environmental conditions in the lagoons. Sample and site diversity were found to be relatively similar, but the importance of habitat networks was indicated by the relatively high system diversity, species turnover being highest between lagoons with different salinity and/or granulometry regimes. Salinity was the principal factor correlated with assemblage structure and species diversity was highest at the higher salinity sites. Median salinity (averaged from weekly records over the previous 4 months) correlated more clearly with nematode assemblage structure than salinity at the time of sampling. This shows the importance of considering historical as well as contemporaneous data when undertaking ecological studies: Contemporary conditions may influence species fecundity, and therefore relative abundances, whilst historic conditions may influence species occurrence through the effects of recruitment and survival.

AB  - Urban ecosystems and remnant habitat 'islands' therein, provide important strongholds for many wildlife species including those of conservation significance. However, the persistence of these habitats can be undermined if their structure and function are too severely disrupted. Urban wetlands, specifically, are usually degraded by a monoculture of invasive vegetation, disrupted hydrology, and chronic-contamination from a suite of anthropogenic pollutants. Top predators-as bioindicators-can be used to assess and monitor the health of these ecosystems. We measured eight health parameters (e.g., parasites, wounds and scars, tail loss and body condition) in a wetland top predator, the western tiger snake, Notechis scutatus occidentalis. For three years, snakes were sampled across four wetlands along an urban gradient. For each site, we used GIS software to measure the area of different landscapes and calculate an urbanisation-landscape score. Previously published research on snake contamination informed our calculations of a metal-pollution index for each site. We used generalised linear mixed models to assess the relationship between all health parameters and site variables. We found the metal-pollution index to have the most significant association with poor body condition. Although parasitism, tail loss and wounds differed among sites, none of these parameters influenced body condition. Additionally, the suite of health parameters suggested differing health status among sites; however, our measure of contemporary landscape urbanisation was never a significant predictor variable. Our results suggest that the health of wetland predators surrounding a rapidly growing city may be offset by higher levels of environmental pollution.

AB  - Researchers have been exploring dielectric testing techniques both in time and frequency domain for insulation condition assessment of oil-paper insulated transformers. In a practical dielectric system, dipoles are found to behave according to a distribution of elementary Debye relaxation properties. Suitable distribution density functions have been proposed to characterise such many-body interaction processes. Cole-Cole diagrams can be one of the methods for studying the nature of frequency dependency of dielectric materials of complex structure. Cole-Cole plots are commonly used for characterising different materials such as dielectric mixtures, ionic liquids, cable insulating oil, polar liquids etc. The scope of its application for assessing transformer oil-paper insulation considering distributed relaxation process has not been explored yet. The present contribution discusses mathematical formulations used for transforming the experimentally obtained time domain dielectric response test data to distribution domain and further to frequency domain for obtaining the Cole-Cole plots. Findings about the influence of various operating conditions and insulation status on the Cole-Cole diagram have been reported in this contribution. Results of tests on field transformers are also presented. This paper attempts to employ the features of Cole-Cole diagrams as potential indicators for analysing condition of the oil-paper insulation considering distributed relaxation process.

AB  - Gastrointestinal helminths can have a detrimental effect on the fitness of wild ungulates. Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems are ideal for the study of host-parasite interactions due to the comparatively simple ecological interactions and limited confounding factors. We used a unique dataset assembled in the early seventies to study the diversity of gastrointestinal helminths and their effect on fitness indicators of Dall's sheep, Ovis dalli dalli, in the Mackenzie Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada. Parasite diversity included nine species, among which the abomasal nematode Marshallagia marshalli occurred with the highest prevalence and infection intensity. The intensity of M. marshalli increased with age and was negatively associated with body condition and pregnancy status in Dall's sheep across all the analyses performed. The intensity of the intestinal whipworm, Trichuris schumakovitschi, decreased with age. No other parasites were significantly associated with age, body condition, or pregnancy. Our study suggests that M. marshalli might negatively influence fitness of adult female Dall's sheep.

AB  - Diatom indices are used to evaluate the ecological status of rivers but they have been rarely applied in estuaries. This study aimed to identify the diatom species indicating the main environmental gradients and pressures in a highly stratified estuary; and to evaluate the applicability of existing freshwater diatom indices. Marine influence due to salt-wedge intrusion and sea water mixing appeared as the main factor affecting diatom community. Three diatom assemblages were identified: indicators of riverine conditions (without marine influence), indicators of estuarine conditions (heterogeneous conditions with higher conductivities due to marine influence) and those specifically indicating well-established saltwedge situations. Nowadays, the main human pressure affecting diatom community in the Ebro Estuary is the hydrological alteration resulting from flow regulation and abstraction. Several limitations were encountered in the application of diatom indices (e.g. inverse response with nutrients; ecologically important species not considered). Therefore, their use in estuaries should be done cautiously. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a total of 20 soil samples were collected around industries and abandoned mine of Maros Karst Ecosystems. Quantitative assessment is done by measuring the factor of single element enrichment and potential biological effects on living things. Calculated Hg accumulation indicates that soil conditions in the area around the Karst Maros Ecosystem have been polluted. In contrast, Cr accumulation means the soil condition remains unpolluted and not harmful.

AB  - Dioecious alpine juniper has been influenced by human impacts, management and climate changes; hence, its present populations are remnant fragments of its former distribution in central Europe. Complex environmental shifts have had fatal consequences for growth, reproduction and health of juniper and hence for its population structure. We asked the questions: 1) what was the population size structure, the sex ratio and the health status of individuals? 2) How were the population parameters linked with the environmental conditions and surrounding vegetation? The study area was close and above the upper forest limit in central Europe, the Hruby Jesenik Mts. The parameters of each juniper individual and its environmental conditions were obtained, Ellenberg's indicator values and habitat categories were also determined. Proportions of sex categories, shrub size and environmental conditions were investigated to assess relationships between the population categories and environmental factors. We revealed linkage among the shrub size, health vigor, vegetation cover, a habitat and environmental factors. While there was equal ratio of females and males (1:1), small individuals of undetermined sex predominated that reducing the effective population size. Juniper health vigor was associated with surrounding vegetation cover. Individuals of undetermined sex were smaller than those of remaining sex categories and prefer specific habitats at higher elevation, underlining the effect of abiotic conditions on sex performance and ratio. The observed pattern, which was attributed to shift in land-use practices in the middle of 20th century and climate changes, could be improved by management.

AB  - The Japanese Rose (Rosa rugosa) an invasive neophyte in Europe, builds LIP large dominant shrublands especially in coastal areas. To describe the vegetation invaded by R. rugosa 383 releves out of NW Europe with R. rugosa were collected from literature and from vegetation databases. Different plant communities were evaluated by TWINSPAN classification, and two main groups were distinguished: wood- and Shrublands, grass- and heathlands. Rosa rugosa builds up dominant stands that are assigned to the corresponding higher syntaxon. The main variation in vegetation composition Was Studied with a Detrended Correspondence Analysis and related to Ellenberg indicator values. Furthermore, Ellenberg indicator values were used to compare the environmental conditions in different plant communities containing Rosa rugosa. Environmental conditions changed with the development and spread of R. rugosa. Effects of R. rugosa Invasion on species richness of different lifeform groups, native species and neophytes were analysed.
   The study shows, that the expansion of R. rugosa changes the species composition of the invaded vegetation. Species richness, especially of herbaceous plants, decreased with increasing cover of R. rugosa. Furthermore, Rosa dominated plots have a higher percentage number of neophytes and a lower percentage number of native species than the corresponding not invaded plant communities. In comparison to its native range, R. rugosa establishes In various plant communities, at a wide range of environmental conditions. Therefore it appears that the shrub has a broader environmental niche in its new range. According to the presented environmental gradient, moderate conditions of nutrients, soil pH and water content, and both lighter and dryer sites were preferred. Considering environmental requirements, open dry grasslands as well as heathlands especially with bare patches arc probably very endangered by R. rugosa invasion.

AB  - Multivariate analyses of a large set of physical, chemical, and biological measurements indicated possible effects that specific surface water properties have on biotransformation rates of pesticides. In this study, we investigated the roles of Mg, Mn, and P, which were identified as relevant, discriminating environmental variables in the overall biotransformation process as it occurred under nitrifying conditions. Nematicide aldicarb, herbicides simazine and MCPA were selected as their chemical group representatives. Series of mechanically aerated incubation vessels were set up to test nutrient enrichment effects on microbial development and subsequent pesticide transformation. Accounting for alterations in system conditions, relevant (physico)chemical characteristics were monitored. An increase in total microbial population was observed in surface water samples in the presence of both aldicarb and simazine. No increase was observed when MCPA was added, which was probably cometabolized. Large phosphorus concentrations not only favored bacterial growth, but also increased the residence time of dissolved Mn which under certain conditions promoted biotransformation. Furthermore, PO4 enrichment decreases aldicarb's aerobic metabolites' concentrations. Simazine was persistent over a period of at least 80 days, except for a short period coinciding with the nitrification period in which NH4+ dissipates and NO2 and NO3- are formed. Selective bacterial growth was observed on simazine's transformation product DES. Relationships of Mg/Mn concentrations to MCPA transformation rates, and of PO4/P-T concentrations to aldicarb transformation rates, are presented. These relationships are assessed as environmental indicators for potential biotransformation, but only under conditions warranting development and growth of a degrading population over a prolonged period.

AB  - In this study, the influence of soil and atmosphere conditions on noon and basal leaf water potential of vines "Touriga Nacional" in the Do region submitted to different irrigation treatments is analysed. Both indicators showed to be dependent on environmental conditions at the time of measurement. Leaf water potential at noon of fully watered plants was linearly related with atmospheric conditions, with values registered when vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was higher than approximately 3 kPa being no different from the values registered in stressed plants. Therefore, this indicator cannot be reliably used to distinguish different plant water stress levels when atmospheric conditions induce high evaporative demands. The basal leaf water potential (psi(b)) was also influenced by VPD at the time of measurement for all soil water conditions. In well irrigated plants, it was even possible to establish a baseline that can therefore be used to identify nonwater stressed conditions (psi(b) (MPa) = -0.062-0.0972 VPD (kPa), r (2) = 0.78). A good correlation was found between soil humidity and psi(b). However, more than the average value of the whole thickness of soil monitored, the psi(b) values were dependent on the distribution of soil humidity, with the plants responding to the presence of wet layers.

AB  - Wildfires are a major concern around the globe because of the immediate impact they have on people's lives, local ecosystems, and the environment. Soil moisture is one of the most important factors that influence wildfire occurrences and spread. However, it is also one of the most challenging hydrological variables to measure routinely and accurately. Therefore, soil moisture is significantly underutilized in operational wildfire risk applications. Thus, the aim here is to use a well-established operational soil moisture product to isolate the soil moisture-fire relationship and assess the utility of using soil moisture as a leading indicator of potential fire risk. We evaluated the value of remotely-sensed soil moisture observations from the soil moisture active passive sensor for monitoring and predicting fire risk in Australia and California. We quantified the relationship between observed fire activity and soil moisture conditions and analyzed the soil moisture conditions for two extreme fire events. Our findings show that fire activity is strongly associated with soil moisture anomalies. Lagged correlation analysis demonstrated that a remote-sensing based soil moisture product could predict fire activity with a 1-2 month lead-time. Soil moisture anomalies consistently decreased in the months preceding fire occurrence, often from normal to drier conditions, according to a spatiotemporal analysis of soil moisture in two extreme fire events. Overall, our findings indicate that soil moisture conditions prior to large wildfires can aid in their prediction and operational satellite-based soil moisture products such as the one used here have real value for supporting wildfire susceptibility and impacts.

AB  - The vegetation, environment, and ecological gradients present on three calcareous mires in the South Park valley, Park County, Colorado, were investigated. Vegetation was classified into four habitat classes, nine subclasses, and twelve species associations using two-way species indicator analysis (TWINSPAN). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to ordinate vegetation samples along two axes representing the three predominant ecological gradients: water table height, miremargin to expanse, and region. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to directly relate local environmental conditions to vegetation. Water table depth, microtopographical development, soil and water pH and nutrient level, soil organic matter, and hydraulic head were significantly correlated with vegetation gradients. The mire soils consist of intermixed areas of organic and mineral soils. Mire soils and water are highly alkaline and nutrient-rich. Mean pore water calcium concentration on these mires is 115 mg/L, electrical conductivity averages 575 muS, and mean pH is 7.4. Owing to these conditions, the fen floras include a number of highly minerophilic species. Based on water chemistry and species criteria, each site was classified as rich to extremely rich fen, with the two fen types mixing in complex patterns according to local environmental conditions. The species Trichophorum pumilum, Salix candida, Salix myrtillifolia, Carex microglochin, Carex viridula, Carex scirpoidea, Eriophorum gracile, Triglochin maritimum, Triglochin palustris, Kobresia myosuroides, Kobresia simpliciuscula, Thalictrum alpinum, Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium turgescens, and Calliergon trifarium were determined to be indicative of extremely rich fen conditions in the southern Rocky Mountains.

AB  - Characterizing how resource use and management activities affect ecological conditions is necessary to document and understand anthropogenic changes in ecological systems. Resource managers on military installations have the delicate task of balancing the training needs of soldiers effectively with the need to maintain a high quality of ecological conditions. This study considers ways that ecological indicators can provide information on impacts that training has on environmental characteristics that occur at different scales and in different sectors of the environment. The characteristics examined include soil chemistry, soil microbes, and vegetation. A discriminant function analysis was conducted to determine whether ecological indicators could differentiate among different levels of military use. A combination of 10 indicators explained 90% of the variation among plots from five different military use levels. Results indicated that an appropriate suite of ecological indicators for military resource managers includes soil, microbial, and vegetation characteristics. Since many of these indicators are related, managers at this location potentially have freedom to choose indicators that are relatively easy to measure, without sacrificing information.

AB  - We examined the feeding ecology and lipid composition of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba around the northern Antarctic Peninsula from 2001 to 2012. We used lipid biomarkers to quantify feeding patterns and relate the variability in biomarkers to environmental conditions that structure the phytoplankton community. Fatty acid profiles varied among years, with some years dominated by lipids indicative of herbivory, while other years were indicative of greater omnivory. Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient. Correlations between the gradient of herbivory and carnivory, as summarized by the first PC, were found with both winter sea ice extent (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and with ENSO conditions the previous winter (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that climatic conditions during the late winter precondition the pelagic ecosystem around the Antarctic Peninsula, impacting the trophic ecology of Antarctic krill the following summer.

AB  - Background: Glucocorticoid hormones are known to play a key role in mediating a cascade of physiological responses to social and ecological stressors and can therefore influence animals' behaviour and ultimately fitness. Yet, how glucocorticoid levels are associated with reproductive success or survival in a natural setting has received little empirical attention so far. Here, we examined links between survival and levels of glucocorticoid in a small, short-lived primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), using for the first time an indicator of long-term stress load (hair cortisol concentration). Using a capture-mark-recapture modelling approach, we assessed the effect of stress on survival in a broad context (semi-annual rates), but also under a specific period of high energetic demands during the reproductive season. We further assessed the power of other commonly used health indicators (body condition and parasitism) in predicting survival outcomes relative to the effect of long-term stress.
   Results: We found that high levels of hair cortisol were associated with reduced survival probabilities both at the semi-annual scale and over the reproductive season. Additionally, very good body condition (measured as scaled mass index) was related to increased survival at the semi-annual scale, but not during the breeding season. In contrast, variation in parasitism failed to predict survival.
   Conclusion: Altogether, our results indicate that long-term increased glucocorticoid levels can be related to survival and hence population dynamics, and suggest differential strength of selection acting on glucocorticoids, body condition, and parasite infection.

AB  - The rate of degradation of enrofloxacin in broiler chicken manure has been characterised. Its degradation was investigated in manure excreted by broiler chickens in an intensively reared chicken facility; further, the degradation also followed after transfer of the excreta into the natural environment occurred. The effect of enrofloxacin and its degradation products on cucumber and tomato was also investigated. Enrofloxacin degradation was shown to take place within the rearing facility and also continuing after the manure was transferred into the environment. The rates of enrofloxacin degradation and the degree of degradation product formation in the manure heap incubated in the environment were condition specific, both variables depending on the manure sampling depth. The degradation half-lives ranged from 12.7 to 38.1 days for enrofloxacin and from 1.2 to 8.2 days for the main metabolite ciprofloxacin. Only the cucumber showed signs of toxicity when incubated with the composted manure immediately after transfer into field occurred (t = 0). No toxic effects to plants were observed when manure from the last incubation day (60th) of the field study and manure from the last incubation day of the laboratory degradation study were applied. The degradation study under field conditions showed that enrofloxacin and its degradation products degrade fast in the environment. Additionally, the toxic effects to plants decrease with the incubation time of manure containing enrofloxacin residuals.

AB  - Net-cage fish farms attract a great number of wild fishes, altering their behaviour and possibly their physiology. Wild Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus), sampled from populations aggregated around two Mediterranean fish farms and from two natural control populations, were analyzed for differences in body condition, stomach content and fatty acid composition. Pellets used to feed caged fish in both farms were also analyzed to identify their relationship with the fatty acid composition of tissue of wild fish. T mediterraneus aggregated around the farms throughout the year although large seasonal changes in abundance and biomass occurred. Wild fish aggregated at farms mainly ate food pellets while control fish fed principally on juvenile fish and cephalopods. Wild fish that fed around the cages had a significantly higher body fat content than the control fish (7.30 +/- 1.8% and 2.36 +/- 0.7%, respectively). The fatty acid composition also differed between farm-associated and control fish, principally because of the significantly increased levels of linoleic (C18:2 omega 6) and oleic (C18:1 omega 9) acids and decreased docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 omega 3) in farm-associated fish. The increased condition of wild fish associated with farms could increase the spawning ability of coastal fish populations, if wild fish are protected from fishing while they are present at farms. The fatty acids compositions could also serve as biomarkers to infer the influence of a fish farm on the local fish community, helping to better describe the environmental impact of fish farming.

AB  - We studied the restoration success of flood plain meadows in the northern Upper Rhine valley, where between 1988 and 1992, 35 ha of arable land was converted into grassland and subsequently managed for nature conservation.
   Remnant populations of typical alluvial meadow species were found in old meadows and along drainage ditches that dissect the whole area. We analysed the site conditions and phytosociological releves in old and new meadows. Small differences in site parameters between old and new meadows contrasted with a clear floristic differentiation between the two meadow types. The vegetation of old meadows was much more differentiated along prevailing environmental gradients than the vegetation of new meadows. Despite the favourable site conditions for the re-establishment of species-rich meadows on the former arable land, restoration success was limited to the vicinity of remnant stands. In contrast to old meadows, indicator species of new grassland were still typical species of regularly disturbed ruderal and arable habitats, often capable of building up a persistent seed bank.
   The precise mapping of 23 target species revealed that even wind dispersal predominantly leads to re-establishment in the close circumference of parent plants. We found no indication that regular flooding, hay-making and autumnal grazing had an impact on recolonization of newly created grassland. Even under favourable conditions for the re-establishment of target species, restoration success in alluvial meadows proved to be strongly dispersal limited. We discuss the implications of our findings for future restoration management in grasslands.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The bivalve Corbula gibber (Olivi,1792) (Corbulidae, Bivalvia) inhabits various benthic communities, including communities in some polluted areas. Therefore Corbula has been proclaimed as a species of wide ecological distribution and an indicator species of environmental instability Benthic moss mortality in the north ern Adriatic Sea in 1989 was caused by lack of oxygen near the bottom layer Corbula: and several oxygen resistant macrobenthic species survived. In this paper we considered the results of Corbula respiration and behaviour studies in order to better understand its survival mechanisms in extreme oxygen conditions.
   Material and Methods: At first the number of boreholes on Corbula. shells done by naticid gastropods was inspected. Then, burrowing behaviour was controlled in several laboratory experiments. Finally Corbula oxygen consumption was measured by "closed bottle" respirometer under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and lactate concentration accumulated in tissue after the certain period of anoxia.
   Results and Conclusion: The laboratory experiments showed that Corbula moved on the sediment surface before burrowing and that once burrowed individuals often changed their position in the sediment. It was also established that burrowing and moving processes depended on illumination (light/dark) and not on diurnal rhythm (day/ night) because movements and burrowing occured during the night time and also during the day time, but in the dark. In the laboratory anoxic conditions Corbula switched to anaerobic metabolism, by an increase in tissue lactate concentration. After their return to normoxic conditions Corbula increased oxygen consumption for certain period of time to break down the accumulated anaerobic metabolites.

AB  - PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the prevalence of both diabetes-concordant and diabetes-discordant conditions and the quality of diabetes care at the family practice level in England. We hypothesized that the prevalence of concordant (or discordant) conditions would be associated with better (or worse) quality of diabetes care.
   METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study using practice-level data (7,884 practices). We estimated the practice-level prevalence of diabetes and 15 other chronic conditions, which were classified as diabetes concordant (ie, with the same pathophysiologic risk profile and therefore more likely to be part of the same management plan) or diabetes discordant (ie, not directly related in either their pathogenesis or management). We measured quality of diabetes care with diabetes-specific indicators (8 processes and 3 intermediate outcomes of care). We used linear regression models to quantify the effect of the prevalence of the conditions on aggregate achievement rate for quality of diabetes care.
   RESULTS Consistent with the proposed model, the prevalence rates of 4 of 7 concordant conditions (obesity, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure) were positively associated with quality of diabetes care. Similarly, negative associations were observed as predicted for 2 of the 8 discordant conditions (epilepsy, mental health). Observations for other concordant and discordant conditions did not match predictions in the hypothesized model.
   CONCLUSIONS The quality of diabetes care provided in English family practices is associated with the prevalence of other major chronic conditions at the practice level. The nature and direction of the observed associations cannot be fully explained by the concordant-discordant model.
