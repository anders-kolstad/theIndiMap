AB  - The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) system that extends from Pence DeLeon Inlet to Jupiter Inlet is comprised of three interconnected estuarine lagoons: the Mosquito Lagoon (ML), the Banana River Lagoon (BRL), and the Indian River Lagoon (subdivided into North Indian River Lagoon, NIRL and the South Indian River Lagoon, SIRL). The declines in both the areal coverage and species diversity of seagrass communities within the IRL system are believed to be due in part to continued degradation of water quality. Large inflows of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) -laden storm-water from urban areas and agricultural land have been correlated with higher chlorophyll a production in the central, south central, and the south segments of the lagoon. in a system as large and complex as the lagoon, N and P limitations are potentially subject to significant spatial and temporal variability Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TN) was higher in the north (1.25 mg/liter) and lower in the south (0.89 mg/liter). The reverse pattern was observed for total P (TP), i.e., lowest in the north (0.03 mg/liter) and highest at the south (0.14 mg/liter) ends of the IRL. This increased P concentration in the SIRL appears to have a significantly large effect on chlorophyll a production compared with the other segments, as indicated by stepwise regression statistics. This relationship can be expressed as follows. South IRL [chlorophyll a] = -8.52 + 162.41 [orthophosphate] + 7.86 [total nitrogen] + 0.38 [turbidity]; R-2 = 0.98**.

AB  - Turning from linear to circular business model, from cradle-to-grave to cradle-to-cradle and from waste to wealth, the concept of circular economy (CE) has become an important tool to promote sustainable development as it combines economic, environmental and social benefits at a local as well as global scale. In the shift towards CE, examining the CE from the perspective of its potential is crucial for its wider and more effective implementation in the practice. The aim of the paper is to clarify a circularity phenomenon in closed-loop economy under the notion of potential in part of (1) the structural elements, (2) underlying categories and (3) basal properties as a follow-up to the previous studies about managing the circularity potential. The study provides the theoretical framework for understanding circularity potential by developing the circularity potential categorization in order to get a comprehensive picture of what has been done in the past and where efforts are most need today to achieve a progress towards circularity in the future. The basal properties of circularity potential such as integrity, dynamism, territorial affiliation and different strategies compatibility were revealed and discussed for managing the circularity potential. The findings of the paper have ambition to contribute to new metrics development to measure the progress towards zero-waste and CE aimed at identification and monitoring all the possible forms of the circularity potential - opportunities, reserves, available resources, rather than the available resources only that were primarily considered in the past attempts at the operationalisation of circular economy.

AB  - Part 1 of this paper described a specimen for the measurement of high strain rate flow and fracture properties of pipe material and for tuning a strain rate dependent damage model (SRDD). In part 2 the tuned SRDD model is used for the simulation of axial crack propagation and arrest in X100 natural gas pipelines. Linear pressure drop model was adopted behind the crack tip, and an exponential gas depressurisation model was used ahead of the crack tip. The model correctly predicted the crack initiation (burst) pressure, the crack speed and the crack arrest length. Strain rates between 1000 s(-1) and 3000 s-1 immediately ahead of the crack tip are predicted, giving a strong indication that a strain rate material model is required for the structural integrity assessment of the natural gas pipelines. The models predict the stress triaxiality of about 0.65 for at least 1 m ahead of the crack tip, gradually dropping to 0.5 at distances of about 5-7 m ahead of the crack tip. Finally, the models predicted a linear drop in crack tip opening angle (CTOA) from about 11-12 degrees at the onset of crack propagation down to 7-8 degrees at crack arrest. Only the lower of these values agree with those reported in the literature for quasistatic measurements. This discrepancy might indicate substantial strain rate dependence in CTOA.

AB  - Although synergies between reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation are generally expected, they will not be achieved through poorly designed REDD+ schemes. Perceptions of actors in REDD+ implementation processes can guide the design of appropriate policies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Peru with actors in REDD+ working groups at the national and subnational level (n = 50) to explore how they relate REDD+ implementation to biodiversity conservation and other policy issues, and to identify the aspects of biodiversity they regard as especially important (biodiversity conservation values). Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis; actors' statements were summarised into nine policy issue categories. Issues raised often were related to governance, socioeconomic aspects and land management in REDD+ implementation (47 % of the statements). Biodiversity issues were mentioned less often (23 %). Direct synergies between REDD+ and biodiversity conservation were assumed by most actors and few concrete risks and corresponding safeguards were mentioned. Actors mentioned 177 biodiversity conservation values, which were classified into different value types. Most values were aspects of biodiversity with direct or indirect use values (68 %). Aspects which potentially provide future benefits (option values) or resilience values were mentioned less often (5 and 16 %, respectively). The opportunity to foster conservation of use values as additional benefits from REDD+ is generally recognised by the actors, but aspects of biodiversity that are important for the long-term integrity of forest ecosystems received less attention. It is thus important to push for the integration of respective safeguards in REDD+ strategies.

AB  - Habitat destruction is one of the main threats to environmental integrity. Assessing the consequences of human impacts is crucial both to predict and prevent structural and functional changes of habitats. However, to date almost all studies on marine threats, from regional to global scales, have been entirely qualitative and generally based on little more than expert opinion. We have developed a meta-analytical approach to quantify overall effects of various stressors on different Mediterranean habitat types and to compare the relative importance of different impacts across a range of habitats. We first qualitatively reviewed and synthesized 366 experiments (either manipulative or correlative) collected in the literature. After a selection procedure, we finally quantitatively meta-analyzed 158 experiments. We showed that fisheries (destructive or not), species invasion, aquaculture, sedimentation increase, water degradation and urbanization have negative effects on Mediterranean habitats and associated species assemblages. We also explored the overlap between the impacts identified as important in the Mediterranean and those identified by experts as being important globally, highlighting the inadequacies of relying on expert opinion alone. Finally, we drew attention to the critical lack of empirical knowledge about marine systems in many areas of the Mediterranean, which impedes the implementation of effective conservation measures. Our study is the first to synthesize experimental analyses on human-driven impacts on marine habitats across such a broad geographic scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dominant grasses in a wetland are of critical concern for the wetland's ecological integrity, because these species provide the habitats for many small plants and animals. In this study, we used hyperspectral imagery to map the distributions of two dominant tall grasses (Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Benth and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Stend) in the Watarase wetland, in central Japan. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was applied to the hyperspectral data to predict the shoot density and biomass of the two grasses. The independent data sets included original reflectance, band ratios, significant components identified by principal components analysis (PCA), and significant components identified by decision boundary feature extraction (DBFE). The coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of model calibration and validation were used to evaluate the models. The significant DBFE components showed better ability at predicting shoot density of the two grasses than the other variables in the validating areas. The RMSE values were 7.40/m(2) for M. sacchariflorus and 13.09/m(2) for P. australis, which amounted to errors of around 10.0% and 12.6%, respectively, of the maximum shoot density measured during our surveys. All variables showed similar performance at predicting biomass, but the results were less accurate than those for shoot density. Considering the performance of the DBFE components for both shoot density and biomass prediction, we suggest that these are the best indicators for estimating the abundance of the two grasses.

AB  - Primary culture of chicken embryo hepatocytes (CEHs) was established to reveal toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and attenuating effects of antioxidants vitamin E (VE), vitamin C (VC) and vitamin A (VA) on PCBs-induced cytotoxicity. CEHs were dispersed from 14-day-old chicken embryo livers and exposed to Aroclor 1254 (A1254) in the range of 0.1-10 mu g/ml, A1254 (10 mu g/ml) and each vitamin (10 mu g/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated by determinations of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. The antioxidant status, namely cellular lipid peroxidation, was evaluated by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and glutathion (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. The cultured CEHs maintained normal polygonal cell shape and formed confluent monolayer after 24-h culture. A1254 (10 mu g/ml) caused irreversible damage to cell membrane integrity and induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. It induced increased TBARS production, decreased SOD activity and GSH concentration. VE, VC and VA alone or combinations of VE + VC and VE + VA significantly attenuated A1254-induced toxic effects, which suggested that lipid peroxidation was involved in-the sequence of events leading to A1254-induced damage or death of the cultured CEHs. These results indicated that CEHs in serum-free culture represented a suitable model for rapid toxicity assessment of environmental pollutants such as PCBs in a visible manner. Antioxidant vitamins displayed protective effects on CEHs from A1254-induced damage through preventing lipid peroxidation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of microemulsions prepared from glycerol monocaprylocaprate (Capmul MCM), non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80), and phosphate buffer loaded with beta-carotene extracted from carrot pomace, to human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells and to determine if non-cytotoxic concentrations of the natural beta-carotene loaded microemulsion could protect Caco-2 cells from oxidative damage caused by exposure to H2O2. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to determine mitochondria functionality and cell membrane integrity, respectively, both of which are commonly used to evaluate cell viability. In addition nitride oxide level was measured as a general indicator of cellular disruption and inflammation. Cytotoxicity of the formulations significantly decreased when lowering the microemulsion concentration. Increasing the cytotoxicity of microemulsions at concentrations higher than 0.0313% (Tween 80 concentration of 0.006%) might be the result of Tween 80 precipitation on the cell culture monolayer, and beta-carotene loaded in the microemulsion did not appear to protect cells from Tween 80 associated damage. However, a beta-carotene loaded microemulsion concentration of 0.0313% gave bioprotection to cells suffering oxidative damage caused by H2O2. These results show the potential of using natural beta-carotene microemulsion as a delivery system at a safe level of Tween 80 for application in pharmaceutical and food sciences.

AB  - A feature of the developing Precambrian palaeomagnetic record is the recognition that unique configurations appear to apply to large continental shields for protracted periods of time, with quasi-integrity providing a general explanation for the distinctive geological and geochemical signatures of continentality that characterise the Proterozoic Eon of Earth history (2.5-0.542 Ga). This paper evaluates the palaeomagnetic evidence for the Palaeopangaean reconstruction during the latter part of this eon. It uses a comprehensive summary of poles assigned to the interval similar to 1.3-0.6 Ga to demonstrate that the records from diverse shields conform to an apparent polar wander path (APWP) comprising tracks of 100-200 Myr duration forming the limbs of tight elongate loops. These comprise the Gardar Track (similar to 1.3-1.14 Ga), the Keweenawan Track (similar to 1.14-1.04 Ga), the Grenville-Sveconorwegian Loop (similar to 1.14-0.85 Ga) and the Franklin-Adelaide Track (similar to 0.8-0.6 Ga). The latter terminates in a protracted quasi-static interval between similar to 0.75 and 0.6 Ga indicating that Plate Tectonics, and an associated input from the Earth's internal heat budget, nearly ceased during the interval embracing widespread glaciation. The subsequent continental break-up was characterised by large scale release of accumulated heat from beneath the continental lid and was expressed by rapid continental movements and major crustal growth at similar to 0.6 Ga. The strength of the Palaeopangaean analysis lies in the invariance of the rotational operations over such a long interval of geological history, and the geological and geophysical relevance of the reconstruction. Data from a number of disparate shields indicate that the crust was still integral in the Palaeopangaean configuration by the time of the Marinoan glaciations similar to 0.6 Ga ago. After this time the APW paths explicitly scatter in the signature of continental break-up between similar to 0.6 and 0.55 Ga and during this latter interval it is not yet possible to define any APWPs with confidence. A range of environmental indicators and the subsidence history of passive marine margins conform to the palaeomagnetic chronology by being focussed between similar to 620 and 550 Ma and comprising the predicted signature of global continental break-up. The geometrical form of Palaeopangaea was similar to (Neo)Pangaea and to a putative Late Archaean-Early Proterozoic supercontinent (Protopangaea) in being symmetrical, crescent shaped, and confined to a hemisphere on the globe. The aggregation of continental crust into a form comparable to the longest wavelength component of the present day geoid indicates a link to whole-mantle convection. This is reinforced by the progressive contraction of the mid-Proterozoic anorogenic magmatism and late Proterozoic arc magmatism towards the inner arc of the crescent. The APW tracks executed during Meso-Proterozoic times moved successively out from, and back towards, a metastable position close to the geometrical centre of the continental crust. The rates of APW were <1.5 degrees/Ma and compatible with those predicted from protracted long-arc True Polar Wander. The selective sampling of a geocentric dipole field by an arcuate and symmetric continental crust centred on this position also provides an explanation for the low latitude magnetic inclination bias which is observed during Proterozoic times.

AB  - The reproductive cycle, sex distribution, and gonadal characteristics of the flame scallop, Ctenoides scaber, formerly Lima scabra scabra (Born 1778), collected from Boca Chica Key, FL, were investigated over the 21-mo period from January 1998 through September 1999. Gametogenic cycles were examined using qualitative and quantitative methods, and the relationships between those observations and environmental conditions (e.g., water temperature, salinity and phytoplankton concentrations) were analyzed. The relationships between sex, gonad color and shell height were also examined. Gamete development in both sexes was initiated in winter and was associated with small oocytes and follicles, cool water temperatures and moderate concentrations of food. Growth of gametes occurred throughout spring, as temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations increased. A partial synchronous spawn occurred in early summer but did not seem to be related to environmental conditions. Maximum gamete ripeness and size occurred in late summer, when water temperatures were at maximum values and food densities were increasing. Decreases in female gamete and follicle sizes and increases in occurrence of partially spawned, spent and early growth gonads in autumn were suggestive of synchronous spawning, which coincided with a rapid decrease in water temperature and maximum measured chlorophyll-a concentrations. Decreases in oocyte size in February coincided with annual water temperature minimums and may represent the conversion of energy from reproduction to survival, and not spawning. The presence throughout the year of juveniles, ripe and partially spawned flame scallops and chlorophyll-a concentrations sufficient to support gamete development suggest a reproductive strategy of continuous spawning, common in tropical marine invertebrates. No relationship was detected between salinity and gonad condition. Flame scallops collected for this study ranged in size from 21-68 into shell height (SH) and those > 25 mm SH had gamete development. The smallest animals were found principally in summer, which suggests a massive synchronous spawning event. Analyzing sex distribution by SH showed that flame scallops are protandric sequential hermaphrodites. Flame scallops < 40 mm SH were predominantly male (83%) those >= 40 mm SH were mostly female (71%) and 4% were in sexual transition near 40 turn SH. The sex ratio for the sampled population was 0.63M:1F. Histologic examination of fresh gonadal tissues revealed that female gonads were predominantly purple (96%) and male gonads were predominantly cream-colored (91%). Other gonad colors observed were not reliable indicators of sex nor was there a clearly defined association between color and those animals in sexual transition. Documenting the reproductive cycle of Ctenoides scaber in the existing Florida fishery is the first logical step to understanding its life history. Because flame scallops are important to the marine aquarium industry in the United States and are a potential food source for humans, it is important that we understand the reproductive cycle of this species to ensure proper management policies. This study provides basic information applicable to mariculture of flame scallops for commercial production to supplement the harvest of wild stock for the marine aquarium industry.

AB  - Early Permian strata exposed in the southern part of the Sydney Basin, NSW, Australia, include the Pebbley Beach Formation, the Snapper Point Formation and the Wandrawandian Siltstone. These formations were deposited during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, when Australia was close to the South Pole. The Pebbley Beach and Snapper Point formations were deposited in shallow marine to coastal environments, while the Wandrawandian Siltstone was deposited in deeper water following a marine transgression. However, opinions differ on the precise environmental and climatic conditions that prevailed during their deposition. Sixteen outcrop samples from these formations were collected and analysed to determine their depositional conditions and the source(s) of their organic matter.
   The biomarker and aromatic hydrocarbon distributions show that the rocks are in the early to mid-oil window. Some aromatic parameters show that the stratigraphically younger Wandrawandian Siltstone is more thermally mature than the older Pebbley Beach Formation, which is interpreted to be due to the geographic position of these outcrops in the Sydney Basin. The samples have low to intermediate pristane/phytane ratios (from 1.4 to 3.4), showing variation from oxic to suboxic depositional conditions. Most of the mudstones and siltstones sampled were deposited in a marine environment, with some fluvial-deltaic or estuarine influence, and contain mixed type II and type III organic matter. The Pebbley Beach formation is characterised by terpane distributions dominated by the C-24 tetracyclic terpane, and to a lesser extent the C-19 tricyclic terpane. The Snapper Point Formation has a mix of C-19 and C-23 tricyclic terpanes and C-24 tetracyclic terpane, while the Wandrawandian Siltstone is dominated by C-19, C-21, and C-23 tricyclic terpanes. The sterane distribution follows a C-29 > C-28 > C-27 pattern in the majority of the samples, including in the marine deposited Wandrawandian Siltstone. The three formations have very variable relative amounts of diahopanes and other rearranged hopanes, with the highest C-30*/C-30 alpha beta hopane ratio (6.9) in the Wandrawandian Siltstone. This formation also has high amounts of diasteranes compared to the other two formations, but the relative amounts of diasteranes are not as high as for the diahopanes. Classically, this suggests a clay-rich sediment in an oxic or suboxic, acid-catalysed depositional environment, with enhanced diagenetic alteration of the biomarkers. The Wandrawandian Siltstone was deposited in suboxic conditions, not unusual to many rocks that contain much less rearranged hopanes. Unusual characteristics of the Wandrawandian Siltstone include significant slumping and soft sediment deformation, and deposition under periglacial-glacial conditions. The occurrence of the slumps on the continental slope led to significant sediment overturn, and this may have resulted in enhanced diagenetic and catalytic rearrangement reactions, leading to the elevated levels of diahopanes and other rearranged hopanes. The disequilibrium between the relative abundances of diahopanes and diasteranes suggests different formation mechanisms for these biomarkers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development of more nitrogen (N) efficient maize (Zea mays L) varieties capable of producing higher maize grain yields under conditions of low soil N supply could improve the livelihoods of smallholder subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa who cultivate infertile soils and are unable to purchase fertilizer inputs due to lack of access or cash constraints. A previous study found that increased grain yield under N stress was associated with higher post-anthesis N uptake, grain production per unit N accumulation and N harvest index. This study examines the underlying physiological mechanisms as well as root morphological differences as they affect N efficiency.
   Sixteen hybrids with contrasting N-efficiency were evaluated under a range of soil N fertility levels at Harare, Zimbabwe, in 2003 and 2004 and Kiboko, Kenya, in 2003 for grain yield, harvest index, ears per plant, kernel number per ear, kernel weight, kernels per row, kernel row number and grain carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio as well as anthesis-silking interval and indicators of photosynthetic efficiency during grain filling. Differences in root-system size (estimated by root electrical capacitance), root density and distribution (estimated by coring), and soil mineral N depletion were assessed between contrasting hybrids.
   There was considerable genetic variability in yield components and dry matter partitioning among the hybrids under all N conditions and a strong relationship between N efficiency and dry matter partitioning. Significant hybrid-by-environment interactions indicated that increasing harvest index under high-N conditions may not increase harvest index under low-N conditions. The N-efficient hybrids were characterized by a lower anthesis-silking interval, higher dry matter production during grain filling, higher kernel number and relatively higher grain C/N ratio under limited N supply compared with inefficient hybrids. These hybrids were also associated with stay-green characteristics in that they maintained more green leaves, and had lower leaf senescence and higher leaf chlorophyll content during and after flowering. This may imply a higher photoassimilate supply in the N-efficient hybrids during and after flowering under low-N conditions.
   Between two contrasting hybrids, an N-efficient hybrid had greater root-length density in, and depleted more mineral-N from the surface soil layer than an N-inefficient hybrid. Although there was significant variation between hybrids, total root-system size was not significantly related to N efficiency indicating that selection for improved performance under low-N did not increase total root-system size in tropical maize. Although this study found a relationship between root-length density, soil mineral N depletion and plant N efficiency, the effects were not sufficiently compelling to conclude that they are causative factors.

AB  - The Late Pleistocene (similar to 21,000 yr BP) Alberca de Guadalupe maar is one of the few phreatomagmatic volcanoes occurring within the scoria-cone dominated Plio-Quaternary Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field. The scarcity of this type of volcano implies that conditions favoring their formation are rarely met in this region. We identify these factors by implementing current methods of investigation with emphasis on hydrogeological conditions. We present the stratigraphy (including a set of Ar-40/Ar-39 and C-14 dates) of the SE margin of the Zacapu intermontane tectonic basin, where the maar just forms a hole (similar to 1 km in diameter, similar to 150 m deep, bearing a similar to 9 m deep lake) in the otherwise planar topography of the underlying early Pleistocene lava flows of the Cerro Pelon scoria cone. The maar is composed of typical phreatomagmatic surge deposits that are poorly sorted and rich in accidental lithics (>60 wt.% of the deposit) with few juveniles (basaltic andesite, SiO2 = 54-58 wt.%). The entire structure is cut by an ENE-WSW trending normal fault and is underlain by andesite lavas and silicic ignimbrites (partly inferred from xenoliths encountered in the maar deposits) that are Miocene to Early Pleistocene in age. The crater is at the center of a N-S elongated drainage basin surrounded by topographic highlands that channel water with high hydraulic pressure from most directions towards the location of the mar. This geometric configuration was already in existence at the time of the maar-forming eruption, but the climate was different. Colder and more humid conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (Cw2-climate type, annual precipitation of >1000 mm) favored the saturation of the fractured shallow aquifer system (hydraulic conductivity of 10(-8) to 10(-7) m/s) that supplied sufficient groundwater at a high flow rate directed towards the center of the basin. Upon contact near surface (<200 m) with the rising dike of basaltic andesite magma, the continuous supply of both dike-fed basaltic andesite magma and groundwater at an optimal ratio of 0.2 allowed explosive interaction for the entire duration of the eruption (17-57 days) creating a >150 m deep crater with steep inner walls and an underlying shallow diatreme (<300 m). Since then, partial collapse of the walls along listric ring-fractures has reduced crater steepness. The present climate is much drier (Cw1 climate conditions with annual precipitation of 697.5-874.8 mm) and it seems unlikely that a maar would form if these conditions persist. Nonetheless, precipitation is still high enough to sustain a similar to 9-m-deep lake in the crater with insignificant seasonal water table fluctuations. These findings lend further support to the notion that maars can be used as paleoclimate indicators in central Mexico. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Body size is sensitive to environmental changes and one of the fundamental traits linking ecological functions. Size structure has been suggested as a useful indicator for environmental monitoring and assessment in aquatic ecosystems. However, the organisms' size structure and the relationship with environmental factors remain seldom addressed in reservoir ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the size spectrum, size diversity of the zooplankton and their relationships with environmental conditions across nitrogen and phosphorus gradients in the Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir, China. We further tested the hypotheses that how nutrient and water temperature affect zooplankton size structure: nutrients indirectly affect zooplankton size spectrum and size diversity via phytoplankton (H1); increasing water temperature will reduce size diversity and result in a steeper size spectrum (H2); size diversity is a more robust metric indicating environment changes than the size spectrum in high dynamic ecosystems (H3). We found that both the size spectrum and size diversity showed high spatiotemporal dynamics. The size spectrum ranged from -3.373 to -0.984. The size diversity ranged from 0.631 to 3.291. Spatially, the lowest values of the size spectrum and size diversity were observed in the upstream areas of Xiangxi Bay, where nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are high and low, respectively. And in temporal dynamics, lower values of the size spectrum and size diversity were generally observed in March and April. Further analyses based on the structural equation model (SEM) found a clear pathway revealing that nutrient variables affect the zooplankton abundance and size structure, supporting hypothesis H1. That is, dissolved inorganic nitrogen had an indirect effect on the zooplankton abundance, size spectrum, and size diversity by influencing the concentration of phytoplankton chlorophyll a. In addition, results of SEM suggested that increased water temperature had a significant negative effect on the size diversity but had non-significant effects on zooplankton abundance and size spectrum. This finding suggests that size diversity is a reliable and useful index in measuring the zooplankton size structure in reservoir ecosystems with high dynamics, which may have a wide application in environmental monitoring and assessment, especially for complex and dynamic aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Marine-continental transitional strata were widely developed in the Ordos Basin in Upper Carboniferous - Lower Permian. The Taiyuan - Shanxi Formation possesses promising shale gas exploration layers. Shale samples from two drilling wells of Shanxi-Taiyuan Formation in Shilou and Xixian, Ordos Basin, were investigated to study their carbon-sulfur contents and distribution characteristics of organic components using carbon/sulfur analyzer and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Using results of total organic carbon analyses, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, shale gas desorption experiments, and other relevant experimental data, the shale samples were comprehensively analyzed. The exploitability of the shale in the study area was evaluated. The Shanxi-Taiyuan Shale in the Shilou and Xixian areas was characterized by high total organic carbon contents of 7.1% and 2.1% and high T-max values of 499 and 505 degrees C, respectively. The organic matter of the shale is types II2 and III. Moreover, biomarker parameters including n-alkanes, P-aq, P-wax, average carbon chain length, and the ternary diagram of C-27-C-28-C-29 steranes show the organic matter constituted terrestrial higher plants and aquatic low biological algae. Multiple n-alkane parameters show the organic matter input in the Shilou area is mainly derived from terrestrial higher plants. The Pr/Ph value and trace element indicators show the deposition environment is dominated by weak oxidation-reduction conditions. A shale gas desorption experiment shows the average desorbed gas contents of the shale samples in the Shilou and Xixian areas were 1.79 and 0.37 m(3)/t, respectively. The organic matter content determined the differences in shale gas properties between the two areas in Ordos Basin. The composition and content of inorganic minerals affect the reservoir physical properties. According to the analyses, the shale in the Shilou area has good shale gas reservoir characteristics in terms of desorbed gas content and the above-mentioned geochemical parameters. Furthermore, the Shanxi shale has good potential for shale gas industrial exploitation.

AB  - Wildfire disturbances can cause modifications in different dimensions of ecosystem functioning, i.e., the flows of matter and energy. There is an increasing need for methods to assess such changes, as functional approaches offer advantages over those focused solely on structural or compositional attributes. In this regard, remote sensing can support indicators for estimating a wide variety of effects of fire on ecosystem functioning, beyond burn severity assessment. These indicators can be described using intra-annual metrics of quantity, seasonality, and timing, called Ecosystem Functioning Attributes (EFAs). Here, we propose a satellite-based framework to evaluate the impacts, at short to medium term (i.e., from the year of fire to the second year after), of wildfires on four dimensions of ecosystem functioning: (i) primary productivity, (ii) vegetation water content, (iii) albedo, and (iv) sensible heat. We illustrated our approach by comparing inter-annual anomalies in satellite-based EFAs in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, from 2000 to 2018. Random Forest models were used to assess the ability of EFAs to discriminate burned vs. unburned areas and to rank the predictive importance of EFAs. Together with effect sizes, this ranking was used to select a parsimonious set of indicators for analyzing the main effects of wildfire disturbances on ecosystem functioning, for both the whole study area (i.e., regional scale), as well as for four selected burned patches with different environmental conditions (i.e., local scale). With both high accuracies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.98) and effect sizes (Cohen's |d| > 0.8), we found important effects on all four dimensions, especially on primary productivity and sensible heat, with the best performance for quantity metrics. Different spatiotemporal patterns of wildfire severity across the selected burned patches for different dimensions further highlighted the importance of considering the multi-dimensional effects of wildfire disturbances on key aspects of ecosystem functioning at different timeframes, which allowed us to diagnose both abrupt and lagged effects. Finally, we discuss the applicability as well as the potential advantages of the proposed approach for more comprehensive assessments of fire severity.

AB  - The classification of river catchments according to their hydrological regime is crucial elements of regionalisation. In absence of hydrological data, the regionalisation of catchment method may be used to asses many flows characteristics like regime or design flow and thus provide help in the analysis of hydrological and ecological processes and also in the management of water resources. Correct clarification of catchments requires knowledge about the main factors that influence on river regime, like meteorologic conditions, land cover/land use, geology, soil properties terrain features, human activities.
   The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between selected catchment attributes along with precipitation climatology and seasonality of mean flows (MQ) in the mountainous rivers in the Upper Vistula basin (the biggest and the most important river in Poland) and regionalisation catchments based on seasonality index. To achieve the objective of the study, we concentrated on the mountain stream and river catchments that are regionalised to the Upper Vistula basin (all of which are Vistula tributaries) and we employed the Colwell's seasonality index in an attempt to clear up the said ecohydrological measures.
   The study confirmed that in mountainous catchments, where response time to rainfall is shorter due to larger slopes, higher seasonality of mean monthly discharges, as expressed by the seasonality index M, is observed. In this case, variability of seasonal rainfall affected seasonality of MQ. In case of smaller slopes and large forest cover and catchment areas, seasonality of flows was lower.
   The innovative aspect of the presented study is the attempt to correlate the Colwell's seasonality index with the physiographic and meteorological characteristics of the catchment. Until now, the characteristics of the catchments have been used as factors differentiating the hydrological regime of the catchments, thus allowing for agglomeration of similar catchments. Our results foster better understanding of the natural processes in the river basin, which definitely would help in better management of the environment and its relationship with huge number of people living there and depend on it. These results show that the regression tree methods based on CART algorithm can be used as effective tool for classification of catchments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An ecological biogeographical perspective provides an understanding of the factors that shape the geographical distribution of organisms, their biodiversity and ecological speciation. Focusing on members of the lichen genus Solenopsora, which are strongly linked to a Mediterranean-type climate, we aimed to depict their environmental niches in the Apennine Peninsula. This area represents their ecological optima, as well as the biogeographical centre of distribution. On the basis of occurrences of Solenopsora congeners, we identified the key ecological factors that shape their environmental niches. Applying an ensemble approach, which merges the results of Random Forest, GLM and MaxEnt algorithms, suitability maps were developed. These are mainly influenced by geological substratum, temperature and precipitation. Occurrence of Solenopsora taxa seems to be mainly governed by low variability in diurnal temperature and tolerance to dryness, with precipitation in the range of 0-20 mm in the driest month and a minimum temperature of >5 degrees C in the coldest month. The sensitivity to diurnal temperature, an important indicator for climate change, suggests that the taxa confined to Mediterranean bioclimatic types (i.e. Solenopsora grisea, S. marina, S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis and S. olivacea subsp. olivacea) might be good indicators of climatic stability. The geological substratum was a strong limiting factor and separated the taxa into three groups: those growing on calcareous, siliceous and ultramafic substrata. Limited co-occurrence of species confined to one of the three categories suggests that the level of niche differentiation is on a microhabitat level. Accounting for ecological requirements, the taxa differ in their tolerance to sub-optimal conditions. The ecological niches of a sister subspecies pair with different reproduction strategies, fertile S. olivacea subsp. olivacea and sorediate S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis, overlap strongly. However, habitat suitability for S. olivacea subsp. olbiensis is greater in areas with higher precipitation in the driest month, whereas S. olivacea subsp. olivacea is more restricted to warmer and drier areas. We also report new regional records for Italy and the first records of S. cesatii in Serbia and Ukraine, and of S. liparina in Serbia.

AB  - Evaluating the state of benthic communities has played an important role in water quality assessments. Indices incorporating species sensitivities, richness and densities are commonly applied. In Europe, the importance of benthic indices has increased in the last years with the implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) which at the same time demands the applicability of an index across regional scales. To date, environmental variability is rarely considered in benthic indices and most sensitivity rankings have the disadvantages of static values (i.e. the same value in all areas), expert judgement and a limited geographical range.
   This study presents species sensitivity values calculated along environmental gradients for the Baltic Sea. Sensitivities were calculated according to the procedure of the Benthic Quality Index (BQI). We created a matrix of subregions, classes of salinity, depth and gear to identify comparable subsets for data analysis. Altogether, 19 subsets were defined within the Baltic Sea basins. Sensitivity values were calculated for 329 species out of a total of 678 species that were recorded in this study. Sensitivity values of taxa vary between subsets as it was expected for different environmental conditions. Most sensitivity values can be assigned to species occurring in euhaline and polyhaline waters. Distribution of species with high and low sensitivity values differed along the salinity gradient. In euhaline waters more species with high sensitivity values occurred than species with low sensitivity values, while in mesohaline waters the ratio of high and low sensitivity values among species was almost equal. In oligohaline waters more species with lower sensitivity values were present.
   For the first time, sensitivity values were calculated for a large number of species using the same method for the entire Baltic Sea. This results in a Baltic-wide comprehensive set of sensitivity values based on a dataset across subregional borders, and divided along environmental gradients and gear type. The same principles can be applied to transient waters from rivers to coastal lagoons as well as to other environments with gradients of, e.g. hydrodynamic characteristics. Publicly available sensitivity values will increase transparency and support the improvement of state assessments under the MSFD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is a trace element essential for the healthy functioning of soil biological systems. However, at elevated concentrations Cu can be a potential toxicant. Consequently, an understanding of Cu availability and toxicity to soil biota is essential for effective ecological assessment of metal impacts in soil. The present study measured the response of a constitutive and Cu specific luminescence marked Pseudomonas fluorescens to Cu analytically determined in five soils.
   Conditioned Cu amended and historically contaminated soils were used. The free ion, soil pore water and solid-phase Cu were defined analytically by standard techniques frequently used to assess environmental availability of metals in soils, i.e. exchange resin, single and sequential metal extractions. The response of the constitutively expressed biosensor (i.e. a decrease in bioluminescence in the presence of Cu) assessed directly the toxicity of soil pore water Cu. The expression of bioluminescence by the bioreporter (i.e. an induction of bioluminescence by the presence of Cu) enabled quantification of Cu bioavailability in soil pore waters. Analytically determined Cu(2+) concentrations strongly linked Cu toxicity to the biosensor responses and thus supported the conventional view of free metal ion toxicity in soil solutions. However, in two soils, other forms of Cu than free ion caused a response of the bioreporter, hence were bioavailable. Relationships between biological responses and analytically defined solid-phase Cu fractions identified pools of labile, potentially bioavailable Cu. As no single chemical method could be used to quantify bioavailable fraction of solid-phase Cu in all soils, the bioreporter provided analytical techniques with inherent biological relevance.
   This study demonstrates that Cu in soils with aged amendments of inorganic salts is more chemically available than in soils treated with sludge containing Cu. These differences are due to the concentration and form of Cu in the aqueous phase and the corresponding extractability of Cu in the soil solid phase. Bioreporter and biosensor validate the performance of rigorous analytical soil chemistry approaches. Their value in soil pollution should be considered a complementary technique rather than an alternative as their performance in complex environmental matrixes is yet to be validated.

AB  - The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China has created a major reservoir in which the water level fluctuates annually by about 30 m, generating a drawdown zone of up to 350 km(2) in summer. Since construction of the dam, there has been scientific and public interest in how to use the drawdown zone resources in environmentally sustainable ways. To this end, and with government support, an international conference was held in Chongqing Municipality (China) in October 2011 on the subject of conservation and ecofriendly utilization of wetlands in the Three Gorges Reservoir. The conference proceedings were subsequently published in the Journal of Chongqing Normal University. The proceedings reports are reviewed here in the context of other relevant literature. The proceedings included papers on ecology, ecodesign and ecological engineering, erosion control, plant production and carbon sequestration, phytoremediation of pollution, hydrosystem management, and others. Several of the reports derive from experimental work conducted at a research field station on the Three Gorges Reservoir situated in Kaixian County, Chongqing Municipality. Plant communities in the drawdown zone are declining in diversity and evolving. Experimental plantings of flood-tolerant edible hydrophytes in a dike-pond system reveal their potential to provide economic returns for farmers, and flooding-tolerant trees, such as cypresses, also show promising results for stabilizing soils in the drawdown zone. Flood-tolerant natural plant communities vary strongly with depth and their composition provides useful indicators for revegetation strategies. In the region surrounding the reservoir, remnant natural broad-leaved evergreen forests are most effective in sequestering carbon, and within the drawdown zone, carbon is mostly stored below ground. There is strong interest in the potential of aquatic plants for removal of pollutants, notably N and P, from the reservoir water by means of floating beds. Other examples of applying ecodesign and ecological engineering strategies for restoration and management of rivers and lakes are also given. Scientific studies have provided valuable advice for ecofriendly utilization of the reservoir drawdown zone and further studies of the evolving condition of the reservoir can be expected to pay additional practical dividends.

AB  - Exploring the response of an ecosystem, and subsequent tradeoffs among its biological community, to human perturbations remains a key challenge for the implementation of an ecosystem approaches to fisheries (EAF). To address this and related issues, we developed two network (or energy budget) models, Ecopath and Econetwrk, for the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. These models included 31 network "nodes" or biomass state variables across a broad range of trophic levels, with the present emphasis to particularly elucidate the role of small pelagics. After initial network balancing, various perturbation scenarios were evaluated to explore how potential changes to different fish, fisheries and lower trophic levels can affect model outputs. Categorically across all scenarios and interpretations thereof, there was minimal change at the second trophic levels and most of the "rebalancing" after a perturbation occur-red via alteration of the diet matrix. Yet the model results from perturbations to a balanced energy budget fall into one of three categories. First, some model results were intuitive and in obvious agreement with established ecological and fishing theory. Second, some model results were counter-intuitive upon initial observation, seemingly contradictory to known ecological and fishing theory; but upon further examination the results were explainable given the constraints of an equilibrium energy budget. Finally, some results were counter-intuitive and difficult to reconcile with theory or further examination of equilibrium constraints. A detailed accounting of biomass flows for example scenarios explores some of the non-intuitive results more rigorously. Collectively these results imply a need to carefully track biomass flows and results of any given perturbation and to critically evaluate the conditions under which a new equilibrium is obtained for these types of models, which has implications for dynamic simulations based off of them. Given these caveats, the role of small pelagics as a prominent component of this ecosystem remains a robust conclusion. We discuss how one might use this approach in the context of further developing an EAF, recognizing that a more holistic, integrated perspective will be required as we continue to evaluate tradeoffs among marine biological communities.

AB  - Fishery annual surveys are shifting towards integrated ecosystem surveys. However, monitoring the whole ecosystem once a year entails special attention to the interpretation of observations, because they only represent a snapshot in the seasonal dynamics of the environment, of a species, or any dynamic process of interest. The dependency of this snapshot to the timing, but also to the duration, of the survey with respect to this seasonal dynamics needs to be considered. Fish stock assessment is only little impacted by the observed timing within a given season, whereas warming, stratification, plankton bloom occurrence, or fish fecundity, are processes rapidly changing especially in spring. Firstly, from independent satellite data, we described the seasonal and interannual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability in the Bay of Biscay in spring around the annual PELGAS surveys. Our results revealed that the in-situ surface temperature snapshot from a given survey may be strongly misleading on the existing spatial pattern, blurring the latitudinal temperature gradient, with potential impact in e.g. species habitat modelling. Secondly, based on these survey-independent SST data, we proposed a methodology to position annual surveys in the environment spring schedule. Our temporal indicator is based on a degree-day metric, computed as the cumulated temperature from the previous winter date with minimum annual temperature. The annual degree-day is then compared to the climatology of the degree-day metric to correct the actual date of survey to an environment date. The methodology was spatialised to take into account both latitudinal shift in phasing of seasonality, and rapidly changing conditions in the environment during the survey itself. Finally, we tested the methodology to refine the description of anchovy and sardine spawning phenology, as well as spawning spatial distribution for particular years such as hot year 2003. More generally, this is an example of how synoptic, independent data from operational oceanography, as a background history of the environment dynamics, can be used to improve the interpretation of biological observations in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Knowledge of nutrient pathways and their resulting ecological interactions can alleviate numerous environmental problems associated with nutrient increases in both natural and managed systems. Although not unique, coastal systems are particularly prone to complex ecological interactions resulting from nutrient inputs from both the land and sea. Nutrient inputs to coastal systems often spur ulvoid macroalgal blooms, with negative consequences for seagrasses, primarily through shading, as well as through changes in local biogeochemistry. We conducted complementary field and mesocosm experiments in an upwelling-influenced estuary, where marine-derived nutrients dominate, to understand the direct and indirect effects of nutrients on the macroalgal-eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) interaction. In the field experiment, we found weak evidence that nutrients and/or macroalgal treatments had a negative effect on eelgrass. However, in the mesocosm experiment, we found that a combination of nutrient and macroalgal treatments led to strongly negative eelgrass responses, primarily via indirect effects associated with macroalgal additions. Together, increased total light attenuation and decreased sediment oxygen levels were associated with larger effects on eelgrass than shading alone, which was evaluated using mimic algae treatments that did not alter sediment redox potential. Nutrient addition in the mesocosms directly affected seagrass density, biomass, and morphology, but not as strongly as macroalgae. We hypothesize that the contrary results from these parallel experiments are a consequence of differences in the hydrodynamics between field and mesocosm settings. We suggest that the high rates of water movement and tidal submersion of our intertidal field experiments alleviated the light reduction and negative biogeochemical changes in the sediment associated with macroalgal canopies, as well as the nutrient effects observed in the mesocosm experiments. Furthermore, adaptation of ulvoids and eelgrass to high, but variable, background nutrient concentrations in upwelling-influenced estuaries may partly explain the venue-specific results reported here. In order to manage critical seagrass habitats, nutrient criteria and macroalgal indicators must consider variability in marine-based nutrient delivery and local physical conditions among estuaries.

AB  - The response of benthic foraminiferal assemblages to trace element pollution in the marine sediments of the Gulf of Milazzo (north-eastern Sicily) was investigated. Since the 1960s, this coastal area has been a preferred site for the development of two small marinas and a commercial harbour as well as for heavy industry. Forty samples collected in the uppermost 3-4 cm of an undisturbed layer of sediment in the littoral environment were used for this benthic foraminiferal analysis. The enrichment factors (EFs) of selected trace elements (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were also calculated. Changes both in benthic foraminiferal assemblages and in some trace elements concentrations have provided evidence that the gulf's littoral zone can be subdivided into three sectors characterised by environmental changes in the marine ecosystem. In the sector unpolluted, close to the Milazzo Cape, foraminiferal assemblages exhibit high values of species richness and foraminiferal density while trace element concentrations and their EFs are very low. Here, the highest densities of Miliolids and epiphytic species are present. On the contrary, in the sector polluted, from the marinas to the crude oil refinery, foraminiferal density and species diversity are low, and assemblages are dominated, albeit with very low densities, by species that tolerate stressed environmental conditions, such as LOFAs, agglutinants and Ammonia spp. Here, the highest trace elements concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cu and related EFs were detected. Eastwards, in the sector moderately polluted, foraminiferal populations are quite poor. They are characterised by low values of species richness and foraminiferal densities, nevertheless trace element concentrations become lower than in the other sectors and their EFs are often below 1. Deformed foraminifera, with percentages up to 7.14 %, were found in all three of the sectors. Differences in benthic foraminiferal assemblages, coupled with results from statistical analysis, indicate that anthropogenic trace element pollution could be considered as one of the most important causes of the modifications of foraminiferal assemblages in the study area.

AB  - Annually recurring environmental processes such as the cycle of temperature and light drive the phenology of marine plankton populations. Improved knowledge about the homogeneity and amplitude of the phenological response of phytoplankton to climate change is essential for an assessment of ecological consequences on the marine ecosystem. We analyzed phenological variability of 21 phytoplankton species monitored work-daily at Helgoland Roads from 1962-2015. We used a function of "Weibull"-type to estimate phenological dates of species-specific abundance peaks. The combination of derived dates and peak abundances formed the basis for the analyses of long-term changes in phenological time slots and associated environmental conditions.
   Species-specific preferences in combination with seasonally varying environmental trends resulted in a complex pattern of phenological long-term response. Phenological trends showed both constant occurrence and shifts to an earlier or later occurrence. Co-occurring phytoplankton species were shown to exhibit different phenological trends even within identical time slots. Differences in species-specific trends in timing also reflected the seasonally varying shifts in water temperature ranges due to warming. In spring and summer, the main patterns of common variability in timing were associated with different abiotic and biotic drivers. The majority of species showed more narrow time slots related to the occurrence of higher peaks. Considering the variation of species occurrence in their "typical" time window provided insight in terms of assigning the effect of environmental drivers on inter-annual phenological variation. Phytoplankton species with similar long-term trends in timing (days) showed different trends in biomass, i.e. the phenological changes resulted from different ecological responses to environmental change. The local character of environmental trends at Helgoland underpins the limits for comparison of findings between different measuring sites or wider areas, such as the North Sea. The study emphasizes the benefit and necessity of a highly resolved phytoplankton record for a true understanding of long-term ecological changes in a highly dynamic marine environment such as the North Sea.

AB  - The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of Bousfer desalination plant brine discharges on the Algerian west coast, on a natural population of the marine gastropod mollusc Patella rustica. The effects of a chronic exposure to such discharges are complex to understand due to the combined effects of environmental physico-chemical parameters (e.g., high salinity) and different pollutants that can modulate the physiological responses of this species to stress. In this context, we assessed the biological effects in a marine species P. rustica, by a multibiomarker approach that provided information on the health status of organisms in response to such an environmental stress. We measured biomarkers in the whole soft tissues of limpets as indicators of neurotoxicity (AChE activity), oxidative stress (CAT, SOD, GR, and GPx activities), biotransformation (GST), oxidative damage (LPO through TBARS levels), and genotoxicity (CSP 3-like activity). In parallel, hydrological parameters were measured in the Bay of Oran, at four selected sites: site H considered as a "hotspot," located at Bousfer desalination plant; two other sites E and W, at the east and the west of H respectively; finally, site R "reference" located in Madragh, which is considered as a remote clean site. Our analyses revealed that the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes reached the highest levels in P. rustica collected from site H. The activation of antioxidant defense system in these organisms translated the alteration of their status health, reflecting a level of environmental disruption generated by the desalination plant brine discharges and the high salinity in this area. We also observed that the tissues of limpets collected from site H as well as the two other sites, E and W, had undergone molecular damage, confirmed by the high levels of CSP 3-like activity. This damage resulted from chronic exposure to environmental conditions, potentially genotoxic, due to the desalination plant discharges. The present results indicate the adverse impact of brine effluents from desalination plants on marine fauna and suggest the need for a more consistent approach to environmental management of brine discharges.

AB  - The results of long-term studies of the contents of bulk forms of metals (Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, Pb, Mn, Co, and Cd) and their mobile compounds in soils of background and human-disturbed areas within the Krasnoural'sk-Sibai-Gai copper-zinc and Baimak-Buribai mixed copper mineralization zones in the Bashkir Transural region are discussed. It is shown that soils of the region are characterized by abnormally high natural total contents of heavy metals (HMs) typomorphic for ore mineralization: Cu, Zn, and Fe for the Sibai province and Cu, Zn, and Ni for the Baimak province. In the case of a shallow depth of the ores, the concentrations of HMs in the soils are close to or higher than the tentative permissible concentration values. The concentrations of mobile HM compounds in soils of background areas and their percentage in the total HM content strongly vary from year to year in dependence on weather conditions, position in the soil catenas, species composition of vegetation, and distance from the source of technogenic contamination. The high natural variability in the content of mobile HM compounds in soils complicates the reliable determination of the regional geochemical background and necessitates annual estimation of background parameters for the purposes of the ecological monitoring of soils. The bulk content of Cu and Zn content in soils near mining enterprises exceeds the regional geochemical background values by 2-12 times and the tentative permissible concentrations of these metals by 2-4 times. Anthropogenic contamination results in a sharp rise in the content of mobile HM compounds in soils. Their highest concentrations exceed the maximum permissible concentrations by 26 times for Cu, 18 times for Zn, and 2 times for Pb. Soil contamination in the impact zone of mining enterprises is extremely dangerous or dangerous. However, because of the high temporal variability in the migration and accumulation of HMs in the soils, the recent decline in the ore mining activities, and the construction of purification facilities, no definite temporal trends in the contents of HMs in the soils have been found in the studied region for the period from 1998 to 2015.

AB  - The present study describes generally the ecosystem of Lake Verevi while more detailed approaches are presented in the same issue. The main task of the article is to estimate long-term changes and find the best method for the restoration of good ecological status. Lake Verevi (surface 12.6 ha, mean depth 3.6 m, maximum depth 11 m, drainage area 1.1 km(2), water exchange 0.63-times per year) is a hypertrophic hard-water lake located in town Elva (6400 inhabitants). Long-term complex limnological investigations have taken place since 1929. The lake has been contaminated by irregular discharge of urban wastewaters from oxidation ponds since 1978, flood from streets, and infiltrated waters from the surrounding farms. The so-called spring meromixis occurred due to extremely warm springs in recent years. The index value of buffer capacity of Lake Verevi calculated from natural conditions is on the medium level. Water properties were analysed according to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. According to the classification, water quality as a long-term average of surface layers is moderate-good, but the water quality of bottom layers is bad. Values in deeper layers usually exceed 20-30 times the calculated reference values by Vighi and Chiaudani's model. Naturally, at the beginning of the 20th century the limnological type of the lake was moderately eutrophic. During the 1980s and 1990s the ecosystem was out of balance by abiotic characteristics as well as by plankton indicators. Rapid fluctuations of species composition and abundance can be found in recent years. Seasonal variations are considerable and species composition differs remarkably also in the water column. The dominating macrophyte species vary from year to year. Since the annual amount of precipitation from the atmosphere onto the lake surface is several times higher, the impact of swimmers could be considered irrelevant. Some restoration methods were discussed. The first step, stopping external pollution, was completed by damming the inlet. Drainage (siphoning) of the hypolimnetic water is discussed. Secondary pollution occurs because Fe:P values are below the threshold. The authors propose to use phosphorus precipitation and hypolinmetic aeration instead of siphoning.

AB  - Mangroves habitat present an important resource for large coastal communities benefiting from activities such as fisheries, forest products and clean water as well as protection against coastal erosion and climate related extreme events. Yet they are increasingly threatened by natural pressure and anthropogenic activities. We observed an inaccurate distribution of mangroves over the Western Arabian Gulf (WAG) which is a vital habitat and resource for the local ecosystem, according to the United Stated Geological Survey (USGS) mangrove database through spectral analysis. Change detection analysis is conducted on mangrove forests along the Saudi Arabian coast of the WAG for the years 2000, 2010 and 2018 using Landsat 7 & 8 data. Three supervised classification methodologies are employed for mangrove mapping, including Supported Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), referred to as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF). CART's accuracy was recorded to be > 95% while other classifiers were > 90%. The CART supervised learning classifier, mapping mangroves' distribution and biomass using Google Earth Engine (GEE) online platform, indicates an overall increase in the northern Tarut Bay and Tarut Island, by 0.21 km(2) from 2000 to 2010 and by 1.4 km(2) from 2010 to 2018. The increase might be due to mitigation strategies such as mangrove breeding and plantation. It can be challenging to detect changes in certain regions due to the inadequate resolution of Landsat where submerged mangroves can be confused with salt marshes and macro algae. We employed a new method to identify and analyze submerged mangrove forests distribution via a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Abu Ali Island. Our results show the robustness of SMRI as an effective indicator to detect submerged mangroves in both high and medium spatial resolution satellite images. NDVI values differentiated submerged mangroves from tidal flats between Landsat 7 & 8 as well as during conditions of low and high tides. High resolution WorldView-2 image showed agreement of mangroves distribution with the SMRI and NDVI results.

AB  - The EU plant protection regulation 1107/2009/EC defines the requirements for active ingredients to be approved, specifically including the assessment of effects on biodiversity and ecosystems. According to that, semi-field methods are expected to be more important in the near future. Therefore, a higher-tier experiment suitable to assess the risk for soil organisms was conducted to further develop the TME (terrestrial model ecosystems) methodology in a dose-response design with the persistent insecticidal model compound lindane (gamma-HCH). The effects of lindane on soil communities such as collembolans, oribatid mites, nematodes, soil fungi and plant biomass were determined in 42 TME. Intact TME-soil cores (diameter 300 mm, height 400 mm) from undisturbed grassland were stored outdoor under natural climatic conditions. Lindane was applied in five concentrations between 0.032 mg active ingredients (ai)/kg dry soil and 3.2 mg ai/kg dry weight soil, six-fold replicated each. Twelve TME served as untreated controls. Abundance and community structures of oribatids, collembolans, enchytraeids, nematodes and fungi were recorded. Oribatid mites' community responded 3 months after treatment, although they were not significantly affected by the overall treatment regimen. Collembolans in total and species-specific abundance as well as the community endpoints (principal response curves, diversity measures) were adversely affected by moderate dosages of lindane. Effects were transient between 3 and 5 months after treatment with a recovery within 1 year. No significant effects could be detected for enchytraeids, nematodes and fungi. The study design and the obtained results allow for calculations of no observed effect concentrations below the highest treatment level for populations and for soil communities as defined entities, as well as effective concentrations. The paper discusses the limits of effect detection in the light of achievable coefficients of variation and by means of minimum detectable differences. Outdoor TME are useful to analyze and assess functional and structural endpoints in soil organisms' communities and their possible recovery after pesticide treatment within 1 year.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) based on statistical relationships between occurrence data and underlying environmental conditions are increasingly used to predict spatial patterns of biological invasions and prioritize locations for early detection and control of invasion outbreaks. However, invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) face special challenges because (i) they typically violate SDM's assumption that the organism is in equilibrium with its environment, and (ii) species absence data are often unavailable or believed to be too difficult to interpret. This often leads researchers to generate pseudo-absences for model training or utilize presence-only methods, and to confuse the distinction between predictions of potential vs. actual distribution. We examined the hypothesis that true-absence data, when accompanied by dispersal constraints, improve prediction accuracy and ecological understanding of iSDMs that aim to predict the actual distribution of biological invasions. We evaluated the impact of presence-only, true-absence and pseudo-absence data on model accuracy using an extensive dataset on the distribution of the invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in California. Two traditional presence/absence models (generalized linear model and classification trees) and two alternative presence-only models (ecological niche factor analysis and maximum entropy) were developed based on 890 field plots of pathogen occurrence and several climatic, topographic, host vegetation and dispersal variables. The effects of all three possible types of occurrence data on model performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and omission/commission error rates. Results show that prediction of actual distribution was less accurate when we ignored true-absences and dispersal constraints. Presence-only models and models without dispersal information tended to over-predict the actual range of invasions. Models based on pseudo-absence data exhibited similar accuracies as presence-only models but produced spatially less feasible predictions. We suggest that true-absence data are a critical ingredient not only for accurate calibration but also for ecologically meaningful assessment of iSDMs that focus on predictions of actual distributions.

AB  - Threshold values for nature protection areas are used as indicators for their nature protection value. Several values related to a minimum share of the area in a region or a country have been proposed as basic conditions for a sound development of natural areas. Although the height of these thresholds is still a matter of extended scientific discussion (they range from 5 to 30% of the agricultural area), they have been embraced by political parties and legislation concerning nature protection. This paper highlights the consequences of the practical application of such thresholds. The example of an intensively used agricultural region, the Kraichgau in Baden-Wuerttemberg, is chosen. To improve the actual situation concerning bio-diversity, a selection of sites with a good potential for the development of oligothropic dry grassland was proposed. To evaluate the consequences of this proposal a GIS based modelling tool was used. By the connection of biological, economic and a-biotic models it was possible to describe the reactions of all these factors simultaneously in form of a scenario. The scenario describes an increase of dry grassland area of approximately 10%. Economically, the reduction of acreage leads to a change of crop ratio and a decrease of gross margin. Due to their profitability, row crops remain with their original amount within the rotation of crops and lead, therefore, to intensification within the region. The accompanied increase of erosion rates results in a higher nutrient impact to adjacent bio-topes (hedges, ridges), thus leading to their further deterioration. Consequently, the gain of bio-diversity in some parts of the region is coupled with a loss of bio-diversity in others. Analysing these results, the usefulness of using an integrated economic-ecological modelling system for the evaluation is shown. Later, discussion of the consequences for the economic as well as for the biotic situation provides an idea of the limitations of the thresholds as indicators with respect to their practical performance. Recommendations for the necessary differentiations pertaining to regional context are given to improve the validity of this indicator type. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A combination of field and tabular methods and multivariate analyses were used to develop groups of ground flora species (i.e., ecological species groups) that characterize and distinguish highly disturbed, landform-level ecosystems dominated by jack pine in northern Lower Michigan. The endangered Kirtland's warbler formerly or currently occupied the large glacial landforms for which species groups were developed. Eight such ecological species groups were created using 31 woody and herbaceous species sampled in 144 plots within a 20,000 km(2) geographic region of uniform climate and regional physiography. The groups were initially constructed using subjective, observation-based groupings of species with similar presence and abundance along soil moisture and fertility gradients. Species groups were corroborated using TWINSPAN and detrended correspondence analysis, and the environmental conditions indicated by each were described and contrasted based upon field observations and canonical correspondence analysis. Two of the eight species groups indicated very dry, infertile sites, and one was indicative of a very broad range of sites dominated by jack pine. The remaining five groups reflected a relatively gentle environmental gradient within the set of ecosystems we sampled, indicating small differences along a soil moisture gradient and less so along a soil fertility and light availability gradient. The groups were applied successfully for the majority of an area that had been repeatedly logged and/or burned for at least 120 years. In addition, the groups were successful when tested on sites with highly disturbed upper soil strata furrowed for the establishment of plantations between the 1960s and 1980s. Within the boundaries of the regional ecosystems for which they were developed, ecological species groups reflect the integrated effects of multiple site factors that control the height growth rates of jack pine trees that, in turn, determine the duration of Kirtland's warbler occupancy. While usually applied at the scale of ecosystem types, our results demonstrate that ecological species groups may also provide the ecological basis for distinguishing ecosystems at broader scales. When examined simultaneously in the field with physiography, microclimate, and soil factors, the groups are therefore useful in identifying and classifying ecosystem units at the scale of landforms, the appropriate scale of management for the Kirtland's warbler.

AB  - Resilience is a major research focus covering a wide range of topics from biodiversity conservation to ecosystem (service) management. Model simulations can assess the resilience of, for example, plant species, measured as the return time to conditions prior to a disturbance. This requires process-based models (PBM) that implement relevant processes such as regeneration and reproduction and thus successfully reproduce transient dynamics after disturbances. Such models are often complex and thus limited to either short-term or small-scale applications, whereas many research questions require species predictions across larger spatial and temporal scales. We suggest a framework to couple a PBM and a statistical species distribution model (SDM), which transfers the results of a resilience analysis by the PBM to SDM predictions. The resulting hybrid model combines the advantages of both approaches: the convenient applicability of SDMs and the relevant process detail of PBMs in abrupt environmental change situations. First, we simulate dynamic responses of species communities to a disturbance event with a PBM. We aggregate the response behavior in two resilience metrics: return time and amplitude of the response peak. These metrics are then used to complement long-term SDM projections with dynamic short-term responses to disturbance. To illustrate our framework, we investigate the effect of abrupt short-term groundwater level and salinity changes on coastal vegetation at the German Baltic Sea. We found two example species to be largely resilient, and, consequently, modifications of SDM predictions consisted mostly of smoothing out peaks in the occurrence probability that were not confirmed by the PBM. Discrepancies between SDM- and PBM-predicted species responses were caused by community dynamics simulated in the PBM and absent from the SDM. Although demonstrated with boosted regression trees (SDM) and an existing individual-based model, IBC-grass (PBM), our flexible framework can easily be applied to other PBM and SDM types, as well as other definitions of short-term disturbances or long-term trends of environmental change. Thus, our framework allows accounting for biological feedbacks in the response to short- and long-term environmental changes as a major advancement in predictive vegetation modeling.

AB  - 1. Using knowledge of leaf functional traits, such as those forming the leaf economics spectrum (LES), to understand plant responses to environmental change is well-established and now being more widely applied to agroecosystems. Yet, little is known about how farm managers invoke leaf functional traits to inform management decisions.
   2. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate whether farmers use knowledge of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in LES traits (or trait proxies) of target crops as response indicators of management conditions; (2) determine whether LES trait values are ranked consistently among multiple farmers along a "Farmer Leaf Economics Spectrum" (FES); (3) evaluate how a FES corresponds to the LES; and (4) identify the farmer and farm attributes that best predict the agreement between the FES and the LES.
   3. We collaborated with coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers in the Turrialba Valley, Costa Rica. We used a visual elicitation tool of fresh leaves along an intraspecific spectrum of leaf size, leaf thickness and leaf colour (as a proxy for leaf nutrients); respondents were asked to rank leaves in response to shade and nutrient scenarios as well as yield potential. On-farm biophysical data, management practices and socio-economic attributes were also collected.
   4. The majority of farmers demonstrated a developed system of utilizing coffee leaf and whole-plant ITV as indicators of management practices. Farmers managing smaller farms tended to more commonly acknowledge ITV in LES chemical-morphological traits, as compared to those managing large farms. The agreement between a respondent-identified ranking of leaf thickness ITV as a function of light environment and an empirically defined thickness-to-light ranking was partially explained by farmers' physical engagement with plants.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In scientific literature, analyses of crop intraspecific trait variation have provided important insights into the mechanistic bases of multiple key agroecological processes. We demonstrate that farmers use crop leaf trait variation as an indicator to both evaluate management prescriptions and to initiate management actions including shade-tree species selection and abundance, crop-and shade-tree pruning regimes and fertilization treatments. These findings signify that functional traits represent a key nexus between scientific and local knowledge.

AB  - Aims and study area: We present the first formalised large-scale syntaxonomic overview of mesic semi-natural grassland communities (Arrhenatheretalia elatioris and Nardetalia strictae) in the Ukrainian part of the Eastern Carpathians and adjacent areas of Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. Methods: During 2009-2014 we recorded 759 phytosociological releves using the Braun-Blanquet approach. The classification was based on our own phytosociological material as well as published material recorded by both Braun-Blanquet and eco-phytocenotic (dominant) approach comprising 2,000 phytocoenological releves in total (952 releves in the stratified data set). Semi-supervised and supervised classifications by the K-means method and indirect gradient analysis by detrended correspondence analysis were used for the analyses. Slovak electronic expert system and diagnostic species for grassland vegetation published in national overviews in the neighbouring countries helped us to identify individual clusters. Didukh indicator values were used to compare habitat conditions of delimited plant communites. Results: A total of fifteen well-differentiated associations within five alliances and two classes were delimited: Class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea including the alliance Arrhenatherion elatioris with associations Anthoxantho odorati-Agrostietum tenuis, Betonico officinalis-Trifolietum pannonici, Poo-Trisetetum flavescentis, Primulo veris-Agrostietum capillaris and Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris and the alliance Cynosurion cristati with associations Plantagini-Lolietum perennis and Lolio perennis-Cynosuretum cristati. Class Nardetea strictae including the alliance Nardo strictae-Agrostion tenuis with associations Antennario dioicaeNardetum strictae, Campanulo abietinae-Nardetum strictae and Betonico officinalis-Agrostietum capillaris, the alliance Violion caninae with associations Campanulo rotundifoliae-Dianthetum deltoidis, Hyperico maculatiDeschampsietum flexuosae, Festuco rupicolae-Nardetum strictae and Polygalo vulgaris-Nardetum strictae caricetosum fuscae and the alliance Potentillo ternatae-Nardion strictae with association Soldanello hungaricaeNardetum strictae. The ecological differentiation of syntaxa is mainly based on certain environmental factors reflected in Didukh indicator values (DIV), management practices and altitude. Conclusions: This study complements current knowledge about mesic grasslands from poorly sampled area using the Braun-Blanquet approach. The classified syntaxa of mesic grasslands are discussed with respect to their distribution in the Carpathians and Europe and we expect that the results of our research will assist in the anticipated future supranational classification of mesic grasslands in the Carpathians.

AB  - Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TME) were developed as one higher-tier option to detect and assess effects of pesticides on soil communities in a 1 year study using lindane (gamma-HCH) as a persistent and toxic reference pesticide. TME contained intact soil cores (diameter 300 mm, height 400 mm) including indigenous soil communities of undisturbed grassland. Forty units were placed outdoors between spring 2005 and 2006. The TME experiment was designed to provide data that fulfill the requirements of the revised European regulation on plant protection products (regulation 1107/2009/EEC replacing guideline 91/414/EC) with a focus on structural endpoints such as soil organisms and their community structure in case higher-tier evaluation is triggered. The key objective was to evaluate the dynamics and stability of species-diverse microarthropod communities of undisturbed grassland over at least 1 year after application. In grassland soils, less selection pressure towards insensitive species compared to arable land was presumed. Sufficient numbers of organisms and numerous TME replicates ensured that a statistical evaluation could be performed to estimate the sensitivity of the organisms upon application of lindane applied at high rates of 7.5 and 75 kg ai/ha. The application rates resulted in nominal concentrations of 10 and 100 mg ai/kg dry soil referred to the top 5 cm soil layer of 10 TME each; 20 untreated TME served as controls and were used to study the natural dynamics and the variability of populations under field conditions. Results showed that the grassland from which the soil cores were sampled contained communities of soil organisms marked by typical diversity of improved grassland. Lindane applied at excessive rates caused clear dose-related and long-lasting effects on the communities of microarthropods. On the contrary, lumbricids, the total feeding activity (bait lamina) and the growth of plant biomass were not affected up to 1 year after application. Based on the results of this study using a toxic reference insecticide, the methodology seems to be suitable for use in the regulatory context of the assessment of pesticides once protection goals, data requirements and the conceptual framework are defined.

AB  - The classical environmental control model assumes that species distribution is determined by the spatial variation of underlying habitat conditions. This niche-based model has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity which assumes that ecological drift is a key process regulating species coexistence. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity in communities critically depends on our ability to decompose the variation of diversity into the contributions of different processes affecting it. Here we investigated the effects of pure habitat, pure spatial, and spatially structured habitat processes on the distributions of species richness and species composition in a recently established 24-ha stem-mapping plot in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest of Gutianshan National Nature Reserve in East China. We used the new spatial analysis method of principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) to disentangle the contributions of these processes. The results showed that ( 1) habitat and space jointly explained; similar to 53% of the variation in richness and; similar to 65% of the variation in species composition, depending on the scale ( sampling unit size); ( 2) tree diversity ( richness and composition) in the Gutianshan forest was dominantly controlled by spatially structured habitat (24%) and habitat-independent spatial component (29%); the spatially independent habitat contributed a negligible effect (6%); ( 3) distributions of richness and species composition were strongly affected by altitude and terrain convexity, while the effects of slope and aspect were weak; ( 4) the spatial distribution of diversity in the forest was dominated by broad-scaled spatial variation; ( 5) environmental control on the one hand and unexplained spatial variation on the other (unmeasured environmental variables and neutral processes) corresponded to spatial structures with different scales in the Gutianshan forest plot; and ( 6). five habitat types were recognized; a few species were statistically significant indicators of three of these habitats, whereas two habitats had no significant indicator species. The results suggest that the diversity of the forest is equally governed by environmental control (30%) and neutral processes ( 29%). In the. fine-scale analysis ( 10310 m cells), neutral processes dominated (43%) over environmental control (20%).

AB  - China experienced a shift from net forest losses to gains (forest transition) between 1976 and 1981. Such transition has increased timber volume in natural forests and expanded the provision of forests ecosystem services. However, the timing, magnitude, and impact of the forest transition varied at provincial scales due to heterogeneous socio-economic and institutional conditions. The aim of this study is to quantify the impact of spatial drivers of forest transition in China through integrated comparative and spatial regression methods. This approach allows the documentation of feedbacks and interactions of theoretical pathways to forest transition at different geographical scales, which is of relevance for large-scale land restoration efforts. Our analysis also accounts for changes in forest volumes, a parameter that is usually not studied in the forest transition literature. Here, we used key indicators of demographic, economic, agricultural, and urbanization processes coupled with forest area data to investigate factors influencing forest transitions at multiple geographic scales between 1973 and 2013. Stepwise and geographically weighted regression models were adapted to quantify the key drivers' integrated and distributed magnitude effects on forest transition patterns, respectively. We assessed changes across forest types (i.e., primary and secondary forests, plantation forests) and investigated pathways to forest transition at provincial scales. The results indicate that increasing demand for timber and other forest ecosystem services, rising gross domestic product and population, forest policy, and increasing employment in the industry and service sectors generated multiple pathways to forest transition. The impact of those drivers varied within provinces, and some transition pathways were more relevant than others at sub-national scales. Despite the Country scale shift to net forest gains, the loss of natural forests continued in some provinces (e.g., Guangdong, Guangxi) until recent years. The loss of ecosystem services from mature forests offset some of the benefits of China's forest transition. Coordinated forest management strategies across political jurisdictions could speed up the path to net forest gains, reduce trade-offs of forest transitions processes, and achieve sustainable afforestation processes. Such an effort could have significant contributions to the preservation and increase of key forest ecosystem services for the Country and the world.

AB  - Hydrocarbon resources are non-renewable and unevenly distributed. Their exploitation is accompanied by various restrictions, associated primarily with the protection of waters, natural environment and landscape values. Polish oil and natural gas deposits are located in the west, north-west and south-east part of the country. Since about 32% of the country belongs to protected areas, more and more deposits (both exploited and prospective) will be located in protected areas or in their close proximity.
   Exploitation of hydrocarbons in protected areas is regulated by the provisions of the laws on environmental protection, planning and spatial development, as well as environmental and geological law. The most restrictive limitations associated with business activities apply to national parks and nature reserves (including mandatory prohibitions included in exhaustive list). Within the parks and protected landscape areas bans are optional. Ecological network of protected areas in the territory of the European Union, Natura 2000, is flexible and does not implement bans, though its purpose is to preserve the subject matter in proper condition. Of the 360 documented hydrocarbon deposits, 28 are located within national and landscape parks. In areas covered by the Natura 2000 network there were 49 documented natural gas and methane deposits (methane from coal seams), as well as 25 proven oil deposits (as of 2006).
   Potential areas of hydrocarbon deposits cover a large part of the country, while some of newly discovered deposits might be located within protected areas. In addition to conventional hydrocarbon deposits there are chances for occurrence of shale gas and tight gas. The potential oil and gas reserves can be located in areas covering two national and 33 landscape parks.
   Exploration and/or exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits is likely to significantly affect (always or potentially) the environment and therefore - before obtaining a concession it is required to obtain environmental decision. An environmental impact assessment is the part of the environmental decision-making procedures.
   Preparation of spatial development plans for the mining areas is optional. These plans should enable the implementation of projects specified in the concession and the protection of the environment; they cannot provide solutions preventing the execution of the activities determined by the concession.
   Protection plans applicable in national and landscape parks, which may lead to limitations in their exploitation, are legally binding for local spatial development plans, when they are developed for the sites located within protected areas.

AB  - Pseudomonas-like organisms form a highly heterogeneous and ubiquitous group of bacteria. Recent identification of an authentic Pseudomonas genus should help to decrease difficulties which arose from taxonomic uncertainties. Further difficulties in recognising N-2-fixing Pseudomonas species lie in the confirmation of diazotrophy. Optimised conditions are often needed for the detection of nitrogenase activity since it is controlled by specific environmental factors and physiological requirements. However, genetically constructed N-2-fixing strains from authentic Pseudomonas species have demonstrated that at least some members of the genus possess mechanisms to accommodate and express nif (N-2 fixation) genes from a well-studied diazotroph, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Renowned for their catabolic versatility, pseudomonads can use a wide range of carbon and energy substrates. Hence, potential N-2-fixing pseudomonads are conceivably less limited by carbon and energy sources available in the environment compared to other N-2-fixing organisms. Pseudomonas species dominate in the rhizosphere of some plants from which isolates have been shown to be diazotrophic. Several strains are also chemolithotrophs, capable of using H-2 as energy and electron source and CO2 as carbon source. Besides assays for N-2-fixing activity, DNA hybridisation to the well conserved molybdo-nitrogenase structural gene probe is an indicator of diazotrophy. However, absence of hybridisation to this probe, despite N-2 fixation activity, has been reported. Although the genetics of N-2 fixation in pseudomonads have hardly been studied, some nif genes have been shown to be plasmid-borne. Pseudomonas species are also predominant soil denitrifiers, reducing nitrate and nitrite to gaseous forms of nitrogen during anaerobic respiration. Hence, they play an important role in the global biological nitrogen cycle. Several diazotrophic species including a few pseudomonads can also denitrify. The potential contribution by N-2-fixing pseudomonads to the sinks and sources of soil nitrogen is considered small in the short term but essentially remains unclear in the absence of experimental data. Reliable rapid methods for their specific enumeration are indispensable for assessing their population dynamics and ascertaining their ecological significance.

AB  - The isoscape of particulate organic matters (POM) in the euphotic zone at the shelf of the East China Sea (ECS) is affected by hydrological interactions and biological activities. Based on the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and C:N ratio of POM (0.7 to 50 mu m) in the euphotic zone of the ECS from 2008 to 2018 with a total of 113 samples, we inferred their sources and then investigated what hydrographical and biological conditions determined these spatio-temporal variations through synoptic and intensive seasonal monitoring. The isotopic signatures (delta C-13: -26.9 to -12.4 parts per thousand, delta N-15: -1.0 to 10.8 parts per thousand) and C:N ratios (4.4-9.0) of euphotic POM varied within the range of values reported for marine phytoplankton, suggesting limited contribution of terrigenous POM to the shelf of the ECS. The delta C-13 values of POM increased with the increase of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration at the depth of chl-a maximum and the delta N-15 values decreased near the Changjiang River plume and inner shelf with freshwater input and coastal upwelling in summer. This indicated that phytoplankton production was enhanced by high nutrient supply and warmer temperature. Besides, the delta N-15 values were higher under lower inorganic nitrogen nutrient concentrations, and were negatively correlated with POM C:N ratio (i.e., delta N-15 value was less negative with higher nitrogen content in POM). Such correlations may suggest the enhanced trophic interactions in microbial food chains in oligotrophic environments, where phagotrophic protists with high delta N-15 values could be included into the size fraction (0.7-50 mu m) of POM. Based on our study, the spatial and temporal delta C-13 and delta N-15 isoscape of euphotic POM serves as an ecological indicator to infer primary production and plankton food web properties of the East China Sea.

AB  - In contexts of exposure to atypical stress or adversity, individual and collective resilience refers to the process of sustaining wellbeing by leveraging biological, psychological, social and environmental protective and promotive factors and processes (PPFPs). This multisystemic understanding of resilience is generating significant interest but has been difficult to operationalize in psychological research where studies tend to address only one or two systems at a time, often with a primary focus on individual coping strategies. We show how multiple systems implicated in human resilience can be researched in the same study using a longitudinal, six-phase transformative sequential mixed methods study of 14- to 24-year-olds and their elders in two communities dependent on oil and gas industries (Drayton Valley, Canada, and Secunda/eMbalenhle, South Africa). Data collection occurred over a 5-year period, and included: (1) community engagement and the identification of youth health and well-being priorities; (2) participatory youth-centric qualitative research using one-on-one semi-structured interviews and arts-based methods; (3) survey of 500 youth at three time points to assess psychosocial health indicators and outcomes; (4) collection of hair samples to assess stress biomarkers (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-DHEA) over time; (5) youth-led ecological data collection and assessment of historical socio-economic development data; and (6) community resource mapping with community elders. Analyzing data from these multiple systems will allow us to understand the interrelationship and impact of PPFPs within and across systems. To date, we have undertaken thematic and narrative qualitative analyses, and descriptive analyses of the preliminary ecological and survey data. As we proceed, we will combine these and grounded theory approaches with innovative techniques such as latent transition analysis and network analysis, as well as modeling of economic conditions and spatial analysis of human geographies to understand patterns of PPFPs and their inter-relationships. By analyzing the complexity of data collected across systems (including cultural contexts) we are demonstrating the possibility of conducting multisystemic resilience research which expands the way psychological research accounts for positive development under stress in different contexts. This comprehensive examination of resilience may offer an example of how the study of resilience can inform socially and contextually relevant interventions and policies.

AB  - The concept of "autonomy", once at the core of the original enactivist proposal in The Embodied Mind (Varela et al. in The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1991), is nowadays ignored or neglected by some of the most prominent contemporary enactivists approaches. Theories of autonomy, however, come to fill a theoretical gap that sensorimotor accounts of cognition cannot ignore: they provide a naturalized account of normativity and the resources to ground the identity of a cognitive subject in its specific mode of organization. There are, however, good reasons for the contemporary neglect of autonomy as a relevant concept for enactivism. On the one hand, the concept of autonomy has too often been assimilated into autopoiesis (or basic autonomy in the molecular or biological realm) and the implications are not always clear for a dynamical sensorimotor approach to cognitive science. On the other hand, the foundational enactivist proposal displays a metaphysical tension between the concept of operational closure (autonomy), deployed as constitutive, and that of structural coupling (sensorimotor dynamics); making it hard to reconcile with the claim that experience is sensorimotorly constituted. This tension is particularly apparent when Varela et al. propose Bittorio (a 1D cellular automata) as a model of the operational closure of the nervous system as it fails to satisfy the required conditions for a sensorimotor constitution of experience. It is, however, possible to solve these problems by re-considering autonomy at the level of sensorimotor neurodynamics. Two recent robotic simulation models are used for this task, illustrating the notion of strong sensorimotor dependency of neurodynamic patterns, and their networked intertwinement. The concept of habit is proposed as an enactivist building block for cognitive theorizing, re-conceptualizing mental life as a habit ecology, tied within an agent's behaviour generating mechanism in coordination with its environment. Norms can be naturalized in terms of dynamic, interactively self-sustaining, coherentism. This conception of autonomous sensorimotor agency is put in contrast with those enactive approaches that reject autonomy or neglect the theoretical resources it has to offer for the project of naturalizing minds.

AB  - Despite the relevance of ecosystem services (ES) to society and modern ecological research, current methods of measurement and mapping remain inconsistent and often lack primary data in estimating and modeling ES. A key player in our understanding of ES and their measurements are plant functional traits-chemical and physical aspects of plants-which are often cited as one of the drivers of ecosystem processes and functions. In order to better quantify the ES-plant functional trait indicators, we outline existing evidence of this relationship and identify gaps between the best predicted ES and the most valued ES. This study offers an up-to-date review of plant functional traits' direct or indirect relationships with ecosystem service provision and discusses the quantitative evidence these traits might hold as indicators. With this review, we seek to (1) offer a current summary of the quantitative evidence on ecosystem service-plant functional trait relationships, (2) identify which traits have been used to successfully indicate ecosystem services, and (3) identify research gaps, and ecosystem services or traits that receive little attention or have weak criteria as indicators. In a comprehensive literature review of the 19 services that were searched for, genetic materials, medicine, and cultural services had no relevant plant functional trait indicators, while the remaining 16 services had a range of traits associated with them. We found that functional traits showed varying relationships to ES, with some depending on the ecosystem type they were found in, while others appeared to remain consistent across ecosystems and conditions. This indicates that there could exist a subset of traits that are "universal" indicators across all ecosystem types, while others are ecosystem dependent. Our review suggests the need for more research on less clearly defined ES (such as cultural, educational, and refugium services) both by more careful definitions to make quantitative measures more applicable, and through increased quantitative and qualitative studies to better understand the nature of ES indicators for these services. This summary shows how plant functional traits can quantitatively and reliably predict and provide details on a subset of ES.

AB  - Efforts to understand causes of declines in productivity of species of concern often involve retrospective evaluation of multiple possible causes based on trends in relevant ecological indicators. We describe a hypothesis testing framework for examining declines in marine survival for coho and Chinook salmon in the Salish Sea. Independent populations of both anadromous species have declined over the last 50 years, prompting extensive examination of mortality in different life stages. Previous studies have identified declining trends in marine survival, and we re-evaluated these trends in light of a number of possible hypotheses for declines. We laid out seven potential explanations for declines: changes in predator buffering related to abundance and timing, density-dependent or -independent food availability, water quality, timing of freshwater delivery to Puget Sound, and anthropogenic impacts. We compiled ecosystem indicators relevant to these hypotheses and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to examine multivariate relationships with survival from multiple coho and Chinook salmon stocks. We also developed additional models using the most informative indicators based on variable importance weighting (VIW) from the seven hypothesis groups. We examined how these models explained overall trends in marine survival, as well as survival in three temporal stanzas (before, during, and after a major decline, based on statistical breakpoint analysis). Across the entire time series, best fitting models explained 30-40% of the variation in the survival data. Best fitting models were from multiple hypotheses, including predation (abundance and timing), competition, water quality, and anthropogenic impacts; the freshwater delivery hypothesis was the least supported. Different models performed best (lowest error) during different stanzas of the coho salmon marine survival time series and the two VIW models were generally the top performing models, but performance varied in different years. Indicators with the strongest support included seal abundance, herring abundance, timing of hatchery salmon releases, and indicators related to water properties like stratification and temperature. These findings suggest that multiple processes embedded in several of our hypotheses influence marine survival but that an ecological "smoking gun" for Salish Sea salmon declines will remain elusive.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - In times of rapid global change, anticipating vegetation changes and assessing their impacts is of key relevance to managers and policy makers. Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision-making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics (SVD), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (10(3)-10(6)) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network (DNN) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the SVD approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta-modelling context. We trained a DNN using simulations of a process-based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of SVD to project long-term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. SVD captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions. In addition, we tested the computational efficiency of the approach, highlighting the utility of SVD for country- to continental scale applications. SVD is the-to our knowledge-first vegetation model harnessing deep neural networks. The approach has high predictive accuracy and is able to generalize well beyond training data. SVD was designed to run on widely available input data (e.g. vegetation states defined from remote sensing, gridded global climate datasets) and exceeds the computational performance of currently available highly optimized landscape models by three to four orders of magnitude. We conclude that SVD is a promising approach for combining detailed process knowledge on fine-grained ecosystem processes with the increasingly available big ecological datasets for improved large-scale projections of vegetation dynamics.

AB  - Background: Rivers receive water and associated organic micropollutants from their entire catchment, including from urban, agricultural and natural sources, and constitute an important environmental component for catalyzing pollutant turnover. Environmental removal processes were extensively investigated under laboratory conditions in the past but there is still a lack of information on how organic micropollutants attenuate on the catchment scale. The aim of this study was to describe the chemical and toxicological profile of a 4th order river and to characterize in-stream processes. We propose indicator chemicals and indicator in vitro bioassays as screening methods to evaluate micropollutant input and transport and transformation processes of the chemical burden in a river. Carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were selected as indicators for dilution processes and the moderately degradable chemicals tramadol and sotalol as indicators for potential in-stream attenuation processes. The battery of bioassays covers seven environmentally relevant modes of action, namely estrogenicity, glucocorticogenic activity, androgenicity progestagenic activity and oxidative stress response, as well as activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, using the GeneBLAzer test battery and the AhR-CALUX and AREc32 assays.
   Results: Both approaches, targeted chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays, identified a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as a major input source of organic micropollutants that dominantly influenced the water quality of the river. Downstream of the WWTP the amount of detected chemicals and biological effects decreased along the river flow. The organic indicator chemicals of known degradability uncovered dilution and potential loss processes in certain river stretches. The average cytotoxic potency of the river water decreased in a similar fashion as compounds of medium degradability such as the pharmaceutical sotalol.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the indicator chemical/indicator bioassay approach is suitable for identifying input sources of a mixture of organic micropollutants and to trace changes in the water quality along small rivers. This method forms the necessary basis for evaluating the natural attenuation processes of organic micropollutants on a catchment scale, especially when combined with enhanced sampling strategies in future studies.

AB  - Cracks are common and natural features of sea ice formed in the polar oceans. In this study, a sea ice crack in flooded, multiyear, land-fast Antarctic sea ice was examined to assess its influence on biological productivity and the transport of nutrients and microalgae into the upper layers of neighboring sea ice. The water inside the crack and the surrounding host ice were characterized by a strong discoloration (brown color), an indicator of a massive algal bloom. Salinity and oxygen isotopic ratio measurements indicated that 64-84% of the crack water consisted of snow meltwater supplied during the melt season. Measurements of nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations within the slush layer pool (the flooded layer at the snow-ice interface) revealed the intrusion of water from the crack, likely forced by mixing with underlying seawater during the tidal cycle. Our results suggest that sea ice crack formation provides conditions favorable for algal blooms by directly exposing the crack water to sunlight and supplying nutrients from the under-ice water. Subsequently, constituents of the crack water modified by biological activity were transported into the upper layer of the flooded sea ice. They were then preserved in the multiyear ice column formed by upward growth of sea ice caused by snow ice formation in areas of significant snow accumulation.
   Plain Language Summary Formation of cracks in sea ice affects the environment associated with biological production and biogeochemical cycling in the surface ocean of sea ice systems. Because cracks are likely to form frequently within the sea ice during the season of ice melting and ice breaking, the contributions of cracks to biological production and biogeochemical cycling may be significant in ice-covered oceans. In the future, the melting of sea ice in polar oceans will strongly affect the output of biogeochemical parameters trapped within sea ice and their use in primary and secondary production within surface oceans. In the case of multiyear, land-fast ice, biogeochemical parameters that accumulate within the ice would be discharged abruptly to ocean surface waters when the multiyear ice breaks up.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

AB  - There is a growing interest on landscape and landscape policy and planning, especially since the adoption of the European Landscape Convention in 2000. This latter defines landscape as "an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors". In the case of rural landscape, this means that an appropriate governance model should not only involve local stakeholders in a participative approach, but also take into account natural characteristics, cultural aspects of the past and present, and socio-economic aspects, since agriculture is the main driver of change for rural landscapes. Farm strategies are influenced by internal and by external factors, these latter being related to market conditions and to constraints and opportunities given by policies. Market globalization and Agricultural policies are consequently having a strong impact on landscape, that public institutions try to neutralise setting rules about landscape conservation. Thus, due to its specific features, landscape is impacted both by several sectorial and territorial policies which have none or very low coordination among them. Indeed, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has often shown a negative influence on landscape, also in the case of Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) intended to promote landscape. In this framework, the aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive model for the governance of rural landscape and a first simplified application to a cultural landscape. This model is based on the integration of a geographical multi-criteria analysis, an advanced GIS-based geo-processing tools, and participatory techniques aiming to understand and foresee local stakeholders' behaviours through focus-groups and dedicated interviews. The identification of future landscape scenarios is based on the integration of past evolution (historical analysis), landscape sensitivity (territorial analysis) and farmers' adaptation to market and policy changes (farm analysis). A simplified version of the model was tailored and tested in the municipality of Castiglione d'Orcia of the Siena province in Tuscany, Italy, one of the UNESCO cultural landscapes, but is the Authors' opinion that its approach (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We quantified the reliability of phytoplankton population, community, and ecosystem variates as indicators of whole-lake enrichment. Variates with high sensitivity to perturbation and low background variability were assumed to be more reliable indicators than variates with low sensitivity or high variability. Our data set included weekly data in four lakes (three manipulated and one reference) during two pretreatment summers and two summers of enrichment. We determined background variability by evaluating change in each variate from year to year in the reference lake throughout the experiment and in each manipulated lake during the pretreatment period. We evaluated sensitivity to enrichment using the frequency of departure from expected conditions for each variate during the period of experimental enrichment. Using this information, we then (1) tested the expectation that species populations are more reliable indicators of perturbation than ecosystem variates (biomass, chlorophyll, and primary productivity), and (2) evaluated whether community variates (genera, taxonomic divisions, allometric variates, and community diversity) were reliable indicators of enrichment.
   Contrary to expectations from other perturbations, phytoplankton species populations were less reliable indicators of enrichment than community and ecosystem variates. Chlorophyll, species diversity, and species evenness were the most reliable indicators of enrichment: each changed significantly only during the first year of enrichment and only in the three enriched lakes. Simultaneous changes in multiple taxonomic divisions also signaled enrichment very reliably. In contrast, the frequency of significant changes in species populations differed little between the reference lake and the enriched lakes, even after experimental enrichment. Changes in species were difficult to detect reliably due to high background variability in all four lakes: most taxa were not present often enough during a single year to assess reliably whether they had increased or decreased compared to the previous years. Genera and allometric variates were also unreliable indicators due to high variability and moderate sensitivity, respectively. Reliable indicators of phytoplankton responses to enrichment were very different from reliable indicators of animal responses to toxic stressors, suggesting that it may be difficult to make generalizations regarding the use of population, community, and ecosystem variates as indicators of a wide array of perturbations.

AB  - To reduce the net losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services caused by iron ore mining in Brazil, mineland rehabilitation using native plant species is necessary. However, systematic knowledge about which plant species are the best candidates for mineland rehabilitation is lacking. Therefore, iron mining companies working on the Urucum Massif reintroduce as many native herb and shrub species as possible to achieve the rehabilitation of savanna vegetation communities. To this end, seeds are collected from nearby native ecosystems, and seedlings are rescued from logged areas or produced in a local nursery. Monitoring is necessary to assess the persistence of the reinstated communities and their similarity to natural reference conditions. Ideally, monitoring efforts should compare the floristic composition of the rehabilitating sites with that of natural reference ecosystems. Here, we compared sites that had undergone two or three years of rehabilitation after iron ore mining on the Urucum Massif, MS, Brazil, with native reference sites. The species composition as well as structural, taxonomic, and phylogenetic diversity indices were compared between the reference and rehabilitating sites. Despite the differences in species composition between the rehabilitating and reference sites, we found more than 50 native species and partial recovery of the vegetation structure in the rehabilitating sites. Furthermore, we detected similar levels of animal-dispersed plant species at rehabilitating and reference sites. These environmental indicators indicate that trial-and-error approaches are indeed able to establish considerable native species diversity during mineland rehabilitation. Furthermore, the partial recovery of the vegetation structure suggests the gradual return of soil functions in the long term, and the presence of zoochorous species is expected to attract seed-dispersing animals that enable gene flow as well as the arrival of additional plant species. Nevertheless, the high cover values of alien exotic species, which are negatively correlated with the diversity of the reinstated communities, endanger the success of mineland rehabilitation in the Urucum Massif, and effective control methods for invasive populations are required. These efforts should be accompanied by enrichment plantings to maintain the diversity of native plant communities at the rehabilitation sites and ongoing environmental monitoring.

AB  - Sediment contaminants were monitored in Milford Haven Waterway (MHW) since 1978 (hydrocarbons) and 1982 (metals), with the aim of providing surveillance of environmental quality in one of the UK's busiest oil and gas ports. This aim is particularly important during and after large-scale investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. However, the methods inevitably have changed over the years, compounding the difficulties of coordinating sampling and analytical programmes. After a review by the MHW Environmental Surveillance Group (MHWESG), sediment hydrocarbon chemistry was investigated in detail in 2010. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) contributed their MHW data for 2007 and 2012, collected to assess the condition of the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) designated under the European Union Habitats Directive. Datasets during 2007-2012 have thus been more comparable. The results showed conclusively that a MHW-wide peak in concentrations of sediment polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals and other contaminants occurred in late 2007. This was corroborated by independent annual monitoring at one centrally located station with peaks in early 2008 and 2011. The spatial and temporal patterns of recovery from the 2007 peak, shown by MHW-wide surveys in 2010 and 2012, indicate several probable causes of contaminant trends, as follows: atmospheric deposition, catchment runoff, sediment resuspension from dredging, and construction of two LNG terminals and a power station. Adverse biological effects predictable in 2007 using international sediment quality guidelines were independently tested by data from monitoring schemes of more than a decade duration in MHW (starfish, limpets) and in the wider SAC (grey seals). Although not proving cause and effect, many of these potential biological receptors showed a simultaneous negative response to the elevated 2007 contamination following intense dredging activity in 2006. Wetland bird counts were typically at a peak in the winter of 2005-2006 previous to peak dredging. In the following winter 2006-2007, shelduck in the Pembroke River showed their lowest winter count, and spring 2007 was the largest ever drop in numbers of shelduck broods across MHW between successive breeding seasons. Wigeon counts in the Pembroke River were low in 2006-2007 and in late 2012 after further dredging nearby. These results are strongly supported by PAH data reported previously from invertebrate bioaccumulation studies in MHW 2007-2010, themselves closely reflecting sediment trends for PAHs in the Pembroke River and Angle Bay.

AB  - Background: Cultivation is the most appropriate management option when both demand and harvesting of wild plant species increase beyond natural production levels. In the current study we made the assumption that, besides the intrinsic biological and ecological characteristics of the species, the decision to cultivate and/or to conserve an overharvested wild plant species is triggered by the socioeconomic factors such as land tenure and size, origin of respondents, gender, and users' knowledge of the plant phenology.
   Methods: We carried out semi-structured interviews with 178 informants involved in V. doniana exploitation. The data collected were related to socio-demographic characteristics of informants' household situation, knowledge of the biology and propagation of the species, willingness to cultivate the species, in-situ maintenance of populations, and costs associated with management of the species. According to data types we used Student's t, Spearman correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's exact and X-2 tests to test the effects of land tenure, origin of respondents, gender and users' knowledge of plant phenology on the decision making process. Conditional inference tree models and generalized additive models were also used to identify variables which were significantly determinant in the decision to cultivate and/or to conserve the species in-situ.
   Results: We found that men were more willing to cultivate the species than women and this is conditioned by land area available. The willingness to conserve the species in-situ depends mainly on the total land area available, the number of trees within the landscape, accessibility of the trees, land tenure, gender, location, seedling cost, and trade-off cost for conservation. People who offered more than one US dollar to acquire a seedling of V. doniana, landowners, and those who own a total land area in excess of 6.5 ha were most willing to conserve the species in-situ.
   Conclusions: From our findings we conclude that future management and conservation initiatives for V. doniana should first target specific user groups for sustainable exploitation of the species. Also, the Cultivation Opportunity Ratio is an important indicator for quick determination of the likelihood of farmers to engage into cultivation and conservation of the species.

AB  - Understanding changes in landscape productivity patterns is critical for management of ecosystems, characterising biodiversity, and monitoring climate change. Vegetation productivity, a key functional component of terrestrial ecosystems, can be readily monitored using remote sensing and can also be combined with other spatial information, such as land cover and topography, to provide a more comprehensive understanding, at the landscape scale, of ecosystem dynamics. Ontario is the second largest and most populated province in Canada covering approximately 1 million km(2) with a population of 13 million. Befitting such a large and complex area, Ontario is characterised by high environmental and land cover diversity. In order to assess temporal trends in vegetation productivity across the province we utilised a series of 10-day composites of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS) fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) over a 6-year period (2003-2008). Indicators of annual productivity, seasonality and the minimum amount of vegetated cover were all calculated from the WAR time-series to evaluate vegetation condition. To define the level of observed natural variability and areas which fall within, and beyond, the variability thresholds, we utilised the Theil-Sen's non-parametric statistical trend test. Results indicate that over the 6-year period decreasing trends in productivity dominated the Ontario landscape. Using spatial data layers of potential drivers of vegetation variability, we found that different land cover types exhibited significantly different trend amplitudes and proportions with elevation a significant correlate for most of the observed trends. Distance from nearest road or human settlement, indicative of anthropogenic drivers, was not significantly related to the observed trends. Recent and older burn areas were linked to decreasing and increasing trends in satellite derived productivity respectively. Our findings suggest that characterising trends in landscape productivity patterns over large areas is possible using remote sensing technology and the integration of productivity trends with explanatory spatial data sets can provide insights into drivers of productivity dynamics. These insights can aid in provincial and national monitoring activities as well as be used to focus more detailed analysis to regions of specific interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense is a common, recurring harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in the Gulf of Maine. To date, most physiological measurements of phytoplankton in the field provide data on the entire community, yet efforts to obtain species-specific data are particularly important for understanding the ecological and physiological dynamics of HAB species, such as, Alexandrium. Alexandrium spp., do not usually dominate the planktonic community in the Gulf of Maine, but are of great interest due to the potent toxins produced. In order to determine the nutritional status of Alexandrium spp. in natural populations, indicators of nutrient deprivation need to be identified that are specific to that one species. To date, the saxitoxin content of A. fundyense is known to vary under different environmental conditions such as nitrogen and phosphorous limitation. However, in batch culture the composition of the toxin (the relative amounts of each saxitoxin derivative per cell) appears to be a stable quantity and thus is sometimes viewed as a biochemical marker of individual strains. In more recent studies, toxin composition has been shown to vary during progressive N- and P-limitation, once the cells are given time to achieve steady state in semi-continuous, nutrient-limited cultures. Using both the absolute toxin concentrations and relative proportion (mole % total toxin) of each toxin derivative, N- and P-limitation can be distinguished based on the observed trends in the different saxitoxin derivatives. In this study, we examine the toxin content and composition in natural A. fundyense populations during a spring bloom in Casco Bay, ME from April-June of 1998. This allows us to examine whether A. fundyense populations in the western Gulf of Maine are sufficiently homogenous to permit the detection of toxin composition and toxin content differences through time and space, and if so, to determine whether those changes are indicative of a particular nutritional state (e.g., N-limitation). Using both toxin composition and toxin ratios determined from field samples during an A. fundyense bloom, the ratios generally correlated with N-limitation in the Casco Bay region.

AB  - Metals are common contaminants worldwide. Long-term deposition of metals in soils can lead to accumulation, transport and biotoxicity/zootoxicity caused by mobility and bioavailability of significant fraction of the metals. Contaminant bioavailability is increasingly being used as a key indicator of potential risk that contaminants pose to both environmental and human health. However, the definition of bioavailability and the concepts on which it is based are still unclear, the methods adopted for its measurement vary and as such there is no single standard technique for the assessment of either plant availability of contaminants or their ecotoxicological impacts on soil biota. Moreover, bioavailability is often assumed to be static in nature where most decisions on risk and remediation are based on laboratory estimations of the bioavailable fraction, which may vary with time, nature of species as well as with temporal variation in environmental factors. Because of their immutable nature, strict natural attenuation processes alone may not be sufficient in mitigating the risks from metals. However, accelerating these processes with human interference (i.e., assisted natural remediation) that effectively immobilizes metals might be a viable option. Application to soils of certain amendments that enhance key biogeochemical processes in soils that effectively immobilize metals have already been demonstrated in Europe and North America on a field scale. Case studies using lime, phosphate and biosolid amendments have demonstrated, under field conditions, enhanced natural remediation resulting in substantially improved vegetation growth, invigorated microbial population and diversity, and reduced offsite metal transport. Depending on soil/hydrogeochemical properties, source term and metal form/species, and land use, the immobilization efficacy induced by such assisted natural remediation may be enduring. The use of green plants as a remediation tool in environmental cleanup has also offered some potential. Plants can uptake and bioaccumulate (phytoextraction) as well as immobilize (phytoimmobilization) certain trace elements, in conjunction with their rhizospheric processes. While long-term stability of certain metal complexes, such as metal pyromorphites has been shown in model systems, the influence of plant roots and its microbial and mycorrhizal association on such stability is unknown. A suite of chemical and biological tests are available to monitor the efficacy of assisted natural remediation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior to registration and commercialization, crop protection products (CPP) need to be tested for their environmental impact and fate. For fate studies, laboratory microcosm experiments are performed with defined natural soils. Quality control of these soils represents a challenge, since it is often difficult to obtain fresh soil and soil storage may affect soil characteristics. According to guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) frozen storage is recommended for periods exceeding three months. The present study was per-formed to investigate the influence of soil frozen storage on microbiological soil characteristics (MSCs) and CPP mineralization rates. For this purpose an agricultural soil was frozen for four days, thawed, and subsequently equilibrated and monitored during 42 days under controlled conditions. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rates increased shortly after thawing and returned to reference levels within ten days. Degradation of the CPP methidathion appeared unaffected in the soils that had been frozen. Conversely, we found that soil DNA contents and direct cell counts decreased by 24 and 22%, respectively, in the frozen stored soil. Impacts on soil microbial population structures were analyzed by use of domain-specific PCR of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes for Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea in conjunction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Since the Archaea community appeared most sensitive to the freezing stress, cloning and sequencing was performed to identify marker genes for freezing stress sensitive and resistant groups. Novel specific PCR detections were developed for a freezing stress resistant and a freezing stress sensitive group. These new tools allowed monitoring and comparison of archaeal population shifts without using RFLP analysis. Over all, the molecular biological approach revealed that the initial MSCs were not restored after 42 days equilibration of the frozen soil, even though SIR rates and mineralization of one specific CPP appeared unaffected. Our results demonstrate that specific molecular tools can identify sensitive indicators of altered MSCs and may be applied for the description of stress effects that can occur during soil storage.

AB  - Due to relatively long development and long life of forest-forming species most of the conclusions on stand dynamics are based on the data collected by indirect methods of comparative research and analysis of cenosis forming theoretically temporal and spatial succession sequences and need to be verified and clarified. The most reliable results on the stand dynamics can be received on stationary objects such as permanent sample areas. The article presents the analysis results of long-term monitoring (1968-2012) of a pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in low-mountain Eastern Sayan on the south slope with a steepness of 7-8 degrees. The intermittent test of morphometric indicators of trees mapped on the permanent sample area was used. It is shown that the sum of tree trunk cross-section areas at breast height (1.3 m) varied by no more than 10 % with timber reserves on the lower, central and upper equal sites of the sample area during the entire observation period. At the same time heterogeneity of ecological conditions, taking place even on a small section of a smooth slope, influences the plantation self-thinning intensity. In the 42-year-old stand density ratio at lower, central and upper sites was 1:1.5:2.1. Stand density difference along the slope had been decreasing gradually over time, although it remained around 30 % at the time of the last observation. Over the years of observation, 53, 47, and 32 % of pines on the lower, central, and upper sites, respectively, have survived. The calculated average age of the died trees showed that in all groups of natural diameter classes, there was an earlier die-off of pines at the bottom of the slope with an increase in dying age up to the slope. Trees with larger trunk diameter (first telling) died later. All this led to a rearrangement of the horizontal structure of the plantation, a decrease in the average diameter and average volume of trees up to the slope. Typical for mountain forests clinal tree distribution, which affects their morphological indicators, is important to consider when studying and modeling forest ecosystems, as well as when implementing forest management measures.

AB  - Tropical peatlands play an important role in carbon storage and in water regulation on a landscape level. However, our understanding of their ecology and long-term hydrological dynamics remains limited. Transfer functions, constructed on the basis of biological indicators (proxies) with known ecological preferences, allow us to infer past environmental conditions and serve as a basis for prediction of future changes in peatlands. Here, we use testate amoebae to develop the first species- and functional trait-based transfer functions for the Southeast Asia. This provides a valuable tool for future reconstructions of past hydrological changes in tropical peatlands, their development, and climatic changes. Surface samples for testate amoeba analysis were taken in various biotopes along two transects across the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra. The following environmental characteristics were measured: water table depth (WTD), light intensity, pH, total C and N concentrations. The analysis of the surface samples revealed 145 morphotypes of testate amoebae belonging to 25 genera. A significant fraction of the variance in testate amoeba morphotypes and functional trait composition was explained by WTD and pH. The wide WTD range (0-120 cm) seems more valuable for reconstruction than the extremely short pH gradient (2.5-3.8). Thus, transfer functions were developed only for WTD, based on weighted averaging model for morphotypes and multiple linear regression for functional traits. Both species- and trait-based model have a predictive ability for WTD reconstruction. For traits, the best performance of the model was reached by including five morphological traits: shell width, aperture shape, aperture invagination, shell shape and shell compression. We discuss the ecology of several taxa and highlight the traits, which reflect hydrological changes in this system. Though the hydrological preferences of some species are similar to those in high and middle latitude peatlands, we argue that latitudinal differences in morphospecies composition and variations in environmental relationships of species require the development of region-specific transfer functions. Moreover, our results indicate that ecological preferences of morphotypes within morphospecies also need to be considered and included in future studies.

AB  - Regulatory policies in many parts of the world recognize either the utility of or the mandate that all available studies be considered in environmental or ecological hazard and risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals, including studies from the peer-reviewed literature. Consequently, a vast array of different studies and data types need to be considered. The first steps in the evaluation process involve determining whether the study is relevant to the ERA and sufficiently reliable. Relevance evaluation is typically performed using existing guidance but involves application of expert judgment by risk assessors. In the present paper, we review published guidance for relevance evaluation and, on the basis of the practical experience within the group of authors, we identify additional aspects and further develop already proposed aspects that should be considered when conducting a relevance assessment for ecotoxicological studies. From a regulatory point of view, the overarching key aspect of relevance concerns the ability to directly or indirectly use the study in ERA with the purpose of addressing specific protection goals and ultimately regulatory decision making. Because ERA schemes are based on the appropriate linking of exposure and effect estimates, important features of ecotoxicological studies relate to exposure relevance and biological relevance. Exposure relevance addresses the representativeness of the test substance, environmental exposure media, and exposure regime. Biological relevance deals with the environmental significance of the test organism and the endpoints selected, the ecological realism of the test conditions simulated in the study, as well as a mechanistic link of treatment-related effects for endpoints to the protection goal identified in the ERA. In addition, uncertainties associated with relevance should be considered in the assessment. A systematic and transparent assessment of relevance is needed for regulatory decision making. The relevance aspects also need to be considered by scientists when designing, performing, and reporting ecotoxicological studies to facilitate their use in ERA.

DREYER (Department of Botany and The Goodwin-Niering Center for Conservation Biology and Environmental Studies, Connecticut College, CT 06320). Vegetation classification and invasive species distribution in natural areas of southern New England. J. Torrey Bet. Soc. 136: 500-519. 2009.-Invasive plant species pose serious threats to ecosystem function and community diversity, dominating many natural systems through Suppression or, competition with, and replacement of native species. This study examines the distribution of invasive alien plant species relative to vegetation, site characteristics, and disturbance indicators in a relatively unfragmented matrix forest block (similar to 8,000 ha) in southern New England and provides the first quantitative description of the forested vegetation of this region. Within 139 - 10 X 10 in sample plots, percent ground coverage was estimated for each vascular plant species and basal area determined for all woody species reaching breast height (1.4 m). Site conditions, including topography, soil moisture and fertility, and evidence of current and historical site disturbance, were assessed to identify factors influencing invasive plant abundance. Fifteen relatively distinct vegetation types were identified using NMS ordination and cluster analysis, including wetland forest, terrestrial open woodland, and terrestrial closed canopy vegetation types. Of the 209 species occurring in sample plots, only 10 (4.8%) were invasive. Most abundant were Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Rosa multiflora, each occurring in 5% or fewer plots. Moist sites were invaded most frequently, especially those with high species richness, lower canopy cover, and those dominated by Acer rubrum or Pinus strobus. Site disturbance, particularly roads, trails, and former land use, also was correlated with invasive abundance. The low frequency of invasive plant Species in Our study area offers an exceptional opportunity to identify ecosystem characteristics inhibitory to invasive plant species and the opportunity to preserve a series of relatively unfragmented and uninvaded natural habitats in this region.

AB  - Despite the recognition of the usefulness of BACI designs for assessing environmental impacts, there are few examples because of the need for repetitive sampling over long time periods. Our examination of the application of a BACI design to detect the impacts of elevated seawater temperature from the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in central California on rocky intertidal communities showed statistically significant changes in a large percentage of the species analyzed. The statistical power of the analysis resulted from both the large numbers of surveys before and during plant operation and from other design features that made the study resilient to the effects of two "100-year" storms, several ENSO warming events, and the highly variable nature of the impacts. The large data set from the study required the development of decision rules for determining- the appropriate surveys, stations, and species to analyze. BACI analyses were used to test the effects of the thermal plume on 47 algal and 50 invertebrate data sets. There were statistically significant effects for 79% of the algal and 60% of the invertebrate data sets. At the impact sites, there was a loss of cover by foliose algae and increases in crustose forms. Many invertebrates, particularly grazing gastropods, increased in abundance. Multivariate analysis of the community showed that there was continual change in impact sites that lasted throughout the study. The nature, magnitude, and spatial extent of the effects identified from the study are being used to determine appropriate plant modifications or mitigation for the effects of discharge. This study illustrates many of the problems in analyzing environmental effects and clearly demonstrates the need for long-term monitoring. This was especially true for this study, where storms and ENSO events affected our ability to analyze data from some of the stations, and points out the importance of having redundancies built into monitoring programs. The complex interactions among the direct effects of the discharge, indirect community-level effects, and variation due to oceanographic conditions provide useful insights for planning impact assessments and other ecological studies, and help contribute toward science-based regulation and management.

AB  - Important ecological functions indicators, such as nitrate net balance (NNB), including nitrate removal (NR) and nitrate production (NP), seem to be impacted by human stressors and climate change, particularly during low flow periods associated with high nitrate pollution. NR is induced by in-stream processes such as nitrate uptake, denitrification, and transient storage. These processes are usually investigated by means of in-situ measurements, but the evaluation on a large scale is not yet developed. Hence, the objectives of this study are (i) to validate a model that quantifies NR indicator in a reach at a monthly time step in the Garonne watershed; (ii) use this model to quantify NR in all reaches at watershed scale; (iii) to analyze NR spatially and temporally at the reach scale, and finally (iv) to identify drivers influencing NR patterns. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the impact of human stressors such as land management and municipalities effluents on in-stream nitrogen cycles. The results show the seasonal variation of NR and NP ranging between - 1.77 gN.m(-2).d(-1) and + 1.62 gN.m(-2).d(-1). NR is stronger during the spring and summer periods (median of - 0.1 gN.m(-2).d(-1)). The hot spots of NP are located downstream in the main rivers whereas NR strongly occurs in small reaches of lowlands and intermediate streams defined by a Strahler order between 3 and 5 and a slope under 0.5%. NR is stronger in hillsides areas such as forests, wetlands and surprisingly agricultural areas and NP increases down in the municipalities due to the effluents. The spatio-temporal variability of NR makes the validation of the model for reaches with Strahler number more difficult than the measured one. However, this study shows that the NNB dynamics in time and space depend on a combination of influencing factors (slope, discharge and hydraulic condition explained by Froude number and nitrate concentration). Investigating a relationship between NR, river characteristics and land management is a promising way to support stakeholders in water management decisions and increase awareness and involvement of people for sustainable management of water resources.

AB  - Patagonia is commonly seen as an exceptionally pristine area because of its wildlife and practically unpolluted waters. However, during the twentieth century the burning of natural forests was one of the most important human activities in Northern Chilean Patagonia. Some estimations indicate that three million hectares were burned during the first three decades of the century. Hence the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of the historical fires in Lake Burgos (45A(0)42'S) and Lake Thompson (45A(0)38'S) in Chilean Patagonia. The impact was measured by evaluating chironomid assemblage since they are sensitive enough to be used as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health. Fires have a direct and drastic effect on a lake watershed but also indirectly affect a lake ecosystem, changing sedimentation patterns or increasing nutrient inputs. In the studied lakes the periods with higher prevalence of fires were identified by charcoal analysis, while organic matter and magnetic susceptibility allowed the confirmation of pre-fire and post-fire periods. The chironomid composition was evaluated through a PCA and an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to test the significance among periods while a Detrended Correspondence Analysis was applied to the chironomid assemblage downcore to assess compositional structure and taxa turnover. In Lake Burgos the ANOSIM test indicated significant differences between the pre-fire and fire periods (p < 0.05), while in Lake Thompson differences were not significant. However, in Lake Thompson the PCA clearly separated the pre-fire from the fire period but not the fire from the post-fire periods. In both lakes chironomid composition changed in relation to the period of higher prevalence of fires, which in turn implies catchment changes, pollution, and other anthropogenic impacts. Particularly a marked change in mesotrophic/eutrophic taxa was detected, reflecting an increase in nutrient input due to deforestation. Our findings point out that the lacustrine ecosystems are still affected by the impact of fires and the subsequent increase in nutrient supply that occurred almost 50 years ago. No sign of reverting to pre-disturbance conditions was observed, which makes these lakes highly sensitive to current human-induced impacts.

AB  - Over the past two decades, several species have undergone distributional shifts in the southern Benguela. The commercially-important West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii is one of these, and its shift in distribution has had profound effects on the rest of the ecosystem along the south-west coast. Reasons for these shifts are not fully understood, but are probably linked to changes in environmental conditions. We applied a sequential t-test algorithm for analyzing regime shifts (STARS) to physical (wind and upwelling) and biological (rock-lobster catch and growth, Bank Cormorant abundance) data for the southern Benguela inshore region and performed sensitivity tests on each of the variables. Regime shifts were defined as 'robust' or 'possible' if they were detected for >= 70% or >= 60% of the sensitivity tests respectively. To corroborate the shifts detected by STARS, we then applied two additional methods: change point analysis and the Chow breakpoint test. The STARS method outperformed the other two methods because it could handle shorter time series and detect shifts towards the end of the time series, but most of the significant shifts detected by STARS were also detected by one or both of the other methods. A significant shift in Cape Point winter winds occurred in 1983, an El Nino year. However, measurement methodology changed during the same period and this is discussed in relation to the shift. A decline in rock-lobster growth rate occurred in the mid 1980s, and significant increases in upwelling variability and mean summer winds were detected in the early-to-mid 1990s - the same period in which rock lobster abundance underwent an eastward shift, declining on the west coast and increasing on the southwest coast. Bank Cormorants underwent respective declines and increases in the mid-to-late 1990s on the west and south-west coasts following the shift in lobsters. Further shifts in mean wind and upwelling were detected in the 2000s. These results are a step towards developing ecosystem indicators for the region, which can be monitored with the intended use of providing an early warning system for long-term, ecosystem-scale changes.

AB  - The success of simple predictive relationships such as the Vollenweider plot in limnology has encouraged marine ecologists to attempt to develop similar models relating pollutant inputs to ecological conditions in estuaries. Most of these efforts have focused on relatively deep (>5 m) river mouth estuaries and embayments where primary production is dominated by phytoplankton. Experimental nutrient enrichment studies of phytoplankton-based mesocosms at the Marine Ecosystems Research Laboratory (MERL) have confirmed that simple Vollenweider type relationships can be found between the rate of input of inorganic nutrients and annual mean chlorophyll concentrations and primary production. However, much of the coastline of the U.S. is characterized by estuarine ecosystems that are very shallow, and where most of the primary production is carried out by angiosperms, such as eelgrass, Zostera marina, epiphytic algae, drift and attached macroalgae, and epibenthic microalgae, rather than by phytoplankton. We have not been able to find useful relationships between nutrient input and the type of plant providing most of the primary production or between nutrient input and the amount of primary production in such shallow lagoon systems. Attempting to adjust nutrient loading for varying hydraulic residence time did not improve the models. Experimental studies using shallow lagoon mesocosms have shown that there is a large variation in the abundance of the various plant forms in these very shallow systems, and that simple Vollenweider models are not likely to emerge for this type of environment. However, it does seem that total system production increases with nutrient enrichment at very low rates of input, and that eelgrass does not persist when exposed to even moderate levels of fertilization. Zostera responds to inorganic nitrogen enrichment and to shading by increasing the rate of leaf elongation and decreasing the allocation of resources to below ground roots and rhizomes. This reduces or eliminates lateral branching of the rhizomes and causes a decline in the density of shoots. Based on mesocosm studies, we propose several indicators of eelgrass health, including the rate of leaf elongation, plant density, and the shoot: root biomass ratio that all deserve further study and field testing.

AB  - The annual phytoplankton bloom is an important marine event and its inter-annual variability can be used to monitor changes in the pelagic ecosystem. In this context, the use of a bio-regionalization analysis to objectively identify ocean areas that differ in their biological characteristics and environmental conditions may be useful to disentangle the functioning of the ecosystem. In this work, satellite surface chlorophyll-alpha concentration observations were used to obtain a bio-regionalization of the Labrador Sea (LS). Specifically, bioregions were defined using a K-means cluster analysis applied on the satellite time-series of chlorophyll-alpha concentration. Finally, the resulting biologically regionalization was used in conjunction with simulated data from a state-ofthe-art ocean circulation model (NEMO) to investigate difference in spring bloom timing response across the Labrador Sea (LS). Chlorophyll-alpha seasonal cycle in the LS varies markedly between two neighboring but distinct bioregions: the north (> 60 degrees N) and the south (< 60 degrees N). The north LS blooms earlier (similar to early-mid April) and more intensely, while the south LS blooms later (similar to May) and its duration may persist all summer long. In the southern LS bioregion, the maximum phytoplankton growth rate (i.e., the initiation of the surface spring bloom) coincides closely with the timing of the first cooling-to-heating shift in air-sea heat fluxes. In this area, the bloom timing tends to precede the shoaling of the mixed-layer depth and the vernal development of the upper ocean stratification. In the southern bioregion, the cooling-to-heating shift in air-sea heat fluxes provided a more suitable indicator for the spring bloom initiation. Meanwhile, in the northern LS bioregion, the early onset of the spring bloom is related to the seasonal evolution (i.e., shoaling) of the mixed-layer depth and precedes the cessation of wintertime cooling. Over the northern bioregion, freshwater exchanges may suppress vertical mixing while the air-sea fluxes are still negative (i.e., ocean cooling). Given the heterogeneity of the LS basin, this study emphasizes the importance to consider the bioregion-specific differences in the upper ocean physical biological interactions.

AB  - Conifers are key species of many boreal and temperate forests, providing crucial resources to human activities. Adaptation to local climate and long life span make tree species highly susceptible to both short- and long-term environmental changes. Thus, a substantial effect of ongoing climate change on forest viability and production potential is expected. A deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control the adaptive ability of forests can be used for management strategies to assist forests through climate change. Indeed, a reliable and systematic genetic assessment of Norway spruce provenances for their response to extreme climatic conditions could be a prerequisite for a successful assisted migration of this species in a changing environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate, by mean of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), the genetic bases of local adaptation along altitudinal gradients in 18 natural Alpine populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst), sampled on a regional scale in Trentino-South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps). To account for patterns of gene flow and spatial genetic structure due to alpine landscape features, sampled stands were subdivided into three geographical groups, each including at least one sampled altitudinal gradient. As expected, hierarchical analyses of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was found within stands, though a little but significant variation was found among geographical groups. To detect potentially adaptive markers, two distinct approaches were used. First, classical outlier loci detection was applied along the altitudinal gradients using both a Bayesian analysis and a Hierarchical Island Model (HIM), which showed contrasting results. Subsequently, Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEM) variables, which may account for spatial variation and un-accounted environmental factors, were applied to an allele distribution model, and 19 loci significantly associated to environmental variation were identified. Four of these loci were also detected as outliers by the HIM. The combined approach of selection scan and spatial analysis method allowed for a parallel investigation of Norway spruce adaptive potential in alpine stands, providing evidence for selective forces acting on adaptive loci that could be relevant in forest management.

AB  - Often termed "acid rain," combined nitrogen and sulfur deposition can directly and indirectly impact the condition and health of forest ecosystems. Researchers use critical loads (CLs) to describe response thresholds, and recent studies on acid-sensitive biological indicators show that forests continue to be at risk from terrestrial acidification. However, rarely are impacts translated into changes in "ecosystem services" that impact human well-being. Further, the relevance of this research to the general public is seldom communicated in terms that can motivate action to protect valuable resources. To understand how changes in biological indicators affect human well-being, we used the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to quantitatively and qualitatively link CL exceedances to ecosystem service impacts. We specified the cause-and-effect ecological processes linking changes in biological indicators to final ecosystem services. The Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) was used within the STEPS Framework to classify the ecosystem component and the beneficiary class that uses or values the component. We analyzed two acid-sensitive tree species, balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white ash (Fraxinus americana), that are common in northeastern USA. These well-known species provide habitat for animals and popular forest products that are relatable to a broad audience. We identified 160 chains with 10 classes of human beneficiaries for balsam fir and white ash combined, concluding that there are resources at risk that the public may value. Two stories resulting from these explorations into the cascading effects of acid rain on terrestrial resources are ideal for effective science communication: the relationship between (1) balsam fir as a popular Christmas tree and habitat for the snowshoe hare, a favorite of wildlife viewers, and (2) white ash because it is used for half of all baseball bats, fine wood products, and musical instruments. Thus, rather than focusing on biological indicators that may only be understood or appreciated by specific stakeholders or experts, this approach extends the analysis to include impacts on FEGS and humans. It also lays the foundation for developing stakeholder-specific narratives, quantitative measures of endpoints, and for conducting demand-based valuations of affected ecosystem services.

AB  - In May of 1998, Owen Bricker and his co-author Michael Ruggiero introduced a conceptual design for integrating the Nation's environmental research and monitoring programs. The Framework for Integrated Monitoring and Related Research was an organizing strategy for relating data collected by various programs, at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and by multiple science disciplines to solve complex ecological issues that individual research or monitoring programs were not designed to address. The concept nested existing intensive monitoring and research stations within national and regional surveys, remotely sensed data, and inventories to produce a collaborative program for multi-scale, multi-network integrated environmental monitoring and research. Analyses of gaps in data needed for specific issues would drive decisions on network improvements or enhancements. Data contributions to the Framework from existing networks would help indicate critical research and monitoring programs to protect during budget reductions. Significant progress has been made since 1998 on refining the Framework strategy. Methods and models for projecting scientific information across spatial and temporal scales have been improved, and a few regional pilots of multi-scale data-integration concepts have been attempted. The links between science and decision-making are also slowly improving and being incorporated into science practice. Experiments with the Framework strategy since 1998 have revealed the foundational elements essential to its successful implementation, such as defining core measurements, establishing standards of data collection and management, integrating research and long-term monitoring, and describing baseline ecological conditions. They have also shown us the remaining challenges to establishing the Framework concept: protecting and enhancing critical long-term monitoring, filling gaps in measurement methods, improving science for decision support, and integrating the disparate integrated science efforts now underway. In the 15 years since the Bricker and Ruggiero (Ecol Appl 8(2):326-329, 1998) paper challenged us with a new paradigm for bringing sound and comprehensive science to environmental decisions, the scientific community can take pride in the progress that has been made, while also taking stock of the challenges ahead for completing the Framework vision.

AB  - A basic requirement for allowing marine aggregate (sand) extraction on the Belgian Continental Shelf (which takes place on sandbanks) is that it should not result in major environmental changes However a tidal sandbank (Kwinte Bank Flemish Banks) exploited intensively since the 1970 9 has shown evidence of significant morphological changes with the development of a 5 m deep depression in its middle section thus since February 2003 sand extraction has ceased in this area in order to study the environmental impacts and the regeneration potential of the seabed The present contribution synthesises the results of the multidisciplinary research which has taken place in the area and on the basis of these findings considers the need for an efficient management framework in both the planning and monitoring stages of the extraction The investigation has shown that extraction has had significant impacts on the seabed sedimentary character and ecology and the local hydro and sediment dynamic regime Under these conditions regeneration of the seabed is not likely in the short term and although modelling exercises have indicated possible recovery in the medium and long term this is likely to be inhibited by the lack of appropriate sediments in the area The results have provided the basis of the identification of a suite of cruel la which can assist in the strategic planning/design of marine aggregate concession zones the efficient management of marine aggregate extraction and the planning of effective environmental monitoring these criteria are related to considerations on resource location the nature/thickness of the targeted deposits morphodynamics and sediment dynamics biology and ecology and extraction practices The Kwinte Bank investigation has demonstrated also the need for intensive monitoring schemes in order to identify the morphological sedimentary and ecological impacts related to the dredging activities A critical part of these schemes should be the evaluation of the (hedging related effects against the background of the natural dynamics of the seabed thus baseline information is crucial as in its absence impact assessments are likely to remain inconclusive

AB  - Natural kilometer-scale spatial variability and seasonal variability in deep-sea sediments at similar to 5000m depth was studied at two reference sites in the Central Indian Basin. Biochemical parameters such as the labile organic matter (LOM) (consisting of carbohydrates, protein and lipids) and total organic matter (TOM) and biological parameters such as total counts of bacteria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were estimated after an interval of 54 months. These were compared with nine locations (12-17 km away) where an artificial sediment disturbance was created by a hydraulic benthic disturber. Besides the above-mentioned parameters, extracellular enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase and lipase were also monitored at these nine locations. Post-disturbance (PoD1) observations were carried out immediately after the benthic disturbance experiment and compared with the pre-disturbance (PreD) pattern. The restoration process in the test site was studied after a period of 44 months (PoD2). There was a drastic reduction in total counts of bacteria, ATP, carbohydrates and lipids accompanied by a two- to four-fold increase in protein content at the undisturbed reference sites after 54 months. A similar reduction in these parameters was observed in the PoD1 compared to the PreD stage at the test site. An initial increase in TOM content and in the activities of three extracellular enzymes in the PoD1 stage was followed by a reduction in TOM, ATP and organic P content and activities of the extracellular enzymes in the PoD2 phase (i.e. after 44 months). Reduction in ATP levels suggests a negative impact of resedimentation on living biomass in the sediments. Although LOM, protein concentrations and the protein/carbohydrate ratio increased in the PoD2 phase relative to the PoD1 phase, the bacterial numbers were below the concentrations in the PreD stage, indicating slow restoration of benthic conditions. Long-term analyses of the indicator parameters thus showed mixed effects of sediment disturbance. A similar pattern at the undisturbed reference location suggests that natural (seasonal) variability outweighed artificial variability caused by the benthic disturbance in the Central Indian Basin and the former is responsible for bringing about changes in deep-sea benthic ecosystem on long-time scales.

AB  - This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the response of different components to the environment will aid in identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO2, nitrogen additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes, and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental conditions.

AB  - Screening is a strategy for detecting undesirable change prior to manifestation of symptoms or adverse effects. Although the well-recognized utility of screening makes it commonplace in medicine, it has yet to be implemented in ecosystem management. Ecosystem management is in an era of diagnosis and treatment of undesirable change, and as a result, remains more reactive than proactive and unable to effectively deal with today's plethora of non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we introduce spatial imaging-based screening to ecology. We link advancements in spatial resilience theory, data, and technological and computational capabilities and power to detect regime shifts (i.e., vegetation state transitions) that are known to be detrimental to human well-being and ecosystem service delivery. With a state-of-the-art landcover dataset and freely available, cloud-based, geospatial computing platform, we screen for spatial signals of the three most iconic vegetation transitions studied in western USA rangelands: (1) erosion and desertification; (2) woody encroachment; and (3) annual exotic grass invasion. For a series of locations that differ in ecological complexity and geographic extent, we answer the following questions: (1) Which regime shift is expected or of greatest concern? (2) Can we detect a signal associated with the expected regime shift? (3) If detected, is the signal transient or persistent over time? (4) If detected and persistent, is the transition signal stationary or non-stationary over time? (5) What other signals do we detect? Our approach reveals a powerful and flexible methodology, whereby professionals can use spatial imaging to verify the occurrence of alternative vegetation regimes, image the spatial boundaries separating regimes, track the magnitude and direction of regime shift signals, differentiate persistent and stationary transition signals that warrant continued screening from more concerning persistent and non-stationary transition signals, and leverage disciplinary strength and resources for more targeted diagnostic testing (e.g., inventory and monitoring) and treatment (e.g., management) of regime shifts. While the rapid screening approach used here can continue to be implemented and refined for rangelands, it has broader implications and can be adapted to other ecological systems to revolutionize the information space needed to better manage critical transitions in nature.

AB  - 1. The NDVI is a remotely sensed vegetation index that is frequently used in ecological studies. There is, however, a lack of studies that evaluate the ability of the NDVI to detect fine-scale variation in grassland plant community composition and species richness. Ellenberg indicators characterize the environmental preferences of plant speciesand community-mean Ellenberg values have been used to explore the environmental drivers of community assembly.
   2. We used variation partitioning to test the ability of satellite-based NDVI to explain community-mean Ellenberg nutrient (mN) and moisture (mF) indices, and the richness of habitat-specialist species in dry grasslands of different ages. The grasslands represent a gradient of decreasing soil nutrient status.
   3. If community composition is determined by the responses of individual species to the underlying environmental conditions and if, at the same time, community composition determines the optical characteristics of the vegetation canopy, then positive relationships between the NDVI and mN and mF are expected. Many grassland specialists are intolerant of nutrient-rich soils. If specialist richness is negatively related to soil-nutrient levels, then a negative association between the NDVI and specialist richness is expected. However, because grassland community composition is not only influenced by abiotic variables but also by other spatial and temporal drivers, we included spatial variables and grassland age in the statistical analyses.
   4. The NDVI explained the majority of the variation in mF, and also contributed to a substantial proportion of the variation in mN. However, variation in specialist richness and the lowest values of mN were explained by grassland age and spatial variablesbut were poorly explained by the NDVI.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The NDVI showed a good ability to detect variation in plant community composition, and should provide a valuable tool for assessing fine-scale environmental variation in grasslands or for monitoring changes in grassland habitat properties. However, because the concentration of grassland specialists not only depends on environmental variables but also on the age and spatial context of the grasslands, the NDVI is unlikely to allow the identification of grasslands with high numbers of specialist species.

AB  - Rockstrom et al. (2009a, 2009b) have warned that humanity must reduce anthropogenic impacts defined by nine planetary boundaries if "unacceptable global change" is to be avoided. Chemical pollution was identified as one of those boundaries for which continued impacts could erode the resilience of ecosystems and humanity. The central concept of the planetary boundary (or boundaries) for chemical pollution (PBCP or PBCPs) is that the Earth has a finite assimilative capacity for chemical pollution, which includes persistent as well as readily degradable chemicals released at local to regional scales, which in aggregate threaten ecosystem and human viability. The PBCP allows humanity to explicitly address the increasingly global aspects of chemical pollution throughout a chemical's life cycle and the need for a global response of internationally coordinated control measures. We submit that sufficient evidence shows stresses on ecosystem and human health at local to global scales, suggesting that conditions are transgressing the safe operating space delimited by a PBCP. As such, current local to global pollution control measures are insufficient. However, while the PBCP is an important conceptual step forward, at this point single or multiple PBCPs are challenging to operationalize due to the extremely large number of commercial chemicals or mixtures of chemicals that cause myriad adverse effects to innumerable species and ecosystems, and the complex linkages between emissions, environmental concentrations, exposures and adverse effects. As well, the normative nature of a PBCP presents challenges of negotiating pollution limits amongst societal groups with differing viewpoints. Thus, a combination of approaches is recommended as follows: develop indicators of chemical pollution, for both control and response variables, that will aid in quantifying a PBCP(s) and gauging progress towards reducing chemical pollution; develop new technologies and technical and social approaches to mitigate global chemical pollution that emphasize a preventative approach; coordinate pollution control and sustainability efforts; and facilitate implementation of multiple (and potentially decentralized) control efforts involving scientists, civil society, government, non-governmental organizations and international bodies.

AB  - Steroids with unconventional side chains have increasingly been applied as diagnostic markers for geological source and age assessments. However, one of the most distinctive characteristics, the abnormal abundance of pregnane and homopregnane in ancient sediments and petroleum, remains unresolved. Higher pregnane and homopregnane, as well as C-23-C-26 20-n-alkylpregnanes, relative to the regular steranes were observed in samples collected from different petroleum basins in China. These included Precambrian marine carbonate-derived petroleum (NW Sichuan Basin), Lower Paleozoic marine marl derived crude oils (Tarim Basin), and Eocene hypersaline lacustrine carbonate source rocks and associated petroleum (Bohai Bay Basin). However, all of the samples have many common biomarker characteristics, such as pristane/phytane ratios < 1, low amounts of diasteranes and high C-29/C-30 hopane (similar to 0.6-1), C-35/C-34 hopane (mostly >= 1) and dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene (DBT/PHEN, mostly 0.5-1) ratios revealing a contribution from anoxic carbonate/marl source rocks deposited in restricted, clastic-starved settings. We suggest that 5 alpha,l4 beta,l7 beta-pregnane and homopregnane, as well as their higher C-23-C-26 homologues, are geological products derived from steroids bound to the kerogen by a sulfurized side chain. Carbon or carbonate minerals are considered to be natural catalysts for this cracking reaction via preferential cleavage of the bond between C-20 and C-22. Similar distributions occur in the short chain analogues of 4-methylsterane, triaromatic steroid and methyltriaromatic steroid hydrocarbons, providing circumstantial evidence for this proposal. The ratio of pregnane and homopregnane to the total regular steranes and the ratio of C-27 diasteranes to cholestanes can be sensitive indicators of sedimentary environments and facies. In general, high diasteranes and low pregnanes (with homologues) indicate an oxic water column or significant input of terrigenous organic matter in clay rich source rocks and some organic lean carbonate rocks. Low diasteranes with high pregnanes implies restricted, sulfur rich conditions, typical of anoxic carbonate source rocks. Furthermore, the two ratios may be useful to assess the variation of mineralogy and openness of source rock depositional settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperate forests with high values for biological conservation, including old-growth and mid-aged (>50 years) semi-natural forests, cover large areas. Many of the forests are protected, and the protected area is expected to increase. The protection efforts need to be supported by research about habitat management. I reviewed >2000 studies of such forests, selecting 150 studies dealing with trees, bushes and forest structure. Of these, 59% gave no recommendation for management; the forest was used as ecological baseline. Minimal intervention was recommended in 8% of the studies. In the remaining studies (33%), active management of many types was proposed. Based on the review and the literature, I suggest four habitat management alternatives: (1) Minimal intervention, the most common form of management, usually allows continued succession and disturbances in the forests. They should develop as old-growth and act as ecological baselines. (2) Traditional management, based on historical reference, is used to create other forest structures that favour biodiversity (e.g. red-listed taxa) related to past cultural landscapes. (3) Non-traditional management is an action to produce old-growth characteristics or specific forest composition, or to favour one or a few tree species which may or may not have been abundant in the past. (4) Species management, for threatened, indicator and other species, and rewilding, is based on one or a small set of species that is valuable or can shape the forest (rewilding may be included in alternative 1, but emphasizes large predators). Depending on forest size and objectives, combinations of these management types may be used. If the concept of ecological restoration is used, which assumes one "best" forest habitat, researchers risk overlooking the importance of evaluating all the alternatives 1-4. There is often not only one correct habitat option for conservation forests. Many more studies of the management alternatives are needed, particularly long-term experiments. In addition, management plans, decisions, and actions in practical management of conservation forests need to be studied, to clarify choices and present conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arthropods form a major part of the biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Many species are valued because they provide ecosystem services, including biological control, pollination and decomposition, or because they are of conservation interest. Some arthropods reduce crop yield and quality, and conventional chemical pesticides, biological control agents and genetically engineered (GE) crops are used to control them. A common concern addressed in the ecological risk assessment (ERA) that precedes regulatory approval of these pest control methods is their potential to adversely affect valued non-target arthropods (NTAs). A key concept of ERA is early-tier testing using worst-case exposure conditions in the laboratory and surrogate test species that are most likely to reveal an adverse effect. If no adverse effects are observed in those species at high exposures, confidence of negligible ecological risk from the use of the pest control method is increased. From experience with chemical pesticides and biological control agents, an approach is proposed for selecting test species for early-tier ERA of GE arthropod-resistant crops. Surrogate species should be selected that most closely meet three criteria: (i) Potential sensitivity: species should be the most likely to be sensitive to the arthropod-active compound based on the known spectrum of activity of the active ingredient, its mode of action, and the phylogenetic relatedness of the test and target species; (ii) Relevance: species should be representative of valued taxa or functional groups that are most likely to be exposed to the arthropod-active compound in the field; and (iii) Availability and reliability: suitable life-stages of the test species must be obtainable in sufficient quantity and quality, and validated test protocols must be available that allow consistent detection of adverse effects on ecologically relevant parameters. Our proposed approach ensures that the most suitable species are selected for testing and that the resulting data provide the most rigorous test of the risk hypothesis of no adverse effect in order to increase the quality and efficiency of ERAs for cultivation of GE crops.

AB  - The size, frequency, and timing of precipitation events are predicted to become more variable worldwide. Despite these predictions, the importance of changes in precipitation in driving multiple above- and belowground ecosystem attributes simultaneously remains largely underexplored. Here, we carried out 3 yr of rainfall manipulations at the DRI-Grass facility, located in a mesic grassland in eastern Australia. Treatments were implemented through automated water reapplication and included +50% and -50% amount, reduced frequency of events, and an extreme summer drought. We evaluated the spatiotemporal responses of multiple ecosystem attributes including microbial biomass, community composition and activity, soil nutrient content and availability, and plant nutritional status to altered rainfall regimes. We found that changing precipitation patterns resulted in multiple direct and indirect changes in microbial communities and soil and plant nutrient content. Main results included greater availability of soil macronutrients and reduced availability of micronutrients under drought, and taxon-specific changes in the composition of soil microbial communities in response to altered rainfall. Moreover, using structural equation modeling, we showed that, in summer 2015, plant macronutrient contents, a widely used ecological indicator of pasture quality, were simultaneously explained by greater soil nutrient availability and the structure of soil microbial communities, and significantly reduced by lower rainfall. Plant micronutrients were also reduced by lower rainfall and explained by changes in microbial attributes. Despite treatment effects on many of the soil, microbial, and plant variables analyzed across the 3 yr of study, many of these ecosystem attributes varied greatly across sampling events. This resulted in many significant interactions between the rainfall treatments and experimental duration, suggesting complex system-level responses to changing rainfall in our grassland, and a high natural buffering capacity of the ecosystem to varying rainfall conditions. Some interactions manifested as changes in the coefficient of variation of ecosystem attributes, particularly in response to changes in the timing of precipitation events and the extreme summer drought. Finally, we posit that a detailed understanding of plant-soil-microbial interactions, and the role of climate in modifying these linkages, will be key for adapting the sustainability of grasslands to a future that will be shaped by climate change.

AB  - Nowadays, there is growing interest in inserting more ecological realism into risk assessment of chemicals. On the exposure evaluation side, this can be done by studying the complexity of exposure in the ecosystem, niche partitioning, e.g. variation of the exposure scenario. Current regulatory predictive approaches, to ensure simplicity and predictive ability, generally keep the scenario as static as possible. This could lead to under or overprediction of chemical exposure depending on the chemical and scenario simulated. To account for more realistic exposure conditions, varying temporally and spatially, additional scenario complexity should be included in currently used models to improve their predictive ability. This study presents two case studies (a terrestrial and an aquatic one) in which some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were simulated with the SoilPlusVeg and ChimERA models to show the importance of scenario variation in time (biotic and abiotic compartments). The results outlined the importance of accounting for planetary boundary layer variation and vegetation dynamics to accurately predict air concentration changes and the timing of chemical dispersion from the source in terrestrial systems. For the aquatic exercise, the results indicated the need to account for organic carbon forms (particulate and dissolved organic carbon) and vegetation biomass dynamics. In both cases the range of variation was up to two orders of magnitude depending on the congener and scenario, reinforcing the need for incorporating such knowledge into exposure assessment.
   Environmental significance
   The general problem addressed in this work is the need for incorporating more environmental dynamics and realism into models and scenarios for exposure assessment. Models employed in exposure assessment, especially in a regulatory context, generally simplify environmental scenarios to keep variability down and provide average predictions. Such values may not really be predictive in many situations, as recently accounted for in an EU Scientific opinion. Here, we focused on the temporal variability of primary producer biomass and environmental parameters in two case studies and showed how such changes can lead to exposure variations up to 1-2 orders of magnitude, highlighting the importance of accounting for dynamics in certain situations.

AB  - Climate change is posing new challenges to conservation because management policies on protected coral reefs are less effective than they were before the current ecosystem degradation. Coral reefs, the most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena, Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and on-site staff, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team gathered to evaluate management effectiveness including biophysical, socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and fish diversity and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a limited efficiency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas, which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35% of the scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience. Social and governance indicators showed low-income levels and few opportunities for communities living in and around the park, low governability, weak communication among stakeholders and with authorities at different levels. As a result, problems related to over exploitation of resources were commonplace in the MPA. These results reflect low adaptive capacity of communities to comply with restrictive conservation rules, showing that establishment of a protected area is a necessary but insufficient condition to guarantee conservation goals. Ignoring the role of local communities only will exacerbate the problems associated with natural resources. Involvement of communities in strategic ecosystems management appears to be a requisite to improve effectiveness of protected areas, and participatory strategies, such as co-management, offer opportunities to improve governability while letting communities adapt to MPA needs.

AB  - The concept of pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) consists of the phenomenon that communities in an ecosystem exhibit increased tolerance as a result of exposure to contaminants. Although a range of 'classic' ecological principles explains the processes that increase tolerance of a community, the value of PICT for ecological risk assessment was recognized only recently (Blanck et al. 1988). The following issues are recognized: First, regarding the question on the role of suspect compounds. causing ecological effects, the PICT approach covers the issue of causality better than 'classical' ecological community response parameters like species densities or species diversity indices. This relates to the fact that the level of PICT is assumed to be relatively constant (compared to density and diversity), whereas the suspect compound causing the observed effect can be deduced with relative clear inference from artificial exposure experiments. Second, PICT directly addresses a level of biological organization (the community), the level of concern for many ecological risk assessment methods. Other methods for risk assessment, like toxicity testing or bioassays, focus on individual or population-level effects, and need extrapolation of the results to the field. Such extrapolation step may pose problems regarding validity of the outcome of risk assessment. The occurrence of PICT is, however, not (yet) a community endpoint that is sufficiently underpinned to trigger risk mitigation activities. This paper especially focuses on the possibility to improve risk assessment approaches by incorporation of PICT assessments, especially focusing on the issue of causality and on the ecological meaning of PICT. Despite the advantages over 'classical' parameters, literature analysis suggests that the PICT approach may be strengthened by determining to which degree the PICT approach relates to ecological changes, like shifts in community structure, functioning, and stability. The aim of this paper is to summarize some literature, putting the emphasis on terrestrial studies, to get insights whether PICT is a sensitive and powerful tool to quantify ecological effects in field conditions, to link them to toxicant stress, and thus to determine whether PICT may be taken into consideration in risk assessment.

AB  - Soil structure formation is among the most important processes in river floodplains which are strongly influenced by alluvial dynamics. In the context of river restoration projects, a better understanding of soil structure formation in habitats adjacent to the river can help to prevent damages caused by riverbank erosion. Ecosystem engineers such as pioneer herbaceous plants and earthworms likely contribute to soil structure formation even despite less favourable environmental conditions. This study aims to assess the capacity of the herbaceous perennial and native species Phalaris arundinacea and earthworm communities to promote a stable soil structure in alluvial sediments, in particular fresh alluvial deposits, in the short term. Delimited plots were set-up in a restored floodplain adjacent to the Thur River in NE Switzerland and exposed to natural alluvial dynamics for 19 months. Four treatments were replicated in a randomised complete block design: (i) plots with Phalaris arundinacea as only vegetation, (ii) plots with all vegetation constantly removed, (iii) and (iv) the earthworm community reduced by mustard treatment, otherwise as (i) and (ii), respectively. Soil structure formation was analysed at the end of the experiment using different indicators: aggregate stability, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and the porosity calculated from X-ray CT reconstructions of freeze cores. Phalaris arundinacea was capable of improving the porosity and aggregate stability of both alluvial sediments present at the beginning of the experiment but also of sediments freshly deposited during the observation period. The latter indicates a structuring effect within only one vegetation period. Earthworm abundance was as a whole very low, most likely due to the large proportion of sand. There was a small earthworm effect on soil structure formation, and only in combination with Phalaris.arundinacea. Our findings highlight the ability of Phalaris arundinacea in efficiently structuring sandy alluvial sediments in the short term even under strong alluvial dynamics. Phalaris arundinacea can therefore play a key role in the early stage of river restoration projects. Thus, facilitating the colonisation by such native pioneer herbaceous plants is a suitable step to improve the success of river restoration projects.

AB  - Discovery and understanding of fragile deep-sea habitats like sponge aggregations, are being outpaced by anthropogenic resource exploitation. Sustainable ocean development in the Faroe-Shetland Channel Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (FSC NCMPA; northeast Atlantic), which harbors sponge aggregations, now requires adaptive management in the face of encroachment of multisectorial activities in this area (e.g., fishing, oil and gas, shipping) and climate change. We examined sponge morphotype composition, richness, diversity, density and body-size distribution inside and outside the FSC NCMPA, and the role of environmental variability and human impact in these sponge aggregations. Analyses were based on the examination of 465 high resolution images from 13 towed-camera transects. A catalog for regional sponge morphotypes was also developed and applied for these analyses. Analysis revealed that morphotype composition did not differ between inside and outside the FSC NCMPA but richness, diversity and densities of massive/spherical/papillate and flabellate/caliculate sponges were higher inside than outside the boundary. The sponge aggregations occurred within a narrow zone between 450 and 530 m depth, within relatively warm and saline water masses. Furthermore, multiple size cohorts of sponges were recorded inside the FSC NCMPA, in contrast to the single cohort outside. Distance-based linear modeling showed that demersal fisheries, substratum, salinity and temperature explained a statistically-significant amount of variation (48%, p < 0.001) of sponge density across the study area. Findings on density and size cohorts suggest that the FSC NCMPA boundary currently encloses the most vulnerable area, which also demonstrates normal ecosystem functions (e.g., recruitment). However, sponges were constrained to a narrow environmental niche shaped by fisheries and interactions of FSC NCMPA water masses with the slope that in turn likely determine, food supply to the sponge aggregations. Our study illustrated the vulnerability of the FSC NCMPA sponge aggregations to fisheries and changes to water mass properties over time. The morphotype catalog and suite of indicators (i.e., density and body-size distribution) allow for baseline and future assessments of anthropogenic and climate change impacts on sponge aggregations' environmental status in the FSC NCMPA, thus guiding management as sectoral encroachment continues in this area.

AB  - The Before-After Control-Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design distinguishes natural spatial and temporal variability from variation induced by an environmental impact (or intervention) of interest. BACIPS is a powerful tool to derive inferences about interventions when classic experimental approaches (e.g. which rely on spatial replicates and random assignment of treatments) are not feasible or desirable. Previously applied BACIPS designs generally assume that effects are sudden, constant and long-lived: that is, that systems exhibit step-changes' in response to interventions. However, complex ecological interactions or gradual interventions may create delayed and/or progressive responses, potentially impeding the reliability of classic (step-change) analyses. We propose a novel approach, the Progressive-Change BACIPS, which generalizes and expands the scope of BACIPS analyses. We evaluate the relative performance of this approach using both simulated and real data that exhibit step-change, linear, asymptotic and sigmoid responses following an intervention. We quantify the statistical power and accuracy of the Progressive-Change BACIPS under varying initial population densities, intensity of spatial sampling, effect sizes and number of sampling dates After the intervention. We show that Progressive-Change BACIPS identified the correct model among the set of candidate models under most conditions and led to accurate estimates of the parameters that were used to generate the simulated data. When data were sparse, and the dynamics complex, simpler (more parsimonious) models were favoured over the more complex models that actually generated the simulated data. Application of the Progressive-Change BACIPS to existing data sets from the literature led to strong support for specific models (over alternatives) and led to more specific inferences than possible under the classic BACIPS approach. The Progressive-Change BACIPS proposed here is more flexible than the original BACIPS formulation because the data are used to inform the form of the final model, rather than having the form of the model imposed on the data. This leads to better estimates of the effects of environmental impacts and the time-scales over which they operate. As a result, the Progressive-Change BACIPS should be applicable to a wide range of studies and should help improve investigation of time-dependent effects. R code to perform Progressive-Change BACIPS analysis is provided.

AB  - Biomes are geographical units that can be defined based on biological communities sharing specific environmental and climatic requirements. Contemporary ocean biomes have been constructed based on various approaches. These included the biogeographic patterns of higher trophic level organisms, physical and biogeochemical properties, or bulk biological properties such as chlorophyll-a, but none considered the biogeographic patterns of the first trophic level explicitly, i.e. phytoplankton biogeography. A global description of marine biomes based on phytoplankton and defined in analogy to terrestrial vegetation biomes is still lacking. A bioregionalization based on phytoplankton appears particularly timely, as phytoplankton have a high sensitivity to climatic changes and fuel marine productivity. Here, we partition the global ocean into biomes by using self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering, drawing on the biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species predicted from empirical evidence. Our approach reveals eight different biomes at the seasonal scale, and seven at the annual scale. The biomes host characteristic phytoplankton species compositions, and differ in their prevailing environmental conditions. The largest differences in phytoplankton composition are found between a Pacific equatorial biome and other tropical biomes, and between subtropical and high latitude biomes. The Pacific equatorial biome is characterized by species with narrower ecological niches, the tropical and subtropical biomes by cosmopolitan generalists, and the high latitudes by species with a heterogeneous biogeography. The strongest differences between biomes are found along gradients of temperature and macronutrient availability, associated with latitude. We test whether our biomes can be reproduced based on indicator species, or potential co-occurrence networks of species determined from the predicted species distributions that are wide-spread in some but rare in other biomes. We find that our biomes can be reproduced by the 51 species identified, which together form significant species co-occurrences. This suggests that species co-occurrences, rather than individual indicator species drive oceanic biome partitioning at the first trophic level. Our biome partitioning may be especially useful for comparative analyses on the functional implications of phytoplankton organization, and impacts on zoogeographical partitionings. Furthermore, it provides a framework for predicting large-scale changes in phytoplankton community structure due to anthropogenic climate and environmental change.

AB  - Habitat loss from unrelenting human pressure is causing an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Protected areas (PAs) are meant to counteract loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and today PAs form the backbone of conservation strategies worldwide. However, anthropogenic climate change can severely reduce the effectiveness of PAs. Conservation professionals are in need of concrete spatial information on climatic changes within PAs in order to put forward practicable strategies to safeguard PA effectiveness in the face of climate change. In this study, we take advantage of openly accessible data on the disappearing climate index (DCI) to examine which PA characteristics are linked to climate change resilience on a global scale. DCI provides a measure of the relative area (percent of total area) within a PA that exhibits certain climatic conditions that will either disappear entirely or move outside the boundaries of the PA by the year 2070. Our results show that topographic diversity is highly correlated with reduced climate change impacts in PAs worldwide. We analyzed three different PA characteristics representing topographic diversity: PA area, maximal elevational difference (MED) and median terrain ruggedness (TR). All three characteristics are highly correlated with a decrease in the disappearing climate index (DCI). These results hold true across localities and even PA management practices. IUCN management category IV (habitat/species management area) and V (protected landscape/seascape) exhibit on average the highest DCI values. As an indicator for PA resilience under climate change, topographic diversity can be assessed easily through publicly available data and remote sensing products. This ease-of-use leaves topographic diversity standing in marked contrast to overall environmental diversity as an actionable conservation metric. Of course, topographic diversity alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to base conservation decisions. However, neither should the potential usefulness of topographic diversity be underestimated. As an actionable and complementary metric in combination with biological information topographic diversity can be an exceptional tool for decision making by PA managers, conservation practitioners and politicians.

AB  - In order to evaluate the influence of geographically varying marine ecosystem properties on the uptake of trace elements in bioindicators, samples were taken of seaweed (Fucus vesiculosus) and common mussel (Mytilus edulis) along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coast. Seasonal variations of the bioindicator status were minimized by sampling within 1 month. Ecosystem properties considered were the geographical position, the salinity and the concentrations of the macroelements Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P and S in the bioindicators. Trace elements studied were As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn. Factor analysis of the concentration patterns in the bioindicators and of salinity as a function of location confirmed the influence of the geographically varying salinity on the biological uptake of macroelements and trace elements. This influence of salinity was higher in the case of seaweed than in the case of mussel. Comparison of the geographical courses of the macroelement and trace-element concentrations by cluster analysis revealed corresponding courses for As and Hg in both bioindicators. All other elements showed different courses in seaweed and mussel. Subsequent cluster analysis comparing locations with respect to the macroelement or trace-element concentration patterns in the bioindicators, indicated a clear separation of North and Baltic Sea locations. However, the trace-element concentration patterns provided a regionally less distinctive ecosystem arrangement than those of the macroelement ones. The results of the cluster analysis were verified by discriminant analysis forming groups of locations with respect to geographical position and salinity. Results of discriminant analysis demonstrated, both for seaweed and for mussel as bioindicators, that the location groups formed according to the macroelement concentration patterns corresponded well with the geographical regions in the order of salinity. On the other hand, location groups based on the trace-element concentration patterns again showed a modified less distinctive ecosystem arrangement than the location groups based on macroelement concentration patterns. This confirms modified conditions for the uptake of trace elements in seaweed or mussel in comparison to the uptake of macroelements. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Increased drought and temperatures associated with climate change have implications for ecosystem stress with risk for enhanced carbon release in sensitive biomes. Litter decomposition is a key component of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, but questions remain regarding the local response of decomposition processes to climate change. This is particularly complex in mountain ecosystems where the variable nature of the slope, aspect, soil type, and snowmelt dynamics play a role. Hence, the goal of this study was to determine the role of elevation, soil type, seasonal shifts in soil moisture, and snowmelt timing on litter decomposition processes. Experimental plots containing replicate deployments of harvested lodgepole and spruce needle litter alongside needle-free controls were established in open meadows at three elevations ranging from 2,800-3,500 m in Crested Butte, Colorado. Soil biogeochemistry variables including gas flux, porewater chemistry, and microbial ecology were monitored over three climatically variable years that shifted from high monsoon rains to drought. Results indicated that elevation and soil type influenced baseline soil biogeochemical indicators; however, needle mass loss and chemical composition were consistent across the 700 m elevation gradient. Rates of gas flux were analogously consistent across a 300 m elevation gradient. The additional variable of early snowmelt by 2-3 weeks had little impact on needle chemistry, microbial composition and gas flux; however, it did result in increased dissolved organic carbon in lodgepole porewater collections suggesting a potential for aqueous export. In contrast to elevation, needle presence and seasonal variability of soil moisture and temperature both played significant roles in soil carbon fluxes. During a pronounced period of lower moisture and higher temperatures, bacterial community diversity increased across elevation with new members supplanting more dominant taxa. Microbial ecological resilience was demonstrated with a return to pre-drought structure and abundance after snowmelt rewetting the following year. These results show similar decomposition processes across a 700 m elevation gradient and reveal the sensitivity but resilience of soil microbial ecology to low moisture conditions.

AB  - Many terrestrial ecosystems are fire prone, such that their composition and structure are largely due to their fire regime. Regions subject to regular fire have exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism, and fire has been proposed as a major driver of their diversity, within the context of climate, resource availability and environmental heterogeneity. However, current fire-management practices rarely take into account the ecological and evolutionary roles of fire in maintaining biodiversity. Here, we focus on the mechanisms that enable fire to act as a major ecological and evolutionary force that promotes and maintains biodiversity over numerous spatiotemporal scales. From an ecological perspective, the vegetation, topography and local weather conditions during a fire generate a landscape with spatial and temporal variation in fire-related patches (pyrodiversity), and these produce the biotic and environmental heterogeneity that drives biodiversity across local and regional scales. There have been few empirical tests of the proposition that 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' but we show that biodiversity should peak at moderately high levels of pyrodiversity. Overall species richness is greatest immediately after fire and declines monotonically over time, with postfire successional pathways dictated by animal habitat preferences and varying lifespans among resident plants. Theory and data support the 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' when mean patch species diversity is correlated with mean fire intervals. Postfire persistence, recruitment and immigration allow species with different life histories to coexist. From an evolutionary perspective, fire drives population turnover and diversification by promoting a wide range of adaptive responses to particular fire regimes. Among 39 comparisons, the number of species in 26 fire-prone lineages is much higher than that in their non-fire-prone sister lineages. Fire and its byproducts may have direct mutagenic effects, producing novel genotypes that can lead to trait innovation and even speciation. A paradigm shift aimed at restoring biodiversity-maintaining fire regimes across broad landscapes is required among the fire research and management communities. This will require ecologists and other professionals to spread the burgeoning fire-science knowledge beyond scientific publications to the broader public, politicians and media.

AB  - Soil enzyme activities are attracting widespread interest due to its potential use in contaminant breakdown, and as indicators of soil deterioration. However, given the multiple environmental and methodological factors affecting their activity levels, assessment of soil pollution using these biochemical endpoints is still complex. Taking advantage of the well-known stimulatory effect of earthworms on soil microbes, and their associated enzyme activities, we explored some toxicological features of carboxylesterases (CbEs) in soils inoculated with Lumbricus terrestris. A microplate-scale spectrophotometric assay using soil-water suspensions was first optimized, in which kinetic assay parameters (K-m, V-max, dilution of soil homogenate, and duration of soil homogenization) were established for further CbE determinations. Optimal conditions included a soil-to-water ratio of 1:50 (w/v), 30-min of shaking, and 2.5 mM of substrate concentration. As expected, CbE activity increased significantly in soils treated with L. terrestris. This bioturbed soil was used for exploring the role of CbE activity as a bioscavenger for organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. Soil treated with two formulations of chlorpyrifos revealed that ODE activity was a significant molecular sink for this pesticide, reducing its impact on soil microbial activity as shown by the unchanged dehydrogenase activity. Dose-dependent curves were adjusted to an exponential kinetic model, and the median ecological dose (ED50) for both pesticide formulations was calculated. ED50 values decreased as the time of pesticide exposure increased (14d-ED50S =20.4-26.7 mg kg(-1), and 28d-ED(50)s=1.8-23 mg kg(-1)), which suggested that chlorpyrifos was progressively transformed into its highly toxic metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon, but simultaneously was inactivated by CbEs. These results were confirmed by in vitro assays that showed chlorpyrifos-oxon was a more potent CbE inhibitor (IC50 =35.5-4.67 nM) than chlorpyrifos (0.41-0.84 mu M). The results showed that earthworm-induced CbE activity is an efficient bioscavengers for OP pesticides, acting as a soil safeguarding system. Moreover, the simple dose-response curves against OP exposure suggest that this enzyme - combined with other enzyme activities (e.g., dehydrogenase) - may be a suitable biomarker of pesticide exposure.

AB  - Invasions by exotic plant species can threaten forest ecosystems in numerous ways. Theories on relationships of exotic species invasions with native vegetation, resource availability, and disturbance could assist in managing exotic plants by identifying parts of the landscape and ecological conditions most susceptible to invasion. However, generality of these theories is complicated by considerable variation among landscapes and ecology of individual species. We assessed hypotheses on relationships of exotic plant communities with native vegetation, environmental (soil, topographic, and climate), and disturbance (roads and grazing) variables using data from 66 plots within a 110,000-ha Pinus ponderosa forest landscape in northern Arizona, USA. We further assessed exotic plant relationships with ecosystem classification, which has a long history of use in forest ecology and management but has been underutilized for understanding exotic species distributions. Plots contained a total of 251 native and 20 exotic plant species. As hypothesized for distributional studies, native and exotic species were positively correlated. but the correlation varied with scale for species richness (m(2), r = 0.65; 500 m(2), r = 0.41) and was weaker for cover (r = 0.32). Multiple regression, including native vegetation and environmental variables, accounted for similar amounts of variation in exotic species richness (50% of variation) and cover (51%). Disturbance variables only entered regression models when native vegetation was excluded from models. Exotic species richness m(-2), cover, and community composition were strongly related to the ecosystem classification. For example, mean exotic cover ranged from <0.1% in ecosystems with volcanic cinder soils to 7% in ecosystems containing Populus tremuloides. As hypothesized, moist ecosystems were generally most invaded. However, also considering factors such as past management of the ecosystems and literature on the introduction histories (e.g., intentional seeding for range improvement) of the species, we hypothesize that the ecosystem classification integrated co-varying environmental, disturbance, and management variables related to exotic plant communities. Ecosystem classification was a useful framework for understanding distributions of exotic plant communities across the landscape. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring the spatial relationship between ecosystem services (ES) and human disturbance intensity (HDI) is vital for maintaining regional ecological security. This study aims to explore the spatial correlation between ES and HDI in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and provide meaningful implications for coastal ecological planning. Multi-source remote sensing data, remote sensing software, and geographic information system provided initial data and technical support for this research. We integrated four human pressures (population, land-use, traffic, and energy) to map the HDI in the GBA for 2018. Coastal ES were comprehensively considered and spatially visualized by extracting the ES sources. The geographically weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and bivariate local Moran were used to quantitatively reflect and spatially visualize the detailed relationship between ES and HDI. Our study presents several key findings. First, the central and southern parts of the GBA are under strong HDI, dominated by a dense population and intense land utilization. Second, the kernel density of ES sources can better manifest the spatial distribution of ES objectively in comparison to the traditional model calculation. Provisioning services mainly originate from the periphery of the central cities; cultural services are highly concentrated in the heartland of the GBA; and regulating and maintenance services have high density in the outermost regions. Third, ES and HDI have a significant correlation, and the geographically weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and local indicator of spatial association cluster maps illustrate that unlike the global findings, the local correlation is spatially nonstationary as the local scale is affected by specific human activities, natural conditions, regional development, and other local factors. Four, high-capacity regions of ES provision are mainly under high HDI. Areas with high provisioning service values are mainly affected by population and traffic pressure, whereas regulating and maintenance services and cultural services are mainly dominated by high-density populations. Regulating and maintenance services are also affected by land-use pressure. We determine that human disturbance has negative spillover effects on ES, which should be the focus in regional ecological planning.

AB  - Inner Peripheries is a recent concept based on both peripherality and marginality features, thus far from the commonly adopted geographical notion of periphery. Inner Peripheries are fragile territories covering rural Europe, which suffer from depopulation, low economic potential, and weak territorial cohesion. However, these territories are extremely important for the provision of goods and services, and the stewardship of natural and semi-natural environments. Such dichotomous condition poses several challenges for planning in the EU context, particularly regarding the implementation of the Rural Development Policy. Therefore, current planning needs to contextualize the policy implementation by considering local needs and territorial resources in the Inner Peripheries. With a focus on the Italian case, the main aim of the present work is to explore to what extent Inner Peripheries cope with Rural Development targets, in the light of improving the effectiveness of planning interventions. We create and implement a set of context indicators to describe the Inner Peripheries' territorial characteristics through fine scale analyses and test their alignment with the Rural Development Policy through ANOVA and PCA. The results show that the indicators' set is significant and robust in depicting the current territorial potentialities and limitations of the Inner Peripheries towards strengthening rural development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Inner Peripheries exhibit alignments and misalignments with rural development targets, depending on localities, and exogenous and endogenous characteristics. We find that the Inner Peripheries in Italy need to develop holistic strategies incorporating different Rural Development Priorities, such as increased competitiveness in agriculture and forestry sectors, sustainable use of resources and climate adaptation, which may also contribute to foster territorial cohesion. We argue that strategies with less consideration of environmental and social aspects may be counterproductive for the local development in Inner Peripheries. Performing an ex-ante assessment of the main characteristics of the Inner Peripheries through e.g. the use of the indicators' framework as proposed, may support the decision-making processes in selecting planning priorities. Considering the large replicability and comparability of the indicators' set, the findings of the present study are useful to further understand how rural development is considered in territorial strategies for Inner Peripheries in similar contexts in Europe.

AB  - Ocean oxygenation during the Precambrian-Cambrian transition is thought to be one of the key factors for the rapid diversification of animals, known as the 'Cambrian Explosion'. Siliceous sponges inhabiting continental slope settings were capable of shifting the respiratory oxygen demand in the water column to depth, resulting in an increase in oxygen levels of shallow water. To assess the global importance of the impact of ecosystem engineering by sponges, we evaluated the palaeo-environmental conditions that confine sponge expansion using multiple geochemical proxies including silicon and carbon stable isotopes as well as major- and trace elements in cherts and siliceous sedimentary rocks that were deposited in shallow water around the Precambrian-Cambrian transition. We investigated three lithosections in the Malyi Karatau Range in southern Kazakhstan. The lowermost chert samples of these sections are typically characterized by comparably low delta Si-30 values and exhibit molds of siliceous sponge spicules. Upsection the occurrence of cross-bedding structures and granular phosphorites document the shallowing of the depositional environment, where overall increasing delta Si-30 values and increasing Al/Si indicate less settlement of sponges and higher suspended particle loads. Corresponding carbon isotope records of the carbonate fraction decrease from near-zero to negative carbon isotope values averaging -5.9 parts per thousand. The delta C-13(carb) values overall coincide with Y/Ho, the redox indicator Ce/Ce*, and mass fractions of carbonate fluorapatite, suggesting that these ratios are predominantly controlled by the mineralization of organic matter in phosphatic sediment. The studied sections document the ecological requirements for sponge settlement and proliferation, such as the presence of a hard substrate and sufficiently low suspended particle concentrations and/or low wave energy. This work suggests that the widespread appearance of karsted surfaces around the Precambrian-Cambrian transition that were subsequently submerged during the Cambrian transgression would have created permissive habitats for sponges and large phosphate deposits. The capability of sponges to oxygenate shallow seawater and extensive phosphorous burial in epicontinental basins are thus feasible mechanisms for the seawater oxygenation around the Precambrian-Cambrian transition.

AB  - Questions: What are the primary biotic and abiotic factors driving composition and abundance of naturally regenerated tree seedlings across forest landscapes of Maine? Do seedling species richness (SR) and density (SD) decrease with improved growing conditions (climate and soil), but increase with increased diversity of overstorey composition and structure? Does partial harvesting disproportionately favour relative dominance of shade-intolerant hardwoods (PIHD) over shade-tolerant softwoods (PTSD)?
   Location: Forest landscapes across the diverse eco-regions and forest types of Maine, USA.
   Methods: This study used USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis permanent plots (n = 10 842), measured every 5 yr since 1999. The best models for each response variable (SR, SD, PIHD and PTSD) were developed based on AIC and biological interpretability, while considering 35 potential explanatory variables incorporating climate, soil, site productivity, overstorey structure and composition, and past harvesting.
   Results: Mean annual temperature was the most important abiotic factor, whereas overstorey tree size diversity was the most important biotic factor for SR and SD. Both mean annual temperature and overstorey tree size diversity had a curvilinear relationship with SR and SD. Average overstorey shade tolerance and percentage tolerant softwood basal area in the overstorey were the top predictor variables of PIHD and PTSD, respectively. Partial harvesting favoured PIHD but not PTSD.
   Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to comprehensively evaluate a number of factors influencing naturally established tree seedlings at a broad landscape scale in the Northern Forest region of the eastern USA and Canada. Despite limitations associated with relatively small plot size, large seedling size class and lack of direct measurements of light, water and nutrients, this study documents the influence of these factors amid high variability associated with patterns of natural regeneration. The curvilinear relationship between mean annual temperature with SR and SD supports the argument that species richness and abundance usually have unimodal relationships with productivity indicators, whereas the curvilinear relationship between overstorey tree size diversity and SR and SD suggest that moderate overstorey diversity incorporates multiple species as well as higher seedling individuals.

AB  - Ancient woodlands, with their long ecological continuity, frequently harbor a high number of typical, rare and threatened species, and are therefore of particular importance for nature conservation. To pinpoint these habitats, a common application is the use of plants as "ancient woodland indicators". The occurrence of these particular species allows for evaluating the continuity of woodland cover in time. While lists of ancient woodland vascular plants have been derived for many regions, the identification and use of bryophytes as ancient woodland indicators has been widely neglected. This is a bit surprising because certain woodland bryophytes are very sensitive to varying environmental conditions or changes in land management. It therefore appeared promising to compile an ecologically grounded list of ancient 'woodland indicator bryophytes for practical use.
   In this study, we present a set of ancient woodland indicator bryophytes based on the analysis of datasets from the North German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. To compile this list, we systematically evaluated the bryophyte distribution data from floristic surveys in relation to ancient woodland cover data from state-wide inventories. In this way, we were able to determine ancient woodland bryophytes using consistent and repeatable statistical methods.
   The presented list of 31 ancient woodland indicator bryophytes is ecologically sound and corresponds well with data from the sparse literature. We could distinguish two groups of ancient woodland indicator bryophytes. The first group is linked to base-rich, semi-natural deciduous woodlands with high soil and air humidity. The second group comprises acidophilic bryophytes that occur not only in acidic beech and oak woods, but also in acidic mixed or coniferous forests on ancient woodland sites. Apart from the ancient woodland indicator bryophytes, we could identify one group of recent woodland bryophytes and four groups of bryophytes that are more or less indifferent with respect to woodland continuity.
   Finally, we provide recommendations for the application of ancient woodland indicator bryophytes in nature conservation practice. Management suggestions for the conservation of the typical bryophyte diversity of ancient semi-natural woodlands are also given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temporal environmental variability causes behavioural and physiological responses in organisms that can affect their spatial location in time, and ultimately drive changes in population and community dynamics. Linking ecological changes with underlying environmental drivers is a complex task that can however be facilitated through the integration of physiology. Our overarching aim was to investigate the association between physiological performance and habitat utilisation patterns modulated by short temporal fluctuations in environmental factors. We used in situ monitoring data from a system experiencing extreme environmental fluctuations over a few hours and we selected four fish species with different habitat utilisation patterns across dissolved oxygen (DO) fluctuations: two commonly observed species (Siganus lineatus and Acanthopagrus pacificus), including at low DO (40 and 50% saturation, respectively), and two reef species (Heniochus acuminatus and Chaetodon vagabundus) never recorded below 70% saturation. We hypothesised that these patterns were associated to species' physiological performance in hypoxia. Therefore, we measured different metabolic variables (O-2crit, incipient lethal oxygen (ILO), time to ILO, index of cumulative ambient oxygen deficit (O-2deficit), maximum oxygen supply capacity (alpha)) using respirometry. Physiological performance differed among species and was intrinsically associated to habitat use patterns. S. lineatus had a lower O2crit than H. acuminatus, A. pacificus and C. vagabundus (13, 18.7, 20 and 20.2% saturation respectively). Additionally, S. lineatus and A. pacificus displayed better capacity for survival below O-2crit than C. vagabundus and H. acuminatus (lower ILO, higher O-2deficit and longer time to ILO) and higher alpha. Field monitoring data revealed that DO temporarily falls below species' O(2crit )and even ILO on most days, suggesting that short temporal variability in DO likely forces species to temporarily avoid harmful conditions, driving important changes in ecosystem structure over a few hours. Our results support the hypothesis that organismal physiology can provide insights into ecological changes occurring over a few hours as a result of environmental variability. Consequently, integrating physiology with ecological data at relevant temporal scales may help predict temporal shifts in ecosystems structure and functions to account for ecological patterns often overlooked and difficult to identify.

AB  - Emerging theory suggests that the ecosystem-level consequences of anthropogenic pressures depend on how species will be disassembled from ecological communities (i.e. the disassembly rule). Species loss, however, is not the sole ecological cause of ecosystem function loss: behaviours underpinning ecosystem function can also be disrupted by anthropogenic pressures without detectable declines of component species ('cryptic function loss'). Here, we introduce a novel framework that integrates behavioural responses into community disassembly metrics. We applied this framework to freshwater mussel communities (order Unionida) of the midwestern United States, in which intensive agricultural land use threatens stream biota. We combined a field experiment, meta-analysis and watershed-scale population dataset to assess how excessive sediment concentrations, one of the leading drivers of freshwater biodiversity loss, influence community-level water clearance rates of freshwater mussels via behavioural (changes in mass-specific clearance rate) and population (changes in population density) responses. Our study provided three key insights. First, freshwater mussels exhibited high behavioural sensitivity to increased total suspended solids (TSS) across species (i.e. reduced water clearance rate), whereas population responses were highly species-specific. Second, the behavioural response to increased TSS causes substantial cryptic function loss under stressful conditions: simulated water clearance rates when behavioural response is included can be less than half that of mussel communities with no behavioural response. Finally, simulations revealed that mussel communities are likely to show rapid but consistent rates of ecosystem function loss irrespective of disassembly rules. The similar rates of function loss are due to the uniform behavioural response to TSS that masks the linkage between population sensitivity of a species and its contribution to ecosystem function. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that ignoring behavioural processes may cause non-negligible underestimation of ecosystem function loss during community disassembly, potentially leading to overly optimistic assessments of ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, unlike species declines or local extinctions, behaviour response tied to function loss may occur concurrently with increasing anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, managers should acknowledge the risk of immediate function loss after human-induced environmental changes.

AB  - Scientists and resource managers often use methods and tools that assume ecosystem components respond linearly to environmental drivers and human stressors. However, a growing body of literature demonstrates that many relationships are non-linear, where small changes in a driver prompt a disproportionately large ecological response. We aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between drivers and ecosystem components to identify where and when non-linearities are likely to occur. We focused our analyses on one of the best-studied marine systems, pelagic ecosystems, which allowed us to apply robust statistical techniques on a large pool of previously published studies. In this synthesis, we (1) conduct a wide literature review on single driver-response relationships in pelagic systems, (2) use statistical models to identify the degree of non-linearity in these relationships, and (3) assess whether general patterns exist in the strengths and shapes of non-linear relationships across drivers. Overall we found that non-linearities are common in pelagic ecosystems, comprising at least 52% of all driver-response relationships. This is likely an underestimate, as papers with higher quality data and analytical approaches reported non-linear relationships at a higher frequency (on average 11% more). Consequently, in the absence of evidence for a linear relationship, it is safer to assume a relationship is non-linear. Strong non-linearities can lead to greater ecological and socioeconomic consequences if they are unknown (and/or unanticipated), but if known they may provide clear thresholds to inform management targets. In pelagic systems, strongly non-linear relationships are often driven by climate and trophodynamic variables but are also associated with local stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, that can be more easily controlled by managers. Even when marine resource managers cannot influence ecosystem change, they can use information about threshold responses to guide how other stressors are managed and to adapt to new ocean conditions. As methods to detect and reduce uncertainty around threshold values improve, managers will be able to better understand and account for ubiquitous non-linear relationships.

AB  - Release of hydrocarbons from sediments is important in increasing habitat heterogeneity on deep ocean margins. Heterogeneity arises from variation in abiotic and biotic conditions, including changes in substratum, geochemistry, fluid flow, biological communities and ecological interactions. The seepage of heavy hydrocarbons to the seafloor is less well studied than most other cold seep systems and may lead to the formation of asphalt mounds. These have been described from several regions, particularly the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we describe the structure, potential formation and biology of a large asphalt mound province in Block 31SE Angola. A total of 2254 distinct mound features was identified by side-scan sonar, covering a total area of 3.7 km(2) of seafloor. The asphalt mounds took a number of forms from small (<0.5 m diameter; 13% observations) mounds to large extensive (<50 m diameter) structures. Some of the observed mounds were associated with authigenic carbonate and active seepage (living chemosynthetic fauna present in addition to the asphalt). The asphalt mounds are seabed accumulations of heavy hydrocarbons formed from subsurface migration and fractionation of reservoir hydrocarbons primarily through a network of faults. In Angola these processes are controlled by subsurface movement of salt structures. The asphalt mounds were typically densely covered with epifauna (74.5% of mounds imaged had visible epifauna) although individual mounds varied considerably in epifaunal coverage. Of the 49 non-chemosynthetic megafaunal taxa observed, 19 taxa were only found on hard substrata (including asphalt mounds), 2 fish species inhabited the asphalt mounds preferentially and 27 taxa were apparently normal soft-sediment fauna. Antipatharians (3.6 +/- 2.3% s.e.) and poriferans (2.6 +/- 1.9% s.e.) accounted for the highest mean percentage of the observed cover, with actinarians (0.9 +/- 0.4% s.e.) and alcyonaceans (0.4 +/- 02% s.e.) covering smaller proportions of the area. Asphalt mounds represent a common and important habitat on several margin systems globally and should be recognised in future environmental assessment and management of these areas.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) feature highly distinctive spatial and temporal patterns of distribution, quantity, and flows. The flow of ecosystem goods and services to beneficiaries plays a decisive role in the valuation of ES and the successful implementation of the ES concept in environmental planning. This is particularly relevant to regulating services where demands emerge often spatially separated from supply. However, spatial patterns of both supply and demand are rarely incorporated in ES assessments on continental scales. In this paper, we present an ES modeling approach with low data demand, fit to be employed in scenario analysis and on multiple scales. We analyze flood regulation services at a European scale by explicitly addressing the spatial distribution of ES demand. A flood regulation supply indicator is developed based on scenario runs with a hydrological model in representative river catchments, incorporating detailed information on land, cover, land use and management. Land use sensitive flood damage estimates in the European Union (EU) are employed to develop a spatial indicator for flood regulation demand. Findings are transferred to the EU territory to create a map of the current supply of flood regulation and the potential supply under conditions of natural vegetation. Regions with a high capacity to provide flood regulation are mainly characterized by large patches of natural vegetation or extensive agriculture. The main factor limiting supply on a continental scale is a low water holding capacity of the soil. Flood regulation demand is highest in central Europe, at the foothills of the Alps and upstream of agglomerations. We were able to identify areas with a high potential capacity to provide flood regulation in conjunction with land use modifications. When combined with spatial patterns of current supply and demand, we could identify priority areas for investments in ES flood regulation supply through conservation and land use planning.

AB  - Benthic invertebrates are important trophic links in aquatic food webs and serve as useful bioindicators of environmental conditions because their responses integrate the effects of both water and sediment qualities. However, long-term data sets for benthic invertebrate assemblages across broad geographic areas are rare and, even if collected, historic data sets are often not readily accessible. This data set provides densities of benthic macroinvertebrates for all taxa collected during lake-wide surveys in Lake Ontario, a Laurentian Great Lake, from 1964 to 2018. This information resulted from surveys funded by the governments of the United States and Canada to investigate the status and changes of Lake Ontario benthic community. Of the 13 lake-wide benthic surveys conducted in Lake Ontario over the course of 54 yr, we were able to acquire taxonomic data to the species level for 11 of the surveys and data to the group level for the other two surveys. Density data are provided for taxa representing the Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Nemertea, and Platyhelminthes phyla. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the compositional structure of Lake Ontario invertebrate assemblages differed markedly by depth and were also significantly altered by the Dreissena spp. invasion in early 1990s. The introduction of invasive dreissenids has changed the community historically dominated by Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae, to a community dominated by quagga mussels and Oligochaeta. Considering the rarity of long-term benthic data of high taxonomic resolution in lake ecosystems, this data set could be useful to explore broader aspects of ecological theory, including effects of different environmental factors and invasive species on community organization, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and spatial scale of variation in community structure. The data set could also be useful for studies on individual species including abundance and distribution, species co-occurrence, and how the patterns of dominance and rarity change over space and time.

AB  - Inconsistent performance of Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which may depend on several factors such as the initial conditions or the applied modelling technique, is one of the greatest challenges in ecological modelling, To overcome this problem, ensemble modelling combines the forecasts of several individual models. A commonly applied ensemble modelling technique is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Ensemble, which was envisaged in the 1990s. However, despite its potential for ecological modelling, it has received little attention in the development of SDMs for freshwater fish. Although this approach originally included all the developed MLPs, Genetic Algorithms (GA) now allow selection of the optimal subset of MLPs and thus substantial improvement of model performance. In this study, MLP Ensembles were used to develop SDMs for the redfin barbel (Barbus haasi; Mertens, 1925) at two different spatial scales: the micro-scale and the meso-scale. Finally, the potential of the MLP Ensembles for environmental flow (e-flow) assessment was tested by linking model results to hydraulic simulation. MLP Ensembles with a candidate selection based on GA outperformed the optimal single MLP or the ensemble of the whole set of MLPs. The micro-scale model complemented previous studies, showing high suitability of relatively deep areas with coarse substrate and corroborating the need for cover and the rheophilic nature of the redfin barbel. The meso-scale model highlighted the advantages of using cross-scale variables, since elevation (a macro-scale variable) was selected in the optimal model. Although the meso-scale model also demonstrated that redfin barbel selects deep areas, it partially contradicted the micro-scale model because velocity had a clearer positive effect on habitat suitability and redfin barbel showed a preference for fine substrate in the meso-scale model. Although the meso-scale model suggested an overall higher habitat suitability of the test site, this did not result in a notable higher minimum environmental flow. Our results demonstrate that MLP Ensembles are a promising tool in the development of SDMs for freshwater fish species and proficient in e-flow assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Green tree retention has been embraced as an alternative to large scale conventional clear-cutting aimed at managing the boreal forest in a more sustainable way. Ground-dwelling spider assemblages were studied 6 years after the application of variable retention harvesting practices (dispersed to 2%, 10% and 75% retention vs. aggregated retention) in deciduous and coniferous dominated stands as part of the Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbances (EMEND) project in the mixedwood boreal forest of northwestern Canada. Overall, spider composition was dominated by open-habitat species, especially by the wolf spider Pardosa moesta Banks, in all harvest treatments. However, an important shift in species composition was observed in unharvested controls. Distinctive ground-dwelling spider assemblages were observed in each forest cover-type and these were highly affected by the various harvest treatments, especially in coniferous forests. From the 164 species collected, 37 were indicators for various combinations of forest type, harvesting treatment and retention level. Species richness was affected as harvesting intensity increased; however, greater impact was observed in dispersed retention than in aggregated retention, and in coniferous stands compared to the same treatment in deciduous stands. Dispersed retention, even at 10%, seemed to mitigate adverse effects of harvesting on spider assemblages, but only in deciduous forests; however, important effects on biodiversity were observed in coniferous forests even after 75% retention. Retention of aggregated patches was useful in maintaining forest specialist species after harvesting, but was more effective when applied together with dispersed retention. Responses of spider assemblages to harvesting seemed to be highly correlated with environmental changes. Green tree retention preserves some of the heterogeneity, structural features and environmental conditions required by forest specialist species and thus becomes an effective management practice to maintain forest biodiversity, especially when both aggregated and dispersed retention practices are applied together. However, the effectiveness of these practices varies depending on the forest cover-type prior to harvesting and the amount of post-harvest residual. This suggests that a single prescription is insufficient for maintaining landscape heterogeneity, and that a combination of prescriptions is supported for a more sustainable management of the mixedwood boreal forest.

AB  - Big ecological changes often involve regime shifts in which a critical threshold is crossed. Thresholds are often difficult to measure, and transgressions of thresholds come as surprises. If a critical threshold is approached gradually, however, there are early warnings of the impending regime shift. For example, in a one-dimensional ecosystem dynamics, autocorrelation approaches 1 from below, variance and skewness increase, and variance spectra shift to lower frequencies. Here we focus on variance, an indicator easily computed from monitoring data.
   There are two distinct sources of increased variance near a critical threshold. One is the amplification of small shocks that occurs as the square of the modulus of the leading eigenvalue (or leading pair of eigenvalues in the complex case) approaches 1 from below. This source, called "squealing,'' is well-studied. The second source of variance, called "flickering,'' involves brief excursions between attractors.
   Interacting regime shifts may muffle or magnify variance near critical thresholds. Whether muffling or magnification occurs, and the size of the effect, depend on the product of the feedback between the state variables times the correlation of these variables' responses to environmental shocks. If this product is positive, magnification of the variance will occur. If the product is negative, muffling or magnification can occur depending on the relative magnitudes of these and other effects. Therefore, monitoring programs should measure variates that have opposite responses to the critical transition. If the correlations to environmental shocks have the same sign, the variance of at least one variate will be magnified as the critical transition is approached.
   Simulation studies suggest that muffling may sometimes interfere with detection of early warning signals of regime shifts. However, more important effects of muffling and magnification may come from their effect on flickering, when random shocks trigger a state change in a system with low resilience. Muffling decreases the likelihood that a random shock will trigger a regime shift. Magnification has the opposite effect. Magnification is most likely when feedbacks are positive and state variables have positively correlated responses to environmental shocks. These results help delimit the conditions when regime shifts are more likely to cascade through complex systems.

AB  - Gene drive organisms are a recent development created by using methods of genetic engineering; they inherit genetic constructs that are passed on to future generations with a higher probability than with Mendelian inheritance. There are some specific challenges inherent to the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of genetically engineered (GE) gene drive organisms because subsequent generations of these GE organisms might show effects that were not observed or intended in the former generations. Unintended effects can emerge from interaction of the gene drive construct with the heterogeneous genetic background of natural populations and/or be triggered by changing environmental conditions. This is especially relevant in the case of gene drives with invasive characteristics and typically takes dozens of generations to render the desired effect. Under these circumstances, "next generation effects" can substantially increase the spatial and temporal complexity associated with a high level of uncertainty in ERA. To deal with these problems, we suggest the introduction of a new additional step in the ERA of GE gene drive organisms that takes 3 criteria into account: the biology of the target organisms, their naturally occurring interactions with the environment (biotic and abiotic), and their intended biological characteristics introduced by genetic engineering. These 3 criteria are merged to form an additional step in ERA, combining specific "knowns" and integrating areas of "known unknowns" and uncertainties, with the aim of assessing the spatiotemporal controllability of GE gene drive organisms. The establishment of assessing spatiotemporal controllability can be used to define so-called "cut-off criteria" in the risk analysis of GE gene drive organisms: If it is likely that GE gene drive organisms escape spatiotemporal controllability, the risk assessment cannot be sufficiently reliable because it is not conclusive. Under such circumstances, the environmental release of the GE gene drive organisms would not be compatible with the precautionary principle (PP). Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;00:1-14.

AB  - Ecological indicators are widely used to characterise ecosystem health. In the marine environment, indicators have been developed to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries. However, very little work on the performance and robustness of ecological indicators has been carried out. An important aspect of robustness is that indicators should respond specifically to changes in the pressures they are designed to detect (e.g. fishing) rather than changes in other drivers (e.g. environment). We adopted a multi model approach to compare and test the specificity of commonly used ecological indicators to capture fishing effects in the presence of environmental change and under different fishing strategies. We tested specificity in the presence of two types of environmental change: "random", representing interannual climate variability and "directional", representing climate change. We used phytoplankton biomass as a proxy of the environmental conditions, as this driver was comparable across all ecosystem models, then applied a signal-to-noise ratio analysis to test the specificity of indicators with random environmental change. For directional change, we used mean gradients to apportion the quantity of change in the indicators due to fishing and the environment. We found that depending on the fishing strategy and environmental change, ecological indicators could range from high to low specificity to fishing. As expected, the specificity of indicators to fishing almost always decreased as environmental variability increased. In 55-76% of the scenarios run with directional change in phytoplankton biomass across fishing strategies and ecosystem models, indicators were significantly more responsive to changes in fishing than to changes in phytoplankton biomass. This important result makes the tested ecological indicators good candidates to support fisheries management in a changing environment. Among the indicators, the catch over biomass ratio was most often the most specific indicator to fishing, whereas mean length was most often the most sensitive to change in phytoplankton biomass. However, the responses of indicators were highly variable depending on the ecosystem and fishing strategy under consideration. We therefore recommend that indicators should be tested in the particular ecosystem before they are used for monitoring and management purposes.

AB  - Given the significant land holdings of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the importance of those lands to support a variety of inherently damaging activities, application of sound natural resource conservation principles and proactive monitoring practices are necessary to manage military training lands in a sustainable manner. This study explores a method for, and the utility of, analyzing vegetation condition and trends as sustainability indicators for use by military commanders and land managers, at both the national and local levels, in identifying when and where vegetation-related environmental impacts might exist. The BFAST time series decomposition method was applied to a ten-year MODIS NDVI time series dataset for the Fort Riley military installation and Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in northeastern Kansas. Imagery selected for time-series analysis were 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1 Collection 5) composites capable of characterizing vegetation change induced by human activities and climate variability. Three indicators related to gradual interannual or abrupt intraannual vegetation change for each pixel were calculated from the trend component resulting from the BFAST decomposition. Assessment of gradual interannual NDVI trends showed the majority of Fort Riley experienced browning between 2001 and 2010. This result is supported by validation using high spatial resolution imagery. The observed versus expected frequency of linear trends detected at Fort Riley and KPBS were significantly different and suggest a causal link between military training activities and/or land management practices. While both sites were similar with regards to overall disturbance frequency and the relative spatial extents of monotonic or interrupted trends, vegetation trajectories after disturbance were significantly different. This suggests that the type and magnitude of disturbances characteristic of each location result in distinct post-disturbance vegetation responses. Using a remotely-sensed vegetation index time series with BFAST and the indicators outlined here provides a consistent and relatively rapid assessment of military training lands with applicability outside of grassland biomes. Characterizing overall trends and disturbance responses of vegetation can promote sustainable use of military lands and assist land managers in targeting specific areas for various rehabilitation activities.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to assess the influence of tamarisk shrubs on soil fertility, salinity and nematode communities in various habitats located in an arid desert-oasis region in northwest China. Three habitats were studied: sand dune, riparian zone and saline meadow, where tamarisk shrubs have been established in recent decades in order to vegetation restoration used as desertification control and saline land rehabilitation projects and become the dominant plant community. The parameters measured include soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen, available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), pH, salt component, and nematode community characteristics. Enrichment ratios (a comparison of the soil measurements between soils under canopy and in the open interspaces) for soil nutrients and salinity were used to evaluate fertility and salinity islands underneath the tamarisk shrubs. The soil nematode community was used as a biological indicator of soil condition. SOC and available P and K were higher beneath the plant canopy than in the open interspaces outside that canopy. The enrichment ratios for SOC and nutrients were highest for the sand dune habitat and tamarisk shrubs clearly created islands of greater salinity under the canopies. Nematode abundance per 100 g dry soil varied considerably between the locations and habitats, with the highest abundance found in sand dune and the lowest in saline meadow. A significantly higher nematode abundance and a lower trophic diversity were found in soils under the canopy compared to the soils in the open interspaces. With the exception of saline meadow, the abundance of bacterivores increased and fungivores decreased under the canopy relative to the open interspaces, and bacterivores dominated under the canopies in the sand dune and riparian habitats. The enrichment ratios for salinity were higher than for fertility, suggesting that improved soil fertility can not limit the impact of salinization beneath tamarisk shrubs. The adverse effect of salt accumulation on the soil environment should be taken into account when using tamarisk as restoration plant species, especially in saline meadow and controlling of tamarisk density should be considered when undertaking re-vegetation projects in the arid desert oasis regions.

AB  - Despite abundant literature on indicators for sustainable resource management, practical tools to help local users to apply its general concepts at a local to regional level are scarce. This means that decisions over land evaluation and land use at a local level are often not based on the formal application of indicators or decision support systems for environmentally sound management but instead on the opinion of local expertise, for instance forest managers. cattle breeders, farmers and/or academics. This is particularly seen to be the case in the tropics where access to modern communication and information technologies is restricted.
   As the opinions of experts are often based on and influenced by personal experience, intuition, heuristics and bias, their evaluations and decision are often unclear to the non-expert working at a local level. In order to make their reasoning more comprehensible to the non-expert, the ecological condition of 176 plots in the tropical Southeast of Mexico were evaluated by experts on soil fertility, forest management, cattle breeding and agriculture. With the assistance of a knowledge engineer (one who converts expert knowledge and reasoning into a model), these expert opinions and reasoning were then translated into a formal computer model.
   As an alternative approach we applied a knowledge discovery technique, namely the induction of regression trees and automatically developed models using the expert evaluations as training data. Where knowledge engineering was tedious and time consuming, regression models could be rapidly generated. Moreover, the correspondence between regression trees and expert opinions was considerably higher than the correspondence between expert opinion and their own models. The regression trees used less explicative variables than the models generated by the experts. The minimisation of sampling effort due to variable space reduction means that the application of regression tree induction has a high potential for a rapid development of indicators for narrowly defined ecological assessments, needed for decision making on a local or regional scale.

AB  - 1. Invasion by alien plant species represents a challenge to land managers throughout the world as they attempt to restore frequent fire-adapted ecosystems following decades of fire exclusion. In ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa forests of western North America, the response of alien species to restoration treatments has not been well documented, particularly for alien species capable of altering environmental conditions (transformers). Understanding alien species dynamics is critical for developing treatments that accomplish restoration goals while minimizing alien invasion.
   2. We used a replicated, randomized block experiment to compare the effects of an untreated control and thin-only, burn-only and thin-burn treatments on alien and transformer understorey species at multiple spatial scales (1 m(2), 100 m(2) and 1000 m(2)). Data were collected pre-treatment and for multiple post-treatment years. We compared richness and cover of alien species and transformer species among treatments, and identified environmental variables correlated with transformer species cover. Indicator species analysis was used to identify transformer species associated with specific treatments.
   3. Alien and transformer species richness and cover were significantly higher in the thin-burn than in all other treatments at all spatial scales. Thin-only and burn-only treatments showed greater alien and transformer species responses than the control at the larger 100-m(2) and 1000-m(2) scales.
   4. Increased transformer cover was strongly correlated with increased tree crown scorch height and removal of overstorey trees.
   5. The thin-burn treatment had four transformer species as indicators, the thin-only had one, while the burn-only and control had none.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The results show that alien species, including transformers, respond to restoration treatments, especially the combined thin-burn treatment. Therefore monitoring for alien species invasion is an essential component of a restoration programme. Abundance of transformer species increased with increasing disturbance intensity, suggesting that less intense single-disturbance treatments (burn-only, thin-only) or incremental treatments may be preferred in some applications. Where more intense treatments are required to meet management objectives, specific strategies, such as seeding of native species, limiting grazing before and after treatment and harvesting over a protective winter snowpack, may be necessary to limit alien invasion.

AB  - Assessments of ecological risk require accurate predictions of contaminant dynamics in natural populations. However, simple deterministic models that assume constant uptake rates and elimination fractions may compromise both their ecological realism and their general application to animals with variable metabolisms or diets. In particular, the temperature-dependent metabolic rates characteristic of ectotherms may lead to significant differences between observed and predicted contaminant kinetics. We examined the influence of a seasonally variable thermal environment on predicting the uptake and annual cycling of contaminants by ectotherms, using a temperature-dependent model of Cs-137 kinetics in free-living yellow-bellied turtles, Trachemys scripta. We compared predictions from this model with those of deterministic negative exponential and flexibly shaped Richards sigmoidal models. Concentrations of Cs-137 in a population of this species in Pond B, a radionuclide-contaminated nuclear reactor cooling reservoir, and Cs-137 uptake by uncontaminated turtles held captive in Pond B for 4 yr confirmed both the pattern of uptake and the equilibrium concentrations predicted by the temperature-dependent model. Almost 90% of the variance in the predicted time-integrated Cs-137 concentration was explainable by linear relationships with model parameters. The model was also relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the estimates of ambient temperature, suggesting that adequate estimates of temperature-dependent ingestion and elimination may require relatively few measurements of ambient conditions at sites of interest. Analyses of Richards sigmoidal models of Cs-137 uptake indicated significant differences from a negative exponential trajectory in the Ist yr after the turtles' release into Pond B, We also observed significant annual cycling of Cs-137 concentrations, apparently due to temperature-dependent metabolism and its influence on ingestion and elimination rates, However, equilibrium concentrations of the radionuclide in the wild population were predictable from negative exponential models based on average annual temperature and its effects on intake and elimination rates, also suggesting that predicting ectotherm responses to long-lived contaminants (such as Cs-137) may be possible without complex ecophysiological modeling.

AB  - Reverse osmosis (RO) is being used in many water reclamation facilities to produce high quality water that can be reused for different purposes. As a part of the RO process, a reject stream is produced as the reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC), which contains elevated levels of contaminants compared to the source water. Effective treatment and safe disposal of ROC via cost-effective means is very challenging. This study aims to develop a robust microbubble ozonation-biological process for industrial ROC treatment with a target effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) lower than 60 mg/L. As compared to macrobubble ozonation, microbubble ozonation exhibited better ozone dissolution and 29% higher COD removal efficiency with the same ozone dosage. Under the optimum operating conditions with ozone dosage of 30 mg/L, ROC natural pH of 8.67 and ozonation duration of 1 h, microbubble ozonation achieved 42% COD removal efficiency while increasing the BOD5/COD ratio (ratio of biological oxygen demand over 5 days to the corresponding chemical oxygen demand) in ROC from 0.042 to 0.216. A biological activated carbon (BAC) column with an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 120 min was combined with microbubble ozonation for continuous ROC treatment. Over the 100-day operation, the combined system performed consistent organics removal with an average effluent COD of 45 mg/L. Both LC-OCD data and fluorescence EEM spectra confirmed humic substances were the dominant organic species in ROC. Ozone pre-treatment could achieve significant removal of humic substances in raw ROC. ATP analysis found that ozone pre-treatment enhanced BAC biofilm activity by around 5 folds. 5 min acute toxicity assessment with Aliivibrio fischeri showed 4 times reduction of bioluminescence inhibition in ozone treated ROC. From the environmental point of view, Life cycle assessment (LCA) results demonstrated that Ozone-BAC system had significant environmental burdens on climate change and human toxicity due to the electricity production process. These environmental impacts can be mitigated by optimizing the ozonation process with reduced ozone dosage or utilizing renewable energy sources for electricity generation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The adjustment of aboveground biomass allocation is an important part of plant growth adaptation strategies. Due to global climate change, rising temperatures are causing changes in global air circulation patterns. Therefore, more extreme drought and flood events will happen in the future. Xerophytic shrubs are the main vegetation types of dryland ecosystems and are expected to be sensitive to changes in rainfall, which would inevitably affect the stability of the ecosystem. We conducted field experiments to simulate the effects of rainfall on Artemisia ordosica Krasch annual net primary productivity (ANPP) and allocation in the Mu Us Desert in northern China. This study examined six different rainfall levels: natural rainfall level (control); natural rainfall level reduced by 30%, 50%, and 70% (-30%, -50%, -70% treatment); and natural rainfall level increased by 30% and 50% (+30%, +50% treatment). The plant height, cover/volume, size/number of vegetative and reproductive twigs, and dry weight of vegetative and reproductive twigs were measured. The results showed the following: (1) Twig size and number are more sensitive to rainfall changes than the cover/volume of this species. (2) Rainfall has a significant influence on shrub ANPP (maximum ANPP was reached at + 30% treatment, and the minimum value was reached at -70% treatment). (3) With the increase or decrease of rainfall, A. ordosica number of twigs increased, and the length became shorter. (4) Rainfall had a significant effect on ANPP allocation (vegetative growth and reproductive growth). With the increase or decrease of rainfall, vegetative growth and reproductive growth of A. ordosica showed a trade-off strategy. Under the condition of adding rainfall, vegetative twig ANPP increased significantly. Under severe drought stress (-70% treatment), ANPP decreased significantly. Adding or subtracting rainfall caused a significant decrease in the vegetative twig ANPP ratio and a significant increase in the reproduction twig ANPP ratio. Our results highlight the sensitivity of twig size and number as indicators of shrub production estimation and the mechanism underpinning desert shrub ANPP response to global environmental changes.

AB  - Fire has shaped the environment and has been important for human cultural development. In this paper, we propose to study past fire events using ecological modelling. For instance, the ecology of fire can help us to understand and interpret archaeological problems related to past settlement patterns or environmental scenarios. Variation in fire regimens are related to both, vegetation and precipitation fluctuations. Recently, we have model past ecosystem dynamics using remote sensing in the Ambato Valley (Catamarca NW Argentina) ranging from 442 to 1998 CE. Our aim here is to use remotely sensed vegetation data to enhance our understanding of environmental disturbance in the period 2000-2011. We characterised the spatial-time dynamics of the annual NDVI as an indicator of vegetation functioning. Then we related the NDVI dynamics to precipitation and fire events in an arid highland environment in the area. Further, we analysed the vegetation data (monthly NDVI, MODIS/ TERRA satellite, 1km(2) pixels), and the climate data: annual precipitation. Then we calculated the NDVI annual average of every pixel and the NDVI anomalies of every year over the studied period. Lastly, we related NDVI data with annual precipitation and compared the NDVIs prior to and after known fire events in this period. On a spatial scale, the results show that the NDVI values were (a) low in shrublands and in cultivated areas, (b) medium in grasslands and piedmont forest with anthropic impact, and (c) high in highland forests. Within the studied time-period, extreme positive and negative anomalies were detected. The precipitation interannual variations were greater than the NDVI inter-annual variations, thus demonstrating that in some areas of the valley the horizontal precipitation can make important contributions to the ecosystem humidity. Extreme negative anomalies were observed the year of fire and fire scars at least for the next two years. These results demonstrate the relation between structure and function of vegetation, precipitation and fire. Understanding these relations can enable us to explain results when hindcasting ("predicting" what happened during past episodes of climate change) palaeoenvironmental conditions and fire events, thus helping us to interpret different archaeological contexts related to fire events.

AB  - It is estimated that world population will keep increasing until reach stability around 11 billion people in 2075. Therefore, the urban environment, housing for the majority of the global population, needs to be seen as a strategic priority in the near future, both in terms of the impact on natural resources and equity of welfare and social justice. Poverty (absolute and relative) and its relationship with health is still a challenge even in high-income countries. In Sao Paulo, there is a socio-spatial gradient of the relative risks for some mortalities, which increase as the socio-environmental profile of the population worsens. To break the link between poverty and health requires an understanding of spatial patterns beyond income as an aggregate indicator. Thus, I tested whether income is still the best indicator for explaining infant mortality in the city of Sao Paulo. For this I outlined an ecological, transversal study with spatial expression through the implementation of a project in Geographic Information System, from the geographic unit of the sample area of the 2010 Demographic Census. I compared income performance as an indicator with other indicators that express the population composition, socioeconomic conditions, income inequality and residential segregation. Data on deaths from DATASUS corresponded to the years 2006 to 2009. The relative risks were calculated through the SaTScan program, considering sex as covariate. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the micro data of the Demographic Census of 2010 referring to the sample areas. Statistical analyzes comprised simple non-spatial linear regression models (Ordinary Least Squares). Due to the spatial dependence of the residues of these models, global spatial regression models were applied, which were not able to fully explain the studied mortalities. Finally, the geographically weighted regression models allowed verifying important spatial associations. The Index of Concentration in the Extremes (ICE) for income and affluent White race or color on poor Black, Mixed or Indigenous people was the best predictor for infant mortality (R2 = 0.39 and AIC = 59.28). The results allow concluding that it is possible to move beyond income by incorporating aspects of residential segregation by income and color or race combined.

AB  - Large quantities of free protein in the environment and other bioaerosols are ubiquitous throughout terrestrial ground level environments and may be integrative indicators of ecosystem status. Samples of ground level bioaerosols were collected from various ecosystems throughout Ecuador, including pristine humid tropical forest (pristine), highly altered secondary humid tropical forest (highly altered), secondary transitional very humid forest (regrowth transitional), and suburban dry montane deforested (suburban deforested). The results explored the sensitivity of localized aerosol protein concentrations to spatial and temporal variations within ecosystems, and their value for assessing environmental change. Ecosystem specific variations in environmental protein concentrations were observed: pristine 0.32 +/- 0.09 mu g/m(3), highly altered 0.07 +/- 0.05 mu g/m(3), regrowth transitional 0.17 +/- 0.06 mu g/m(3), and suburban deforested 0.09 +/- 0.04 mu g/m(3). Additionally, comparisons of intra-environmental differences in seasonal/daily weather (dry season 0.08 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3) and wet season 0.10 +/- 0.04 mu g/m(3)), environmental fragmentation (buffered 0.19 +/- 0.06 mu g/m(3) and edge 0.15 +/- 0.06 mu g/m(3)), and sampling height (ground level 0.32 +/- 0.09 mu g/m(3) and 10 m 0.24 +/- 0.04 mu g/m(3)) demonstrated the sensitivity of protein concentrations to environmental conditions. Local protein concentrations in altered environments correlated well with satellite-based spectral indices describing vegetation productivity: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r(2)=0.801), net primary production (NPP) (r(2) = 0.827), leaf area index (LAI) (r(2)=0.410). Moreover, protein concentrations distinguished the pristine site, which was not differentiated in spectral indices, potentially due to spectral saturation typical of highly vegetated environments. Bioaerosol concentrations represent an inexpensive method to increase understanding of environmental changes, especially in densely vegetated ecosystems with high canopies or in areas needing high spatial and temporal resolution. Further research to expand understanding of the applicability of bioaerosol concentrations for environmental monitoring is supported by this pilot study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf wax n-alkanes are long-chain hydrocarbons that can persist in sedimentary records over geological timescales. Since their hydrogen isotopic composition (expressed as a delta D value) can be correlated to the delta D values of precipitation, leaf wax n-alkane delta D values have been advocated as new and powerful proxies for paleohydrological research. The exact type of hydrological information that is recorded in the delta D values of leaf wax n-alkanes remains, however, unclear. In a companion paper we provide experimental evidence showing that the delta D values of leaf wax n-alkanes of angiosperm plants grown under controlled environmental conditions not only reflect delta D values of precipitation - as has often been assumed - but that evaporative deuterium (D)- enrichment of leaf water has an additional critical effect on their delta D values. Here we present a detailed observational study that illustrates that evaporative D-enrichment of leaf water also affects the delta D values of leaf wax n-alkanes in plants from natural ecosystems along a 1500 km climate gradient in Northern Australia. Based on global simulations of leaf water D-enrichment we show that the effects of evaporative D-enrichment of leaf water on leaf wax n-alkane delta D values is relevant in all biomes but that it is particularly important in arid environments. Given the combined influence of precipitation delta D values and leaf water D-enrichment we argue that leaf wax n-alkane delta D values contain an integrated signal that can provide general hydrological information, e.g. on the aridity of a catchment area. We also suggest that more specific hydrological information and even plant physiological information can be obtained from leaf wax n-alkanes if additional indicators are available to constrain the plant- and precipitation-derived influences on their delta D values. As such, our findings have important implications for the interpretation of leaf wax n-alkane delta D values from paleohydrological records. In addition, our investigations open the door to employ delta D values of leaf wax n-alkanes as new ecohydrological proxies in contemporary plant and ecosystem sciences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - European risk managers currently face substantial difficulty in evaluating the risks of genetically modified (Gm) crops for biodiversity. This difficulty is not primarily due to a lack of scientific data (the data are abundant) but rather to a lack of clear criteria for determining what represents environmental harm. Establishing criteria that define harm is not a scientific process but a process of analysing and implementing policy requirements, and policy-makers and regulatory authorities need to define what is to be regarded harmful based on existing legislation. This process is a necessary pre-condition for the environmental risk assessment of GM crops. The present paper proposes a systematic approach on how harm can be explicitly and operationally defined for decision-making. Most legal frameworks require the protection of the environment or more specifically of biodiversity from harm. It follows that the first step in defining harm should be the characterisation of protection goals; protection goals are those valued environmental resources that should not be harmed by GM crop cultivation or by any other agricultural practice. In a second step, one must derive scientifically measurable entities (so-called assessment endpoints) on the basis of the protection goals. Such endpoints are required for regulatory decision-making because they specify what deserves protection. They furthermore allow quantifiable predictions of adverse changes during environmental risk assessment. Definitions of harm also require decisions on which environmental changes should be regarded as relevant and thus represent unacceptable harm. Using a case study comparing different effects of various pest management practices, the current paper proposes an approach that differentiates between intended effects that are acceptable and harmful unintended effects. By making explicit the assumptions underlying policy choices, the ecological criteria proposed here may result in a better and more transparent evaluation of the probability of harm to biodiversity due to the cultivation of GM crops. The paper can help risk managers improve decision-making by providing methods for deriving operational decision-making criteria from policy objectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A symposium was held 8 August 1991, at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles and The Herpetologists' League in University Park, Pennsylvania. The topic, "Amphibian Declines and Habitat Acidification" was selected for its relevance to the topical issues of a precipitous drop in many amphibian populations, and possible causation by acidic atmospheric deposition. As organizers, we felt that a rigorous approach to these issues requires meticulous field documentation of population fluctuations and correlated environmental measures of pollution, along with an experimental ecotoxicological analysis of possible anthropogenic causation. Because of the potential for large-scale environmental change acting synergistically with pollution across landscapes, the experimental elucidation of cause and effect will be extremely difficult. It appears that some amphibian populations fluctuate in an episodic fashion, but there are no long-term data bases adequate to determine whether particular declines are uniequivocally due to acidic deposition from non-point sources, other anthropogenic causes, natural causes, or interactions among them. This series of papers deals with the effects of acidic waters and soils on amphibians in England and North America. It is very clear that acidic habitats of natural and polluted origin exclude certain species and cause sub-lethal and lethal effects. However, no data are at hand which show directly that anthropogenic acidification causes amphibian populations to decline. There is considerable interest in the development of bioindicators of habitat decline. Net loss of body sodium and the embryonic curling defect in amphibians are examples of the best of such direct bioassays in acidified aquatic and terrestrial habitats. There is a strong need for standardization of test conditions so that better comparisons can be made among results from laboratories in different geographic regions. We recommend that a number of sites be chosen for long-term (10 year minimum) study of the relation between amphibian population cycles and anthropogenic change. This research would provide data not only specifically pertinent to the issue of amphibian declines, but would also provide valuable tests of the usefulness of amphibians as general bioindicators of ecosystem decline in response to anthropogenic stress. These issues are complex and are not amenable to quick solutions. A sustained commitment is needed by researchers and funding agencies to provide long-term monitoring and rigorous experimental tests of the causes of any declines in especially sensitive biotic components of ecosystems.

AB  - The environmental risk assessment (ERA) for genetically modified plants (GMPs) is a prerequisite for commercial approval of these new varieties according to regulatory systems worldwide. The first country to regulate GM crops was the USA and the issue of possible environmental impacts was based on the principles used in risk assessment of pesticides. Two main pillars of this approach are the use of surrogate species for testing effects on non-target organisms using a tiered assessment with clear thresholds to indicate the need to move between tiers. The latest EFSA guidance document on ERA of Genetically Modified Organisms considers specifically the receiving environment in preparation of ERA for commercial cultivation of GMPs. According to existing guidelines in the EU, the receiving environment is defined by three mutually interacting components: the characteristics of the environmental stressor (i.e. the GM plant), the bio-geographical regions where the commercial release of the crop is expected and the agricultural systems therein. Difference in agronomic and ecological conditions (e.g. use of different varieties, vegetation of adjacent areas, non-target species assemblages, sensitivity of local species to the stressors) suggests that explicit considerations of the receiving environments are necessary. Results from field experiments indicate that differences in cultivation practices, e.g. the herbicide regime used on herbicide-tolerant GM crops, may induce direct and indirect effects on wild plant distribution and abundance, with consequent repercussions on food webs based on these plants. Moreover, ecological literature indicates that the concept of surrogate species has clear limitations if applied broadly to any ERA. Starting from case studies regarding GMPs, this paper discusses some ecological and agronomic characteristics of agro-ecosystems, which have implications in the elaboration of both hazard and exposure analyses during ERA. The species selection approach indicated in the EFSA Guidance Document and the consideration of the area(s) of the expected release of the new variety may provide the basis to an ecologically sound ERA for a range of environmental stressors. The quality of the data that become available for risk managers with this approach may support a more transparent and dependable ERA and risk management for GMPs as well as for other potential environmental stressors in agro-ecosystems.

AB  - Diatoms are diverse and widespread freshwater Eukaryotes that make excellent microbial subjects for addressing questions in metacommunity ecology. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, the simple trophic structure of glacier-fed streams provides an ideal outdoor laboratory where well-described diatom assemblages are found within two cyanobacterial mat types, which occupy different habitats and vary in coverage within and among streams. Specifically, black mats ofNostocspp. occur in marginal wetted habitats, and orange mats (Oscillatoriaspp. andPhormidiumspp.) occur in areas of consistent stream flow. Despite their importance as bioindicators for changing environmental conditions, the role of dispersal in structuring dry valley diatom metacommunities remains unclear. Here, we use MCSim, a spatially explicit metacommunity simulation package for R, to test alternative hypotheses about the roles of dispersal and species sorting in maintaining the biodiversity of diatom assemblages residing in black and orange mats. The spatial distribution and patchiness of cyanobacterial mat habitats was characterized by remote imagery of the Lake Fryxell sub-catchment in Taylor Valley. The available species pool for diatom metacommunity simulation scenarios was informed by the Antarctic Freshwater Diatoms Database, maintained by the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research program. We used simulation outcomes to test the plausibility of alternative community assembly hypotheses to explain empirically observed patterns of freshwater diatom biodiversity in the long-term record. The most plausible simulation scenarios suggest species sorting by environmental filters, alone, was not sufficient to maintain biodiversity in the Fryxell Basin diatom metacommunity. The most plausible scenarios included either (1) neutral models with different immigration rates for diatoms in orange and black mats or (2) species sorting by a relatively weak environmental filter, such that dispersal dynamics also influenced diatom community assembly, but there was not such a strong disparity in immigration rates between mat types. The results point to the importance of dispersal for understanding current and future biodiversity patterns for diatoms in this ecosystem, and more generally, provide further evidence that metacommunity theory is a useful framework for testing hypotheses about microbial community assembly.

AB  - Modelling tree habitat suitability (HS) is a common practice to assess tree species distribution across a broad range of spatial scales. However, it is seldom used to test the extent that modelled HS-scores (probability of species occurrence) can represent on-the-ground measures of species-structural characteristics. In this study, we compare four parametric and non-parametric models generated with the R-package, sdm, to assess the potential for these models to estimate tree species distribution of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] in naturally-growing forests across an extensive landscape. Central to this development are inventory plot data of species presence-absence and four abiotic factors linked to plant growth and distribution. The study's abiotic factors include: (1) photosynthetically active radiation; (2) growing degree-days; (3) relative extractable soil water content; and (4) near-surface wind speed, all expressed spatially at 30-m resolution. To gauge whether modelled HS can explain structural characteristics in balsam fir-dominated stands, field-based estimates of site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG) were compared against independently-derived HS-scores. The results showed that: (i) random forest was the most successful at representing species distribution of balsam fir among the four methods considered; (ii) overall growing conditions for balsam fir was observed to be most favourable on north-facing slopes, particularly in the northwest part of the target landscape, where near-surface air temperatures are cooler, soils are moderately wetter, and wind speeds are lower; (iii) tree-based calculations of SI were partially characterised by patterns in modelled HS-scores, due to scale differences (i.e., from individual tree to 30-m grid cells) and an inadequate number of sample trees; and (iv) patterns of cumulative AGB were more accurately represented by species HS. Modelled HS-scores, as potential indicators of tree species habitat preference, AGB, and species distribution, can offer key ecological information essential to inform forest management and conservation planning at the landscape level.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are amongst the most heavily altered ecosystems and exhibit a disproportional loss of biodiversity. Numerous stressors, such as nutrient enrichment, contaminant pollution, sedimentation and alterations in stream hydrology and habitat structure, account for these losses. Understanding these forces is of utmost importance to prevent riverine ecosystems from further deterioration and to provide helpful insights for restoration practices. In the present study, we analyse the response of biological indicators to a large number of environmental factors. For this, benthic invertebrate assemblages from 83 sites in Germany were described based on 25 metrics from four different metric types. The condition of the sites was described using 27 environmental factors; 13 for water quality, 4 for land use in the catchment and 10 for local scale habitat structure. The relative importance of single environmental predictors or predictor combinations for benthic invertebrate assemblages was analysed with single and multiple linear regression models. The results for the latter models were statistically supported via a bootstrap approach. The models revealed the importance of water quality and catchment-scale land use in explaining benthic invertebrate assemblages; in particular, chloride, oxygen, total organic carbon and the amounts of artificial surfaces and arable land were the most important predictors. Models including solely structural variables such as plan form, bank structures and substrate diversity had lower goodness of fit values than those for other variables. Regarding the four different assemblage metric types, functional metrics had on average lower goodness of fit values than composition/abundance, richness/diversity and sensitivity/tolerance metrics. Among the richness/diversity metrics, however, the model results for the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indices and evenness were poor. Our results show that catchment-related factors and water quality were of overriding importance in shaping biodiversity patterns and causing species loss. In contrast, structural degradation at a local scale was not the most significant stressor.This finding might explain why structural restoration at a reach scale often yields a low benefit-cost ratio and may be considered to represent inappropriate investment prioritisation.

AB  - The Chironomidae (Diptera: Insecta) have a high species richness, with species adapted to live under widely different environmental conditions. The study of the taxonomic composition of chironomid larvae and the percentage of occurrence of deformities in mouthparts, mainly in the mentum, are used in biomonitoring programmes in order to obtain information on the levels of organic and chemical pollution of aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the abundance of chironomid larvae and to quantify the occurrence of mentum deformities in the specimens collected in three urban reservoirs with different trophic levels. The reservoirs are located in the hydrographic basin of the Paraopeba River, an affluent of the Sao Francisco River basin (Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil). The Serra Azul Reservoir is oligotrophic, the Vargem das Flores Reservoir is mesotrophic, and the Ibirite Reservoir is eutrophic. Along the littoral zone of each reservoir, 30 samples were collected during each sampling campaign. Sampling was carried out every three months for one year, with two sampling campaigns during the wet season and two during the dry season in 2008. Physical and chemical parameters measured in the water column included the water depth, Secchi depth, air and water temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, Total-N, Total-P, P-ortho, and chlorophyll-a. The chironomid larvae were identified to the genus level. The structure of the chironomid assemblages was evaluated based on taxonomic richness (24 genera), density, equitability, and diversity. The potential indicator taxa for each reservoir were established through an Indicator Species Analysis. The values for taxonomic richness (20 taxa), equitability (0.737), and Shannon-Wiener diversity (2.215) were highest in the Serra Azul Reservoir. Fissimentum was the indicator taxon in Serra Azul, the oligotrophic reservoir; whereas Pelomus was the indicator taxon in Vargem das Flores, and Chironomus in Ibirite. The highest percentage of mentum deformities was found during the dry season in Serra Azul (6.9%), while the lowest percentage was found during the wet season in Vargem das Flores (0.8%). The results of this study evidenced significant differences in the taxonomic composition, richness, equitability, and diversity of the chironomid assemblages in these three reservoirs of different trophic levels.

AB  - Mean length in the catch of Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus) declined drastically by 8 cm in a few months in 1992. The 1991-93 El Nino event marked the beginning of changes in bottom environmental conditions, that along with other changes in the ecosystem, were the cause of the disappearance of large sized old hake from the traditional fishing grounds and the invasion of these areas by high concentrations of small sized young hake, traditionally distributed in the southern areas. A misinterpretation of this change gave an optimistic perception of the state of the stock, leading to a large increase of the fishing fleet and therefore to an increase of the fishing pressure on this resource. Catch increased quickly to very high levels in 1996, the fishery indicators of relative abundance remained stable, while global abundance of hake was diminishing. The resource responded to these natural variations of environment and to the intense fishing pressure with changes in some aspects of its biology and ecology. The most remarkable was the decrease of the length and age at first maturity that led to spawning by 1 year old (19 cm) individuals in a species whose observed longevity was 14 years.
   In 2002 a total and indefinite fishery closure was established by the Peruvian government and a technical commission for the hake recovery was created, which carried out continuous monitoring of the stock. After a closure of 20 months the indicators showed signs of recovery and the fishery was reopened in 2004. However, after an encouraging beginning during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, neither abundance nor age structure bad improved by the end of 2005, and in fact were deteriorating by the start of 2006. The survival of the age 2 and 3 groups was very low and few 4+ years old individuals were observed. Several factors working at different time scales have been proposed to explain the status of hake. The impact of the fishery, variations in the abiotic environment, predation by the jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) and cannibalism were considered as potential causal factors of this decline.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes in lakes and rivers are highly sensitive to changes in water quality and ecological conditions. Satellite remote sensing of aquatic macrophyte distributions can map changes in freshwater ecosystem dynamics. However, macrophyte mapping by remote sensing is challenging in lakes dominated by algal blooms or with high turbidity. In this study, we mapped the composition and distribution of emergent/floating and submerged macrophytes in the large turbid and eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. We used a novel classification method and 16 y of MODIS images to map these data. The inter-annual trends in macrophyte distribution and cover show complex dynamics in this heavily-managed lake. The area occupied by emergent/floating macrophytes increased from 39.3 km(2) in 2000 to 90.3 km(2) in 2015 (a 230% increase), whereas the area dominated by submerged macrophytes decreased from 404.6 km(2) in 2001 to 167.5 km(2) in 2015 (a 59% decrease). We also used the annual date of initial macrophyte occurrence and growth period to examine temporal variation in species composition and biodiversity of macrophytes. Aquatic macrophytes in different parts of the lake responded differently to temporal trends in water quality (Secchi disk and nutrient concentrations), hydrology (water level), and meteorological data (daily temperature, precipitation, and h of sunlight). Changes in lake transparency occurred over the study period, reducing the availability of underwater solar irradiance. Light availability was the most influential local environmental factor for macrophyte dynamics. We also found that eutrophication control projects indirectly reduced lake ecosystem quality in some bays. These control projects included water transfers from the Yangtze River (dilution), aquaculture management actions, macrophyte removal, and dredging. Our findings suggest the species composition and area covered by aquatic macrophytes in this shallow lake are driven by multiple mechanisms. These results highlight that efforts to manage the increase in algal-dominated lake areas require a more complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of management activities. We also show that satellite-based remote sensing measurements of macrophyte spatial and temporal dynamics provide a useful indicator to evaluate the impacts of these activities.

AB  - The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this population of cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in San Diego Bay has been monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in blubber, blood and milk. Data generated from these studies have afforded insight into the fate and possible effects of OC contaminants in marine mammals. We now report preliminary findings on the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy outcome. Blubber OC levels were compared between females whose calves survived beyond 6 months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12 days of birth. The mean concentration of Sigma DDT was more than 3 times as high among dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves survived beyond 6 months (P = 0.002). Mean Sigma PCB was more than 2.5 times higher in females whose calves did not survive (P = 0.076). This population is a logical sentinel for the assessment of environmentally mediated disease. Biological tissues and fluids can be sampled on a regular basis from the dolphins for accumulation of tissue residues, facilitated by conditioned husbandry behaviors. These trained behaviors help preclude possible alterations in health measures resulting from capture stress. Animals' diets can be monitored for contaminant levels. With these data, the expertise and facilities available at the Navy laboratory and in collaboration with other experts in the field, controlled studies can be designed to monitor and assess dietary exposure, measurable immune and neurologic responses and assess reproductive and transgenerational effects of contaminants. Biomarkers can be developed to relate the health of individual animals relative to contaminant exposures. Such investigations of natural exposure and response scenarios are a logical adjunct to traditional laboratory toxicity studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Integrating soil physico-chemical properties and soil invertebrate bioindicators could prove a practical and robust method for assessing reclamation and soil biological quality of cultivated lands disturbed by oil and natural gas activities. Until the current study, there have been no data or analyses showing these relationships in cultivated lands. We examined a fine line between two types of disturbance (i.e., cropland, oil & gas reclaimed cropland) and the invertebrates that could tolerate these disturbed conditions. We aimed to determine 1) if crop type, age class, reclamation criteria, soil type, disturbance history (reclaimed wellsite) or a combination of these factors, influenced invertebrate abundance; 2) if invertebrate community abundance correlated with soil physico-chemical properties or with the presence of major mesofauna taxa, and 3) if reclamation efforts, plus the additional yearly cultivation activities, ameliorate the biological effects of oil and gas disturbance. Although we identified a clear trend in the densities and abundances of major mesofauna taxa, they did not differ significantly between groups. Reclaimed sites appeared more susceptible to crop pests (Psocoptera and Hemiptera), especially on younger sites, which could have been driven by higher bulk density (low aeration). There were clear differences in soil physico-chemical properties bulk density, pH, and total organic carbon (TOC), which were not reflected in the Acari:Collembola (A:C) ratios, invertebrate density or community results. There were some correlations between physico-chemical properties and specific invertebrate groups. Oribatida were positively correlated with electrical conductivity; Astigmata, Oribatida, and Symphyla were negatively correlated with bulk density; Prostigmata, Collembola, and Mesostigmata were negatively correlated with pH, and Mesostigmata were positively correlated with TOC. The site age results indicate that cultivation activities may reset mesofauna community succession each year, creating densities and abundances similar to that of adjacent cultivated fields and masking long-term industrial effects. For these reasons, neither broad invertebrate taxa nor A:C ratios should be used as indicators of reclamation quality or biological recovery on industrially reclaimed, cultivated sites if the comparable references are also cultivated. We foresee expansions of this research with functional trait analysis, as well as exploring differences at a finer taxonomic level within invertebrates.

AB  - Existing methods for applying the planetary boundary concept in life cycle assessment are not sufficiently spatially and temporally resolved. Here, we develop a new method for freshwater use based on the safe operating space (SOS) at watershed-level. The SOS is based on the concept of environmental flow requirements, which is the share of mean monthly flow that should be reserved to achieve or maintain "fair conditions" of aquatic ecosystems. The method is composed of two steps. First, water consumption is multiplied by a characterization factor, which converts it to an environmental impact, expressed as an area-equivalent of a watershed's mean monthly flow. Second, the environmental impact is compared to an assigned share of SOS to determine if the activity causing it can be considered environmentally sustainable, with respect to a chosen principle for sharing the SOS.
   The method is demonstrated for a case study on water consumed for irrigation in open-field tomato production in 27 watersheds, spanning 10 countries and 5 continents, based on data for 316 farms in the year 2014. Water consumption was modelled from crop characteristics, climatic data and the assumed type of irrigation system. Two principles, "status quo" and "gross value added", were illustratively applied for the assignment of SOS to 1 tonne of tomatoes.
   The characterization factors developed span two orders of magnitude from 10th to 90th percentile, which shows the relevance of a spatially and temporally explicit assessment. In the case study, the characterization factors largely determine the high variability in the resulting environmental impacts between watersheds, which ranged from 400 m(2) to 50,000 m(2) per tonne of tomatoes. The analysis would suggest that the freshwater use by current tomato farming is environmentally sustainable in all months in a maximum of 2 of the 27 watersheds with respect to the two principles applied for sharing the SOS.
   The method can be used as a basis to identify potential "planetary boundary hotspots" in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. Two key challenges are the lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data in current life cycle inventories and the choice of sharing principle for assigning the SOS.

AB  - Buffer strips have recently become the main management practice for reducing logging impact on stream habitats in boreal and temperate regions. The habitat value of buffer strips, however, has not received much attention, although riparian forests belong to the systems with the highest biodiversity in these regions. We used plants as indicators of the ability of buffer strips to maintain an environment similar to intact riparian forests in a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. We measured the growth of three common bryophyte species (Hylocomiastrum umbratum, Calypogeia integristipula, and Tritomaria quinquedentata) transplanted to riparian habitat close to a stream in clear-cut logged sites 10-15 m wide buffer strips on each side of the stream, and intact (reference) sites. Each of the three site categories included six wet and six tnoist-mesic sites and the experiment was followed over three months in 1999.
   The species remained vital in the reference sites and grew substantially during the 3-mo-long experiment, but in the logged sites almost no growth was registered, and many shoots died (except for T. qninquedentata). The pattern was consistent irrespective of the ground moisture class. The performance of bryophytes in the moist-mesic buffer strips was almost as bad as in the logged sites, whereas in the wet buffer strips it was either intermediate between that in logged and reference sites (H. umbratum) or very similar to that in reference sites (C. integristipula and T. quinquedentata). The edge effect has previously been shown to vary depending on edge orientation, edge physiognomy, and weather conditions. We found that ground moisture can be of major importance as well. Although many buffer strips function better than no strips, 20-30 m wide strips (with a stream in the middle) through a logged area consist entirely of edge habitat. Increasing the buffer width and avoiding clear-cut logging on both sides of a watercourse would be the first steps to take for improving biodiversity conservation in riparian habitats. Our results also show that bryophytes are good indicators of habitat quality and efficient tools for assessing the ecological function of buffer strips.

AB  - Poyang Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in China, has a seasonal flooding cycle that significantly changes the water level every year. The aim of this study was to research the effects of water-level changes on periphytic algal assemblages in Poyang Lake. Dynamic shift of periphytic algal biomass were studied from November 2016 to July 2019. Periphytic algal biomass and species composition were analyzed microscopically, and physicochemical conditions were measured. There were significant seasonal variations in the community distribution of periphytic algae. The biomass of the periphyton ranged from 8 to 22,636 mg m-2. Periphytic algal biomass ranged from 30 to 622 mg m-2 with the average of 204 mg m-2 in the LWL phase; periphytic algal biomass ranged from 8 to 21,839 mg m-2, with the average of 3,399 mg m-2 in the IWL phase. It ranged from 166 to 22,636 mg m-2, with the average 4,320 mg m-2 in the HWL phase and from 16 to 3,231 mg m-2 with the average of 585 mg m-2 in the DWL phase. There were temporal variations in periphytic algal community structure in Poyang Lake. Cryptophyceae dominated in algal periphyton from November 2016 to February 2017. Bacillariophyceae dominated from March to July 2017 (increasing water-level phases). Pynephyceae and Euglenophyceae were dominant from August and September (high-water-level phase) in 2017. Bacillariophyceae dominated through 2018 with occasional dominance of Cryptophyceae from January to June and the occasional dominance of Chlorophyceae from July to December. Chlorophyceae dominated from January to July in 2019 with occasional dominance of Bacillariophyceae. The water-level variations led to environmental heterogeneity in Poyang Lake, creating heterogeneous habitats for algal periphyton. Our study revealed the primary importance of water level, water temperature, conductivity, total nitrogen, nitrite and total phosphorus as abiotic local factors structuring the periphytic algal community in Poyang Lake. The water-level changes did not prevent growth of periphytic algae, but it did change the periphytic algal community assemblages. This research provides data on the periphytic algae in Poyang Lake and will be useful for establishing biological indicators of environmental changes and protecting Poyang Lake in the future.

AB  - A thorough understanding of the geochemical behavior of W in soils is crucial for environmental risk assessment. Soil pH is known as master variable of element solubility and bioavailability in soils. Here we report on effects of soil pH (modified by liming and acid - base additions) and soil aging on the environmental availability of W in soil using W solubility and chemical fractionation as indicators. Experimental soils included two naturally acidic soils with contrasting soil texture (SAND, CLAY), at native pH or limed with 2.5% CaCO3, and spiked with increasing concentration of W. Our results showed that W was significantly more labile in alkaline compared to acidic soils, confirming the validity of results of pure-mineral studies for more heterogeneously composed soils. While labile W was generally greater in the SAND compared to the CLAY soil, the reverse trend was observed in the limed soils at the highest W addition (5000 mg kg(-1)). Combining our results with previous mechanistic reports suggests that clay edge sorption sites significantly contributed to W retention in treatments with low to medium W additions, resulting in lower environmental availability for W in the CLAY soil. At high W concentrations and high pH, the stronger W retention in the SAND was attributed to continuous formation of W surface polymers on the more abundant metal (oxyhydr)oxides, a process that has been previously reported to occur even under alkaline conditions. A first comparison of various soil chemical methods (Bray & AB-DTPA extractions, soil solution centrifugation CL, diffusion-based DGT) to predict W phytoavailability in soil also revealed a strong pH dependency challenging the identification of a suitable method. This study is one of the first demonstrating the pH dependence of W in natural soils and delivers evidence for increased risk of W mobilization in W polluted, alkaline soil environments.

AB  - Halda, one of the major tributaries of the mountainous river Karnaphuli, is well known as the country's only natural carp spawning ground. Naturally fertilized eggs of carps collected from Halda River are hatched in mud-made scoops on the river ban k for aquaculture purposes. However, the river habitat is under constant threat due to human interventions like loop cutting, pollution from the paper mill and power plant, blocking natural water flow of larger tributaries by introducing sluice gates, embankments and rubber dam over the river at upstream, as well natural causes like siltation, erosion and climate change impacts. A study is conducted to address the issues of the ecosystem, sustainable management and the flow regulation impacts of dams in the Halda River, although the flow regulation assessments are conducted based on the macroinvertebrate, index-based framework, land-use effects on the hydrology, new indicators development, hydrologic impact assessment, hydrodynamics in dam regulated rivers, surface-water hydrodynamics and regimes of a small mountain stream and wide range of initiatives. In our case, we considered runoff flow, mountainous flow and dams in the rivers are primary parameters for assessment, so based on previous studies we decided to simulate a hydrologic and hydrodynamic model for the dam and without dam scenarios. Major difficulties and challenges for the environmental flow analysis of a river are continuous data availability. In this research, a hydrologic model ArcSWAT has been built to assess the contribution of rainfall on the river discharge to be used as output from the tributaries in the hydrodynamic model Delft3D. The research findings help us to perceive the effect of the dams on fish breeding condition in the river. In order to perform the environment flow analysis of the river, Tennant method has been followed in the study, which is a secure and reliable approach. The flow regulation impacts are assessed for fish habitat and spawning in the river area based on the simulations. Finally, the findings are further analyzed for velocity profiles for dams by building block method for the sustainable aquatic habitat in the Halda River.

AB  - Climate change and population growth are degrading coastal ecosystems and increasing risks to communities and infrastructure. Reliance on seawalls and other types of hardened shorelines is unsustainable in an era of rising seas, given the costs to build and maintain these structures and their unintended consequences on ecosystems. This is especially true for communities that depend on coastal and marine ecosystems for livelihoods and sustenance. Protecting and restoring coral reefs and coastal forests can be lower cost, sustainable alternatives for shoreline protection. However, decision-makers often lack basic information about where and under what conditions ecosystems reduce risk to coastal hazards and who would benefit. To better understand where to prioritize ecosystems for coastal protection, we assessed risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass along the entire coast of The Bahamas, under current and future climate scenarios. Modeled results show that the population most exposed to coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded. We also found that ecosystem-based risk reduction differs across islands due to variation in a suite of ecological, physical, and social variables. On some populated islands, like Grand Bahama and Abaco, habitats provide protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the rest of the country. Risk reduction provided by ecosystems is also evident for several sparsely populated, remote coastal communities, which in some cases, have large elderly populations. The results from our analyses were critical for engaging policy-makers in discussions about employing natural and nature-based features for coastal resilience. After hurricanes Joaquin and Matthew hit The Bahamas in 2016 and 2017, our assessment of coastal risk reduction and the multiple benefits provided by coastal ecosystems helped pave the way for an innovative loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to the Government of The Bahamas to invest in mangrove restoration for coastal resilience. This work serves as an example for other regions and investors aiming to use assessments of ecosystem services to inform financing of natural and nature-based approaches for coastal resilience and climate adaptation.

AB  - The guidelines for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) recommend the use of standard ecotoxicity assays and the assessment of endpoints at the individual level to evaluate potential effects of PPCP on biota. However, effects at the sub-individual level can also affect the ecological fitness of marine organisms chronically exposed to PPCP. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the environmental risk of two PPCP in marine sediments: triclosan (TCS) and ibuprofen (IBU), using sub-individual and developmental endpoints. The environmental levels of TCS and IBU were quantified in marine sediments from the vicinities of the Santos submarine sewage outfall (Santos Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at 15.14 and 49.0 ng g(-1), respectively. A battery (n = 3) of chronic bioassays (embryo-larval development) with a sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus) and a bivalve (Perna perna) were performed using two exposure conditions: sediment-water interface and elutriates. Moreover, physiological stress through the Neutral Red Retention Time Assay (NRRT) was assessed in the estuarine bivalve Mytella charruana exposed to TCS and IBU spiked sediments. These compounds affected the development of L. variegatus and P. perna (75 ng g(-1) for TCS and 15 ng g(-1) for IBU), and caused a significant decrease in M. charruana lysosomal membrane stability at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.08 ng g(-1) for TCS and 0.15 ng g(-1) for IBU). Chemical and ecotoxicological data were integrated and the risk quotient estimated for TCS and IBU were higher than 1.0, indicating a high environmental risk of these compounds in sediments. These are the first data of sediment risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products of Latin America. In addition, the results suggest that the ERA based only on individual-level and standard toxicity tests may overlook other biological effects that can affect the health of marine organisms exposed to PPCP.

AB  - Aquaculture activities are increasing worldwide, stimulated by the progressive reduction of natural fish stocks in the oceans. However, these activities also suffer heavy production and financial losses resulting from fish infections caused by microbial pathogens, including multidrug resistant bacteria. Therefore, strategies to control fish infections are urgently needed, in order to make aquaculture industry more sustainable. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as an alternative to treat diseases and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance by pathogenic bacteria. The aim of this work was to evaluate the applicability of aPDT to inactivate pathogenic fish bacteria. To reach this objective a cationic porphyrin Tri-Py+-Me-PF was tested against nine pathogenic bacteria isolated from a semi-intensive aquaculture system and against the cultivable bacteria of the aquaculture system. The ecological impact of aPDT in the aquatic environment was also tested on the natural bacterial community, using the overall bacterial community structure and the cultivable bacteria as indicators. Photodynamic inactivation of bacterial isolates and of cultivable bacteria was assessed counting the number of colonies. The impact of aPDT in the overall bacterial community structure of the aquaculture water was evaluated by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE). The results showed that, in the presence of Tri-Py+-Me-PF, the growth of bacterial isolates was inhibited, resulting in a decrease of approximate to 7-8 log after 60-270 min of irradiation. Cultivable bacteria were also considerably affected, showing decreases up to the detection limit (approximate to 2 log decrease on cell survival), but the inactivation rate varied significantly with the sampling period. The DGGE fingerprint analyses revealed changes in the bacterial community structure caused by the combination of aPDT and light. The results indicate that aPDT can be regarded as a new approach to control fish infections in aquaculture systems, but it is clearly more difficult to inactivate the complex natural bacterial communities of aquaculture waters than pure cultures of bacteria isolated from aquaculture systems. Considering the use of aPDT to inactivate pathogenic microbial community of aquaculture systems the monitoring of microorganisms is needed in order to select the most effective conditions.

AB  - Arcellaceans have been used as indicators of a variety of paleolimnological conditions including pH, eutrophication, oxygen level, and heavy metal contamination, but there has only been limited application of the group to climate and land-use change research. The limnological evolution of Swan Lake in southwestern Ontario was documented using arcellaceans as proxies, and compared to the results of a palynological analysis, with which it closely correlated. The palynological record documents the rapid disappearance of forest by around 1850 as the area was cleared for agriculture and settlements. The change was characterized by a shift in the palynological record from the Woodland to High Diversity assemblages. Similarly the arcellacean fauna changed from the Pre-European Settlement Assemblage to the distinctive low diversity, stressed environment European Deforestation Assemblage. The introduction of high-yield chemical fertilizers in the post World War II era, and the resultant eutrophication of the lake, was clearly recognizable in the palynological record as indicated by the dramatic increase in the algae Pediastrum (High Nutrient Assemblage). This change in farming practice was also identifiable with arcellacean proxies, as indicated by the appearance of the algalphilic Eutrophication Assemblage. The arcellacean Ecologically Destabilized Assemblage dominated the lake for short intervals during the transition between the Pre-European Settlement and European Deforestation assemblages and again at the transition between the European Deforestation and Eutrophication Assemblages, indicative of periods of ecological destabilization as the lake adjusted to new trophic inputs. A stressed environment arcellacean Ecologically Destabilized Assemblage found in a portion of the core estimated to have been deposited between AD 1350 and AD 1700 may provide evidence of an earlier phase of deforestation associated with Huron Indian agricultural practices. The close correlation between the palynological and arcellacean proxy data clearly demonstrates the potential of arcellaceans as land-use change proxies, and indicates that changes in land-use had an almost immediate impact on the Swan Lake ecosystem. This observation raises concerns about the impact that rapid urbanization is having on the environmentally sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine watershed, of which Swan Lake is a part.

AB  - Sponges are sessile filter feeders found in all aquatic habitats from the tropics to the arctic. Against potential environmental hazards, they are provided with efficient defense systems, e.g., protecting chaperones and/or the P-170/multidrug resistance pump system. Here we report on a further multidrug resistance pathway that is related to the pad one homologue (POH1) mechanism recently identified in humans. It is suggested that proteolysis is involved in the inactivation of xenobiotics by the POH1 system. Two cDNAs were cloned, one from the demosponge Geodia cydonium and a second from the hexactinellid sponge Aphrocallistes vastus. The cDNA from G. cydonium, termed GCPOHL, encodes a deduced polypeptide with a size of 34,591 Da and that from A. vastus, AVPOHL, a protein of a calculated M-r of 34,282. The two sponge cDNAs are highly similar to each other as well as to the known sequences from fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and other Metazoa (from Schistosoma mansoni to humans). Under controlled laboratory conditions, the expression of the potential multidrug resistance gene POHL is, in G. cydonium, strongly upregulated in response to the toxins staurosporin (20 muM) or taxol (50 muM); the first detectable transcripts appear after 1 d and reach a maximum after 3 to 5 d of incubation. The relevance of the expression pattern of the G. cydonium gene POHL for the assessment of pollution in the field was determined at differently polluted sites in the area around Rovinj (Croatia; Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea). The load of the selected sites was assessed by measuring the potency of XAD-7 concentrates of water samples taken from those places to induce the level of benzo[a]pyrene monooxygenase (BaPMO) in fish and to impair the multidrug resistance (MDR)/P-170 extrusion pump in clams. These field experiments revealed that the levels of inducible BaPMO activity in fish and of the MDR potential by the water concentrates are highly correlated with the level of expression of the potential multidrug resistance gene POHL in G. cydonium. This report demonstrates that the detoxification POH pathway, here mediated by the G. cydonium GCPOHL gene, is an additional marker for the assessment of the environmental load in a given marine area.

AB  - Simple Summary Reindeer herding is the most important agricultural sector of the Russian Far North, representing the local genetic resources that compose original genetic wealth for the indigenous Arctic ethnic groups, which has maintained their life in harsh conditions of the area for many years. Conservation about and further rational use of such resources are very difficult without taking into account genetic diversity. Here, for the first time, the current genetic composition of the four officially recognized reindeer breeds and their ecotypes inhabiting the area from the Kola Peninsula in the west to the Chukotka region in the east are described using a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Our findings reveal the genetic uniqueness of each breed, formed by the consequences of ecological processes, internal gene flow, breeding practices, and geographical features. The obtained results will assist the ongoing breeding policy to develop accurate programs to preserve genetic resources of this essential element of Russia's Far North ecosystem. To examine the genetic diversity and population structure of domestic reindeer, using the BovineHD BeadChip, we genotyped reindeer individuals belonging to the Nenets breed of the five main breeding regions, the Even breed of the Republic of Sakha, the Evenk breed of the Krasnoyarsk and Yakutia regions, and the Chukotka breed of the Chukotka region and its within-breed ecotype, namely, the Chukotka-Khargin, which is bred in Yakutia. The Chukotka reindeer was shown to have the lowest genetic diversity in terms of the allelic richness and heterozygosity indicators. The principal component analysis (PCA) results are consistent with the neighbor-net tree topology, dividing the reindeer into groups according to their habitat location and origin of the breed. Admixture analysis indicated a genetic structuring of two groups of Chukotka origin, the Even breed and most of the geographical groups of the Nenets breed, with the exception of the Murmansk reindeer, the gene pool of which was comprised of the Nenets and apparently the native Sami reindeer. The presence of a genetic component of the Nenets breed in some reindeer inhabiting the Krasnoyarsk region was detected. Our results provide a deeper insight into the current intra-breeding reindeer genetic diversity, which is an important requirement for future reindeer herding strategies and for animal adaptation to environmental changes.

TI  - The use of phytoplankton as an indicator of internal hydrodynamics of a large seaside reservoir - case of the Sasyk Reservoir, Ukraine
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The Sasyk Reservoir, one of the largest seaside reservoirs on the northwest shore of the Black Sea, the former river delta currently detached from the sea with a narrow bar of sediments, was investigated for spatial distribution of water quality characteristics with the use of bioindication method. A three day preliminary sampling campaign of phytoplankton held in the summer 2013 revealed that the reservoir's dominating species belonged to moderate temperature, freshwater, low acidic and low alkaline indicative groups. They suggest standing to slow-moving hydrodynamics of water masses, that contain a medium amount of oxygen. The indices of ecosystem status, such as index of organic pollution according to Watanabe, modification of Sladecek, water quality classes based on saprobity, trophic state indicator groups, nitrogen metabolism indicator groups, as well as Shannon index coincided, showing medium polluted Class III (saprobity) eutrophic water with prevailing moderate concentrations of organically bounded nitrogen. Environmentally homogeneous water masses were dominated with local anomalies on the locations of inflows of waters of different physicochemical characteristics from rivers and the Danube-Sasyk Canal, saline waters from the sea, and nitrogen enriched groundwater from intensive agricultural area. Two types of ecosystems were identified, the one connected with the main water body and the other with the shallows. The sampling was performed in the condition of no outflow, but the wind direction and the wind driven internal dynamics of the reservoir were the major influencing factors for phytoplankton distribution. A gradient of water pollution in the direction of the north-south section of the receiving water from the Danube-Sasyk Canal was revealed. Although the reservoir ecological processes seems to be effective enough in metabolizing the incoming pollution, the symptoms of progressing deterioration of water quality (small-cell forms of organisms) indicate the need for further monitoring and proper management. The bioindicative method appeared to be in some cases more sensitive in ecosystem and abiotic factors analysis then a standard physicochemical analysis, which creates a ground for further developing of its predictive potential.

AB  - Background: Heavy metals like Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co and Cr can naturally be found almost all over this planet in various amounts. Urban activities such as heavy metal industry, traffic and waste can rapidly increase the metal concentrations in a fresh water ecosystem.
   Methods: This study was done in natural conditions to capture as many aspects in heavy metals pollution and bioremediation of Nicolina River, Romania considered a stream model which is under anthropogenic pressure. Water, sediment and leaves samples of Typha latifolia L. were collected during October 2013 and analyzed in order to assess certain heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co and Cr) from each sampling site using GF-HR-CS-AAS with platform. Heavy metals in significant concentrations in cattail samples were correlated with the water parameters to show the possibility to use the cattail leaves as indicators in heavy metals pollution with potential in bioremediation because they can be easily harvested in autumn and this species is spread worldwide.
   Results: The levels of metals concentrations in leaves were: Cu > Ni > Cr > Pb > Co knowing that copper is an essential element for plants. The sampling time was important to draw the river diagnosis for heavy metal pollution. The samples were collected, from river, after more than 60 days without rain same as a "human patient" prepared for blood test. Cobalt was considered the metal marker because it was an element with the lowest level of usage in the city. Compared with it only lead, cadmium and copper were used intensively in the industrial activities.
   Conclusions: T. latifolia L. can be use as an indicator for the health of the studied stream and it was noticed that the heavy metals were not accumulated, although the metal uptake was influenced by sediments and water parameters. The alkalinity of the studied river acts as an inhibitor in the bioremediation process of cattail for cadmium and copper. Lead was uptake by leaves and the water parameters influenced it but it wasn't concentrated enough in leaves to propose this species in lead bioremediation process for Nicolina River.

AB  - Aim Predictions of aquatic ecosystem change with global warming require basic data that accurately reflect the environmental conditions underlying species distributions. However, in remote arctic areas such baseline data are scarce. We assess the influence of environmental variables on chironomid distribution and taxon richness in shallow, isothermal lakes in a poorly studied arctic region. We pay particular attention to community variation along the treeline ecotonal zone where many environmental variables change abruptly in a relatively small area.
   Location Lake transect in Finnish Lapland spanning from boreal coniferous forest to arctic tundra.
   Methods Chironomid assemblages were determined from surface-sediment samples of 50 shallow (< 10 m) natural lakes. Abundance and taxon richness data were related to 24 limnological variables using canonical ordination techniques (DCA, CCA, RDA). A Monte Carlo permutation procedure was used to assess the explanatory power of single variables. Between-vegetation zone differences of richness were tested for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA.
   Results In total, 7771 chironomid head capsules were identified, consisting of 13 species, 10 species groups, four subgenera, 41 genera, four genus groups, five types and three with uncertain taxonomic affiliation. A hump-shaped relationship between taxon richness and elevation was noted along the study transect with a peak in taxon richness occurring in mountain birch woodland lakes at middle elevations, decreasing then towards both warmer and colder ends of the elevation/temperature gradient. Of the individual parameters, sediment organic content, total organic carbon, pH, and lake-specific air temperature accounted for the greatest amount of variation in the chironomid data.
   Main conclusions Maximum taxon richness occurred at mid-elevations where aquatic algae also reached their maximum diversity. This area coincides with an ecotonal transitional zone, which seems more likely to account for the peak in species richness. Our study demonstrates that the factors most strongly affecting chironomids in Finnish Lapland (i.e. temperature, and ecosystem features) are those that with great probability will also change as a result of future climate change. This will likely have an effect on the distribution of chironomids in subarctic and arctic areas.

AB  - Understanding the response of plant species to soil factors on coastal sand dunes is critical for effective conservation of coastal habitats in the Mediterranean basin. Our main objectives were to investigate: i) the main soil factors driving species composition in a Mediterranean coastal dune environment; ii) the ecological requirements of focal plant species with respect to single soil factors; iii) whether the focal species of a given macrohabitat (including EU habitats) have similar edaphic needs. We identified 108 plots with three macrohabitats as strata (embryo dunes; mobile dunes; fixed dunes) by random stratified sampling design along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy in areas with a high degree of biodiversity and naturalness. Vegetation and soil data were collected in the plots.
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) confirmed that soil had a main role in driving focal dune species composition as found in other Mediterranean areas and indicated that three factors (field capacity, pH and CaCO3) sufficiently explain patterns of plant species. An inverse relation between field capacity, which proves to be the most decisive feature for differences in species ecological requirements between macrohabitats, and pH was observed. Generalized Additive Models (GAMS) showed that: i) the focal species of fixed dunes have a higher probability of occurrence and response curves that overlap at high field capacity and TOC values and at low pH, showing an opposite trend with respect to the species of embryonic and mixed dunes; ii) species of mixed dunes have a probability of occurrence linked to different values of CaCO3, with Ammophila arenaria showing its optimum at high CaCO3 values. Thus our results sustain the hypothesis that dune focal species, diagnostic and characteristic of coastal dune macrohabitats, have different ecological responses with respect to soil factors. Moreover, species within the same habitat can have different ecological responses due to species competition. Data about edaphic requirements of sand dune species and modelling of their ecological responses suggests that focal dune species can be bio-indicators of soil conditions and provide useful indications for conservation, monitoring and restoration of Mediterranean coastal habitats.

AB  - Contamination of soil with toxic heavy metals poses a major threat to the environment and human health. Anthropogenic sources include smelting of ores, municipal wastes, fertilizers, and pesticides. In assessing soil quality and the environmental and ecological risk of contamination with heavy metals, often homogeneous contamination of the soil is assumed. However, soils are very heterogeneous environments. Consequently, both contamination and the response of soil organisms can be assumed to be heterogeneous. This might have consequences for the exposure of soil organisms and for the extrapolation of risk from the individual to the population level. Therefore, to explore how soil contamination of different spatial heterogeneity affects population dynamics of soil invertebrates, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based model of the springtail, Folsomia candida, a standard test species for ecotoxicological risk assessment. In the model, individuals were assumed to sense and avoid contaminated habitat with a certain probability that depends on contamination level. Avoidance of contaminated areas thus influenced the individuals' movement and feeding, their exposure, and in turn all other biological processes underlying population dynamics. Model rules and parameters were based on data from the literature, or were determined via pattern-oriented modelling. The model correctly predicted several patterns that were not used for model design and calibration. Simulation results showed that the ability of the individuals to detect and avoid the toxicant, combined with the presence of clean habitat patches which act as "refuges", made equilibrium population size due to toxic effects less sensitive to increases in toxicant concentration. Additionally, the level of heterogeneity among patches of soil (i.e. the difference in concentration) was important: at the same average concentration, a homogeneously contaminated scenario was the least favourable habitat, while higher levels of heterogeneity corresponded to higher population growth rate and equilibrium size. Our model can thus be used as a tool for extrapolating from short-term effects at the individual level to long-term effects at the population level under more realistic conditions. It can thus be used to develop and extrapolate from standard ecotoxicological tests in the laboratory to ecological risk assessments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A survey of 18 watercourses of the Tiber River basin was carried out to define the ecological niche breadth of some aquatic bryophyte species in relation to environmental factors. Aquatic bryophytes were sampled and water environmental parameters were measured at 99 stations distributed along the catchment (from the headwater regions to the downstream reaches). The datasets of the collected species and environmental data were analyzed by using a multivariate statistical analysis (PCA biplot). Ecological responses of the recorded aquatic bryophytes were obtained using a fuzzy set approach, and were compared with data from literature. The results show that the presence of the aquatic bryophytes in watercourses is affected negatively by the reduction of water velocity, clearness, substratum size and the worsening quality of the water physico-chemical status. In fact, aquatic bryophytes show a general preference for stations characterized by medium-large granulometry, and fast-flowing, clear, oxygenated (mean value 9.2 mg/l), cool waters (mean value 15.0 degrees C), with low loads of nutrients, particularly ammonia (mean value 0.10 mg/l) and phosphates (mean value 0.09 mg/l). However, ecological responses reveal different patterns in the distribution of aquatic bryophyte species mainly in relation to water physicochemical parameters (e.g. temperature, conductivity, ammonia, phosphates). E.g. Palustriella commutata var. commutata, Cratoneuron filicinum, Fissidens viridulus and Cinclidotus aquaticus show high preference for clear, turbulent and fast-flowing waters, with temperature below 12 degrees C, conductivity below 300 mu S/cm, and concentrations about 0.01 mg/l for phosphates, not exceeding 0.10 mg/l for ammonium ions and 0.90 mg/l for nitrates. Leptodictyum riparium and Riccia fluitans are for their part more linked to turbid and slow waters affected by eutrophication, showing optimum values for about 0.30 mg/l for ammonia concentration, 0.90 mg/l for nitrates and 0.11 and 0.22 mg/l for phosphates respectively. Conversely, Fontinalis antipyretica is not closely related to specific conditions, showing wide ecological ranges for most of the analyzed environmental factors. This paper has evaluated and discussed the possible use of sampled species as bioindicators for biomonitoring of the water quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hatchability is the most important elements for producing more ducks. Hatchability is an indicator used to determine the economic value for any commercial hatchery. Optimal conditions during the incubation process may be defined as those leading to maximum hatchability of healthy ducklings. One of the main factors in the success of the duck hatching process is to adjust the appropriate temperature and humidity with the ventilation of the eggs enough as well as a proper turning of the eggs. In addition, the complete disinfection of eggs and incubator machine, and the process of egg candling to define the fertile eggs in order to maintain the hygienic conditions of the incubator and ensure a high hatchability. By knowing the simple steps of hatching duck eggs, successful management can access different ways to improve the hatchability. Therefore, this review was conducted to reveal the incubation factors that influence the hatchability of duck eggs and also the new ways to improve the hatchability.

AB  - The zooplankton community presents stochastic temporal fluctuation and heterogeneous spatial variation determined by the relationships among the organisms and environmental conditions. We predicted that the temporal and spatial zooplankton distribution is heterogeneous and discrete, respectively, and that the daily variation of most abundant species is related to environmental conditions, specifically the availability of resources. Zooplankton samples were collected daily at three sampling stations in a lateral arm of the Rosana Reservoir (SP/PR). The zooplankton did not present significant differences in abundance and evenness among sampling stations, but the temporal variation of these attributes was significant. Abiotic variables and algal resource availability have significantly explained the daily variation of the most abundant species (p<0.001), however, the species distribution makes inferences on biotic relationships between them. Thus, not only the food resource availability is influential on the abundance of principal zooplankton species, but rather a set of factors (abiotic variables and biotic relationships).

AB  - Traffic emission is a major source of air pollution in the urban environment, especially along narrow and main traffic arteries. The purpose of this study is to analyze the dependence of the measured air pollutants on street configuration, traffic levels and meteorological parameters.,
   In the frame of an EU project, OSCAR (Optimised Expert System for Conducting Environmental Assessment of Urban Road Traffic), simultaneous measurements were carried out for a number of traffic-related pollutants on two typical roads - a street canyon and open road. Their traffic measurements (volume, classification and speed) and meteorological data were continuously sampled and recorded.
   Spatial and temporal variations as well as the correlation of the above parameters have been examined. Measurement comparison showed a different behaviour, as far as the primary and secondary (i.e O-3) emitted pollutants are concerned. In that case, geometry seemed to be of great importance. Meteorological conditions significantly affected the levels of pollutants in the streets. Low and parallel to the street axis, winds not significantly contributed to the pollutants' dispersion.

AB  - The technique of karst susceptibility assessment in the territory of Ust-Kishert village is presented. The environmental conditions of predominantly gypsum and carbonate-gypsum karst area are analyzed. The zonation map of karst cavities and crushed zones density is created. The distribution of the overlying soil geotechnical property values within the classes of different subterranean karst form density is carried out and presented in the form of histograms and distribution curves. The computer simulation of the soil stress condition is used to demonstrate that karst cavity affects the mechanical properties of the overlying soils and alters the initial stress in the soils. In our research, the anomalous values of the overlying soil geotechnical properties are applied as the indicators of the karst cavities and crushed zones location. The anomalous value intervals are determined by one-dimensional statistical analysis. The analysis of the overlying soil geotechnical properties is resulted in the integral model of karst susceptibility in the research area.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of climate variability on the phenotype, leaf litter decomposition intensity and seedling spread of alien red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Twenty-eight red oak forest stands located in Lithuania were evaluated. Indirect climate change indicators such as continentality were used in the analysis. Simulation of climate warming was achieved using an agro sheet cover. According to the results, the morphological traits of red oak stems in the maritime regions (warmer winters) do not differ significantly from those of red oaks stems in the continental areas of Lithuania (colder winters, more frequent spring frosts). Red oak leaf litter under an agro sheet cover (warmer conditions) decomposes at almost the same intensity as without the cover (natural conditions). The red oak seedlings spread 100 m or more irrespective of continentality. These results showed indirectly that climate change will not affect red oak stem quality or microorganism activity in the process of leaf litter decomposition. Red oak will thus remain as an invasive species, threatening composition change in native forests.

AB  - Wastewater reclamation was studied by using a small biological reactor and an external filtration membrane coupled in series. Use of the membrane enhanced the quality of the effluent of the biological reactor in terms of suspended solids and presence of indicator bacteria. Partial removal of faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli was observed in the effluent of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) previous to filtration by the membrane. Use of the membrane ensured full removal of the indicator bacteria in the final permeate. More than 95% of organic matter, suspended solids, and coliform. bacteria were successfully removed. The operation and behaviour of internal submerged membranes in two different bioreactors was an additional objective. For this reason, two configurations-a membrane coupled to a SBR (MSBR) and a continuous membrane bioreactor (MBR)-were used during the study. Particular attention was focused on fouling and hydraulic conditions in the membranes. Fouling could be reduced by maintaining turbulent conditions and by operating at sub-critical flux.

AB  - The occurrence of a species along an environmental gradient can be considered as the product of its physiological requirements and competitive interactions with other species. One may, therefore, expect that this realized habitat differs between areas when a species has to co-exist with different species. To test this hypothesis, we compared the responses of wetland plants to hydrological conditions in two European lowland river valleys: the Drentse A valley (The Netherlands) and the Peene valley (eastern Germany). We used mean water level and wafer level amplitude as hydrological parameters to analyse differentiation in realized habitats within species. Most species occurred in slightly wetter conditions, with higher fluctuations in the German site but with narrower tolerances for these parameters. We suggest that this may result from a higher competition intensity for light, possibly caused by a larger local species pool and/or presence of more dominant species with a high competitive ability. The consequences for practical applications-such as parameter estimation fbr predictive models-are discussed.

AB  - This study was designed to develop a protocol for using a biologically-based system to detect and tract airborne herbicides. Common bean, lentil, and pea were selected for their quasi-diagnostic sensitivity to chlorsulfuron, thifensulfuron, metsulfuron, tribenuron, paraquat, glyphosate, bromoxynil, 2,4-D, and dicamba. Plants were grown in the greenhouse at Prosser, WA, and placed at 25 exposure sites at weekly intervals between Apr. 2 and Oct. 15, 1991. After 1 wk of field exposure plants were brought back and observed for herbicide symptoms over a 28-d period. Symptoms that developed were compared with symptoms caused by disease, insects, adverse weather conditions, and herbicides applied at different rates under controlled conditions on these species. In addition, if herbicide symptoms were observed, herbicide spray records and weather data in the area were used in a computer model to determine the source of potential herbicide drift. This study demonstrates that indicator plant species selected for high sensitivity to herbicides can be used to monitor the occurrence of herbicide movement.

AB  - Business environment is an essential indicator of a country's competitiveness in general, and in the tourism field in particular. The aim of this paper is to examine whether indicators of the Business Environment pillar of the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) share common factors. We use TTCI data of seven indicators obtained from World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey for 119 countries during 2017 and 2019. Factor analysis shows two common factors, namely General legislative conditions (protection of property rights, regulations on foreign direct investment, indicators of legal and judicial systems, and market dominance) and Taxation (specifically, its extent and effect on incentives to work and invest). Data of TTCI show that overall Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Finland have the best business environment. Contrastingly, doing business is most difficult in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Mauritania. The specific findings are very similar for both analysed years. The results of this study could be useful in any attempts to manage the business environment in travel and tourism.

AB  - The article is devoted to assessment of the development level of the Central Federal district, based on the study of gross domestic product by region by Russian Classification of Economic Activities grouped by institutional sector of the economy. We apply the author's methodological toolkit that includes the formation of individual and integrated indicators of the functioning of complex systems, considered as socio-ecological and economic systems. The algorithm of constructing indicators is based on aggregate data and econometric modeling and takes into account both individual assessment indicators and specific conditions for these systems functioning (factors of condition and impact). We present the methodology of forming the harmonic coefficient characterizing the equilibrium of socio-ecological and economic systems economic development by activities, the latter is one of the criteria of complex systems stability. This approach was tested on the example of Central Federal district regions using Russian Federation Federal State Statistics Service data for 2007-2015.

AB  - Lake Champlain is host to a diversity of recreational and other uses that may have social and ecological impacts. Questions of how much and what type of use should be allowed in recreation areas can be addressed through carrying capacity frameworks, using indicators and standards of quality. This study focuses on indicators and standards of quality for paddling on the lake along a non-motorized kayak and canoe trail. A number of indicator variables are identified, including scenery, quiet and solitude, being on the water, presence of wildlife, motorized watercraft, shoreline development, and invasive lake vegetation. Standards are formulated for three variables: 1) presence of sailboats and motorboats, 2) shoreline development, and 3) campsite impacts. Study findings indicate that conditions typically experienced by paddlers are nearing the minimum acceptable condition for both the number of motorboats and sailboats on the lake and the amount of shoreline development. Monitoring and management may be needed to maintain high quality paddling experiences on the lake. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a particular focus of environmental research, involving the examination of many pollutants and their reactivity. Special attention must be paid for an accurate characterization of AMD samples in the field and in the laboratory. AMD samples are typically unstable due to the presence of colloidal material such as iron oxyhydroxides and bacteria. They induce physical and chemical transformations that may affect the analytical results. Variations in pH are recorded within days following sample collection, indicating changes in their chemistry. The present work demonstrates evidence of the instability of AMD samples, through the results of monitoring experiments performed under different laboratory conditions. Expeditious indicators, such as pH and electrical conductivity (combined with the analysis of crystallinity, composition and morphology of the resulting precipitates), allow monitoring of the evolution of the samples. The results also provide information about the transformation of the typical ochre products that precipitate from AMD, suggesting the formation of schwertmannite and its evolution to a more crystalline mineral.

AB  - The present study aimed to establish potential indicators of fish farming pollution in muddy substrate, by means of meiofauna, and to test whether the effect of the fish farm is more important to determine the meiofauna community than the seasonal environmental conditions. Sampling was performed in spring, after several months of light feeding, and in summer, at high food supply. Samples were collected in three directions at various distances from the floating cages. Harpacticoid copepods and kinorhynchs, whose abundance decreased under the cages, were put forward as indicator taxa. However, harpacticoid copepods were sensitive to fish farm only, while kinorhynchs showed responsiveness to fish farm and to seasonal environmental conditions. Total meiofauna density was dependent on season sensu stricto. The nMDS clearly showed a 'cage community' and 'control community' in both sampling occasions; therefore it is a good tool for impact assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The survival of indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and enterococci) and polio viruses in Lake Kinneret were studied at different seasons, under various light and oxygen-sulfide regimes. Survival of the bacteria was dependent on environmental conditions, whereas numbers of polioviruses (pfu) were high for all the seasons studied. A large discrepancy was often noted between the methods to determine bacterial numbers (plate counts on selected media and direct counts). Under certain conditions, bacterial plate counts dropped, even though the direct counts remained the same or increased. These ''inactive'' or non-culturable cells were still viable, since glucose uptake activity was not impaired in such bacteria. Inactivation of E. coli appears to be initiated by light, although sulfide also renders the cells non-culturable. Survival patterns of E. coli and polioviruses in the lake were similar, suggesting that for the Kinneret, at least, E. coli is a better indicator of fecal pollution than the enterococci.

AB  - should remain the last resort, and should only be applied after having carefully considered cheaper alternatives in terms of supply and demand management. A second conclusion is that the private sector can play a useful and important role in funding and operating desalination plants, but only if the above conditions are met. If these conditions are absent, there is a risk that excessive investments in desalination become a drain to the national budget, either directly under public financing or indirectly through implicit or explicit guarantees under private financing. A third conclusion is that desalination technology itself has evolved substantially, making it significantly cheaper, more reliable, less energy-intensive and more environmentally friendly than it was a few decades ago. This is especially true for reverse osmosis, which is gaining a large share of the market outside the Gulf countries which continue to use mainly distillation technologies.

AB  - We simultaneously measured the fecal microbiota and multiple environmental and host-related variables in a cohort of 185 healthy horses reared in similar conditions during a period of eight months. The pattern of rare bacteria varied from host to host and was largely different between two time points. Among a suite of variables examined, equitation factors were highly associated with the gut microbiota variability, evoking a relationship between gut microbiota and high levels of physical and mental stressors. Behavioral indicators that pointed toward a compromised welfare state (e.g. stereotypies, hypervigilance and aggressiveness) were also associated with the gut microbiota, reinforcing the notion for the existence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. These observations were consistent with the microbiability of behaviour traits (> 15%), illustrating the importance of gut microbial composition to animal behaviour. As more elite athletes suffer from stress, targeting the microbiota offers a new opportunity to investigate the bidirectional interactions within the brain gut microbiota axis.

AB  - Owing to the depletion of resources coupled with increasing waste generation, the conversion of waste biomass to value-added materials has gained interest. Here, we report for the first time the application of Musa acuminata (banana) peel ash (MAPA) as a heterogeneous catalyst for C-C bond formation via a Henry reaction under solvent-free conditions at ambient temperature. The catalyst was well characterized using different analytical techniques like FT-IR, SEM, TEM-EDS, XRD, XRF, XPS, BET and TGA, along with basicity determination by a Hammett indicator test and titration method. An excellent yield of nitroalcohol was obtained within 15-30 minutes. No dehydrated product was observed. The catalyst used in these studies has the advantage of being a waste material and is hence low-cost, easily prepared, recyclable and environmentally friendly. In addition, the use of a biogenic renewable catalyst, its atom economy, and room temperature and solvent-free reaction conditions and the avoidance of column chromatography make the protocol highly significant from green and sustainable chemistry perspectives.

AB  - With growing population as well as increasing automobile and energy use, transport externalities are inevitably on the rise. Internalized transport externalities include monetary costs from impacts on the society and environment, such as air pollution, congestion, noise, traffic accidents and greenhouse effects. However, externalities also vary depending on the geographic conditions, modes of transport, intensity of traffic and population exposed in the metropolitan areas. To indicate precisely how externalities differ in relation to modes and territories, this research principally aims at presenting methods for comprehensive evaluation of external costs based on objective territorialization in the greater Paris region. It does so with a gravity indicator that is related to the intensity of traffic and population. The objectives of this research are to evaluate the external costs related to the geographical conditions of the greater Paris region and then to compare the respective characteristics of these external costs in order to determine the coherence of urban transport policies.

AB  - This paper reviews the identification of the various levels of structure present in fat crystal networks, and the development of analytical techniques to quantify these levels. The relationship of the various levels of structure to macroscopic physical indicators of the mechanical strength of the network is discussed. The analysis of the microstructural level of the network via fractal geometrical methods is discussed, as well as mechanical models relating the structure to mechanical properties. A method developed to quantify the fractality of fat crystal networks is also presented. The effect of processing conditions on microstructural indicators of the elastic modulus of the network is also discussed. This paper summarizes some 50 years of endeavor to relate the structure of fat crystal networks to their macroscopic rheological properties. (C) 1999 Candian Institute of Food Science and Technology.

AB  - Power batteries in electric vehicles are subjected to vibration during vehicle's driving. Clarifying battery vibration characteristics in service conditions is the basis for understanding battery performance and for structure improvement. The acceleration responses at multiple points on a battery pack are measured on various road conditions in this study. Indicators, namely, the standard deviation of acceleration root-mean-square (SD-ARMS) and fatigue damage spectrum (FDS), are introduced to analyse vibration differences among various positions and with vibration test standards. Time-forced vibration test profiles are derived based on the calculated FDS curves. The findings are first to indicate obvious vibration inconsistency among the sampling points in the Z direction, with high SD-ARMS values. The fatigue damage values computed from measured data and from standard vibration profiles significantly deviate. This research provides an intact method from measurements, and evaluates vibration levels to generate time-forced vibration profiles for battery durability assessment.

AB  - A two-year field experiment was carried out in a typical Mediterranean environment (Foggia, Southern Italy) to evaluate the effect of the reduction of nitrogen (N) fertilization on yield, quality, N uptake, N utilization efficiency, and on environmental impact of processing spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). In a completely randomized experimental design with four replications, 50, 75, and 100% (150, 225, and 300 kg N ha-1, respectively) of the normal rate applied by the farmers in the trial area were compared. In both years, the total amount of the urea fertilizer applied was broadcasted three times. The results obtained indicate that a lower N fertilization level ensured a satisfactory yield, increased quality and N utilization efficiency. However, crop performances and the amount of N available for leaching were dependent by the weather conditions occurred during plants growth, being significant the year x N fertilization rate interaction.

AB  - Emissions of N2O, a greenhouse gas, were measured in field conditions on a Rendzic Leptosol, an Eutric Leptosol, a Haplic Calcisol, a Haplic Luvisol and two Gleyic Luvisols under cultivation, and on a Haplic Fluvisol and two Gleyic Cambisols under cultivation and grassland conditions. The kinetics of N2O production and consumption during denitrification in these soils were studied during anaerobic incubations in the laboratory, with NO3- and N2O addition in the presence or absence of acetylene. The soils with the highest "in situ" levels of N2O emission, i.e. the Gleyic Luvisols under cultivation and the grassland soils, exhibited considerable transient accumulation of N2O during denitrification studied in the laboratory. We therefore propose an empirical indicator, measured in the laboratory, of the soil's potential to emit N2O on the field scale. Carbon addition to one of the Gleyic Luvisols promoted N2O reduction and limited the transient accumulation of N2O during laboratory denitrification.

AB  - Stalagmite ZJD-21 (12.3-cm long) was collected from Zhijin Cave in Zhijin County, Guizhou, China. Its Pb-210 profile and seven Th-230/U-234 dates indicate that the stalagmite has grown continuously for the past 1100 years. The (delta O-18 record of ZJD-21 indicates that delta O-18 in the stalagmite was mainly influenced by rainfall amount and/or summer/winter rain ratio, with lighter values corresponding to wetter climatic conditions and/or more summer monsoonal rains. The ZJD-21 delta O-18 record suggests: (1) dry/warm climates during AD 950-1100 (overlapping with most of the Medieval Warm Period, MWP, in Europe); (2) strengthening of the summer monsoon from the MWP toward the beginning of the Little Ice Age (LIA) at AD 1250; (3) relatively wet/cold conditions occurred between AD 1250 and 1500, shown by relatively light (5180 values; (4) the summer monsoon intensity strongly declined referred by the increase (delta O-18 trend from AD 1500 to AD 1600, perhaps resulting in dry/cold conditions; and (5) a strongly enhancement of the summer monsoon intensity appeared from AD 1700 to 1950, reflecting wet/cold conditions during the late period of the LIA. On decadal scales the monsoonal climate of central western Guizhou can be either warm/wet and cold/dry, or warm/dry and cold/wet. The (delta C-13 variations in ZJD-21 on decadal-to-centennial scales respond mainly to vegetation changes with heavier values reflecting lesser amount of forest coverage. Prior to AD 1700, the (delta C-13 generally co-varied with (5180 reflecting the expected more extensive vegetation growth (lighter delta C-13) under wetter climate (lighter (delta O-18). However, during the past 300 years the (delta C-13 increased sharply showing an opposite trend to that of (delta O-18. This observation strongly suggests that a decline of surface vegetation due to an artificial deforestation might have occurred - an occurrence coincident with the large-scale immigration into central western Guizhou in connection with copper-mining activities during the reign of Emperor Yongzheng of Qing Dynasty. Since the late 1890s, especially in the past 50 years, population surge has led to serious karst rocky desertification in the area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An understanding of the partition between pre-anthesis and post-anthesis N uptake and their contribution to total grain N and protein content in spring two-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare spp. distichum L.) is important to achieve additional breeding progress for both fodder and malting barley. N translocation from the vegetative tissues at anthesis to the kernel, N translocation efficiency, and N harvest index (NHI) were studied in field experiments during 4 years (1995-1998). Plants were harvested at anthesis and maturity and divided into leaf+culm, chaff and grain. Significant cultivar differences in N translocation, N translocation efficiency and NHI were determined. Across cultivars, the highest N translocation was in a favorable year (93 kg ha(-1)) and the lowest in a year with poor growing conditions (40 kg ha(-1)). Cultivar differences in N translocation were related to dry matter and pre-anthesis N accumulation (R-2 > 0.70). N translocation efficiency varied more among the cultivars (0.27-0.66) than years (0.47-0.52). Post-anthesis N uptake was negatively correlated (P < 0.01) with N translocation. NHI ranged among the cultivars from 0.49 to 0.73 and among the years from 0.57 to 0.74. The cultivars Arapiles, Schooner, Cantala, Kaskade and Pek stored in the grain more than 70% and Hiproly less than 50% of above-ground N at maturity. Translocated N participated with 85, 56, 42, and 61% in grain N in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. The ratio of translocated N to grain N could be an indicator of growing conditions; a higher ratio indicates good growing conditions over the entire growth period, a lower ratio indicates poor conditions during pre-anthesis, and a medium ratio indicates some temperature and water deviations from the long-term average. Straw N concentration was in significant positive (P < 0.01) correlation with N translocation and translocation efficiency. Straw N concentration adequately represents N efficiency utilization for synthesis of grain protein, and because it saves time and money compared to N harvest index determination, it can be used for the testing of breeding materials for the development of new barley cultivars.

AB  - Appendicularians are important but remain poorly studied groups of zooplankton in polar regions. The present research is based on samples collected in Admiralty Bay (King George Island) during a year-long period. Six larvacean species were noted, among which Fritillaria borealis and Oikopleura gaussica were found to be the most numerous, while the other species were relatively rare. Fritillaria borealis was a dominant part of the late summer (warm water) community, while O. gaussica had the highest presence in the winter (cold water) community. The abundance of appendicularians recorded in the bay was less numerous than that described by other authors. The most important factors influencing annual changes in the larvaceans in the bay was season, but only in the case of the two species. These facts were probably linked to the very dynamic changes in the abiotic conditions in the fjord, and the influx of specific masses of water.

AB  - The prospects for using fiber-optic sensors as a tool for measuring physical quantities in leak detection systems (LDS) have been analyzed. Traditional methods and means used to measure technically relevant parameters of processing facilities, such as pressure, temperature and vibration have some limitations concerning the possibility of organizing the measurement process in the conditions of electromagnetic interference in an explosive and fire hazardous environment, as well as in case when sensors are at a large distance from measuring equipment. Today, traditional electronic sensors have almost completely exhausted their potential of increase in sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability of measurements. Meanwhile, the rapid development of photon technologies makes it possible to consider the possibility of using fiber-optic sensors and systems based on them for high-precision measurements in difficult conditions and at large distances from digitizing tools. Application of fiber-optic sensors in the composition of LDSs has great prospects in terms of improving the quantitative and qualitative indicators of measurement

AB  - The article examines some of the indicators of Mtkvari River in terms of environmental chemistry. The study covers full 2016-2017 and the first half of 2018 in Georgia and Turkey. In particular, the data were collected from sampling points in Tbilisi and Karsi. In the context of Georgia, for us, the existing situation in Tbilisi was far more interesting, as contamination by additional anthropogenic factors is getting increased here. In addition to this, the fish caught in Mtkvari in Tbilisi is used as food and for sale by the local population. Respectively, the river condition affects the health of the population. Mktvari is a common river to two neighbor countries (it flows in the third country as well, however, we limited ourselves to Turkey and Georgia only), therefore its environmental study is deemed to be crucial. Chemical parameters were defined on site. Other parameters were determined in the lab. Transportation of samples was conducted through the International Standard Organization (ISO) methodology. The obtained results showed moderate contamination.

AB  - Recent trends in the trophic conditions of the north-western Adriatic Sea have been evaluated using organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), pollen and spores. Palynological analyses performed on a sediment core covering the period AD 1830-1990 have revealed a progressive increase in eutrophication beginning in the 20th century. The first signal of a change seems to occur earlier in the terrestrial ecosystem and later in the marine realm. Pollen data indicate that the source of enhanced nutrient loading to the North Adriatic Sea, which partly resulted from increased wetland reclamation and forest clearance, began at about AD 1910. The clear shift in the relative abundance of the dinocyst Lingulodinium machaerophorum at AD 1930 suggests an increase in eutrophication. Dinocyst assemblages point to stressful conditions from AD 1960, reaching a maximum at about AD 1978. Subsequently eutrophication levels decrease, although dinocyst diversity suggests that the ecosystem has not completely recovered. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dielectric response (DR) measurement is commonly used for condition assessment of insulation systems of power components. A method for measurement of dielectric response using the stimulus of natural transients such as lightning and switching impulses was proposed in earlier work. Its desirable features include the ability to make measurements online over a range of frequencies, without requiring a voltage source. This article presents a laboratory demonstration of the method on a 150 kV service-aged transformer bushing, where the stimulus was a standard lightning impulse voltage superimposed on an AC voltage. Several aspects of the measurement and data processing that affect the results are studied experimentally and numerically. The results are compared with low-voltage frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS). Reasonable accuracy for monitoring changes in DR can be achieved by suitable choice of measurement circuit and data acquisition. The study suggests an approach for online monitoring of dielectric properties of power transformer bushings, and diagnostics of defects that affect the high frequency region of DR, such as moisture content.

AB  - The physical office environment has been shown to be associated with indicators of both health and performance. This study focuses on how memory performance is affected in normal working conditions compared to a quiet baseline (with low amount irrelevant stimuli) in different office types, including cell offices, small open-plan offices, medium-sized open-plan offices and large open-plan offices. The results showed that the drop in performance from the quiet baseline to normal working conditions was higher in larger, compared to smaller, open-plan offices. However, contrary to our hypothesis we found that cell offices might have negative effects on performance comparable to those of large open-plan offices. These results indicate that employees in small open-plan offices, in comparison to large, have better possibilities to conduct cognitively demanding tasks and that cell offices might not be as advantageous as previously thought.

AB  - Inflammatory eye diseases are an important manifestation of many pediatric rheumatologic conditions. Early screening and diagnosis are imperative as these illnesses can not only result in significant visual morbidity but are also an indicator of systemic inflammation. Time to presentation of ocular inflammation varies significantly and can range from many years prior to the onset of systemic symptoms to well after the diagnosis of the rheumatologic disorder. Due to this variability in presentation, careful monitoring by an ophthalmologist is vital to preventing ocular complications and preserving vision. Both local and systemic immunosuppressive medications have been effective in the management of ocular disease. In this review, we will focus on the known ophthalmologic manifestations of common pediatric rheumatologic diseases and discuss recent advances in therapeutic considerations for these conditions.

AB  - The distribution of different ecological groups of lichens (acidophytes, 'nitrophytes', indifferent species) was compared on 1-24 year-old twigs of Abies sibirica sampled in the 'pristine' West Sayan and the polluted East Sayan Mountains (Krasnoyarsk District, South Siberia, Russia) to test their value as indicators of current pollution effects. Bark pH of twigs and bark chemistry (N, S, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe) were measured, and a preliminary estimate of emissions in the Krasnoyarsk District from livestock animal populations was calculated. In both regions, an unusually high twig bark pH and an abnormal species composition for A. sibirica canopy were found (e.g. Physcia aipolia, P. dubia, P. tenella, Phaeophyscia sp., Melanelia exasperatula and Candelariella vitellina), with P. tenella (East Sayan) and M. exasperatula (West Sayan) as dominants. The results confirm that the distribution of lichen species on Abies sibirica twigs is a valuable indicator of current changes in atmospheric conditions.

AB  - In this work, a new Classifier System is proposed (CS). The system, a Reactive with Tags Classifier System (RTCS), is able to take into account environmental situations in intermediate decisions. CSs are special production systems, where conditions and actions are codified in order to learn new rules by means of Genetic Algorithms (GA). The RTCS has been designed to generate sequences of actions like the traditional classifier systems, but RTCS also has the capability of chaining rules among different time instants and reacting to new environmental situations, considering the last environmental situation to take a decision. In addition to the capability to react and generate sequences of actions, the design of a new rule codification allows the evolution of groups of specialized rules. This new codification is based on the inclusion of several bits, named tags, in conditions and actions, which evolve by means of GA. RTCS has been tested in robotic navigation. Results show the suitability of this approximation to the navigation problem and the coherence of tag values in rules classification.

AB  - The extent and nature of farm household pluriactivity varies across the different regions of Scotland.  This study examines the way in which farm business characteristics and regional socio-economic conditions influence the uptake of non-farming activities by farm households.  The proportion of farms with on-farm enterprises in a region is found to be related more strongly to regional opportunities in non-agricultural markets than to low average farm income or small business size.  In contrast, differences in the extent of off-farm work are found to be higher in regions characterised by low agricultural incomes and where off-farm work opportunities would be expected to be low (according to commonly used indicators of labour-market conditions).  This was particularly the case in the least urbanised regions.  It is concluded that, whilst economic factors are important in determining the take-up of pluriactivity at the local level, social and cultural determinants are important at a regional scale.  Implications for policy targeting are discussed.

AB  - Incomplete panicle exsertion is one of the symptoms of cold injury at the reproductive stage of the rice plant (Oryza sativa L.), which damages grain yield and raises disease incidence. For this reason, panicle exsertion is a better indicator of cold tolerance under field conditions than spikelet sterility, which may also be affected by other climatic factors. This work studies the variability of degree of panicle exsertion in rice, under the Southern Brazilian environmental conditions and determines the inheritance and heritability of this trait. Four rice genotypes of different cool temperature reactions at the reproductive stage were crossed and field evaluated, with the F-2 generation, in relation to the degree of panicle exsertion and spikelet fertility. There was variability among the genotypes for panicle exsertion. The F-2 generation of the crosses presented continuous distribution and transgressive segregation towards incomplete exsertion, indicating that genes controlling this trait may be complementary distributed between the parents. Heritability was moderate, so selection for complete panicle exsertion should be applied in advanced generations.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates of the Okefenokee Swamp have been largely overlooked despite their ecological importance and value as water quality indicators. In a two-year study we analyzed taxon richness and abundances of individual macroinvertebrate taxa in the Okefenokee Swamp to assess temporal variation among seasons and spatial variation among five plant community habitats (marsh prairies, cypress forest, scrub-shrub thickets, deepwater lakes, and boat trails) and across six areas of the Okefenokee. Chironomid and ceratopogonid midges and water mites numerically dominated the macroinvertebrate community, and chironomids, dytiscid beetles, and libellulid dragonflies had the greatest generic richness. Multivariate analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure did not show clear patterns among seasons, habitats, or areas. Furthermore, few individual taxa had either spatial or temporal variation in abundance. Wetland macroinvertebrate communities were relatively homogenous across the Okefenokee Swamp possibly because conditions important to these organisms did not vary dramatically among habitats or seasons. Alternatively, most resident taxa might be ecological generalists able to exploit a broad range of conditions.

AB  - Empirical evidence has shown that industrialization and changes in agricultural practices have caused worldwide dramatic changes in the burial conditions of the archaeological remains. The current understanding of the problem, however, is not sufficiently advanced, which hinders adequate measures to prevent a tremendous loss of archaeological information. In the beginning of the nineties, research programmes were started to gain insight into the deterioration of different kinds of organic and inorganic components, representing a great variety of archaeomaterials. Knowledge of the present-day preservation condition of the remains will create the scientific basis for an environmental risk assessment of archaeological sites. It also will be the basis for developing strategies fcr the monitoring of a well-defined number of endangered sites. Such a monitoring system particularly is needed at places where geotechnical measures, like the local up-levelling of the soil and the creation of an artificially high ground water table, have been carried out to protect the archaeological heritage.

AB  - In Baldeggersee, the distributions of solid phase Fe, Mn, V, Cr, As and Mo were determined in different sediment strata, deposited under various deep-water oxygen conditions. Iron concentrations are correlated with water depth when an anoxic sediment is in contact with an oxic water column. Benthic redox gradients trigger iron transport towards the deepest site (geochemical focusing) and loss of iron from the shallower parts through the outflow. Fe cycling in the lake is inhibited by oxygen penetration into the sediment. Vanadium and arsenic can be used as tracers for the internal Fe cycle. Their distribution patterns are highly correlated with iron. In case of a stable oxycline in the deep water, Mo is enriched in the sediment and correlates with Mn. The horizontal distribution patterns of Fe, V, As and the correlation of Fe and Mn with trace metals are promising proxy indicators for the reconstruction of deep-water oxygen conditions during deposition.

AB  - Data on births, on deaths by cause and on morbidity are essential in planning appropriate health interventions, but the scarcity of these data in South Africa is striking. Some of the limitations of national mortality and morbidity data collection systems are reviewed. In order to improve the usefulness of vital statistical information, it is proposed that active disease monitoring be introduced in a number of surveillance sites where the population has been properly enumerated. A network of these sites would routinely gather information on births and deaths by cause and on a List of conditions that are: (i) easy to identify clinically; (ii) would bring most people to the attention of health personnel; and (iii) would indicate failure of health service provision, environmental control or resource allocation. The measurement of the geographical variation of a number of conditions, coupled with geographical information on health care indicators and risk and health promotive factors in each site, would facilitate the planning of interventions in a rational manner.

AB  - Diffuse pollution from oil spills is a widespread problem in port areas (as a result of fuel supply, navigation and loading! unloading activities). This article presents a method to assess the environmental risk of oil handling facilities in port areas. The method is based on (i) identification of environmental hazards, (ii) characterization of meteorological and oceanographic conditions, (iii) characterization of environmental risk scenarios, and (iv) assessment of environmental risk. The procedure has been tested by application to the Tarragona harbor. The results show that the method is capable of representing (i) specific local pollution cases (i.e., discriminating between products and quantities released by a discharge source), (ii) oceanographic and meteorological conditions (selecting a representative subset data), and (iii) potentially affected areas in probabilistic terms. Accordingly, it can inform the design of monitoring plans to study and control the environmental impact of these facilities, as well as the design of contingency plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We studied phytoplankton community and succession in Lake Dishui, the largest man-made coastal lake in China. The lake experienced drastic changes in physicochemical conditions since its creation in 2003. Monthly phytoplankton communities were characterized between 2006 and 2011. A two-dimensional solution of nonmetric multidimensional scaling clearly delineated four groups of distinct phytoplankton community structure. Indicator species analysis showed that Group I (2006-2008) was characterized by mainly nanoplankton including Chromulina pygmaea. Group II (2009) was characterized by nonmotile, unicellular, elongated, or filamentous taxa, which are resistant to grazing pressure due to their large size. Group III (winter-early spring since 2010) was characterized by many motile taxa. The most characteristic taxa in Group IV (summer-autumn since 2010) were the flagellate algae. Seasonal variation in phytoplankton community was highest after 2010. Changes in phytoplankton communities may closely reflect rapid changes in lake environmental conditions such as desalination and nutrient enrichment.

AB  - This article outlines a new method for comparing proxy data for the health and well-being of Late Roman populations through the statistical analysis of skeletal remains and material culture. A multistage statistical approach is applied to a sample of published Late Romano-British cemeteries. A battery of health indicators are compared using multidimensional scaling, and patterns in the provision of grave inclusions are analyzed using the Gini coefficient of inequality. The results of these analyses yield two principal findings. First, patterns are often strongly conditioned by settlement type, with individuals in cemeteries from urban locations exhibiting better health than their nonurban counterparts, contrary to historical models stressing the disadvantages of urban environments. Second, urban cemeteries feature both higher levels of grave furnishings and greater equality in their intracemetery distributions than nonurban cemeteries. Such findings suggest entrenched differences in the quality of living conditions and social relations between urban and rural communities in Late Roman Britain, potentially mirroring the observed modern relationship between high levels of social inequality and poor health.*

AB  - 1. The geographical distribution of planktonic rotifer species was investigated in 31 lakes in the North Island of New Zealand.
   2. A total of 78 species was recorded. Species richness, previously thought to be low in New Zealand, was found to be comparable with that of northern temperate lakes with an average of 21.1 species found per lake. The large, deep oligotrophic Lake Taupo had the lowest richness and the artificial reservoirs the highest.
   3. The distribution of species, investigated using multivariate techniques [Cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)], was most strongly associated with trophic state gradients. For example, Conochilus unicornis, C. dossuarius and Ascomorpha ovalis were associated with more oligotrophic conditions, and Brachionus budapestinensis, B. calyciflorus and Keratella tropica with more eutrophic conditions. Inorganic turbidity was also of importance in determining rotifer distributions in some shallower lakes.
   4. Some species, for example K. australis and C. exigus, appear to be limited in distribution by poor dispersal abilities.

AB  - At present, the existing predictive models of overall thermal sensation cannot accurately evaluate occupants' feelings under vehicle cabin conditions. In this work, aiming at the overall thermal sensation evaluation of vehicle occupants in winter heating condition, the interrelations between the occupants' local thermal sensations and the overall thermal sensation are analyzed using the experimental results of physical tests. It reveals that the overall thermal sensation is significantly affected by the local thermal sensation at extremities, which are called the extreme local thermal sensations. The overall thermal sensation evaluation model is established using the Support Vector Machine method, which is based on the maldistribution of the local thermal sensations, the extreme local thermal sensation, and the mean value of the local thermal sensations. The prediction accuracy of the training set and the verification set are 80% and 71.11% evidence the application potential of the Support Vector Machine evaluation model.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the fruitfulness of cow artificial insemination of milking herd at various levels of productivity was carried out in the conditions of Bayserke-Agro LLP. A study of reproduction performance of the milking herd was conducted based on the results of work performed from January 2018 to March 2019. The comparative data include cows artificially inseminated both according to the natural estrous cycle and according to the hormonal stimulation scheme of the estrus according to the Ovsynch program. It was established that the variability of the insemination index is directly dependent on the level of cow productivity, while the variability of this indicator in terms of lactation numbers has not been established. The service period and the insemination index in high productive groups significantly exceed the optimal indicators, and in groups with milk yields of 6-9 thousand kg, relatively high reproductive qualities are observed, corresponding to zootechnic norms.

AB  - This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based approach to identifying environmental indicators of oyster norovirus outbreaks in coastal waters. It was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks are generally linked to the extreme combination of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low water temperature, low solar radiation, low gage height, low salinity, strong wind, and heavy precipitation. Among the six environmental indicators, the most important three indicators, including water temperature, solar radiation and gage height, are capable of explaining 77.7% of model-predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks while the extremely low temperature alone may explain 37.2% of oyster norovirus outbreaks. It is, therefore, recommended that water temperature in oyster harvesting areas be monitored in the cold season and particularly the extremely low temperature during a low gage height be used as the primary indicator of oyster norovirus outbreaks. The findings are of profound significance to reducing the public health risk of norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nutrients are indicators of a serious water pollution problem in lakes. Excessive concentration of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, can lead to eutrophication, a condition that includes anoxia, noxious algal blooms, and fish kills. A single national nutrient criterion for lakes is inappropriate in China because of its diverse climate and geographic conditions. The nutrient criteria must be instead developed at the regional or individual water body level. In the current paper, we utilized the structural equation model (SEM) to identify the relationships among the water quality variables. We then integrated the results from literatures to set a nutrient criterion for regional lakes. This approach was applied in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau ecological region using total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll a (Chi- a), and Secchi depth (SD) as the criterion variables. TP was the most predictive variable obtained from the SEM, and the optimal criterion levels were TN = 0.31 mg/L, TP = 0.014 mg/L, Chl-a = 2.0 mg/m(3), and SD = 2.1 m.

AB  - The late Pleistocene site of Oerel which represents the Eemian and the Weichselian interstadials Brorup, Odderade, Oerel and Glinde as well as parts of the stadials Herning and Rederstall was investigated for botanical remains such as fruits, seeds, wood, leaves and mosses, as well as insect remains. A large number of taxa were identified. They show the different environmental conditions, in particular several changes of water level leading to the formation of lakes and diverse forms of mires up to raised bogs. The trophic conditions, too, changed several times. The macrofossil record supports the pollen evidence of dense forests during the two early Weichselian interstadials and tundra vegetation during the later ones. Several indicator species show comparably warm summers but very cold winters during the Brorup and Odderade while the climate during Oerel and Glinde was generally cool. Climatic reconstructions using the MCR method were performed on the basis of the beetle finds.

AB  - Unpublished data from our laboratory suggest that the respiratory tract may be a viable portal of entry for Salmonella infection. Further, field reports have indicated that tracheal sampling can be a sensitive tool for monitoring for Salmonella incidence in commercial flocks. In the present study we conducted a series of field trials in North and South America to evaluate the association between cecal and tracheal recovery of Salmonella in chickens and turkeys from commercial flocks. Environmental humidity and temperature were measured to evaluate their effects on frequency of isolation from the organs. Salmonella was recovered from tracheal samples in all trials. In 3 of the 4 trials in which both trachea and ceca were sampled, the incidence of Salmonella recovery was higher in tracheal samples. Though Salmonella was not recovered from ceca in trial 2, 5% of liver and spleen samples indicated infection. Environmental conditions were not associated with incidence of Salmonella recovery. These data suggest that tracheal contamination can be a good indicator of Salmonella infection under commercial poultry conditions.

AB  - "Solubilization (SCOD/TCOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), %)" is generally used as an indicator for the pretreatment effectiveness in anaerobic digestion (AD) of excess sludge. In the present work, ultrasonic (irradiation 5-60 mm) and alkaline pretreatments (pH 9-13) were applied to excess sludge individually and in combination. Biological methane potential tests were carried out using the whole part of pre-treated sludge and only the soluble fraction. Although solubilization increased with pretreatment intensity increase, methane production was inconsistent with increased solubilization, due to the lower methane yield of soluble fraction. While the soluble fraction obtained under mild pretreatment condition (pH 9 + ultrasonication 5 min) showed 91% of methane yield, it was only 61% in case of severe pretreatment condition (pH 13 + ultrasonication 60 mm). 25.8% of the pretreated sludge at (pH 13 + ultrasonication 60 min) consisted of soluble but non-biodegradable portion. These findings demonstrate that increased solubilization does not always result in enhanced AD efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grus weathering profiles are common signs of bedrock alteration in northern middle and high latitudes and have frequently been used to infer climatic regimes of the past and to develop denudation chronologies. This paper shows that the actual palaeoenvironmental significance of grus weathering is limited, and its potential in such reconstructions is clearly conditioned by local situations. Textural and mineralogical features of grus weathering profiles are rather unreliable indicators of past environments, being influenced by a variety of factors, including parent rock characteristics, topography and geological and geomorphological history. Grus weathering has been operating for at least the last few million years and the known profiles are of different ages, so it is doubtful if there is any narrow range of climatic conditions to which the origin of grus may be ascribed. By contrast, the relatively neglected relationships between grus weathering and topography at different scales of inquiry may be worthy of exploration, because it may help to decipher evolutionary pathways of weathering profiles.

KW  - DIGITAL DIVIDE
AB  - The digitalization processes of modern society are carried out at lightning speed, affecting all spheres of life. There is a change in the social structure of society; the problem of the digital divide is becoming more acute. Under these conditions, social groups and individuals are forced to adapt to the new social reality in a fairly limited time. The article aims to provide an analytical review of the current main directions and concepts of older people's social adaptation in the context of digitalization of modern society, and to determine the role of ICT in solving the problems of older people's social adaptation and integration. The article presents: (1) an analytical review of sociological concepts of social adaptation, the impact of social changes on adaptive behavior, models of social adaptation, types of social inequality, including the digital divide, and ways to overcome it; (2) secondary analysis of the results of sociological studies of older people's social adaptation and adaptation resources in the context of digitalization of Russian society; (3) promising directions for future research. The problem of the research is that, in the conditions of digitalization of modern Russian society, a situation has developed when only a small part of the elderly are able to successfully adapt to the new social reality, which leads to the social exclusion of this social group. That is why the problem field of the research was formed within the framework of the analysis of older people's social adaptation in the conditions of modern society's digitalization and the digital divide, and the analysis of the role of ICT in solving the problems of older people's social adaptation and integration. The authors conclude that modern Russian society is experiencing digital inequality caused by both objective (formed by the social environment: the accessibility of ICT tools) and subjective (depending on the individual: motivation to use and master ICT, digital competence) parameters. Digital inequality is a factor in the transformation of older people's social behavior. The authors emphasize that older people's integration into modern society and social adaptation to it are possible through the use of such an adaptation resource as ICT. The knowledge and intensity of use of ICT by the elderly are indicators of older people's social adaptability in the information society.

AB  - Macroeconomics is a very complex and huge system. With the improvement of China's market economy, it is of great theoretical significance and practical value to apply quantitative economics methods and models to study the macroeconomic state and forecast the economic development trend. The development of regional economy is restricted by natural conditions and social and humanistic conditions, and it is a complex system with many factors and levels. By using grey system theory, data processing can reduce its randomness and strengthen the inherent trend of data, so it is possible to use as few data as possible to establish a model describing economic system. Through empirical test, the author analyses the main factors of unbalanced regional economic development and puts forward the comparative advantages of regional development. According to the simulation results, the predicted results are stable and reliable. The conclusion of the study has a certain reference value for the formulation of macroeconomic policies. By strengthening the guidance of government classification, the regional economic disparity will be narrowed continuously.

AB  - Bioorthogonal reactions, especially the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, have revolutionized our ability to label and manipulate biomolecules under living conditions. The cytotoxicity of Cu(I) ions, however, has hindered the application of this reaction in the internal space of living cells. By systematically surveying a panel of Cu(I)-stabilizing ligands in promoting protein labelling within the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, we identify a highly efficient and biocompatible catalyst for intracellular modification of proteins by azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This reaction permits us to conjugate an environment-sensitive fluorophore site specifically onto HdeA, an acid-stress chaperone that adopts pH-dependent conformational changes, in both the periplasm and cytoplasm of E. coli. The resulting protein-fluorophore hybrid pH indicators enable compartment-specific pH measurement to determine the pH gradient across the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. This construct also allows the measurement of E. coli transmembrane potential, and the determination of the proton motive force across its inner membrane under normal and acid-stress conditions.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) emission is a direct indicator of the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, which is a key parameter of the carbon cycle. This paper analyses chlorophyll fluorescence evolution at leaf level during a complete diurnal cycle in simulated and natural conditions, for two species under different stress conditions. Absolute spectral radiance of the ChF emission is obtained allowing a quantitative derivation of the fluorescence yield of the ChF, which correlates well with established fluorescence instruments. The studied cases show that the ChF emission is mainly driven by the photosynthetic active radiation during the whole cycle, but the fluorescence yield is severely reduced during the central hours of the day when the plant is under stress due to light and heat. Results show that the Fraunhofer Line Discriminator method is an accurate way of retrieving quantitative values of ChF from remote sensing sensors at 760 nm and suggest that the mid-morning period is the best time of the day to maximize signal levels while identifying vegetation stress state.

AB  - The main objective of this research was to investigate ergonomics, occupational health and safety problems of an oil industry in a developing country. Fifty-six industrial unit managers participated in the study. Forty-eight percent of the managers received worker complaints of back pain, 36% of fatigue, 32% of upper-body pain, 48% of stress and 46% of dissatisfaction. Fifty-seven percent of the managers reported a hot environment, 36% a noisy environment, and 41% a lack of resources and facilities. Sixty-two percent had no knowledge or access to ergonomics information, while 64% of the managers did not carry out an ergonomic assessment of their units. A significant correlation (p < 0.01) was found among ergonomics and safety indicators and average injury rates. Lack of skills in ergonomics, communication and resources are believed to be some of the major factors contributing to the poor ergonomic conditions and consequent increase in health and safety problems in this industry.

AB  - The reconstruction of regional long-term patterns recorded in marine sedimentary successions of the Eastern Paratethys is important in understanding the role of Cenozoic climate change and orogenic activity on the depositional environment and sedimentation dynamics in Western Asia. In this study, the environmental conditions in the early to middle Miocene (Islam Dag section) in eastern Azerbaijan are elucidated using petrographic-mineralogical relations, detrital indicators, weathering indices and delta C-13 and delta O-18 signatures of organic-rich (total organic carbon: ca 3 to 6 wt. %) argillites. Sedimentary facies and chemical proxies (Na/K, K/Al, Si/Al, Ti/Al ratios, chemical index of alteration values) indicate arid conditions, reduced weathering rates in the hinterland and sediment deposition in an euhaline and poorly oxygenated deep-water basin during the early Miocene, followed by a shift to humid conditions, higher weathering rates and an oxygenated water column in the mid-early Miocene. Long-term aridification and deposition of gypsiferous and calcareous argillites under generally more oxygenated, euhaline to polyhaline conditions in a lacustrine or restricted shelf setting until the middle Miocene is evidenced by gradual changes in element ratios and the chemical index of alteration. Discriminant function analysis suggests the Russian Platform, drained by the Palaeo-Volga and Palaeo-Don river systems, to be the source area for the siliciclastic input throughout the Miocene, although a minor contribution of volcanogenic detritus and mafic components from the Greater Caucasus is possible. The C-S-Fe associations and increasing Fe/Al ratios towards the middle Miocene support the concept of continuous influx of detrital Fe and total organic carbon. The formation of ferruginous smectite from alteration of volcanic ash layers could have affected the preservation of total organic carbon and therefore the sedimentary C and Fe budget in the Eastern Paratethys basins. Palaeo-climatic reconstructions based on delta C-13 (-34 center dot 5 to +1 center dot 7 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and delta O-18 (-34 center dot 7 to -4 center dot 8 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) records of authigenic carbonates should be made with great caution, as the pristine marine signatures may be affected by the oxidation of organic matter and meteoric diagenesis.

TI  - Study on Engineering Application and Degradation Efficiency of Nanoscaled TiO2 Used as Photocatalytic Fog Sealing
T2  - ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - There exists a great difference of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency between nanoscaled TiO2 modified-emulsified asphalt applied as the fog sealing under the indoor and outdoor environment. Much efforts have been made by many investigators to study this issue. However, most of them focus on the ideal condition, ignoring the degradation efficiency examination of TiO2 in the actual engineering practice. A series of field tests are carried out, accompanied with laboratory experiments, to analyze and consequently compare the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of nanoscaled TiO2 in the indoor and outdoor conditions, respectively. Regression analysis was employed to investigate the influence factors of degradation efficiency, by which formula of function of factors influencing degradation efficiency and degradation efficiency deviation equation are obtained. The results show that when the degradation efficiency of NO2 in the laboratory test is as high as 63%, the degradation efficiency affected by the environmental factors is only 25% in the actual engineering practice. Based on the measurement data, detection indicators and criteria can be provided, which is of great significance in the establishment of the construction quality control system.

AB  - Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS), versus attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFT), was firstly applied in quick assessment of rice quality in response to rising CO2/temperature instead of conventional time-consuming chemical methods. The influences of elevated CO2 and higher temperature were identified using FTIR-PAS spectra by principal component analysis (PCA). Variations in the rice functional groups are crucial indicators for rice identification, and the ratio of the intensities of two selected spectral bands was used for correlation analysis with starch, protein, and lipid content, and the ratios all showed a positive linear correlation (R-2 = 0.9103, R-2 = 0.9580, and R-2 = 0.9246, respectively). Subsequently, changes in nutritional components under future environmental conditions that encompass higher CO2 and temperature were evaluated, which demonstrated the potential of FTIR-PAS to detect the responses of rice to climate change, providing a valuable technique for agricultural production and food security.

AB  - Stubble height, streambank alteration, and woody species use are indicators used to monitor livestock impacts on riparian areas in the western United States. Effects of wild ungulates on riparian conditions are often not monitored and assumed to be represented by indicators developed for livestock. We tested this assumption by evaluating effects of elk (Cervus canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on grazing indicators along Meadow Creek, a salmonid-bearing stream in northeastern Oregon. Wild ungulates reduced stubble height by 20% to 30%. Mean streambank alteration was 1.1% (ranged from 0.3-8%). Woody species use was negatively related to stubble height and positively related to streambank alteration (P < 0.05). Despite maintenance of stubble height and streambank alteration within regulatory guidelines, wild ungulate use of preferred woody species was moderate to high (>50%). Adherence to guidelines developed for livestock may not result in desired riparian conditions where wild ungulate populations are high. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The effect of cloudiness on the occurrence of atmospheric new-particle formation events at two measurement stations, SMEAR II in Hyytiala, Finland and San Pietro Capofiume (SPC) in Italy, was investigated. As an indicator of cloudiness, we use the relative radiation intensity (I/I-max) defined as the ratio of measured global radiation and the modeled clear-sky global radiation. We studied the relationship between the occurrence of new-particle formation (NPF) events and I/I-max. using multi-year data sets. The results showed that, at both sites, the radiation intensity (I) should be at least about 50% of its maximum possible value (I-max.) for a clear NPF event to occur. In SPC, clearly higher relative radiation intensity was typically required for the occurrence of an NPF event than in Hyytiala. Also, the features of anomalous days, i.e either NPF events that occurred in cloudy conditions or non-events that occurred in clear-sky conditions, were explained using the environmental variables sulfur dioxide and condensation sink.

AB  - Neuronal circuits develop, adjust to experience and degenerate in response to injury or disease in the course of weeks and months. Available recording techniques, however, typically sample physiological properties of identified neurons on the time scale of minutes and hours. Thus, in order to obtain a full understanding of a long term physiological process data need to be extrapolated from numerous experimental sessions and animals, often collected blindly and under variable conditions. The generation and ongoing engineering of genetically encoded calcium indicators creates an opportunity to repeatedly record activity from the same individual neurons in vivo over weeks, months and potentially the entire lifetime of a model organism. Chronic calcium imaging with genetically encoded indicators thus may allow to establish functional biographies of identified neuronal cell types in the brain and to reveal the physiological relevance of structural changes as they occur under natural and pathological conditions.

AB  - A pair of series straight long-chain 2- and 1-alkyl naphthalenes (aNs) with alkyl chain carbon number up to 30 was detected in late Cretaceous sedimentary source rocks of the onshore Songliao Basin, NE China. Their sedimentary profile was shown to correlate positively with the relative abundances of several higher plant biomarkers including iP-iHMN and phenanthrene and weakly inversely with the relative abundance of alkylbenzenes. In contrast, the aNs distribution shows no relationship with hydrocarbon maturity indicators. The TOC, delta C-13 profile and other molecular features (e.g., CPI, OEP, Pr/Ph, Ga/C31H) were consistent with transgressive/regressive water cycles of the palaeo-lake of Songliao Basin. Decreasing Pr/Ph values in the upper horizon indicative of increasingly anoxic conditions. The distinctive occurrence and distribution of the long-chain aN compounds on the profile of the SK-1 borehole may imply some unique source inputs under particular lacustrine environmental conditions.

AB  - Ground-living spiders of different habitats in the Cabatieros National Park, central Spain, each under different management conditions, were studied to characterize their community richness and composition. Five different habitats were selected: Mediterranean forest, abandoned pine plantations and three kinds of dehesas or meadows (differing in their understory management). In three sampling periods, during two springs and one in fall (2001-2002), a total of 1,152 pitfall traps were deployed in five different habitats. A total of 3,801 adult spiders, representing 105 species from 24 families were collected, among which 13 are considered endemic for the Iberian Peninsula. Correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis showed that spider richness and assemblages differed considerably among the different habitats. The scrub dehesa had the highest ground-living spider richness. Twenty-three indicator species were identified for the different habitats, of which four are considered endemic for the Iberian Peninsula. Gnaphosidae have a high potential as indicators of habitat quality.

AB  - Metabolisms related to enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) were found to be affected when two activated sludges with different EBPR activities were mixed together. In the present study, two laboratory scale EBPR processes were operated in parallel, one of them with higher and another with lower EBPR activities. The activated sludges from the two reactors were mixed together at different mixing ratios. The supernatant was made the same for all mixing ratios, anaerobic -aerobic batch experiments were performed, and acetate uptake rate and phosphate release rate under anaerobic conditions and phosphate uptake rate under aerobic condition were determined. The metabolic rates measured were expected to be linear to the mixing ratios, as the supernatant was the same for all mixing ratios, whereas the metabolic rates were either promoted or inhibited by mixing of sludges. As an indicator for the sludge mixing effect on the metabolic rates, mixing effect intensity (MEI) was introduced. Chemical substances that are produced by microorganisms in activated sludge are proposed to be one of the possible causes of the sludge mixing effect.

AB  - A systematic approach for fish shelf life modelling and Time Temperature Integrator (TTI) selection in order to plan and apply an effective quality monitoring scheme for the fish chill chain was developed. The temperature behaviour of the natural microflora of the Mediterranean fish boque (Boops boops) was studied and growth of the specific spoilage bacteria Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella putrefaciens was modelled and correlated to organoleptic shelf life. Arrhenius and square root functions a ere used to model temperature dependence of maximum growth rates. Bacterial growth and shelf life models were validated under dynamic storage conditions with independent variable temperature experiments. The response of several TTIs from similar storage experiments was also modelled. The reliability: of the TTI monitoring was cumulatively expressed by the error in the TTI derived effective temperature (T(eff)) for different variable temperature distributions. T(eff) was directly translated to shelf life of the fish. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN. All:rights reserved.

AB  - When fitness of a resource-limited animal depends only on that individual's share of the total resource in a habitat patch and individuals are free to move to the patch where their gains are highest, population density matches resource availability under the simple assumption that individual fitness increases with resource use. Previous theory on habitat matching required the stronger assumption that individual fitness was directly proportional to (rather than monotonically increasing with) resource use. The basic theory suggests conditions under which population density empirically indicates habitat quality. Extensions of this basic theory apply when individuals that are free to move among resource patches interact by interfering with each other's resource extraction or by competing unequally. Analysis of existing models of such "ideal free competition" yields conditions for a single general matching rule in which the logarithm of "crowding" is a linear function of the logarithm of resource abundance. Double logarithmic plots of empirical data on habitat use and habitat quality based on this rule furnish possible graphical indicators of the occurrence and intensity of competition in nature.

In this contribution, the characteristics of the liquid waste discharges at the Technological University of Havana "Jose Antonio Echeverria" are studied, for which the main pollution indicators were monitored and a comparison between the different points is established. Of sampling. Three of the 6 drainage streams of the center's waste were studied, demonstrating that in the current conditions the effluents comply with the discharge regulations, due to the dilution of the pollutant load by the large amount of existing drains. In addition, the residuals studied contain an excess of nitrogen and phosphorus, which must be taken into account when proposing a treatment system. Among the main conclusions that the investigation threw is that the liquid residuals in the current conditions in the analyzed sampling points, are classified as a residual water of diluted concentrations.

AB  - Disturbance of biological rhythms contributes to the onset of bipolar disorders and is an important clinical feature of the condition. To further explore the role of biological rhythms in bipolar disorders, 95 English articles published between 1968 and 2019 were retrieved from the PubMed database and analysed. We herein review the outcomes of studies on biological rhythm disturbance in bipolar disorders, including the epidemiology, aetiology, clinical features (eg, sleep, feeding and eating disorders) and treatment of the condition evaluated by patients' self-report and biological indicators such as melatonin. Our report supports the characterisation of biological rhythm disturbance as a significant clinical feature affecting the onset and development of bipolar disorders and reviews classical and novel treatments, such as chronotherapy, that can be applied in the clinical practice. Our analysis indicates that a more comprehensive study of the pathophysiology, clinical phenomenology and treatment of biological rhythm disturbance is required.

AB  - High-pH alkaline lakes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth and prime targets in the search for life on Mars; however, a robust proxy for such settings does not yet exist. Nitrogen isotope fractionation resulting from NH3 volatilization at high pH has the potential to fill this gap. To validate this idea, we analyzed samples from the Nordlinger Ries, a Miocene impact crater lake that displayed pH values up to 9.8 as inferred from mineralogy and aqueous modeling. Our data show a peak in delta N-15 of +17 parts per thousand in the most alkaline facies, followed by a gradual decline to around +5 parts per thousand, concurrent with the proposed decline in pH, highlighting the utility of nitrogen isotopes as a proxy for high-pH conditions. In combination with independent mineralogical indicators for high alkalinity, nitrogen isotopes can provide much-needed quantitative constraints on ancient atmospheric P-CO2 (partial pressure of CO2) and thus climatic controls on early Earth and Mars.

AB  - In this paper, we present results from measuring physical disorder in Los Angeles neighborhoods. Disorder measures came from structured observations conducted by trained field interviewers. We examine inter-rater reliability of disorder measures in depth. We assess the effects of observation conditions on the reliability of reporting. Finally, we examine the relationships between disorder, other indicators of neighborhood status, and selected individual outcomes.
   Our results indicate that there is considerable variation in the level of agreement among independent observations across items, although overall agreement is moderate to high. Durable indicators of disorder provide the most reliable measures of neighborhood conditions. Circumstances of observation have statistically significant effects on the observers' perceived level of disorder. Physical disorder is significantly related to other indicators of neighborhood status, and to children's reading and behavior development.
   This result suggests a need for further research into the effects of neighborhood disorder on children. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The implementation of fleet management in the train traction activity is a must in the conditions of market operation of the railway sector, since good management of traction units has not alternative. The crucial issue of implementing such sophisticated tools is in real environment, and therefore SWOT analysis of the most important technological indicators has been carried out, in order to determine the most efficient method of its implementation. The defined technological indicators and the respective criteria have been used to evaluate the possible implementation of the total fleet management system in the HZ Vuca vlakova (HZ - Train Traction) company. The pilot project carried out in the activities of the HZ - Train Traction has resulted in great savings at the annual level in fuel consumption, creating also the preconditions for the savings in fleet maintenance and workforce recruitment. Based on the results of the pilot project the methodology for efficient implementation of fleet management was defined. The defined methodolog was tested in real conditions and can be implemented at any company which provides services of train traction or manoeuvring of locomotives.

AB  - The present investigation focused on screening of a new potent strain for laccase production and optimizing the process parameters to achieve the maximum enzymatic decolourization of textile azo dye Congo red. Seven hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial strains were selected as positive in laccase production in solid medium using 2,6 dimethoxyphenol as an enzyme activity indicator. The best enzyme producer Pseudomonas extremorientalis BU118 showed a maximum laccase activity of about 7000 U/L of wheat bran under solid-state conditions. The influence of different concentrations of dye, enzyme, salt and various incubation times on Congo red decolourization was studied using response surface methodology to find the optimum conditions required for maximum decolourization by P. extremorientalis laccase. The enzyme exhibited a remarkable colour removal capability over a wide range of dye and salt concentrations. The above results show the potential use of this bacterial laccase in the biological treatment of the textile effluent.

AB  - This baseline reports daily variations of physico-chemical parameters, nutrients and metals in water of two sites [eutrophic conditions (BB) versus reference (LL)] in Obidos coastal lagoon (Portugal). Dissolved oxygen in BB varied between 40% saturation levels (night) and 190% (daylight). NH4+, PO43- and ratios to Al of Mn, Fe and Pb in suspended particulate matter increased during the period of lower oxygenation, indicating exportation of nutrients and metals from the sediment to water at night. At LL, 02 values oscillated always around 100%. PO43- and Mn/Al ratio at LL were always lower than at BB and no increases were found during the night. The input of PO43- and Mn provided from the sediment at BB during the night could surpass the contribution of freshwater discharges. PCA confirmed the separation of most samples from BB and LL. These results pointed to the importance of assessing chemical conditions over day-night cycles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The general purpose of this study is to make feasible the recovery of waste heat in gas turbines. An integrated power generation system consisting of a gas turbine-powered by supercritical carbon dioxide closed Brayton cycle and organic Rankine cycle working with n-pentane is designed. The actual operating conditions of the combined system are examined thermodynamically to establish the limiting states. Thermodynamic examination is performed for all elements of integrated system. The total net power generation of overall system is found to be 2,789 kW. The energetic and exergetic efficiencies of combined plant are found to be 44.71% and 42.05%, respectively. As a result of thermodynamic analyses, the irreversibility amount of system is also calculated and found to be 13,810 kW. System equipment with the highest exergy destruction is found in the heat exchangers with 56%. The temperature and pressure of turbine inlet conditions have considerable impact on the whole system performance.

AB  - The average is usually applied to describe the traffic delay, and the environmental factors are considered to influence it. However, the distribution and the influencing individual behavior on traffic delay is seldom investigated. An observational study shows that pedestrian and vehicle delay follow exponential and power-law distributions. Since they are left-skewed and fat-tailed, the average delay fails to describe the Level Of Service (LOS) in some traffic conditions. To confirm that traffic delay follows these distributions in other situations, a simulation study is conducted. The results coincide with the empirical ones. A new indicator-the average of the longest 20% delay, is developed. It provides a better estimate of LOS than the average of the whole in describing traffic conditions, especially the congested ones. Moreover, pedestrian assertive behavior is a critical influencing factor on traffic delay. The results indicate that the characteristics of the delay distribution is worthy of note.

AB  - Previous studies with bioindicator organisms have used somatic length distributions, i.e., population structure, to understand the effects of management, environment, or a potential contaminant on populations. We describe a statistical approach to separate somatic length classes of Folsomia candida juveniles as an endpoint for the assessment of changes in population structure. Reproduction-survival bioassays were carried out with five different biochars applied at increasing concentrations. Multi-Gaussian models parameterized juvenile size class cohorts, and the biomass of each size class cohort was estimated. Population structure was modified by both material type as well as concentration. Both biomass and population structure were sensitive to effects not reflected in juvenile number, the classic endpoint. Treatments with more size classes and larger individuals were taken to represent favorable conditions, and less size classes and smaller individuals indicated less favorable conditions. This extension of the standardized test provided additional information about the demography of the population.

AB  - Stable-isotope probing was previously used to identify bacterial anthracene-degraders in untreated soil from a former manufactured gas plant site. However, subsequent pyrosequence analyses of total bacterial communities and quantification of 16S rRNA genes indicated that relative abundances of the predominant anthracene-degrading bacteria (designated Anthracene Group 1) diminished as a result of biological treatment conditions in lab-scale, aerobic bioreactors. This study identified Alphaproteobacterial anthracene-degrading bacteria in bioreactor-treated soil which were dissimilar to those previously identified. The largest group of sequences was from the Alterythrobacter genus while other groups of sequences were associated with bacteria within the order Rhizobiales and the genus Bradyrhizobium. Conditions in the bioreactor enriched for organisms capable of degrading anthracene which were not the same as those identified as dominant degraders in the untreated soil. Further, these data suggest that identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in contaminated but untreated soil may be a poor indicator of the most active degraders during biological treatment.

AB  - The degree to which children grow up in crowded housing is a neglected but potentially important aspect of social inequality. Poor living conditions can serve as a mechanism of social stratification, affecting children's wellbeing and resulting in the intergenerational transmission of social inequality. This paper reports an investigation of housing crowding on children's academic achievement, behavior, and health in the US and Los Angeles, a city with atypically high levels of crowding. We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Child Development Supplement and the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to explore the effect of living in a crowded home on an array of child wellbeing indicators. We find that several dimensions of children's wellbeing suffer when exposed to crowded living conditions, particularly in Los Angeles, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. The negative effects on children raised in crowded homes can persist throughout life, affecting their future socioeconomic status and adult wellbeing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sedimentary evidence from a total of 21 AMS C-14 dates and 192 pollen and charcoal and 181 phytolith samples from three study sites in the archaeologically rich lower Yangtze in China provides an indication of interactions between early agriculturalists and generally highly dynamic environmental conditions. Results suggest that environmental changes influenced agricultural development, and attest the localised environmental impacts of incipient agriculture. Evidence of human activity, in the form of indicators of deforestation and possibly food production, is apparent by ca 7000 BP (early Neolithic or Majiabang). Clearer evidence of human activity dates to ca 4700 BP (late Neolithic or Liangzhu). Extensive, profound and apparently widespread human impacts do not appear until the Eastern Zhou (Iron Age, ca 2800-2200 BP), however, which in the lower Yangtze was a period associated with technological advances in agriculture, increased urbanisation and relatively stable hydro-geomorphological conditions.

AB  - To optimize the efficiency of bioremediation, treatability studies are needed to understand the fate of pollutants and environmental conditions under which microorganism growth is promoted and efficient degradation of these pollutants result. This article presents a recommended procedure which may achieve these goals. Results and treatability comparisons for, candidate compounds including carbon, tetrachloride (CT), methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) are presented and discussed. Culture redox potential (ORP) which is an indicator or free electron activity of a system appeared to have a significant impact on CT biodegradation. Optimum biodegradation of CT by Pseudomonas cepacia was observed between -100 and -200 mv. Under the optimum environmental conditions established during the batch-scale biotransformation study, 98 to 99.9% of CT and 70% of MTBE introduced into the continuous fixed-biofilm reactor were degraded. The biphasic model simulating biodegradation of CT and MTBE provided an excellent correlation in the fixed-biofilm study and was simple to apply as compared with other models.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

AB  - Microarthropod communities provide a valuable indicator of soil conditions, and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) can be harmful to native forest ecosystems. Thus, I attempted to delineate feral pig impact and successional recovery of microarthropod populations in a Hawaiian rain forest ecosystem. I examined succession of soil microarthropod communities in fenced areas after removal of feral pigs in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. During 7 years of forest recovery, microarthropod density in soil increased nearly 2 times, and the amount of biomass rose by 2.5 times. Springtails (Collembola spp.) were dominant among microarthropods, and their populations reflected changing soil conditions during forest recovery. The numbers of species of springtails doubled, endemic springtails increased, and cosmopolitan species decreased during forest restoration. Density of springtails increased by 3.5 times, and the amount of biomass grew by 6 times. Springtails were affected primarily by soil density. Although feral pig activity in native Hawaiian rain forests devastated soil microarthropod communities, fencing and removal of pigs can restore this important group of soil decomposers in 7 years.

AB  - Water environmental capacity (WEC) is an essential indicator for effective environmental management. The designed low water flow condition is a prerequisite to determine WEC and is often based on the stationarity assumption of low water flow series. As the low water flow series has been remarkably disturbed by climate change as well as reservoirs operation and water acquisition, the stationarity assumption might bring risk for WEC planning. As the reservoir operation and water acquisition under climate change can be simulated by a water resources allocation model, the low water flow series outputted from the model are the simulations of the disturbances and often show nonstationary conditions. After estimating the designed low water flow through nonstationary frequency analysis from these low water flow series, the WEC under the nonstationary conditions can be determined. Thus, the impacts of water resources allocation on WEC under climate change can be quantitatively assessed. The mid-lower reaches of the Hanjiang River basin in China were taken as a case study due to the intensive reservoir operation and water acquisition under the climate change. A representative concentration pathway scenario (RCP4.5) was employed to project future climate, and a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was employed to simulate water availability for driving the Interactive River-Aquifer Simulation (IRAS) model for allocating water. Water demand in 2016 and 2030 were selected as baseline and future planning years, respectively. The results show that water resources allocation can increase the amount of WEC due to amplifying the designed low water flow through reservoir operation. Larger regulating capacities of water projects can result in fewer differences of WEC under varied water availability and water demand conditions. The increasing local water demand will decrease WEC, with less regulating capacity of the water projects. Even the total available water resources will increase over the study area under RCP4.5. More water deficit will be found due to the uneven temporal-spatial distribution as well as the increasing water demand in the future, and low water flow will decrease, which further leads to cut down WEC. Therefore, the proposed method for determining the WEC can quantify the risk of the impacts of water supply and climate change on WEC to help water environmental management.

AB  - We studied an improved slope form system using a fuzzy logic method to assess and map soil fertility of a mountain region in northern Vietnam that has strong relief conditions. The lack of good soil mapping techniques in Vietnam has brought about insufficient soil information, which often leads to false recommendations for land use and crop planning. The reviewed literature describes soil-mapping techniques using fuzzy logic method, but all of them are applied for mapping areas that have gentle relief conditions that are unlikely to be applicable to the mountainous soils in our study area. In this paper, we introduce a detailed slope form system that significantly describes the complexity of terrain characteristics of the area to be mapped, and provides more detail about the variability of the soil fertility of the area. Nine basic slopeforms were used to characterize for each of upper-, middle-, and foot slope positions, making the list 27 slopeforms. Together with crest and valley, the total unit number is 29. We investigated soils of the area and classified them into the major soil groups and calculated soil property indices for all of them. We identified four major environmental parameters affecting soil formation and soil quality: geology, elevation, slope inclination and land use. The findings indicated that soil fertility differs at slope positions. Soils located at upper slope positions, where agricultural activity only started recently, are more fertile than those found at middle slope positions. Soils located at foot slope positions, where eroded sediments accumulate, also have high levels of fertility compared to those on the middle slope. The improved slope form system then became an important additional environmental parameter for this soil mapping work. At a same comparable category, i.e. slope position, geology, soil group, elevation, slope gradient, straight slopeforms are an indicator for better soil fertility compared to convex and concave forms. Although the findings could not specify soil fertility variability for all 29 slopeforms, they did emphasize the major differences in soil fertility and soil formation based on three major forms of convex, straight and concave, with other factors taken into account, such as slope inclination, geology and elevation. We expect our results to be used by scientists and local authorities in deriving more effective land use and crop options for land use management strategies for the northern Vietnam's mountain regions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the (Ca + Mg + K)/Al and the Ca/Al ratios in soil solution as chemical criteria for forest condition in critical load calculations for forest ecosystems. The tree species Norway spruce, Sitka spruce and beech were studied in an area with high deposition of sea salt and nitrogen in the south-western part of Jutland, Denmark. Throughfall and soil water were collected monthly and analysed for pH, NO3-N, NH4-N, K, Ca, Mg, DOC and Al-tot. Organic Al was estimated using DOC concentrations. Increment and defoliation were determined annually, and foliar element concentrations were determined every other year. The throughfall deposition was highest in the Sitka spruce stand (maximum of 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and lowest in the beech stand (maximum of 11 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The Sitka spruce stand leached on average 12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)during the period 1988-1997 and leaching increased throughout the period. Only small amounts of N were leached from the Norway spruce stand whereas almost no N was leached from the beech stand. For all tree species, both (Ca+Mg+K)/Al and Ca/Al ratios decreased in soil solution at 90 cm depth between 1989 and 1999, which was mainly caused by a decrease in concentrations of base cations. The toxic inorganic Al species were by far the most abundant Al species at 90 cm depth. At the end of the measurement period, the (Ca+Mg+K)/Al ratio was approximately 1 for all species while the Ca/Al ratio was approximately 0.2. The lack of a trend in the increment rates, a decrease in defoliation as well as sufficient levels of Mg and Ca in foliage suggested an unchanged or even slightly improved health condition, despite the decreasing and very low (Ca+Mg+K)/Al and Ca/Al ratios. The suitability of these soil solution element ratios is questioned as the chemical criteria for soil acidification under field conditions in areas with elevated deposition rates of sea salts, in particular Mg.

AB  - To identify the possible sources and formation mechanism of perylene in sediments, temporal trends of perylene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as the organic matters, were analyzed in sediment cores from Dianchi Lake and Sihailongwan Maar Lake in China. Significantly high concentrations of perylene were observed in both cores and increased gradually with the sediment depth. Source identification suggested that perylene in both cores were of primarily diagenetic origin, other than the anthropogenic inputs. Both terrigenous and aquatic organic matters could be the source of perylene in sediments and diagenetic formation of perylene in sediment is kinetically controlled by the microbial activities under anaerobic conditions. All evidence points to the fact that the formation of perylene in sediment should be an index of the microbial activities and environmental conditions, other than the source of specific organic matters or precursors. In addition, we should be cautious when using any geochemical indicators involving the microbial alternation.

AB  - Nopal mucilage is a complex polysaccharide with great potential in the preparation of films for food packaging. In this work, a smart edible film was developed with pH-indicating capabilities based on nopal mucilage/gellan gum. and red cabbage anthocyanins (70:20 w/w, and 10%, respectively). Physical properties, appearance, and colorimetric functionality were characterized at a pH range 2.5-5.9. Color stability, measured by CIELAB, was tested with different storage conditions and time, and interpreted by differential tristimulus colorimetry. Results showed films with uniform appearance, flexibility, easyhandling, and excellent color response within the pH range studied. The evolution of color difference (Delta E*ab) confirmed that the colorimetric functionality of films was stable at short storage periods (8 days) under natural conditions of sunlight and oxygen exposure, whereas a more extended storage period affected the films. Results showed that the film is an excellent barrier and presents color changes triggered by pH changes.

AB  - This paper provides a comparative entrepreneurial analysis of modern combined-cycle power generation technologies and future-oriented high-efficiency oxy-fuel combustion cycles with zero emissions. Considering the main criteria for sustainable development, we identify the generation technology that provides the lowest cost of electricity supply and the maximum economic efficiency of investments with equally high environmental indicators. Based on a comprehensive literature review and comparison of the technical and economic parameters of modern and forward-looking generation technologies under different economic conditions, the paper develops and presents the path of increasing the technical level of generation technologies, corresponding to the conditions of sustainable development at each moment of time. Furthermore, the paper analyses the technical and economic characteristics of the combined-cycle technology successfully applied in the world's energy systems and advanced oxy-fuel combustion cycles. In addition, the paper proposes a multifactorial economic-mathematical model that allows to evaluate the performance indicators of any of the considered technologies in accordance with the criteria for sustainable development.

AB  - During the 1980s, empirical social sciences and normative theory seemingly converged within ethical debates. This tendency kindled new debates about the limits and possibilities of empirical-normative collaboration. The article asks for adequate ways of collaboration by taking a closer look at the philosophy of science of empirical social sciences as well as normative theory development and its logical groundings. As a result, three possible modes of cooperation are characterized: first, the empirical assessment of conditions that actually necessitate the translation of normatively derived basic principles into practice rules; second, the empirical assessment of conditions for application of a moral norm which are formulated by bridging principles; third, the empirical assessment of social practice which allows (a) to measure whether adopted norms actually are implemented in practice or not and (b) to encounter new moral problems which are in need of ethical guidance. Finally, the article defends a symbiotic position in Weaver's and Trevino's triad of possible approaches to empirical-normative collaboration in ethics.

AB  - Identifying the potential effects of industrially formed wetlands on waterfowl populations is important for assessing the suitability of such wetlands in industrial reclamation strategies. Mallard ducklings were held in situ on two industrially formed wetlands and one reference wetland in northern Alberta, Canada. Duckling mass and skeletal size were measured at regular intervals over 33 d, and blood was collected to investigate the analysis of plasma metabolites (triglyceride and glycerol) as an indicator of physiological condition. In repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate ANOVA, and subsequent multiple-comparisons tests, body mass and skeletal size were significantly lower in ducklings maintained on the industrial wetland after 2, 5, 9, and 13 d of exposure. In this situation, plasma metabolite analysis did not provide additional information on mass-independent condition. We conclude that if the observed differences in growth and size translate into a decreased survival of juvenile waterfowl inhabiting these wetlands, then populations of these birds in the area could be negatively affected. We emphasize the importance of field-based ecological research in toxicological studies of wildlife.

AB  - Maintenance planning of groundwater delivery infrastructure, such as canals, requires labor-intensive field inspection for properly allocating maintenance resources to sections of water infrastructure based on their deterioration conditions. Defective canal sections have cracks where the water delivery performance degrades. In practice, canals can be tens or even hundreds of miles long. Manual canal inspections could take weeks, while could hardly achieve comprehensive water leakage assessment. Another difficulty is that most cracks are developing under the water. Without drying up the canals, inspectors could not observe underwater conditions. They would have to assess visible parts of water facilities and environments (e.g., humidity changes and vegetation growths nearby) for prioritizing canal sections in terms of leaking risks. Even experienced inspectors need much time to complete a reliable canal condition assessment.
   This paper presents a deep-learning approach augmented by canal inspection knowledge to achieve automated and reliable water leak detection of canal sections from Landsat 8 satellite images. Such integration utilizes the domain knowledge of experienced inspectors in augmenting the deep-learning methods for more reliable image pattern classification that supports rapid canal condition assessment. Compared with machine learning algorithms trained by raw satellite images manually labeled as leaking, domain-knowledge-augmented deep learning algorithms use satellite image augmented by pixel-level land surface temperature (LST), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) as training samples. Specifically, LST, FVC, and TVDI for each pixel are physical parameters derived from Landsat 8 satellite images by remote sensing methods. The "leaking" or "no-leaking" labels of the training samples are from the concrete surface inspection records collected during annual dry-ups of the canal from 2016 to 2019. Testing results on data sets collected for canals flowing through both urban and rural areas show that the proposed approach can achieve recall at 86%, precision at 86%, and accuracy at 85%. The precision, recall, and accuracy of the proposed approach are similar to a conventional deep learning algorithm that uses raw images for training while being more computationally efficient. The reason is that the new approach only processes three channels rather than the 11 channels in raw images. The authors also tested how different combinations of environmental features influence the performance of the algorithm. The results showed that two feature combinations: (LST, FVC) and (LST, FVC, TVDI) achieve the most robust performance in diverse geospatial environments.

AB  - Bioprocesses based on (ligno-)cellulosic biomass are highly prone to batch-to-batch variations. Varying raw material compositions and enzyme activities hamper the prediction of process yields, economic feasibility and environmental impacts. Commonly, these performance indicators are averaged over several experiments to select suitable process designs. The variabilities in performance indicators resulting from variable process inputs are often neglected, causing a risk for faulty performance predictions and poor process design choices during scale-up. In this paper, a multi-scale variability analysis framework is presented that quantifies the effects of process input variations on performance indicators. Using the framework, a kinetic model describing simultaneous saccharification and ethanol fermentation was integrated with a flowsheet process model, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment in order to evaluate a wheat straw-based ethanol biorefinery. Hydrolytic activities reported in the literature for the enzyme cocktail Cellic (R) CTec2, ranging from 62 to 266 FPU center dot mL(-1), were used as inputs to the multi-scale model to compare the variability in performance indicators under batch and multi-feed operation for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Bioprocess simulations were stopped at ethanol productivities <= 0.1 g center dot L-1 center dot h(-1). The resulting spreads in process times, hydrolysis yields, and fermentation yields were incorporated into flowsheet, techno-economic and life cycle scales. At median enzymatic activities the payback time was 7%, equal to 0.6 years, shorter under multi-feed conditions. All other performance indicators showed insignificant differences. However, batch operation is simpler to control and well-established in industry. Thus, an analysis at median conditions might favor batch conditions despite the disadvantage in payback time. Contrary to median conditions, analyzing the input variability favored multi-feed operation due to a lower variability in all performance indicators. Variabilities in performance indicators were at least 50% lower under multi-feed operation. Counteracting the variability in enzymatic activities by adjusting the amount of added enzyme instead resulted in higher uncertainties in environmental impacts. The results show that the robustness of performance indicators against input variations must be considered during process development. Based on the multi-scale variability analysis process designs can be selected which deliver more precise performance indicators at multiple system levels.

AB  - The placebo effect is powerful and has been proved effective in multiple studies, competing even with well-established treatments. It is absolutely not an unspecific or inert effect. It has a ubiquitous nature and accounts for all types of treatments, although psychology is the area that makes it comprehensible. Discussing and discovering what makes it so effective is a useful and illustrative task regarding how treatments work. In this sense, it must be emphasized that in order for the placebo effect to operate, it must be considered from a contextual view, it does not require deception, and it does require a person with problems, in homeostatic imbalance. The study of the conditions in which the placebo effect occurs has been useful in delineating which aspects are important in treatments. These are as follows: the provision of information and its meaning, the patients previous experiences and beliefs, the application of the treatment under favorable conditions, and the use of well-recognized and accepted treatments in their foundations and procedure.

AB  - Measurement techniques that allow the global analysis of cellular responses while retaining single-cell sensitivity are increasingly needed in order to understand complex and dynamic biological processes. In this context, compromises between sensitivity, degree of multiplexing, throughput, and invasiveness are often unavoidable. We present here a noninvasive optical approach that can retrieve quantitative biomarkers of both morphological and molecular phenotypes of individual cells, based on a combination of quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy measurements. We then develop generalized statistical tools to assess the influence of both controlled (cell sub-populations, immune stimulation) and uncontrolled (culturing conditions, animal variations, etc.) experimental parameters on the label-free biomarkers. These indicators can detect different macrophage cell sub-populations originating from different progenitors as well as their activation state, and how these changes are related to specific differences in morphology and molecular content. The molecular indicators also display further sensitivity that allow identification of other experimental conditions, such as differences between cells originating from different animals, allowing the detection of outlier behaviour from given cell sub-populations.

AB  - Electric vehicles are dependent on onboard battery management systems that protect the battery from functioning outside its safe operating limits by monitoring its state of charge (SOC). Advanced online monitoring techniques are required so that the performance of the energy management is not lowered severely. However, the behavior of batteries is difficult to be predicted online because of its nonlinearity, intrinsic variability and fluctuating environmental conditions. Gaussian Process (GP)-Bayesian filters are based on probabilistic non-parametric Gaussian models of hidden states using available measurements. As a result, model response variability can be explicitly incorporated into the prediction and measurement steps, which is usually not the case for more traditional filtering strategies that resort to parametric models for state estimation. In this work, GP models were incorporated into nonparametric filtering techniques to monitor the battery SOC online. Results show that Bayes' filtering techniques increase the predictability of the SOC under uncertainty about the effect of environmental conditions on the SOC.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop a treatment system for leachate from old municipal landfills by means of electrochemical, ultrasound and electromagnetic methods in laboratory conditions and at a pilot plant. The leachate was taken from two sanitary landfills (Piskornica and Tarno) and subjected to electrochemical treatment by implementing electrodes made of stainless steel, iron and aluminium, and a simultaneous treatment with ultrasound and recirculation through electromagnetic field. The reactions of pollutants from the leachate with the electrochemically generated hypochlorite, chromates and free radicals as well as thermal decomposition in cavitation bubbles are responsible for fast, efficient removal of organic matter and ammonium. The removal efficiency of COD, BOD5 and ammonium is over 99 % after 85-minute treatment. The removal of heavy metals up to 99.93 % is mostly achieved by means of electrocoagulation with iron and aluminium electrodes. All measured indicators in treated water, both in laboratory conditions and at the pilot plant, were significantly lower with respect to their maximum permitted concentrations in waters that can be discharged into a natural receiving body.

AB  - Increasing drug-resistant infections have drawn research interest towards examining environmental bacteria and the discovery that many factors, including elevated metal conditions, contribute to proliferation of antibiotic resistance (AR). This study examined 90 garden soils from Western Australia to evaluate predictions of antibiotic resistance genes from total metal conditions by comparing the concentrations of 12 metals and 13 genes related to tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulphonamide resistance. Relationships existed between metals and genes, but trends varied. All metals, except Se and Co, were related to at least one AR gene in terms of absolute gene numbers, but only Al, Mn and Pb were associated with a higher percentage of soil bacteria exhibiting resistance, which is a possible indicator of population selection. Correlations improved when multiple factors were considered simultaneously in a multiple linear regression model, suggesting the possibility of additive effects occurring. Soil-metal concentrations must be considered when determining risks of AR in the environment and the proliferation of resistance.

AB  - The seasonal changes of pigments and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13 values) were investigated in needles of Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) from two typical sites, one drier and the other wetter, in the Qilian Mountains, China. The anthocyanins and rhodoxanthin content from both sites were much higher in winter than in summer. Plant needles contained more carotenoids and xanthophylls in winter at the wetter site, while no seasonal difference appeared at the drier site. However, lower chlorophyll content and higher proline and delta C-13 were observed at the drier site. Average tree height was shorter at the drier site trees than at the wetter site. Our results suggested that under natural conditions, pigmentation in S. przewalskii may serve to improve the energy balance of the photosynthetic apparatus under cold and drought stresses. Proline and delta C-13 could be used as drought indicators for S. przewalskii.

AB  - Measurement of soil microbial biomass and abundance offers a means of assessing the response of all microbial populations to changes in the soil environment after a fire. We examined the effects of wildfire on microbial biomass C and N, and abundance of bacteria and fungi 2 months after a fire in a pine plantation. Soil organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-tot), and electrical conductivity (EC) increased following the fire. In terms of microbial abundance, the overall results showed that burned forest soils had the most bacteria and fungi. Microbial biomass C and N from soil in the burned forest were not significantly different from their unburned forest counterparts. However, microbial indices indicated that fire affects soil microbial community structure by modifying the environmental conditions. The results also suggested that low-intensity fire promotes microorganism functional activity and improves the chemical characteristics of soils under humid climatic conditions.

AB  - Aims: We present the first survey of plant communities of Istanbul, their classification and syntaxonomy with main environmental drivers that shape them. Study area: Anatolian (Asian) part of Istanbul, Turkey. Methods: We collected 442 vegetation releves according to Braun-Blanquet method. Cluster analysis and ordination of the dataset were performed to assess particular vegetation patterns. Diagnostic species of each cluster were determined using the fidelity measure (phi-coefficient). Site conditions were presented by ecological indicator values. Results: The analysed dataset shows clear division into six classes. They represent typical weed plant community (Digitario sanguinalis-Eragrostietea minoris), annual (Sisymbrietea, Chenopodietea) and perennial ruderal vegetation (Artemisietea vulgaris, Epilobietea angustifolii), and higher successional stadia (Charabdido-Asphodeletea). Conclusions: Our survey of urban vegetation of Istanbul is the first attempt of urban vegetation classification in Turkey. We showed high diversity of vegetation due to various human impacts and Istanbul's location on the crossroads of different phytogeographical regions.

AB  - Despite the enticing discoveries of chaos in nature, triggers and drivers of this phenomenon remain a classical enigma which needs irrefutable empirical evidence. Here we analyze results of the yearlong replicated mesocosm experiment with multi-species plankton community that allowed revealing signs of chaos at different trophic levels in strictly controlled abiotic environment. In mesocosms without external stressors, we observed the "paradox of chaos" when biotic interactions (internal drivers) were acting as generators of internal abiotic triggers of complex plankton dynamics. Chaos was registered as episodes that vanished unpredictably or were substituted by complex behaviour of other candidates when longer time series were considered. Remarkably, episodes of chaos were detected even in the most abiotically stable conditions. We developed the Integral Chaos Indicator to validate the results of the Lyapunov exponent analysis. These findings are essential for modelling and forecasting behaviour of a variety of natural and other global systems.

AB  - The Arctic and Antarctic are both cold deserts but show contrasting geographic and climatic features. Marked differences are notice able in the richness of insect communities at these high latitudes. In the north, a continuous terrestrial gradient links sub-Arctic and Arctic regions, while in the south, the Southern Ocean is an efficient barrier between the sub-Antarctic and the Antarctic. In spite of stressful environmental conditions, insects are present but species richness is poor. Functional diversity is subordinate to these constrained features. However, ecological and physiological adaptations are varied and generally show no taxonomic pattern. On sub-Antarctic islands, the recent increase in human activities has precipitated a dramatic increase in entomological diversity. In the Arctic, the spectacular underrepresentation of the Exopterygota cannot be explained only by biogeographic criteria. An ecophysiological interpretation is suggested and leads to an evolutionary hypothesis of entomoiogical biodiversity in polar regions. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - The scope of this work is the thermal assessment of a stationary engine for power generation, fuelled by biogas at the Experimental Station of Pastures and Forages Indio Hatuey (EEPFIH), in order to reach efficient working conditions within a Cuban environment. The assessment was based on the first and second law of thermodynamics, estimating thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, exergy efficiency and cost. On the other hand, an engine test bench was settled, which was composed by an expansion device for pressure reduction to near atmospheric, a gas analyzer and a counting, likewise electric resistances to establish the engine load. The optimal work condition was obtained for 3.6 kW of engine load with a 12.32% of efficiency, consuming 1.316 m(3)/kWh, favorable with biogas use in an Otto cycle engine, and the substitution of gasoline to biogas generates important economic benefits. The engine tested showed good performance to be implemented coupled to small biodigesters, such as those found at a local scale farms.

AB  - An ecologo-floristic approach and Tsyganov's ecological indicator values have been used to analyze the effect of abiotic factors on the distribution of Anemonastrum biarmiense (Juz.) Holub, a species endemic to the Southern Urals. The results show that this species has a wide range of tolerance to edaphic factors, with its synecological optimum being positioned centrally. Therefore, changes in edaphic conditions have no significant effect on its productivity and vitality. With respect to climatic factors, the realized ecological niche of A. biarmiense is narrow. The synecological optimum is displaced to its boundary and corresponds to mountain tundra communities, where habitat conditions change over relatively small distances. Therefore, the response of A. biarmiense to climate warming will involve in the first place a decrease in the density of cenopopulations with the following reduction of habitats. Thus, the combination of the narrow range of tolerance to climatic factors and the position of synecological optimum at the boundary of realized ecological niche makes A. biarmiense a good indicator of global climate change.

AB  - The influence of economic development on the resorption of inequality levels in India is an open debate. Inequality shapes both the Indian society as a whole and, spatially, the different regions of this subcontinent-wide country. In this article, emphasis is given to the conception and to the spatial analysis of an indicator named "Non-Crowded Housing" (abbr. NCH). The latter uses official census data, is easily computed and focuses on the absence of housing overcrowding. This indicator offers a good alternative to explore the standard of living gap in India in terms of housing usage and unveil specific sub-spaces and trajectories within the 2001-2011 period. Census data are complemented with field studies in order to shed new light on the geography and nature of housing and spatial inequalities linked to rapid urbanization. The case studies reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the NCH index, which is able to provide a comprehensive overview of the human well-being, focusing on housing conditions only, though being scale-dependent and sensitive to urbanization levels.

AB  - Goats are homeothermic animals considered as rustic from the bioclimatic point of view, but the reduction of their productive efficiency may occur in unfavorable thermal conditions. The present study was carried out to evaluate pupil dilation as an indicator of thermal stress in Boer crossbred goats maintained under controlled environmental conditions. Six male crossbred goats of the Boer breed were distributed in a completely randomized design submitted to temperatures of 26, 29 and 33 degrees C. The pupillary dilation and pupillary temperature, respiratory frequency, heart rate, surface and rectal temperatures were monitored. The significant increase in physiological responses occurred in response to the increase in air temperature. An increase of pupillary dilation was observed in the animals with the elevation of the air temperature, with an increase of 26.96 mm(2) in pupillary area when comparing the temperatures 26 and 33 degrees C, and it was possible to establish a correlation between air temperature and pupillary diameter increase, named pupillary stress ratio (PSR).

AB  - Phytoplankton alter their macromolecule composition in response to changing environmental conditions. Often these changes are consistent and can be used as indicators to predict their exposure to a given condition. FTIR-spectroscopy is a powerful tool that provides rapid snapshot of microbial samples. We used FTIR to develop signature macromolecular composition profiles of three cultures: Skeletonema costatwn, Emiliania huxleyi, and Navicula sp., exposed to chemically enhanced water accommodated oil fraction (CEWAF) in artificial seawater and control. Using a multivariate model created with a Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis of the FTIRs-pectra, classification of CEWAF exposed versus control samples was possible. This model was validated using aggregate samples from a mesocosm study. Analysis of spectra and PCA-loadings plot showed changes to carbohydrates and proteins in response to CEWAF. Overall we developed a robust multivariate model that can be used to identify if a phytoplankton sample has been exposed to oil with dispersant.

AB  - A clear need for evidence-based animal management in zoos and aquariums has been expressed by industry leaders. Here, we show how individual animal welfare monitoring can be combined with measurement of environmental conditions to inform science-based animal management decisions. Over the last several years, Disney's Animal Kingdom (R) has been undergoing significant construction and exhibit renovation, warranting institution-wide animal welfare monitoring. Animal care and science staff developed a model that tracked animal keepers' daily assessments of an animal's physical health, behavior, and responses to husbandry activity; these data were matched to different external stimuli and environmental conditions, including sound levels. A case study of a female giant anteater and her environment is presented to illustrate how this process worked. Associated with this case, several sound-reducing barriers were tested for efficacy in mitigating sound. Integrating daily animal welfare assessment with environmental monitoring can lead to a better understanding of animals and their sensory environment and positively impact animal welfare.

AB  - Present paper reports dissolution rate of liquid CO2 with hydrate film into water which is essential for estimation of CO2 sequestration in ocean and marine environmental impact assessment. Effect of hydrate film was fully included in the simulations. Droplet diameter released from pipeline introduced from power-plant is required to be less than 0.8 cm to obtain the complete dissolution for the travel distance less than 1000 m. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that easier released droplet size condition to obtain complete dissolution is acceptable when liquid CO2 is released from a pipe of moving ship. For CO2 isolation at seabeds deeper than 3000 m, an experiment simulating dissolution of liquid CO2 stored at a seabed into an undercurrent flow was conducted. Applying the measured surface concentration and mass transfer coefficient obtained from the actual conditions of deep ocean, the time scale of CO2 dissolution into an undercurrent flow was estimated to be around 240 years for a complete dissolution of the CO2 pool created by a 1 GW power plant in 10 years.

AB  - Composition values of several components (total lipids and their fatty acid composition, caffein, total nitrogen, soluble ash and nitrogen, crude fiber), of fresch leaves of Ilex paraguariensis Saint Hil (clon 44/75, crop 1988) were determined during thering the different stages (<<zapecado>>, <<secado + canchado>> y <<estacionamiento>>) of <<yerba mate, traditional elaboration method. The drastic conditions of <<zapecado>> stage produced some transformations, which involve fatty acids and other components of the fresh leaves.A similar behaviour was observed for other species of Ilex (I. dumosa and I. brevicuspis). Consequently the <<zapecado>> should be considered as the primary stage of formation of the volatile components which will develope later during the storage. The lipid autoxidation reactions should be one of the main factors affecting this last stage. Taking into account the natural presence of poliphenols and their antioxidants properties, temperature and aereation should be considered in order to reach optimized conditions for the <<storage>> stage. Climatic characteristics, mainly rain during leave developing have incidence on the content of certain components (caffein).

AB  - The presented paper analyses the variability of grain size distribution parameters of bedload transported by the gravel-bed Scott River (Svalbard) draining a glacier catchment with an area of 10km(2). The grain size distribution analysis is one of the basic elements of identification of the fluvial transport mechanisms in gravel-bed rivers. It is used for the determination of threshold values for bedload movement. It is also treated as an important indicator of the origin, routes of distribution, and conditions of transport and deposition of fluvial bedload. The field study in a natural proglacial gravel-bed channel was carried out at two reaches in the mouth section of Scott River. The study revealed relatively high temporal variability and similar mean parameters of grain size distribution in conditions of low discharges. Bedload transport rates reached a mean of 71.9-76.0kgd(-1) in channel cross-section. Bedload texture was dominated by gravels with a proportional contribution of the fine-grained fraction along with very fine-grained gravels (8-2mm) of 38.8%. The medium-grained fraction (16-8mm) constituted 33.7%, with a lower contribution from the coarse-grained fraction (32-16mm) of 23.2%, and the very coarse-grained fraction (64-32mm) of 4.4%. Two periods in the course of bedload transport and distribution of grain size distribution parameters were distinguished based on variation of hydro-meteorological conditions. The first half of the measurement period was distinguished by significantly higher values of daily loads and increased contribution of the coarse-grained and very coarse-grained fraction (28-31% and 6.2-6.6%, respectively). During this time, the river discharged up to 94% of bedload. This resulted in a clear tendency for riverbed scouring. The second half was distinguished by generally low daily bedload transport rates (<10kgd(-1)), an increase in contribution of fine- and very fine-grained gravels (42-55.6%), and a change in the tendency to aggradation. Grain size indices were more varied, and grains were usually finer and better sorted. Selective transport processes, often related to redeposition, were dominant in the channel. Along with an increase in flow velocity, conditions for material deposition became more variable. This was manifested in weaker sorting and an increase in grain diameter.

AB  - The Dieselgate has changed the public view of diesel powertrains and local authorities have issued first driving bans on diesel cars in Germany. Nevertheless, a systematic calculation of the external costs of the Dieselgate considering different car models and a variety of emissions has not yet been conducted. We compare the results, which reflect emissions under test bench conditions, with those of diesel cars under the assumption that NOX emissions reflect realistic driving behavior. We find that diesel cars with idealized emissions are superior to petrol cars with regard to external costs and that electric cars have only partially lower external costs than diesel cars. However, when realistic driving behaviors are considered, diesel engines constitute the worst powertrain in all cases. Our results show that the Dieselgate has led to substantially higher external costs than cars which would comply with environmental regulations under realistic driving conditions.

AB  - This study presents the characterization of macroinvertebrates colonizing La Calaboza creek (an important hydric system from Casanare department), to determine the status of water quality and to improve understanding of the native entomofauna, in response to summer and winter conditions. The macroinvertebrates were collected from six sampling stations and identified at the family level. And also, their relationship with various physicochemical variables was established. The environmental status was determined by the application of three biotic indices: BMWP, ASPT, and EPT. Despite the impact of anthropogenic activities, the water quality of the stream was classified as acceptable or good. Regardless of the season, Ephemereptera was the predominant order in most of the selected stations. However, the winter period presented the lowest biotic indexes, associated with a different distribution of individuals and low diversity, as a result of fluctuations in the physicochemical state of the water. It is concluded that the environmental status of the study area is highly influenced by the change of period, presenting greater susceptibility in winter conditions.

AB  - Use of natural ventilation in the barn should lead to optimal microclimatic conditions over the entire space. In the summer, especially during hot weather, higher air velocity cools cows, which helps to avoid heat stress. The paper presents the results of studies on the evolution of air movement in a modernized free-stall barn of the Fermbet type with the natural ventilation system during the summer period. Based on measurements of velocity and direction of air flow (inside and outside the barn) and observations of smoke indicator, the movement of air masses in different parts of the barn was identified. Significant variations of air flow at different levels of the barn were found. These differences deviate from the accepted patterns of natural ventilation, which can be found in the literature. The range of a draught and stagnant air along with the conditions in which they are built was determined. On this basis, recommendations regarding the location of barns on the plots and the improvement of ventilation in summer were made.

AB  - In order to assess the agricultural potential of regions and to evaluate the risk of environmental degradation due to agriculture, we define a marginality index for agricultural land use which is based on available global data sets and takes into account various environmental conditions, Influencing factors taken into consideration are the general climatic conditions for plant growth, the soil fertility, the soil moisture availability, the precipitation uncertainty and the erosion risk due to the steepness of slopes. Comparison of our marginality index with present global assessments of agricultural land use shows that about 30% of agricultural land currently in use can be identified as marginal, in other words as having a disposition towards overuse and potential environmental degradation. The validity of our approach is strengthened by the fact that agriculturally used areas identified as marginal are described as vulnerable in the literature. The risk of degradation with a further intensification of agriculture on existing crop land and the potential for the cultivation of previously unused land can be identified using our fuzzy logic technique.

AB  - The article presents a mathematical model for the analysis of operational reliability of a wastewater treatment plant, in which sedimentation of activated sludge and removal of biogenic compounds were taken into account. The presented model allows for continuous control and monitoring of both processes, even in the case of measurement discontinuities. In the presented approach, the values of quality indicators can be determined using selected data mining methods on the basis of wastewater flow and temperature measurements. The paper proposes an innovative indicator that takes into account the interaction between the quantity, the quality of inflowing wastewater expressed by means of physicochemical parameters and the susceptibility of activated sludge for bulking. Based on the presented calculation algorithm, an exemplary concept of controlling the biological process (mixed liquor suspended solids, oxygen concentration and the amount of coagulant dosed) is presented, taking into account the variable conditions at the inflow to the bioreactor.

AB  - Middle- and upper-class status along with suburban residence are together considered symbolic of the American dream. However, the question of whether they mean access to better quality residential environments has gone largely unexplored. This study relies on data from the 2009 panel of the American Housing Survey and focuses on a range of neighborhood conditions, including indicators of physical and social disorder as well as housing value and a neighborhood rating. Contrary to the tenets of the spatial assimilation model, we find that middle-class and affluent status do not consistently lead to superior conditions for all households. Neighborhood circumstances vary considerably based on householder race and ethnicity, with blacks and Hispanics experiencing the greatest disparities from whites. In addition, suburban residence does not attenuate such differences, and in some cases, well-to-do minorities do even worse than whites in neighborhood quality in suburbs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - EFFECTS OF EXOTIC FISHES ON THE SOMATIC CONDITION OF THE ENDANGERED KILLIFISH FUNDULUS LIMA (TELEOSTEI: FUNDULIDAE) IN OASES OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR, MEXICO
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - We assessed the effects of the abundance and biomass of four exotic fishes (common carp, Cyprinus carpio; guppy, Poecilia reticulata; green swordtail, Xiphophorus hellerii; and redbelly tilapia, Tilapia cf. zillii) on the residual somatic condition (Kr) of endangered Baja California killifish (Fundulus lima) in two oasis systems of Baja California Sur, Mexico. We used multiple regressions to analyze relationships between Kr of the killifish and 21 ecological variables. Biomass of redbelly tilapia and common carp were variables that better explained variation in Kr among populations of killifish. In both drainages, redbelly tilapia was the dominant fish, which relegated smaller habitat units to the other coexisting species of fishes, increasing competition among them and decreasing Kr and abundance of the endemic killifish. We concluded that Kr for populations of killifish may be a good indicator of the competitive interactions with exotic fishes in drainages of Baja California peninsula and should be considered when such stocks are subject to recovery plans or any other management program.

AB  - This paper presents validation results and some management applications of a Tropical Pasture Simulator. The effects of different environmental conditions, N fertilisation regimes and grazing intensities are analysed, and physiological concepts are used to aid in the interpretation of the responses obtained. The model demonstrates the importance of flexible management guidelines depending on environmental conditions, It stresses the need for an increased understanding of the processes controlling the development and senescence of the sward, since these largely influence the responses to nutrients and determine sward structure. Strategies based on morphological indicators such as number of live leaves were derived in order to develop simple and applicable pasture management guidelines at the farm level. Examples are presented with reference to kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) production and utilisation in dairy systems in the highlands of Costa Pica. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - MUCOSAL IRRITATION AND THERMAL COMFORT AMONG OCCUPANTS OF AN OFFICE BUILDING
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - The Madison Building of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., was investigated in 1989 to determine whether occupant-reported symptoms were related to environmental conditions. Questionnaires were distributed to 3176 employees. Respondents reported on mucosal symptoms, thermal comfort, and demographic and health characteristics. In a follow-up survey, temperature and relative humidity were measured in selected locations and shorter questionnaires were administered. Symptoms were grouped into eye, nose, throat, respiratory, and a combined symptom cluster. Indicator variables were created for thermal comfort conditions perceived as cold and hot/stuffy. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test associations between mucosal symptoms and thermal comfort, adjusting for demographic and health characteristics. No associations between symptoms and measured temperature or relative humidity were found. Perceived stuffiness was significantly associated with eye symptoms (odds ratio, OR, = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.6-4.0), nose symptoms (OR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.5-3.4), and throat symptoms (OR = 2.95; 95% CI 1.5-5.9). The results suggest that improving occupant comfort may alleviate symptom reporting.

AB  - This study presents a comparative analysis of subjective well-being in the Italian regions (NUTS2) by synthesizing several ordinal indicators. In recent decades, the use of subjective indicators, i.e. information collected at individual level, has become widespread in official statistics. This article refers, in particular, to those subjective indicators that detect perceptions, points of view and emotional states. The data source is the ad-hoc module on subjective well-being of the European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions, one of the harmonised European official statistical surveys. In synthesizing the information, the study applies the Partially Ordered Set methodology. The purpose is to safeguard the multidimensionality of the phenomenon and the ordinal nature of the items. The study synthesizes the dimension of subjective well-being at micro level, i.e. at individual level, and reports the individual condition of subjective well-being at regional level. In doing so, it explores the informative potential of the ad-hoc module on subjective well-being, which seems not yet fully exploited.

AB  - Due to the adoption of the household as a unit of analysis, researchers have failed to identify accurate measures of women's income poverty. This study proposes an individualized measure of European poverty to highlight gender differences in the economic crisis. Employing data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for the period 2007-12, it compares the household-based at-risk-of-poverty rate (ARPR) and the individualized financial dependency rate (FDR). The study shows that the gender gap in poverty in Europe is considerably higher when computed through FDR. Indeed, since the ARPR constitutes a proxy of the household's average conditions, it levels down gender inequalities within the household and also variations in individuals' incomes over time. Only more detailed data collection on intrahousehold resource sharing will possibly allow the development of more precise and realistic indicators of women's and men's risks of poverty and financial dependency.

AB  - This article assesses how astrocytes respond to numerous endogenous agonists; and a wide variety of chemical stressors, including well-known neurotoxic agents such as lead and methylmercury, and drugs, within the context of dose-response relationships. In general, astrocytes displayed biphasic dose-response relationships from exposure to neurotoxic agents with temporal and quantitative features similar to hormetic dose responses. While the low-dose stimulatory responses have been viewed as a manifestation of a toxic response, this perspective is being broadly reconsidered and in some cases reinterpreted as being an indicator of an adaptive/protective response. These dose-response patterns are likely to have significant implications in a wide range of conditions affecting normal developmental processes, tumor development, adaptive responses to numerous environmental neurotoxins, and strategies for drug development for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Distinguishing between components (stomatal conductivity, mesophyll conductivity, carbon dioxide fixation in chloroplasts, and respiration) of the complex biochemical mechanism of plant photosynthesis is a challenging problem. To solve it, we used both experimental data obtained in natural conditions (time series of recorded indicators) and a specially designed experiment: determination of carbon dioxide compensation points. A specialized processing method (balanced identification) and the corresponding information technology made it possible to consider a number of models, unbiasedly evaluate the significance of the hypotheses, and determine the errors of models describing the dataset. The evolutionary method of modifying models (from simple to complex, with modeling error as the selection criterion) made it possible to choose a model whose complexity corresponds to the used experimental data. The model thus constructed is applied to calculate the assimilation of CO2 by forest ecosystems and WUE (Water Use Efficiency).

AB  - The scarcity of high-resolution empirical data directly tracking diversity over time limits our understanding of speciation and extinction dynamics and the drivers of rate changes. Here, we analyze a continuous species-level fossil record of endemic diatoms from ancient Lake Ohrid, along with environmental and climate indicator time series since lake formation 1.36 million years (Ma) ago. We show that speciation and extinction rates nearly simultaneously decreased in the environmentally dynamic phase after ecosystem formation and stabilized after deep-water conditions established in Lake Ohrid. As the lake deepens, we also see a switch in the macroevolutionary trade-off, resulting in a transition from a volatile assemblage of short-lived endemic species to a stable community of long- lived species. Our results emphasize the importance of the interplay between environmental/climate change, ecosystem stability, and environmental limits to diversity for diversification processes. The study also provides a new understanding of evolutionary dynamics in long-lived ecosystems.

AB  - Tidal bars and tidal flats in shallow, mesotidal estuaries are subject to the action of tidal currents and waves. This complex forcing gives rise to large variations in bottom sediments and related benthic ecosystems. In this research we study the spatial relationships among tidal currents, waves, sediment characteristics, chlorophyll a, and pheophytin in the shallow bars and flats of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA. Waves and tides have a mild effect on the sand grain size and percent of silt and mud of these shallow deposits. Average wave conditions are more important than extreme events, like Nor'-easters, in sediment sorting. The spatial distribution of pheophytin, an indicator of dead microphytobenthos, mimics that of silt and mud whereas chlorophyll a, a proxy for the live microphytobenthos stock, is greatest in sandy areas characterized by intermediate values of tidal velocity.

AB  - Pedestrians, comprising approximately 60% of the population, are among the most vulnerable road users in South Africa. The roadside environment may be an important factor influencing the nature and frequency of pedestrian fatalities. While there are audit tools for assessing the pedestrian environment in other countries, no such tool exists for South Africa. This study evaluated existing audit tools in relation to South African issues and conditions and developed a South African Pedestrian Environment Assessment Tool (PEAT). PEAT was tested at five sites in the Tshwane Metropolitan Area in Gauteng to assess its applicability. PEAT was simple to use and provided valuable information, however, appropriate measures need to be taken to address fieldworker security, especially for night-time assessments when several roadside factors, such as lighting, should be evaluated. Although it was not the focus of our study, based on our results, we suggest that the lack of pavements, pedestrian crossings and pedestrian lighting are factors that, potentially, could increase pedestrian vulnerability.

AB  - Entertainment was modeled as a nested temporal process using ecological momentary assessments. In natural viewing conditions, participants watched a Super Bowl game on television and answered a brief questionnaire via the Internet at the beginning of commercial breaks. Multilevel data analytic techniques were employed to analyze the longitudinal data from these assessments. After controlling for individual differences, such as gender, fandom, and team support, affect played a critical role. Average positive affect, averaged over the course of the game, and situational positive affect during specific moments in the game had a significant impact on entertainment, suggesting a baseline level of entertainment that is associated with the ritual of watching the event and added situational entertainment that is tied to the events in the game. Interestingly, situational negative affect was also significant and seemed to work in concert with positive affect.

AB  - Vibration analysis is an effective tool for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbine drivetrains. It enables the defect location of mechanical subassemblies and health indicator construction for remaining useful life prediction, which is beneficial to reducing the operation and maintenance costs of wind farms. This paper analyzes the structure features of different drivetrains of mainstream wind turbines and introduces a vibration data acquisition system. Almost all the research on the vibration-based diagnosis algorithm for wind turbines in the past decade is reviewed, with its effects being discussed. Several challenging tasks and their solutions in the vibration-based fault detection of wind turbine drivetrains are proposed from the perspective of practicality for wind turbines, including the fault detection of planetary subassemblies in multistage wind turbine gearboxes, fault feature extraction under nonstationary conditions, fault information enhancement techniques and health indicator construction. Numerous naturally damaged cases representing the real operational features of industrial wind turbines are given, with a discussion of the failure mechanism of defective parts in wind turbine drivetrains as well.

AB  - To investigate the distributions of dinoflagellate cysts in relation to environmental conditions from southern coast of Korea, surface sediment samples collected from 11 stations in Gamak Bay, Yeoja Bay and the offshore area of Yeoja Bay were analyzed. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages observed in the study area included many species commonly reported from other temperate regions. Among them, Polykrikos cysts were dominant, together with Brigantedinium spp. and Spiniferites spp. Based on cluster analysis, dinoflagellate cyst assemblages were divided into two main groups; group I, located in Yeoja Bay and group II, located in Gamak Bay and the offshore area of Yeoja Bay. Principal component analysis identified differences in salinity levels as the main environmental factors affecting the distributional characteristics of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in the study area. Gamak Bay is a typical eutrophied area as result of extensive human activities around the bay, and heterotrophic cysts, including Polykrikos cysts, are remarkably abundant and likely to be a useful indicator for eutrophication in Gamak Bay.

AB  - The effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization levels on the growth patterns of the grass Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85) were studied in terms of occurrence of plants, sward height, leaf area index, and photosynthetically active radiation interception (PAR(int)). The field trial was made in an experimental area. Treatments consisted of N levels (0; 150; 300; 450; and 600kg/ha N-urea, split in two applications) arranged in an experimental design of entirely randomized blocks with four repetitions. Plots were weekly sampled, from the day 10(th) to 40(th) after cutting. Both occurrence of plants as well as sward height were responsive to nitrogen fertilization according to a response pattern that seasonally varied, depending on N rates and environmental conditions; thus, demonstrating their sensitivity as indicators of growth conditions and canopy structure. Leaf expansion and its associated PAR interception were also directly and proportionately controlled by N rates, being maximized to values of leaf area index around 4.0.

AB  - In this paper various biogas systems based on waste materials have been analysed from an environmental point of view. The analyses are based on Swedish conditions using a systems analysis approach from an energy and life cycle perspective. The biogas produced is used as a transportation fuel replacing petrol in light-duty vehicles. The overall aims are to quantify the potential environmental effects when current waste handling and transportation fuel systems are replaced. A general conclusion is that the indirect environmental benefits (e. g. reduced emissions of ammonia and methane, and nitrogen leaching) from altered handling of organic waste materials and land-use may often significantly exceed the direct environmental benefits achieved when biogas replaces petrol (e. g. reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and air pollutants). Such indirect benefits are seldom considered when biogas is evaluated from an environmental point of view. However, the environmental impact from different biogas systems can vary significantly due to factors such as the waste materials utilised, different reference systems being replaced, and local conditions.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the effect of gamma radiation on biological specimens. Thus, our concept is to clarify that exposure to accumulated dose of 0.2 Gy gamma rays (0.66 rad/Sec. dose rate) from Cs137 source induces cellular perturbations in the midgut epithelium of the F1 progeny of Blaps polycresta, therefore affecting nutrition and growth. Beetles were reared in laboratory conditions and the newly emerged adults were irradiated with the aforementioned dose. Histological and ultrastructure anomalies of midgut cells (digestive and regenerative cells) were observed by 72 h after radiation exposure to ensure that the cells will not return to control state. Retardation in the development of the F1 progeny was also noticed and beetles died through two weeks. In the light of these observations, biological tissue act as an indicator to the continuous exposure to environmental radiation.

AB  - This study examines how political, social and economic factors influence clean energy technology entrepreneurship (CETE). Government policies supporting clean energy technology development and the development of markets for clean energy create opportunities for CETE. However, the extent to which such opportunities lead to the emergence of new clean energy businesses depends on a favorable external context promoting CETE. This study employs a novel dataset combining indicators of the policy and social context of CETE with information on clean energy technology startup firms in the USA to provide empirical evidence that technological and market conditions supporting clean energy induce more extensive CETE under contexts where local attention to clean energy issues and successful firms commercializing clean energy technologies are more prominent. By establishing that CETE is contingent upon a supportive local environment as well as technology and market opportunities, the study holds relevance for policy makers and clean energy technology firms.

AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of ice edge position at the end of the summer period, the dates of the beginning of stable ice formation in early autumn in the Russia's Eastern Arctic seas (Laptev, East-Siberian, and Chukchi) during 1981-2018 together with climate changes in the 21st century are analyzed. The analysis of summer and autumn ice characteristics shows certain common features occurring for many years: since the beginning of the 21st century, ice conditions have significantly improved, which is due to the more Northern position of the ice border in August-September and later dates for the beginning of stable ice formation in September-October. On average for the period 2002-2018, the ice edge at the end of the period of clearance from ice shifted (as compared to 1981-2001) in a northerly direction by about 400-500 km. Observations did show that in 2003-2018, the beginning of stable ice formation in the autumn season (as compared to 1981-2002) occurred later by about three weeks. The maximum northward shift of the ice edge was first observed (since 2002) on the aquatory to the East of the New Siberian Islands, and then (since 2011) - to the West of them. The greatest anomalies of late dates (onset) of ice formation were first observed (since 2003) in the Chukchi Sea, then (since 2008) - in the Laptev Sea, and later (since 2014) - again in the Chukchi Sea. Long-term changes in the ice conditions occur according to the similar scenario: first, an anomaly of the latitudinal position of the edge or the date of the ice formation beginning was formed in the Eastern part of the studied aquatory, and then this anomaly shifted from East to West. At the same time, the anomaly diminishes in the East that makes it possible to interpret the observed natural changes as fluctuations of the "ice wave" type. Taking into account the wave features of changes in summer and autumn ice indicators, we can assume that in the 2020s we should expect a similar continuation of natural fluctuations in changes in ice conditions, which will be accompanied by a spatial shift of the ice edge in the South direction and relatively earlier dates for the beginning of ice formation.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of livestock grazing is crucial to rangeland management and conservation. Numerous indicators have been employed to detect differences caused by grazing, while case studies suggest that effects differ among individual indicator systems. Across Tibetan pastures that have evolved with long grazing histories and harbour high levels of biodiversity, we tested: (I) whether commonly used grazing indicators differ in their sensitivity to grazing and environmental conditions, and (2) the relative importance of grazing and abiotic factors in controlling effects on indicators.
   Our sampling covered 18 sites within two main grassland types (steppe and meadow). We compared species compositions among communities of plants, small mammals and ants, as well as overall soil chemical conditions and field hyperspectral reflectance data using multivariate analyses between two qualitative levels of grazing intensity (heavy vs. light). Using univariate Generalized Linear Models, we explored the effects of grazing intensity, grassland type and their interaction on the richness and abundance of biotic groups as well as values of key soil and hyperspectral indices. The major environmental factors tested included temperature, precipitation, elevation, relief, exposure and inclination.
   Few of the indicators differed under relatively heavy grazing, including reductions in vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen concentration and two hyperspectral indices. Indicator groups differed both quantitatively and qualitatively with respect to grazing and climate impacts. Grazing effects were evident in the moist Kobresia meadows of eastern Tibet, while environmental controls dominated in alpine steppes of the drier western part of the plateau. Grazing effects on indicators thus depended on local precipitation conditions. Multivariate species compositions were affected by abiotic factors in all biotic indicator groups: precipitation was the most influential abiotic factor affecting plant species composition, overall soil nutrients and hyper spectral data, while elevation and temperature influenced ant and small mammal communities in terms of richness and species composition.
   Our results do not support the notion that local increases in relative grazing intensity have strong effects on the species richness of key biotic indicator groups across all Tibetan pastures. Reliable assessments of grazing effects thus require both multiple appropriate indicators and careful calibration to account for local climate and topographic conditions. Differences between principal grassland types must be acknowledged for future grassland conservation and management.

AB  - This paper compares two North American occurrences of fossils that exhibit Burgess Shale-type preservation (BST): the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Formation of southeastern British Columbia, and the Lower to Middle Cambrian Kinzers Fm of southeastern Pennsylvania. Redox-sensitive trace elements (Mo, Ni/Co, V/Sc) indicate that palaeo-oxygenation conditions varied with respect to faunal assemblage and location. Ogygopsis-bearing fauna in both the Burgess Shale and Kinzers formations are associated with a dysoxic metal signature. Burgess Shale-type preservation in the Kinzers Fm was deposited in a fluctuating oxycline, whereas the BST-fossil beds of Fossil Ridge and Mt Stephen (Burgess Shale Fm) yield a geochemical signature that consistently indicates oxic conditions. Thus, sustained low-oxygen conditions do not correlate with higher quality of fossil preservation at these sites. Ogygopsis is associated with dysoxic conditions in both localities, and may therefore be a faunal indicator of such environments in Middle Cambrian strata.
   Carbonate units associated with both the Burgess Shale and Kinzers formations contain large, generally concordant, near-surface cavities that contain herringbone calcite cements that show no significant enrichment in the potential calcite inhibitor ions such as reduced Fe. Sr, S, Pb, and Zn. The abundance of micro-inclusions of dolomite suggests that Mg may have been the calcite inhibitor ion responsible for herringbone cement in these Cambrian occurrences. Another distinctive mineralogical feature is the presence of doubly-terminated, euhedral, zoned, authigenic quartz as a conspicuous part of a carbonate host-rock replacement assemblage. The association of both herringbone calcite and zoned quartz crystals in units associated with the Burgess Shale and Kinzers formations suggest a common feature in the depositional and diagenetic environment of these two regions in which Burgess Shale-type fossil preservation occur; syn-depositional brine flow is the likely cause of these distinct mineralogical features. Brine seeps in the depositional environment may have provided nutrients for stable high-abundance faunal communities in a slope setting, thereby accounting for the abundance of fossil material. Furthermore, high-salinity brine in the pore waters of carcass-bearing Cambrian muds may have further limited shallow burrowing, scavenging, and decomposition rates, accounting for the exceptional preservation in these two localities.

AB  - In this study, the effects of Intermittent-Vacuum Stripping (IVS) on activities of methanogenesis in co-digestion of corn stover with liquid swine manure (LSM + CS) under thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) conditions were evaluated. A 65% methanogenesis activity inhibition was observed in pretreated LSM plus corn stover (pLSM + CS), while 60 and 165 mL/L/day CH4 productions were achieved in pLSM + CS and LSM + CS, respectively. The high salinity condition (5.28%) after IVS pretreatment was considered the primary inhibitor in pLSM + CS, while the ammonia (<= 600 mg/L), C:N ratio (15.52) and volatile solid loading rate (3 g/kg(-1).day(-1)) didn't show a negative effect on CH4 production. When salinities were increased from 2% to 4% and 8%, 50% and 100% inhibition were observed respectively. The butyrate accumulation was a potential indicator of the non-salinity-inhibition status for methanogenesis in TAD.

AB  - Earthworm avoidance behaviour test is an important screening tool in soil eco-toxicology. This test has been developed and validated under North American and European conditions. However, little research has been performed on the avoidance test in the tropics. This work demonstrates the potential suitability of the avoidance behaviour test as screening method in the highlands of Colombia using Eisenia fetida as the bio-indicator species on contaminated soils with carbofuran and chlorpyrifos. Though for the two active ingredients 100% avoidance was not reached, a curve with six meaningful concentrations is provided. No significant avoidance behaviour trend was found for mancozeb and methamidophos. Tests were conducted in the field yielded similar results to the tests carried out in the laboratory for chlorpyrifos and mancozeb. However, for the case of carbofuran and methamidophos, differences of more than double in avoidance were obtained. Divergence might be explained by soil and temperature conditions.

AB  - A Lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model combining a three dimensional prognostic sea-land breeze model has been developed and applied to the analysis of mesoscale atmospheric dispersion of radiological releases from the nuclear power plants in mountainous coastal regions. The hydrostatic primitive equations in the terrain-following coordinate system were used in the sea-land breeze model, and a Markov chain process and a kernel density estimator were used in the Lagrangian particle dispersion model. In this study, the mesoscale atmospheric circulation and particle dispersion simulations around the Wolsung nuclear power site located on the east coastline of Korea were carried out for two synoptic weather conditions on a clear day in summer by using the developed models. The simulated results showed that the atmospheric dispersions were affected by wind directions of sea breeze and land breeze according to synoptic weather conditions. And the simulated results have very good agreement with the observations.

AB  - Soil enzyme activities are sensitive indicators of soil quality reflecting effects of land management. This study aims to monitor the effects of four crop rotation systems (rice-rice-rice: R-R-R, soya-rice-rice: S-R-R, fallow-rice: F-R and pea-soya-rice: P-S-R) on the activities of six important soil enzymes involved in C, N, P, and S cycling and soil properties during rice growth.
   Four rice plots with different rotation systems were investigated before rice planting and during the phenological cycle in a paddy soil from the Veneto region, Italy; sampling of soils (0-15 cm) was carried out four times during growing season (three replicates). A total of 48 samples were air dried, for some chemical (soil pH, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon, extractable P), physical (particle size distribution), and biochemical measurements (enzymatic assays and extraction of soil DNA). Moreover, the total concentration of trace and macro- and microelements were measured for assessing element levels and possible contamination of soils.
   The results demonstrated that compared with field moist soil, drained soil conditions resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) of beta-glucosidase, arylsulfatase, alkaline and acid phosphomonoesterase, leucine aminopeptidase, and chitinase activities in almost all rotations. The results obtained point to a land with high soil contamination by Li and TI. Moreover, soil DNA was negatively correlated to soil TI stress (r = - 0.41, p E, 0.01). The P-S-R rotation had the highest TI concentration in April and it is likely to be responsible for the lowest enzyme activities in the field-moist condition.The total concentrations of most studied elements (Al, As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, V, Zn) in the soil samples fell within the natural geochemical background concentration levels.
   The obtained results suggest that the activity of most enzymes decreases in the different experimental conditions with the following order: drained soil > late waterlogging > early waterlogging > moist soil. However, the response of enzymes to waterlogging differed with the chemical element and the cropping pattern. The best rotation system for chitinase, leucine aminopeptidase, and beta-glucosidase activity (C and N cycles) was R-R-R, while for arylsulfatase, alkaline, and acid phosphatase activities (S and P cycles), it was the S-R-R.

AB  - Pollen- and non-pollen-palynomorphs (NPP) analytical studies of the northwestern part of Spitsbergen were conducted between 1988 and 1991. As well as pollen from local native flora and more dispersed species, some well preserved remains of tardigrada exuvia, buccal tubes and eggs were found. This study reviewed the remains of at least six tardigrade taxa reported: Dactylobiotus ambiguous, Paramacrobiotus richtersi group, Richtersius coronifer, Macrobiotus hufelandi group, Macrobiotus peterseni and Minibiotus cf. intermedius, which are reassessed and determined more accurately. These findings provide some new insights into the past environmental conditions and changes for Spitsbergen. Based on the present research it can be concluded that tardigrade remains are frequent NPP elements of pollen analyses from lake, peat bogs and detritus sub-fossil sediment cores, at least in polar regions. It can also be stated that tardigrades can be considered indicators in further palaeontological studies helping to reconstruct past environmental conditions (for example humidity) for some regions. However, the knowledge of tardigrades in these types of analyses is still rather poor.

AB  - Lake Pernatoe is located on Paramushir Island, Kuril Arc, in the area of sand dunes. The 7-m-thick sediments of this lake pertain to the Holocene and contain palustrine, marine, and lacustrine facies. The rock magnetic properties of the sediments are analyzed for tracking the changes in sedimentation conditions. Marine facies are noted with low content of magnetic minerals; their magnetization is dominated by the paramagnetic component; pseudo-single-domain particles of magnetic material and iron sulfides (pyrite) are present. Pyrite frequently occurs in diatoms in the form of chains, spherules, and crystals. The lacustrine facies show high values of the magnetic parameters; they contain multidomain particles, mostly titanomagnetite and magnetite. Sands and sandy silts have the maximum values of magnetic parameters and reflect the stages of aeolian activity, corresponding to climatic cooling and marine regressions. On the basis of magnetic properties, four stages of active aeolian sedimentation are identified in the Holocene.

AB  - The classification of railway stations is a potentially powerful tool for strategic transport and land use planning. Existing classifications rely strongly on the indicator "passenger frequency", which focuses on transport related issues, blending performance with preconditions at a given site. We argue that a classification system for strategic planning should focus on the demands and conditions of the site within which the railway station must function, i.e. system context. Here, we present such a classification system: a cluster analysis of the 1700 Swiss railway stations relying solely on context factors. The resulting classes vary primarily in density (of land use and transport services) and use (commuting, leisure time, tourism). Common geographic patterns and class-specific dynamics are discernable. These results indicate that classification based on the relevant demands and conditions given by context leads to clearly interpretable classes and supports multi-perspective strategic planning for railway stations. The systematic approach allows for a better understanding of the interrelations between railway stations and their context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the disaggregated impacts of non-renewable energy (NRE) indicators comprising coal, gas, and fuel, and trade openness (TO) entailing imports and exports on environmental quality proxied by (carbon emission per capita, co2pc) in selected G-20 countries with the conditioning role of technological innovation (ecoi) from 1990 to 2018. The empirical analyses are evaluated using a battery of estimation techniques comprising augmented mean group (AMG), common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG), and mean group (MG), respectively. The following major results are evident from the analyses. First, coal, gas, fuel, and imports increase co2pc while exports reduce it. Second, the unconditional and conditional effects of technological innovation (ECOI) significantly reduce co2pc. These results are consistent with the robustness checks based on CCEMG and MG estimators. On the policy front, promoting technological innovation remains a veritable option to curtailing the devastating impacts of co2pc.

AB  - This study applies a process of detailed assessment to summarize the potential impact of a proposed construction or other activity on the environment before implementation of an investment plan. The aim of the study was to develop a general methodology for analysis and evaluation of environmental issues connected with planned activities and proposed projects (especially buildings and engineering constructions, required implementation of environmental impact assessment process) using a risk analysis method, thus enabling the best option among the proposed activities to be chosen. The methodology was developed for conditions in Slovakia but could be arranged for any other country considering national conditions, requirements, standards and legislative. Application of the developed methodology in environmental impact assessment could create preconditions for more effective implementation of the EIA process. This paper provides a framework for the risk analysis component of the scoping phase within the EIA process. The process outlined in this paper will assist with determination of an estimation of risks to environmental and health of proposed activities.

AB  - Symbiont-bearing large benthic foraminifers (LBFs) are widely distributed around coral reefs. If the physiological responses of LBFs to environmental changes can be recognized at an individual level, LBFs could serve as highly accurate bioindicators. In this study, chlorophyll a, respiration, and photosynthesis of Baculogypsina sphaerulata individuals were measured, and whether these physiological traits could be estimated based on the color of the holobiont (foraminifera and the diatom symbionts) was examined. Chlorophyll a content was estimated using a* and b* values of holobiont color represented in CIE L*a*b* color space. Photosynthetic performance decreased significantly with increasing whiteness (L*). These results indicated chlorophyll content as well as photosynthetic performance of Baculogypsina could be directly estimated using the holobiont color. The increased whiteness in color and decreased photosynthetic performance were mainly observed under low-light environment, possibly indicating symbiotic algae were shrunk into the central part of the host shell due to prolonged exposure to adverse conditions.

AB  - Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) analysis was undertaken on three biofilms grown under different feeding conditions and offering diverging microbial activities and structural characteristics. EPS were extracted by a multi-method protocol including sonication, Tween and EDTA treatments and were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Tween and sonication extracts presented higher EPS size diversity compared to EDTA extracts. EPS size diversity also increased with microbial functions within the biofilms and a specific 25-50 kDa cluster was identified only in extracts from biofilms presenting autotrophic activity. Another specific size cluster (180 kDa) occurred in Tween extracts provided from the mechanically stable biofilms. Such specific EPS appear as potential indicators for describing microbial and structural properties of biofilms. This study brings new elements for designing EPS fractionation and shows that size distribution analysis is an interesting tool to relate EPS diversity with macro-scale characteristics of biofilms.

AB  - The aim of the studies was to determine how the level and variation of the physiological indicators: thyroxine, triiodothyronine, insulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosfatase, urea, glucose, creatynine and cholesterol depend on different feeding. Four samples of the blood were taken from 174 young bulls (7-9 months old) before morning feeding. The first blood samples were collected under standard feeding conditions while animals were fed a diet of corn silage and hay with supply concentrates. The second sampling was done 36 h after fasting, Next the animals were offered mixed concentrates and hay ad libitum for 42 days and the third sample was taken. The last sample was collected after 36 h of fasting. The variation of all indicators was high (except glucose). No effect of the feeding and fasting period on the activity of alanine aminotransferase was determined, The animals showed a higher level of aspartate aminotransferase and creatynine after silage and hay feeding compared to ad libitum concentrate feeding. The variability of biochemical indicators showed that their level is dependent on many environmental factors and physiological conditions.

AB  - Because cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an indeterminate, tropical perennial plant that is grown commercially as a temperate annual, proper management of vegetative and reproductive growth may produce substantial yield response. In regions such as the semi-arid and arid West, characterized by long seasons and substantial control over the environment by means of irrigation and fertilization, field-implementable indicators of early season vegetative source strength can provide a useful management tool. To be useable, baseline data must exist that provide values for these indicators under unstressed conditions. We present arguments in support of the concept of height-to-node ratio (HNR) and growth rate (GR) as indicators of the strength of vegetative growth during the early season (prior to anthesis). We analyzed relationships derived from the experimental controls in 13 separate replicated experiments conducted between 1982 and 1989. Relationships between plant height and number of mainstem nodes (MSN) were analyzed and summarized using linear and nonlinear regression. These analyses provide baseline values under unstressed conditions for Acala 'SJ-2' cotton grown in the San Joaquin Valley, California.

AB  - An attempt was made to distinguish metal-organic matter interactions in two types of sulfate-reducing environments, mild (MR) and strong sulfate-reducing (SR), in the Aleksinac oil shale deposit (Oligocene-Miocene). Samples from the MR group show (all differences are statistically highly significant): lower organic matter content, compared with the SR group, higher O/C and N/C ratios (0.147 +/- 0.054 and 0.041 +/- 0.014, respectively, compared with 0.125 +/- 0.031 and 0.035 +/- 0.008, respectively, in the SR group), and higher Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mo and C contents than in the SR group. Statistically significant correlations between metals, the N/C and the SiO2/A12O3 ratio in the MR group only, represent a record of highly interdependent processes of organic-metal-silicate interactions which had been occurring in the mild sulfate-reducing conditions during oil shale formation.

AB  - The pursuit of happiness has a long history as a primary political end in Western political thought. Along with traditional economic indicators, policy makers are increasingly concerned with the subjective well-being of a society as a measure for its success. It is important to understand the nature of happiness and ask what can be done to improve it. This article builds upon existing literature that consistently identifies health, wealth, and social connectedness as key predictors of happiness. We find that the design and conditions of cities are associated with the happiness of residents in 10 urban areas. Cities that provide easy access to convenient public transportation and to cultural and leisure amenities promote happiness. Cities that are affordable and serve as good places to raise children also have happier residents. We suggest that such places foster the types of social connections that can improve happiness and ultimately enhance the attractiveness of living in the city.

AB  - This study from summer 2002 describes the largely undisturbed vegetation cover of pioneer habitats on coastal dunes of the Swina Gate Barrier, west Polish coast. The aim of the study was to survey the morphology of the youngest undisturbed dunes on an accumulation coast and describe the different vegetation types. The influence from tourism in the main selected study area is rather low; however, increasing numbers of tourists potentially threaten the dunes. The result of the study is the map of habitats and graphs of species in each section of the dunes. Ecological indicator values were calculated for each section of the dunes, showing the changing ecological conditions for the different habitats. Each habitat has some typical species, which are sometimes completely restricted to this single habitat. Consequently, the value for conservation of these undisturbed complex dunal ecosystems with all habitat types is high.

AB  - Late Glacial and Holocene lacustrine molluscs occurring in three sites from the Gniezno and Pozna Lake Districts in central Poland are described. The mollusc fauna present in the sites is composed mainly of aquatic species with an accessory content of terrestrial snails inhabiting damp or very damp, periodically flooded sites. Ecological preferences of species, changes in their composition and frequency together with shell dimensions are used as indicators of palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate. Infrequent shells present in the Imiolki and Rybitwy sites are small and thin-walled in consequence of the cold climate prevailing in the Late Glacial when the sediments in question were deposited. In the Imiolki site Pisidium lilljeborgii CLESSIN, a species indicative of low temperatures, occurs. Deposits in the Niepruszewo-Ciesle site were accumulated through most of the Holocene, thus warmer conditions resulted in considerably more abundant and larger shells with thicker walls.

AB  - Section 305(b) of the United States' Clean Water Act (CWA) requires states to assess the overall quality of waters in the states, while Section 303(d) requires states to develop a list of the specific waters in their state not attaining water quality standards (a.k.at impaired waters). An integrated, efficient and cost-effective process is needed to acquire and assess the data needed to meet both these mandates. A subset of presentations at the 2002 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) Symposium provided information on how probability data, tools and methods could be used by states and other entities to aid in development of their overall assessment of condition and list of impaired waters. Discussion identified some of the technical and institutional problems that hinder the use of EMAP methods and data in the analysis to identify impaired waters as well as development needs to overcome these problems.

AB  - The vertical zonation pattern of Eurydice longicornis, Pontogeloides latipes and Excirolana natalensis, cirolanid isopods co-existing on Sundays River Beach, was studied, and differed from Dahl's. Salvat's and Trevallion et al.'s schemes. In view of the apparent differences in zonation both in the present study and the literature, the use of cirolanid isopods as indicators of zones is questionable.
   Environmental factors are suspected to be more important than biological interactions as cause for the observed zonation patterns of the three species, This study suggests longshore distributional differences in the cirolanid isopod populations both on a large scale along a log-spiral bay and on a small scale along a mega-cusp system. Seasonal changes in distribution seem to occur in all three species as well as semilunar zonation changes in E. natalensis.
   The flexible zonation patterns exhibited by the cirolanid isopods at Sundays River Beach may be an adaptation for survival in the dynamic, unstable conditions of a high energy, microtidal beach.

AB  - Humic material is an alive material occuring with decay of products of the animals and plants. They help to arrange plants growth and also help to set response for surronding environmental conditions. Plants, bacteria, fungi, and insects have a major role for formation of humic materials. Especially beetles decomposer bugs are one of the major contributers of humic materials formation. Some studies stated that beetles decomposers play important roles in nutrient cycling for forming new habitats for other organisms and for being indicator species for envirenmental health. Therefore, it is vital to increase benefits of these species to maximize humic material occurance in the nature. More knowledge needed between these beetle decomposers and their habitats. Identifying and protect of their living habitat for humic materials becoming even more important. In this study, direct and indirect benefits of beetles decomposers for humic materials were determined. The studies about Humic materials and insects, specially in relation with humic material and beetles decomposers are detailed and presented.

AB  - Marine aquaculture is controversial in coastal communities for a variety of reasons, including environmental and aesthetic concerns. Shellfish and especially finfish farming have the potential to cause eutrophication effects on the bottom, and reduce oxygen levels in the water column. Active participation of citizens in data gathering before and after development provides a mechanism of engagement in the science used for development decisions. I examine how participatory science can solve 2 problems: insight into far-field impacts of aquaculture, and entrainment of coastal stakeholders into the decision process. Working with a community group, I suggest sediment profile imaging as a method that could be employed by coastal residents, including participation in image analysis of the apparent redox potential discontinuity, a validated visual indicator of coastal benthic conditions. The implementation of rigorous science, with applicability to ecosystem health and capacity for public participation is key in ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Statistical learning theory is the basis of support vector machine (SVM) technique. This technique in natural hazard assessment is getting extremely popular these days. It contains a training stage related to the input and desire output values. The main goal of this paper is to assess and evaluate the prediction capability of SVM technique with different kernel functions for spatial prediction of flood occurrence. Kuala Terengganu basin, Malaysia was selected as study area. To begin, a flood inventory map was produced by mapping the flood locations in the Terengganu using documentary sources and field survey. The flood inventory was partitioned into training and testing datasets through random selection. The spatial database was constructed using various flood conditioning factors: altitude, slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from the river, geology, land use/cover (LULC), soil, and surface runoff. Four SVM kernel types such as linear (LN), polynomial (PL), radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid (SIG) were utilized to check the robustness of the SVM model. Consequently, four flood susceptibility maps were created. In order to examine the efficiency of the SVM model, a probabilistic based frequency ratio (FR) model was applied and compared with the SVM outcomes. An area under the curve (AUC) method was used to validate the resultant flood susceptibility maps. The validation results demonstrated that the prediction rate curves for flood susceptibility maps generated by the SVM-LN, SVM-PL, SVM-RBF, and SVM-SIG were 84.63%, 83.92%, 84.97%, and 81.88% respectively. On the other hand, the prediction rate achieved by FR showed the lowest accuracy of 61.43%. To evaluate the impacts of conditioning factors on the flood susceptibility mapping, Cohen's kappa index was measured. The result demonstrated that all conditioning factors have reasonably positive influence on the flood analysis in current case study except surface runoff which decreased the accuracy of the final results. The most influential factors were altitude and slope for all kernel types. It can be concluded that SVM technique is an efficient and reliable tool in flood susceptibility assessment. The resultant flood susceptibility maps can be beneficial in flood mitigation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Combined effects of the recent mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak and white pine blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola) (WPBR) are causing extensive crown dieback and mortality in limber pine (Pinus flexilis) in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. Additional stressors such as climate change and limber pine dwarf mistletoe (Aceuthobium cyanocarpum) may significantly alter stand structure and biodiversity of these ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess site, stand, and tree health conditions in limber pine stands of northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana, (2) quantify impacts of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe, and (3) determine biotic and abiotic factors that influence the occurrence and incidence of these damage agents.
   We assessed 22,700 limber pines on 508 plots in limber pine-dominated stands in twenty-five study areas in northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana. Average live limber pine density was 311 stems ha(-1). Overall, 50% of limber pines were classified as healthy with over 50% of limber pine mortality attributed to bark beetle attacks. White pine blister rust damage was evident on over 60% of declining or dying limber pines. Blister rust was the primary damage agent, occurring on 73% of the plots and 26% of the trees. Bark beetle-caused mortality was found on 75% of plots and 18% of trees. Limber pine dwarf mistletoe was present on 29% of plots and 9% of trees. In study areas that were previously monitored, incidence of WPBR increased over 8-9 years by 6%, bark beetle-caused mortality by 17%, while dwarf mistletoe incidence remained the same. We used statistical modeling to determine meteorological, macro and micro site factors, and stand factors that influenced the occurrence and incidence of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe on limber pines.
   Declines in health and rise in mortality due to bark beetles and WPBR has left some study areas with low limber pine basal area and stand density. These stands may be at risk for localized extirpation if the minimum viable population thresholds are not maintained and are identified as areas of concern for restoration and conservation efforts. Current condition status and long-term monitoring of limber pine is needed for land manager decision making and facilitation of restoration goals. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - P-T conditions, mineral isograds, the relation of the latter to foliation planes and kinematic indicators are used to elucidate the tectonic nature and evolution of a shear zone in an orogen exhumed from midcrustal depths in western Turkey. Furthermore, we discuss whether simple monometamorphic fabrics of rock units from different nappes result from one single orogeny or are related to different orogenies. Metasedimentary rocks from the (dine and Selimiye nappes at the southern rim of the Anatolide belt of western Turkey record different metamorphic evolutions. The Eocene Selimiye shear zone separates both nappes. Metasedimentary rocks from the (dine nappe underneath the Selimiye shear zone record maximum P-T conditions of about 7 kbar and > 550 degreesC. Metasedimentary rocks from the overlying Selimiye nappe have maximum P-T conditions of 4 kbar and c. 525 degreesC near the base of the nappe. Kinematic indicators in both nappes are related to movement on the Selimiye shear zone and consistently show a top-S shear sense. Metamorphic grade in the Selimiye nappe decreases structurally upwards as indicated by mineral isograds defining the garnet-chlorite zone at the base, the chloritoidbiotite zone and the biotite-chlorite zone at the top of the nappe. The mineral isograds in the Selimiye nappe run parallel to the regional S-R foliation, parallel the Selimiye shear zone and indicate that the Selimiye shear zone formed during this prograde greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphic event but remained active after the peak of metamorphism. Ar-40/Ar-39 mica ages and the tectonometamorphic relationship with the Eocene Cyclades-Menderes thrust, which occurs above the Selimiye nappe in the study area, suggests an Eocene age of metamorphism in the Selimiye nappe.
   Metasedimentary rocks of the (dine nappe 20-30 km north of the Selimiye shear zone record maximum P-T conditions of 8-11 kbar and 600-650 degreesC. An age of about 550 Ma is indicated for amphibolite facies metamorphism and associated top-N shear in the orthogneiss of the Cine nappe. Our study shows that simple monophase tectonometamorphic fabrics do not always indicate a simple orogenic development of a nappe stack. Preservation in some areas and complete overprinting of those fabrics in other areas apparently occur very heterogeneously.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to determine whether contaminant data on mussels and sediments can be used interchangeably, or not, when assessing the degree of anthropogenic contamination of a water body. To obtain adequate coverage of the entire Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy sediment samples were collected, analyzed and combined with similar data from four coastal monitoring programs. This required careful interpretation but provided robust results consistent with published literature. A strong correspondence was found between sediment and mussel concentrations for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, moderate to weak correspondence for polychlorinated biphenyls, and except for mercury and zinc, little to no correspondence was found for metals. We conclude that mussel contaminant data are likely sufficient for providing information on the spatial and temporal distribution of chemical contaminants, in coastal waters, under a broad range of environmental conditions and contaminant levels, and unlike sediments, provide direct information on contaminant bioavailability.

AB  - The debate surrounding the inclusion of gender dysphoria/gender variant behavior (GD/GV) as a psychiatric diagnosis exposes many of the fundamental shortcomings and inconsistencies of our current diagnostic classification system. Proposals raised by the authors of this special issue, including basing diagnosis on cause rather than overt behavior, reclassifying GD/GV behavior as a physical rather than mental condition, and basing diagnosis on impairment or distress, offer some solutions but have limitations themselves given the available database. In contrast to most accepted psychiatric conditions where emphasis is placed on ultimately changing internal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, consensus treatment for most GD/GV individuals, at least from adolescence onward, focuses on modifying the external body and external environment to maximize positive outcomes. This series of articles illustrating the diversity of opinions on when and if gender incongruence should be considered pathological reflects the relative lack of scientific indicators of disease in this area, similar to many other domains of mental functioning.

AB  - The effect of an acceleration assay, carried out with a periodic aeration and an increased surface/volume ratio, on various aroma compounds of "fino" Sherry wines aging under a veil of a pure culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae race capensis G1 flor film yeast was studied. The results were subjected to multifactor analysis of variance, and the compounds simultaneously depending on acceleration conditions and aging time at p < 0.01 were subjected to principal component analysis. The first component, accounting for 86.14% of the overall variance, was mainly defined by acetaldehyde and its derivatives 1,1-diethoxyethane and acetoin. These compounds reached higher concentrations in accelerated aging wines in a shorter time than they did in control wines, and no browning problems were detected. Taking into account that these compounds can be used as indicators for biological aging of "fino" Sherry wines, the acceleration condition assayed can be applied to shorten the time of this process.

AB  - Streamflow can be drastically perturbed in urban basins with important implications for stream, floodplain, and riparian ecosystems. Normally, the dynamic influence of urbanization on streamflow is studied via space-for-time substitution. Here we explicitly consider urban growth when determining the flow regime of 14 urban basins. To synthetically represent the flow regime, we employ flow duration curves (FDCs) determined using a stochastic model. The model permits derivation of FDCs that are dependent on few parameters representing climatic, land use, conventional stormwater management, and geomorphological conditions in an urban basin. We use the model, under conditions of urban growth, to assess the influence of urbanization on key model parameters and to determine different indicators of hydrologic alteration. Overall, results indicate consistent changes in the temporal evolution of the perturbed flow regimes, which in this case can largely be explained by the progressive redistribution with urban growth of water from slow subsurface runoff and evapotranspiration to fast urban runoff.

AB  - Predicting insect field performance has direct value for control programmes seeking increased efficacy while simultaneously providing insights into field physiology and responses to environmental variability. Recent studies of field-released insects have made significant progress in three main areas. First, the trade-offs associated with thermal history relative to abiotic conditions on a given day have been repeatedly demonstrated in several taxa. Cold-acclimated insects released into hotter environments typically suffer performance costs - but do better than controls - in cooler environments suggesting both costs and benefits to physiological adjustments. Second, molecular mechanisms explored to date suggest complex underlying associations with recapture rates. Third, there has been significant progress in strengthening the link between traits scored in the laboratory as indicators of field performance. The overarching conclusion from this developing field suggests that physiological adjustments can make large, and in at least several cases, predictable changes in performance under field conditions. Further research is likely to contribute important insights into variation in field performance of insects.

AB  - In the present study, micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (UF) has been applied to treat edible oil processing wastewater using linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactants. In particular, the effects of different operating conditions on process performance were investigated in terms of product flux and reductions of wastewater turbidity, oil and grease content, chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS). Experimental results showed that transmembrane pressure and temperature of wastewater had direct effect on permeate flux while surfactant concentration influenced it reversely. To achieve the highest pollutants removal, the optimum operating conditions were found and applied. Finally, optimum permeate quality was compared to the permissible limits of environmental standards. As a result, LAS was shown to reduce pollution indicators more effectively in comparison with SDS, since combination of LAS and UF could eliminate turbidity, oil and grease, COD, EC, and TDS by 98, 95.7, 84.7, 90.6, and 90.7%, respectively.

AB  - The survival of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in a waste stabilization pond system in northwestern Spain and the effects of sunlight and the depth and type of pond on oocyst viability were evaluated using an assay based on the exclusion or inclusion of two fluorogenic vital dyes, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and propidium iodide (PI). All tested factors had significant effects (P<0.01) over time on C. parvum oocyst viability. Sunlight exposure was the most influential factor for oocyst inactivation. A 40% reduction was observed after 4 days exposure to sunlight conditions compared with dark conditions. The type of pond also caused a significant reduction in C. parvum oocyst viability (P<0.01). Inactivation rates reflected that the facultative pond was the most aggressive environment for oocysts placed both at the surface (presence of sunlight) and at the bottom (absence of sunlight) of the pond, followed by the maturation pond and the anaerobic pond. The mean inactivation rates of oocysts in the ponds ranged from 0.0159 to 0.3025 day(-1).

AB  - Biodiversity offsets are increasingly required as a condition to develop new projects in the context of the mitigation hierarchy. There is widespread understanding that conservation and restoration measures are necessary to maintain the supply of ecosystem services, but the relationship between biodiversity offsets and ecosystem services affected by development projects is still poorly understood. The extent to which biodiversity offsets can compensate for impacts on priority ecosystem services is analysed for a large iron ore mining project in Southeast Brazil. Evidence obtained from reviewing offsets and mitigation measures implemented as part of environmental impact assessment shows that specific ecosystem services-oriented offset strategies are necessary and that mitigation devoted to other impacts - especially on water - have potential to address impacts on ecosystem services. Actions such as conducting an ex ante ecosystem services review, integrating biodiversity with social mitigation measures and stakeholder engagement are necessary to simultaneously offset impacts on biodiversity and on priority ecosystem services.

AB  - Quantitative measures of visible injury are proposed for the protection of the aesthetic acceptability and health of ecosystems. Visible indications of air pollutant injury symptoms can be assessed rapidly and economically over large areas of mixed species such as native ecosystems. Reliable indication requires close attention to the criteria for assessment, species selection, and the influence of other environmental conditions on plant response to a pollutant. The estimation of fluoride-induced visible injury in dicotyledonous species may require techniques that are more varied than the measurement of necrosis in linear-leaved monocotyledons and conifers. A scheme is described for quantitative estimates of necrosis, chlorosis and deformation of leaves using an approximately geometric series of injury categories that permits rapid and sufficiently consistent determination and recognises degrees of aesthetic offence associated with foliar injury to plants.

AB  - The fate and environmental risk of antimicrobial compounds of different groups of veterinary medicine pharmaceuticals (VMP's) have been compared.
   The aim was to demonstrate a correlation between the physical and chemical properties of active compounds and their metabolism in target animals, as well as their fate in the environment. In addition, the importance of techniques for manure management and agricultural practice and their influence on the fate of active compounds is discussed. The selected active compounds are shown to be susceptible to at least one environmental factor (sun, water, bacterial or fungal degradation) to which they are exposed during their life cycle, which contributes to its degradation. Degradation under a number of environmental factors has also to be considered as authentic information additional to that observed in the limited conditions in laboratory studies and in Environmental Risk Assessment calculations.

AB  - Population trends and breeding success variability of Addle penguins, a bioindicator of Antarctic environments, have been attributed to changing sea-ice extents; however, causative mechanisms remain unclear. By electronically tagging 175 penguins in four seasons with contrasting sea-ice conditions, we show that ice-free environments enhance, not deteriorate, foraging efficiencies and breeding success. In an ice-free season, penguins traveled by swimming rather than walking, leading to larger foraging areas, shorter trip durations, and lower energy expenditure than three ice-covered seasons. Freed from the need to find cracks for breathing, dive durations decreased, and more krill were captured per unit dive time, which may also be associated with phytoplankton blooms and increased krill density in the sunlit ice-free water. Consequently, adult body mass, chick growth rates, and breeding success increased. Our findings explain the regional population trends and demonstrate a key link among sea ice, foraging behavior, and reproductive success in this iconic species.

AB  - Insect diversity is an indicator of environmental conditions. Frequent outbreaks of mangrove pests have threatened the fragile mangrove ecosystem in China and the sustainable utilization of mangrove resources. The understanding of mangrove pests, as well as a fundamental knowledge of insect diversity, in mangrove forests in China has been hindered by the difficulty of morphological species delimitation because captured insect specimens are either larvae or incompletely preserved adults. DNA barcoding technology uses only a small amount of DNA to conduct species identification. Taking advantage of this, we investigated the entomofauna of mangrove forests on Hainan Island by using a barcode combining cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome-b (Cytb). We collected 627 specimens at six localities around the island, which were identified as 219 insect species belonging to 11 orders and 72 families. Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera are the most species-rich and abundant taxa. We also identified 13 mangrove pests, 5 parasitoids, and 12 species of predators.

AB  - The results of long-term dendrochronological investigation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growth and condition in the impact zone of one of the biggest air pollution sources in Lithuania as cement plant "Akmenes Cementas" are presented. Conifers arc especially sensitive to environmental pollution. As an anatomical indicator of anatomical indicator of tree vitality, annual radial increment of trees was examined. The dynamics of the annual radial increment is influenced by the main climatic parameters (air temperature and amount of precipitation) as well as environmental pollution. The main attention was concentrated to assessment of the complex impact of climatic factors and industrial pollution on the radial increment of pine stands growing at different distances from the plant. Results of investigation and climate response models have shown that closest pine stands have suffered the strongest pollution impact, while the furthest pine stands were affected only by natural factors.

Quantification of DON content under natural conditions revealed differences between locations, years and genotype/environment Interactions. DON contents reaching or overcoming accepted limits for food processing (1.25 ppm) were found in some environments. Efficiency of a higher level of FHB resistance vs. DON contamination under artificial inoculation was demonstrated. In some environments, phenotypic traits, mainly percentage of FDK could be a good indicator associated with DON contamination of grains. Further breeding efforts are required to build genotypes combining both traits, a low content of DON and low FDK, %.

AB  - We analyze for the first time the spatial distribution of siphonophores in relation to water masses along a 3750-km oceanic transect between the Chilean coast and the Easter Island (27 degrees S), a sector scarcely known of eastern South Pacific Ocean. Thirty-one siphonophore species were identified; Sulculeolaria turgida and Vogtia glabra were recorded for the first time in this sector. The most abundant species were Muggiaea atlantica (29.2%), Eudoxoides spiralis (24.5%) and Lensia subtilis (13.1%). Two different siphonophore assemblages east and west of 76 W, associated respectively with Subantarctic Water and Subtropical Water masses, can be used as water mass indicators. The former included the three most abundant species, whereas the latter showed greater species richness. This study provides basic knowledge on spatial distribution of siphonophores, which is important to develop future research focused on understanding the ecological role and biological processes driven by planktonic organisms in the southeastern Pacific Ocean.

T2  - AMBIO

KW  - CENTRAL PERUVIAN ANDES
KW  - RECORD
AB  - Historical accounts of the Inca indicate that they greatly valued trees and practiced planting to fulfil their needs for fuel and timber. These records are evaluated in the light of palaeoecological and archaeological evidence suggesting a dramatic increase in arboreal taxa from c. AD 1100 during a period of significant global temperature increase. This natural vegetation response to improving environmental conditions may have stimulated management; it is suggested that agroforestry has a long tradition in the Andes. With the arrival of the Spanish, in the 1530s, land management practices changed and forest resources became increasingly overexploited. A multidisciplinary approach may provide important lessons from the past for modern policy makers in Peru. Widespread planting of Eucalyptus may not be an appropriate solution. Land restoration projects should take account of natural diversity and utilize a range of native species. This is relevant in view of the current period of rising temperatures, and may help to alleviate both soil erosion and rural poverty.

AB  - Fan deposits located at the mouths of Martian valleys have been interpreted as indicators of wet conditions during Mars history. However, the processes, time and amount of water needed to carve the valleys and form the fans are still debated. Here we present a detailed morphometric and mass balance analysis of valleys and fan-shaped deposits using high resolution topography, which provides new insights into past depositional environments.
   Based on morphometric and volumetric measurements, we found that several Martian fans previously interpreted as deltas can be categorized into two main types. Type I fans are more numerous, relatively well preserved, are associated with smaller and less mature drainage networks and were deposited on steeper gradients. The balance between eroded and deposited materials indicates that this set of fans might have been formed mainly in subaerial settings by depositional processes other than typical deltaic sedimentation (e.g. alluvial, glacial, mass-wasting in general), since a significant loss of sediment during deposition did not occur (we obtained a volume ratio of eroded vs. deposited materials of approximately 1). Therefore, we propose that the identified Type I fans were not deposited in prevailing subaqueous deltaic settings, but mainly in subaerial conditions with perhaps sporadic presence of ephemeral bodies of standing water within the basins.
   In contrast, Type II fans are less abundant, highly eroded, were deposited on flatter areas and formed downstream of more mature drainage networks with longer, deeper and wider valleys. The mass balance for this set of fans clearly shows that considerable amounts of sediment were not retained in the fans, implying large offshore transport of sediment during their formation (eroded vs. deposited volume ratios between 3 and 10 are probable). This evidence supports a fluvio-deltaic origin for this class of fans, indicating the existence of paleolakes over substantial periods of time.
   Based on the collected morphometric measurements and mass balance modeling we conclude that only a small percentage of the fans (Type II fans correspond to similar to 1/3 of the sampled areas) are consistent with the occurrence of favorable and durable conditions for life, i.e. long-lived integrated fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine environments. Whereas, the majority of fans might have been formed in subaerial settings with significant contributions of alternative processes besides fluvial transport and deposition thus not necessarily requiring the occurrence of extended epochs of clement climatic conditions.

AB  - Oligotrophy has its basis in low inorganic nutrient availability and it is generally known that in equatorial waters inorganic nutrient availability is insufficient to sustain the richness of life observed in some special places at this latitude Thus, the understanding of the organic dissolved component role in N and P biogeochemical cycles could explain the support of the food cham in oligotrophic equatorial waters. This study was undertaken for the purpose of contnbuting to the knowledge of nutrient availability and the participation of dissolved organic components in the trophic conditions of an oceanic equatorial island in the South Atlantic. Water and phytoplankton were sampled on the western fringe of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago in March 2015. Tropical oceanic conditions prevailed in this oceanic domain with high salinity (>28.36(degrees)c). and temperatures (>28 30 degrees C) The oceainc conditions assured a high pH and dissolved oxygen levels (>5.00 mL L-1 ) Alkalinity showed slight vanations, its lowest values being associated with biological interaction Suspended particulate matter was relatively low and its organic fraction was associated with the productive process and/or pollution contribution, which is confirmed mainly by high DON concentrations (similar to 4 00 mu molL(-1) ) with an association with high total chlorophyll in the primary production process and with urea in the pollution situation. The urea content attained 2.77 mu molL(-1) at a waste disposal outlet when a contamination event was observed in the region. The available inorganic nutrients showed low concentrations with an N-ammonium average of 1.99 +/- 0.64 mu molL(-1), nitrate with an average of 0.13 +/- 0.04 mu mol L-1 and nitrite with an average of 0.19 +/- 0.13 mu mol L-1 The DIN vaned from 0.74 to 4.32 mu mol L-1 principally represented by Nammonium DOC showed values of from 53 to 109 mu mol L (-1) and the DOC: DON ratio confirmed the organic source as being an inorganic N pool of oxidized orgamc matter and indicated that mtrogen-nch compounds are recycled faster than carbon-rich compounds Total chlorophyll concentrations reached 0.81 mg m(-3) and the noteworthy presence of filamentous cyanobacteria despite low inorganic nitrogen availability lead to a trophic cham initially supported with the contribution of a fixation process.

AB  - Sponges are commonly known as general nutrient providers for the marine ecosystem, recycling organic matter into various forms of bioavailable nutrients such as ammonium and nitrate. In this study we challenge this view. We show that nutrient removal through microbial denitrification is a common feature in six cold-water sponge species from boreal and Arctic sponge grounds. Denitrification rates were quantified by incubating sponge tissue sections with (NO3-)-N-15-amended oxygen-saturated seawater, mimicking conditions in pumping sponges, and de-oxygenated seawater, mimicking non-pumping sponges. It was not possible to detect any rates of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) using incubations with (NH4+)-N-15. Denitrification rates of the different sponge species ranged from below detection to 97 nmol N cm(-3) sponge d(-1) under oxic conditions, and from 24 to 279 nmol N cm(-3) sponge d(-1) under anoxic conditions.
   A positive relationship between the highest potential rates of denitrification (in the absence of oxygen) and the species-specific abundances of nirS and nirK genes encoding nitrite reductase, a key enzyme for denitrification, suggests that the denitrifying community in these sponge species is active and prepared for denitrification. The lack of a lag phase in the linear accumulation of the N-15-labelled N-2 gas in any of our tissue incubations is another indicator for an active community of denitrifiers in the investigated sponge species.
   Low rates for coupled nitrification-denitrification indicate that also under oxic conditions, the nitrate used to fuel denitrification rates was derived rather from the ambient seawater than from sponge nitrification. The lack of nifH genes encoding nitrogenase, the key enzyme for nitrogen fixation, shows that the nitrogen cycle is not closed in the sponge grounds. The denitrified nitrogen, no matter its origin, is then no longer available as a nutrient for the marine ecosystem.
   These results suggest a high potential denitrification capacity of deep-sea sponge grounds based on typical sponge biomass on boreal and Arctic sponge grounds, with areal denitrification rates of 0.6 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) assuming non-pumping sponges and still 0.3 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) assuming pumping sponges. This is well within the range of denitrification rates of continental shelf sediments. Anthropogenic impact and global change processes affecting the sponge redox state may thus lead to deep-sea sponge grounds changing their role in marine ecosystem from being mainly nutrient sources to becoming mainly nutrient sinks.

AB  - Understanding how disease affects commercial production is imperative for pig producers to quantify its full impact on pig performance, carcass quality, and net returns. The objective of this experiment was to assess the productivity and economic importance of naturally occurring health challenges (HC) under commercial conditions. Three 1,000 pig grow-finish facilities received 936 pigs each. The experimental period started approximately 34 d post placement at an average start BW of 13.1 +/- 0.2 kg. Barns were characterized based on the relative HC, determined by diagnostic assessments as the main characterization tool, along with other health indicators. Barns were characterized as low challenge health (LCh), moderate challenge health (MCh), and high challenge health (HCh). All barns tested positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection prior to the start of the experiment. Additionally, the MCh and HCh barns experienced influenza type A virus of swine. Similar to commercial production conditions, the disease challenge was not imposed but rather occurred naturally. Reduced ADG, ADFI, and G: F were observed with an increased HC (P < 0.001). Similarly, mortality was increased when the HC increased (P < 0.001). Decreased ADG increased days to achieve harvest BW, by 10 and 15 d in the MCh and HCh treatments compared with LCh, respectively (P < 0.001). No differences were observed for percent lean, loin depth, or fat depth (P > 0.10). The economic impact of the HC was assessed by applying these growth performance data to two economic models encompassing the two main marketing methods used by U.S. pig producers: fixed-weight and fixed-time. Financial losses attributed to the variation in disease severity that occurred in the present study ranged from $8.49 and $26.10 U.S. dollars (USD)/pig marketed using a fixed-market weight model, or between $11.02 and $29.82 USD/pig using a fixed-time model, depending on feed costs and market hog prices. In conclusion, increasing severity of HC under commercial conditions reduced ADG by 8% and 14% and resulted in mortality as high as 19.9%. Losses of $8.49 to $29.82/pig marketed underscore the potential magnitude of the economic impact of mixed etiology concurrent diseases in pork production.

AB  - This purpose of the research was to determine if there were cultural tourism products in Tanjung Api in the district of Kuala Kuantan, in the state of Pahang. To that end, the research process would require the understanding of the community, an analysis of the site, and the availability and conditions of the natural resources of the area. This study was conducted via unstructured interview, observations, and the use of the ethnography approach in the research methodology. The data collection method was guided through the use of five resources measuring instruments: Site Analysis, Community Analysis, Cultural Resources Analysis, Natural Resources Analysis, and Environment Assessment. The findings indicated the availably of tourism products such as the martial art called silat cekak, fishing and crab catching activities, interesting sights at the village such as the wet market and night market, visiting the jetty area, the old British graveyard and the uniquely design mosque.

AB  - The city of Rio Grande, located in the south of Brazil, suffers with the inadequate coverage of its network of sewage collection and treatment. In addition, there are clandestine effluents ducts being launched in the Mangueira bay, a region of extreme economic and ecological importance. This article aims to understand the influence of the Patos lagoon hydrodynamics, as well as inside the bay, in the behavior effluents dispersion in two different conditions: flood and ebb events. Further, the assessment of local pollution analyzing indicators of the contamination degree was performed. For the development of this study a hydrodynamic model TELEMAC-3D coupled to a dispersion pollutant model were applied. The results indicate that minor parts of the pollutants are dispersed outward the bay, whilst the bay is the most susceptible site to contamination since a large part of pollutants remain trapped in this region.

KW  - SITE SELECTION
AB  - Offshore wind energy has become the fastest growing form of renewable energy for the last few years. And the development of offshore wind farms (OWFs) is now characterized by a boom. OWF siting is crucial in the success of wind energy projects. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce intelligent algorithms to improve the siting assessment under conditions of multisource and uncertain information. An optimization macrositing model based on Cloud-Bayesian Network (Cloud-BN) is put forward. We introduce the cloud model and adaptive Gaussian cloud transformation (A-GCT) algorithm to grade indicators and apply BN to achieve nonlinear integration and inference of multi-indicators. Combined with the fuzzy representation of the cloud model and probabilistic reasoning of BN, the proposed model can investigate the most efficient siting areas of OWFs in the North Sea of Europe. The experimental results indicate that the siting accuracy is up to 86.67% with reference to the actual OWF location.

AB  - Restoration has been acknowledged to be a major pathway by which humans can repair damaged ecosystems. Most of the work to date on terrestrial systems has focused on restoring plant communities, with an assumption that the conditions that lead to more diverse plant communities will also lead to a restoration of insect communities. This, however, has not been proven to be true. Here, we examine the recovery of terrestrial insect communities in naturally recovering and restored sites in response to severe historic pollution in the region of Sudbury, Ontario. We find that the insect communities have not recovered to the same degree as the plant communities. Furthermore, we present directions on how cross-taxa surrogacy can be useful to further aid the use of insects as indicators of restoration success.

AB  - Offshore and coastal wind power is one of the fastest growing industries in many areas, especially those with shallow coastal regions due to the preferable generation conditions available in the regions. As with any expanding industry, there are concerns regarding the potential environmental effects which may be caused by the installation of the offshore wind turbines and their associated infrastructure, including substations and subsea cables. These include the potential impacts on the biological, physical and human environments. This review discusses in detail the potential impacts arising from offshore wind farm construction, and how these may be quantified and addressed through the use of conceptual models. It concludes that while not environmentally benign, the environmental impacts are minor and can be mitigated through good siting practices. In addition, it suggests that there are opportunities for environmental benefits through habitat creation and conservation protection areas.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to find a way to simulate the concentration of antimony in river water in order to obtain the data necessary for ecological risk assessment. The antimony concentration decrease coefficient (K') was introduced in the continuous plane source approximation of the one-dimensional form of the advective-dispersion equation in order group all removal processes into one parameter due to lack of sufficient data on antimony and sediments in Kuzuryu River, Japan, where the industrial zone discharges the antimony found most frequently. K' was calibrated according to the released and measured concentration of antimony, its value was 2.6 E-4.0 s(-1). The comparison between the calculated concentrations of antimony based on K' and the hazardous concentration affecting 5 % of aquatic species (HC5) calculated from the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of antimony, showed that the ecological risk quotient is larger than that under dry weather conditions.

AB  - The current research has been carried out to explore the spatial association of Multilevel deprivation within the urban setting of West Bengal, a state of India. In this cross-section study, 15 Socio-economic drivers have been used to construct an index of deprivation, reflecting the neighborhood's household condition, spatial variation wealth, physical infrastructure, health, hygiene, education and economic participation of urban residents. Principal Component Analysis is used to drive this sub-indicator which explains more than 83.293% of the variances. For the assessment of spatial association of multilevel deprivation, the Hierarchical clustering method has been used. Results show spatial variation exists in the level of deprivation. Index of deprivation identified heterogeneity in the level of poverty and their spatial association with deprivation. A strong negative association has been observed between the deprivation index and degree of urbanization, while a robust positive association has been marked with the poverty rate.

AB  - The growing population, thriving economy, rapid urbanisation significantly accelerate the generation of municipal waste. Tightening conditions for waste management are a challenge for all stakeholders to comply with the law and, at the same time, motivate them to reduce waste production. The knowledge of the biosphere's assimilation capacity can quantify the environmental impact of waste in an understandable and popular form to better understand the human need to assimilate the waste produced. Utilising the waste footprint indicator and anthropogenic emissions in the form of waste are converted into soil adsorption capacity. The article compares the waste footprints of different areas of the city of Prague. It quantifies the influence of living and waste services on the waste footprints of the capital inhabitants. This article also discusses the relationship of the waste footprint with other footprints and is intended to inform future debate on trace accounting.

AB  - Artists spend their working time in the workplace so a design is needed to address their needs. The workplaces need to be economic, ergonomic, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly based on the current trends. This study focused on all of these aspects while choosing the subjects for conducting the experiment. A total of 10 test subjects were involved in this study. Data related to environmental conditions were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test and those related to workloads and musculoskeletal disorders were tested by two-paired samplettest. The cardiovascular load and cardiovascular strain (CVS) data were tested by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for a 5% significance level. The results showed that using a natural posture while working can improve health quality. Occupational health indicators, such as workloads, cardiovascular load, and CVSs, musculoskeletal disorders, visual complaints, and concentration showed an improvement characterized by decreased workloads, cardiovascular load and CVS, musculoskeletal disorders, visual complaints, and increased concentration.

AB  - Microorganisms are fundamental drivers of biogeochemical cycling, though their contribution to coral reef ecosystem functioning is poorly understood. Here, we infer predictors of bacterioplankton community dynamics across surface-waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) through a meta-analysis, combining microbial with environmental data from the eReefs platform. Nutrient dynamics and temperature explained 41.4% of inter-seasonal and cross-shelf variation in bacterial assemblages. Bacterial families OCS155, Cryomorphaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Synechococcaceae and Rhodobacteraceae dominated inshore reefs and their relative abundances positively correlated with nutrient loads. In contrast, Prochlorococcaceae negatively correlated with nutrients and became increasingly dominant towards outershelf reefs. Cyanobacteria in Prochlorococcaceae and Synechococcaceae families occupy complementary cross-shelf biogeochemical niches; their abundance ratios representing a potential indicator of GBR nutrient levels. One Flavobacteriaceae-affiliated taxa was putatively identified as diagnostic for ecosystem degradation. Establishing microbial observatories along GBR environmental gradients will facilitate robust assessments of microbial contributions to reef health and inform tipping-points in reef condition.

AB  - Soil-test biological activity (STBA) is a key indicator of soil health because of its relevance to ecosystem processing, broad applicability, and simple and rapid analysis. Short-term and long-term influences of carbon (C) availability on STBA were assessed. A short-term factor was root-derived C inputs from a sudangrass (Sorghum x drummondii) test crop grown under greenhouse conditions. Long-term factors were from soil at two depths in three sections of a field varying in soil texture and exposed to 16 yr of different pasture-crop rotation management. Soil-test biological activity was determined after 0, 14, 21, 31, and 45 d of greenhouse growth. Total variation in STBA was 7% from the short-term factor and 81% from the long-term factors. Soil depth was the primary long-term factor influencing STBA (57%) and soil texture was intermediate (24%). Results indicate that short-term changes in STBA are important but modest compared with variations due to soil depth and texture.

AB  - Phytoplankton community structures of water environmental were monitored from July to August 2010 in Zhalong Wetland in northeast China. Phytoplankton community was obtained from samples taken from 341 stations with different environmental conditions. Physicochemical parameters (chemical oxygen demand, the total nitrogen, the total phosphorus, chlorophyll a (Chl-a)) were measured simultaneously for comparison with phytoplankton samples. A total of 410 phytoplankton taxa belonging to 7 phyla, 9 classes, 20 orders, 29 families, 79 genera were obtained. The mean value of trophic state index (TSI) was 49.87 and ranged from 34.89 to 69.12. The dominant species in the study area included Anabaena azotica, Selenastrum minutum, Chlorella vulgaris, Trachelomonas volvocina, Navicula radiosa, and indicator species suggesting that most of the Zhalong Wetland is mesotrophic. The TSI, phytoplankton density, Shannon-Wiener index, Margalef index also indicated that the water quality was a mesotrophic state in Zhalong Wetland.

AB  - Protozoa. and particularly ciliates, are essential in aerobic purification processes of wastewaters and have proved to be very sensitive to environmental changes. The physiological response of the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis was assessed in terms of mortality, growth and grazing capacity after exposure to four toxicants: copper; zinc, cycloheximide and Triton X-100. In the ranges of concentrations used, mortality, inhibition of growth and inhibition of grazing were observed with all toxicants employed, but in different ways. Copper and zinc showed lower toxicity than observed in other studies with protozoa, though some of the present results are in accordance with those reported by other authors. This supports the importance of the organism tested and the experimental conditions of the bioassays. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The relationship between linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) and nutritional stress caused by a grave historical famine (1959-1961) was investigated among contemporary Chinese. Based on dental observations in a sample of 3,014 subjects from rural and urban China, and data on famine stress from a variety of historical sources, hypotheses regarding the relation between LEH and nutritional stress were tested. Famine stress raised LEH prevalence significantly in the birth cohorts having their teeth developing during famine years; therefore, a correlation between nutritional stress and formation of LEH as suggested by previous studies was indicated. Rural subjects had significantly higher LEH prevalence than urban subjects, and this was attributed to poorer nutritional and living conditions in rural areas. Males had a slightly higher LEH prevalence than females, so that female biological buffering to environmental stress appears to have outweighed possible cultural practice of daughter neglect in this difference.

AB  - The vulnerability of any country's infrastructure to natural and anthropogenic factors serves as one of the most important issues, which in turn may cause irreparable damage. The present practical and developmental study aims to shed light on the spatial vulnerability of infrastructure in Kurdistan province (Iran) from the perspective of passive defense using analytic network process (ANP) in a GIS environment and also zoning vulnerability infrastructure against natural and human factors. The results obtained from the study of spatial pattern and zoning of vulnerability show that the spatial distribution of infrastructure in Kurdistan province is centralized and clustered, and in terms of vulnerability, about 80% of this province have moderate to very high vulnerability. The reason behind this is the poor condition of the physical indicators and the concentration of the main infrastructure in a small part of the province, necessitating more attention to land management and passive defense plans.

AB  - The Moroccan Atlantic coast is considered as one of the richest fishing areas in the world, having rich biodiversity, and supporting the fisheries sector. However, studies have shown that the ecosystem presently suffers from overexploitation of fishery resources and environmental degradation. To quantify these impacts, the characterization of the ecosystem is essential. In this work, an Ecopath model (EwE), which assumes steady-state and mass-balanced conditions for the Moroccan Atlantic coast ecosystem, was developed and balanced. Network analysis included in the Ecopath software package was used to estimate trophic interactions and the maturity of the ecosystem. The model consisted of 29 functional groups. The results showed a Total System Throughput (TST) which is comprised mainly of flows into detritus, followed by export, consumption, and respiration. Systemic indicators, suggest that the Moroccan Atlantic coast is an immature and developing ecosystem. Further observations on the functioning and dynamics of the ecosystem are discussed.

AB  - The article contains the results of autecological studies of the Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus in the Far East seas. It was found that its main food resources in different parts of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea are worms and bivalves, while the proportion of other species is insignificant. All these worms and bivalves are the species of benthic infauna and onfauna. The trophic level is in the range from 3.39 to 4.13; its variability depends on the proportion of bivalves and polychaetes. We described the environmental conditions of the habitat of Alaska plaice: depth, temperature, and preferred types of soil. The adaptation of Alaska plaice to certain soil structure provides camouflage and easier access of food resources. Relatively nonselective consumption of polychaetes and bivalves provides A wider range of habitats.

AB  - Mining has a long history in Namibia. Legacies of old operations are evident in numerous shut-down and abandoned mines, posing severe to moderate environmental and health risks. It is the responsibility of the government to deal with these risks, firstly by assessing their magnitudes, and then deciding on those that need the most urgent attention. The Geological Survey of Namibia, in cooperation with its partner, the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), and their consultant the Southern African Institute for Environmental Assessment (SAIEA) developed a Risk Assessment Manual for shut-down and abandoned mines, which takes the environmental conditions prevailing in Namibia into consideration. This manual provides a useful tool for the scientific and practical evaluation of the risks. It can be further developed and customized for adoption in other countries. In this article, we present the methodology adopted in the manual. (c) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eco-energy anthropopressure specifically affects the agricultural landscape, but is essential for society to survive and grow. While developing new dependencies and demonstrating large transgressions against the present state, eco-energy investments affect redefinition of the identity of place, society and landscape. This paper discusses management of eco-energy anthropopressure with regard to the sustainable development of society and the economy. Projects of infrastructure modernisation related to construction of renewable energy sources should consider an assessment of anthropopressure trends, which facilitate definition of priorities in measures exemplified by subsequent investments, considering their economic, environmental and social aspects. The criteria of eco-energy anthropopressure constitute the bases of analyses and guidelines when planning new undertakings. The positive trend of anthropopressure is a condition verifying the correctness of eco-energy engineering development. Application of enzymatic indicators enabling quantification of anthropogenic transformations, along with the ecological results of protective measures related to the generation of renewable energy allow for the long-term monitoring and identification of trends.

AB  - We compared naturally alkaline streams with limestone lithology to freestone streams with and without acid mine drainage (AMD) to predict benthic macroinvertebrate community recovery from AMD in limestone-treated watersheds. Surrogate-recovered (limestone) and, in many cases, freestone systems had significantly higher macroinvertebrate densities; diversity; taxa richness; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa; EPT/chironomid ratios; scraper/collector-gatherer ratios; herbivores; collector-filterers; and scrapers. AMD-influenced systems had significantly greater numbers of Diptera and collector-gatherers. An entire trophic level (herbivores) was "restored" in surrogate-recovered streams, which also showed greater trophic specialization. Indicator analysis identified seven taxa (within Crustacea, Diptera, Nematoda, Trichoptera, and Ephemeroptera) as significant indicators of limestone systems and six taxa (within Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Tricoptera, Coleoptera, and Mollusca) as significant freestone indicators, all useful as biological indicators of recovery from AMD.

AB  - A total of 56 bryophyte taxa associated with biological soil crusts was collected from 282 sites in semi-arid and arid eastern Australia. The 41 moss taxa and 15 liverwort taxa found were dominated by the families Pottiaceae and Ricciaceae respectively. Bryophytes were present at 224 of the 282 sites, and their distribution varied widely according to different landscapes. The mean number of taxa per site ranged from 8.9 on plains with red earths to 2.1 on active floodplains. The most common bryophytes found in the survey area were Bryum pachytheca, Didymodon torquatus, Gigaspermum repens, Goniomitrium enerve, Desmatodon convolutus, Stonea oleaginosa, Crossidium davidai, Riccia limbata and Riccia lamellosa. In this paper, the distribution of bryophytes in relation to landscape types, and some strategies for surviving in arid environments and their roles in biodiversity and rangeland condition assessment are discussed. Their distribution is compared with other published and unpublished studies from similar areas of Australia.

AB  - The research had the objective of diagnosing agro-ecosystems dedicated to the production of Coffea canephora, in municipalities of the Uige province, Angola. For this purpose, a diagnosis was made, which took into account the establishment of agro-ecological indicators that allowed the characterization of farms, which were previously selected according to the socioeconomic conditions and coffee production results, in conjunction with specialists and community leaders. After being characterized and evaluated, the results showed, according to a Cluster analysis, the structuring of six groups of farms that have similarities in some cases and differences in most of the indicators evaluated. The indicators that most influenced the differentiation of these groups were agricultural and industrial yields, topography, structural composition of shade, land use and tenure, soil agro-productivity, and traditional knowledge. Through them, the agro-ecological structure of the farms was defined, as a basis for making proposals for agro-ecological development, according to the potentialities found in each group.

TI  - The islands of Oceania - Political geography, biogeography, and terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
LA  - English
AB  - Humans are dependent upon ecosystems for the production of goods and services necessary for their well-being (Daily, 1997). As the service provider units (SPUs) for these benefits of nature (Anderson et al., 2015), ecosystems need to be managed in a way that maximizes their persistence on the planet. Part of that management effort includes knowing a) what the ecosystem types are, b) where they are located on the landscape and in the seascape, and c) what condition they are in. Mapping of ecosystem occurrences as the SPUs for ecosystems goods and services is therefore an important element of ecosystem accounting, an inherently spatial activity. Maps are also needed of the ecosystem accounting areas within which the accounting is conducted. Standardized maps of ecosystem accounting areas and terrestrial ecosystem SPUs have not previously been available for many islands of the Oceania region. We describe the availability of new island shorelines and ecosystems data for Oceania herein, and encourage consideration and evaluation of the data for ecosystem accounting and other applications.

AB  - We observed the distribution and identity of forage species to infer behavioral changes in response to intraseasonal variation in the coastal upwelling ecosystem of Monterey Bay, California. While the biomass of forage species remained comparable, the small-scale distribution of krill and anchovies was strongly affected by upwelling conditions. When regional upwelling influences were strong in the Bay, both species formed numerous discrete swarms and schools. During relaxation, both species were more diffusely distributed. Rather than gross changes in spatial distribution, a process that could take a long time for these relatively small animals, forage species responded to the short time scale dynamics that occur between days in the upwelling season with changes in their aggregative behavior. The behavioral responses observed highlight the need to study within-season dynamics in upwelling systems in addition to their cumulative influence in order to understand the ecological processes of these productive systems.

AB  - Increasing environmental pollution and the continuous development of new chemicals and drugs has led to ever growing concern about the potential effects of these compounds directly or indirectly on human health. As concerns water pollution, protozoa seem to be an excellent tool to assess both toxicity and pollution: they are regarded as biological indicators of pollution when their presence or absence can be related to particular environmental conditions, and they are considered test organisms when a species or population is used to evaluate the toxicity of relevant toxic compounds. Thus, an integrated approach is being developed to assess how toxic compounds affect the different biological levels of organisation - from the community level to the species level - of ciliated protozoa. The present paper reports and discusses the current state of the art of this approach. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

TI  - Rehabilitation of degraded mountain ecosystems in southwestern China: An integrated approach
T2  - AMBIO
LA  - English
AB  - The degradation of the mountain ecosystems in southwestern China has been unprecedented in speed and scale over the past decades. Deforestation, overgrazing, water and soil erosion, loss of soil fertility and declining or poor crop yields are alarming indicators of unsustainability due to rapid population pressure. Under the conditions of shortage of arable land, more marginal and forest lands are being reclaimed for agricultural use, and this accelerates the degradation of the fragile mountain ecosystems. Moreover, inaccessibility and a low level of education are preventing development in mountain communities. Agroforestry provides a promising resource-centered technology to meet the twin goals of productivity and conservation. This paper discusses the indigenous agroforestry system practiced in southwestern China, and the promising economic and ecological benefits. People in southwestern China have accumulated abundant knowledge on the utilization of agroforestry technologies to rehabilitate degraded land and the multiple benefits that follow some indigenous practices. Integrating the agroforestry system and modern agricultural technologies can be an effective approach for the sustainable development of mountain ecosystems.

   An extraordinary rich bryophyte flora can be found in one of the last unspoiled percolation mires of northern Germany in the valley of the Blinde Trebel south of Franzburg (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). The habitat has maintained its natural conditions nearly without any changes over the last five decades. A number of the existing plant communities, which are characterized by the highest contents of endangering, harvest a high degree of very rare and critically endangered mosses. Among them arc especially the characteristic taxa of the Paludello palustris-Caricetum Succow 1974 Paludella squarrosa, Helodium blandowii, Tomentypnum nitens and Philonotis calcarea.
   With the help of ecological indicator values the bryophytes contribute considerably to the habitat characterization of such mesotrophic calcareous mire.

AB  - In order to address the problem of pollutant effects on trees against the background of environmental fluctuations a simulation model using radial increment as an indicator of tree productivity is proposed. Ring times series of large trees provide one of the most acceptable biological indicators for the assessment of pollutant impact. This research focused on the tallest severely damaged and healthy trees growing close to each other in the surroundings of Jonava Mineral Fertilizer plant, which primarily emits nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) compounds. The annual increment was found to be strongly correlated with mean September air temperature of the previous year and S load. The correlation coefficient (k=0.961) between modelled and observed tree ring times series of severely damaged trees proves the impact of S load on growth and vitality of a tree and enables fulfillment of tree condition prognosis.

AB  - Investigation of biodiversity, including genetic diversity within species, is crucial for rational planning of nature conservation and species protection. Endemics or narrow-ranged taxa, sensitive to alteration of physical and chemical conditions, may serve as local bioindicators. Homoeogammarus scutarensis is an endemic, cold-adapted amphipod crustacean, inhabiting fragmented spring habitats, within a relatively small area of the Lake Skadar basin. The basin is recently under heavy anthropogenic influence leading to habitat deterioration. Genetic diversity within H. scutarensis was investigated using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA markers. Genetic diversity within the mitochondrial (mt)DNA appeared to be surprisingly high as for the limited spatial scale. The history of within-species divergence dates back at least to the Pliocene. A case of interspecific mtDNA introgression from the endemic H. scutarensis to the widespread and partly sympatric Homoeogammarus thoni was observed in one of the studied populations. Demographic analysis showed that the demography of H. scutarensis population has been stable, without evidence of expansion. Thus, we believe that H. scutarensis, responsive to environmental changes, is a proper model mirroring the conditions in sensitive habitats of the Lake Skadar basin. To protect ongoing evolutionary processes, the conservation measures for this species should take into account the complex fine-scale lineage endemism patterns. This case study may also provide a hint for planning conservation strategies in other geologically old spring systems. Most of the localities where H. scutarensis occurs provide refugia for divergent mtDNA lineages, suggesting prolonged isolation between sites and independent evolutionary histories. We conclude that H. scutarensis is composed of two or three conservation units. One of them occupies the headwaters of the Crnojevica River and spring in its valley. The other is widespread throughout the sub-lacustrine springs and the Zeta Plain; however, a group of unique haplotypes is found in springs in the Podhum Bay. Their presence and distribution should be considered while planning any investments or conservation strategies.

AB  - Surface water pollution has a complex multicomponent nature, due to a combination of various heavy metals that have a synergistic or antagonistic effect on various physiological parameters. Under model conditions, the combined effect of several heavy metals on aquatic plants was studied in terms of their toxicity, taking into account the nature of the interaction. In laboratory conditions, we studied the effect of nickel and copper ions and their mixtures in different concentrations on seed germination, growth and development of seedlings of the coastal-aquatic plant Alisma plantago-aquafica L. At the end of the experiment, seed germination, inhibition coefficient, morphometric indicators of seedlings and tolerance index were determined. Alisma seeds are highly resistant to nickel and copper chlorides and their mixtures. The toxicity limit for seed germination at 1-500 mg/L was not detected, although the inhibition coefficient in all variants of the experiment increased. A greater toxic effect of copper ions was noted compared to nickel ions. With the joint action of two metals on seed germination, a change in the nature of the effect from an independent action at low concentrations to antagonism at high concentrations was revealed. The growth and development of seedlings was observed at 1-100 mg/L. The main inhibitory effect of heavy metals was on the length of the main root, the first true leaf and the number of adventitious roots. Necrosis of the root system and hypocotyl, a weakening of the differentiation of the site of transition of the hypocotyl to the cotyledon, a change in the shape of the cotyledon, the colour intensity and turgor of the cotyledon and leaves were noted. The tolerance index showed that resistance at a level above 50% to the action of nickel, copper and their mixture was maintained at 1 mg/L. In the rase of the development of hypocotyl and cotyledon, copper was more toxic than nickel; nickel had a greater inhibitory effect on leaves. Under the action of the heavy metal mixture on the growth and development of seedlings, the independent action at low concentrations changed to antagonistic at high concentrations, which is probably due to competition in a number of indicators between nickel and copper.

AB  - Background: Sex presents evolutionary costs and benefits, leading to the expectation that the amount of genetic exchange should vary in conditions with contrasting cost-benefit equations. Like eukaryotes, viruses also engage in sex, but the rate of genetic exchange is often assumed to be a relatively invariant property of a particular virus. However, the rates of genetic exchange can vary within one type of virus according to geography, as highlighted by phylogeographic studies of cystoviruses. Here we merge environmental microbiology with experimental evolution to examine sex in a diverse set of cystoviruses, consisting of the bacteriophage phi 6 and its relatives. To quantify reassortment we manipulated by experimental evolution electrophoretic mobility of intact virus particles for use as a phenotypic marker to estimate genetic exchange.
   Results: We generated descendants of phi 6 that exhibited fast and slow mobility during gel electrophoresis. We identified mutations associated with slow and fast phenotypes using whole genome sequencing and used crosses to establish the production of hybrids of intermediate mobility. We documented natural variation in electrophoretic mobility among environmental isolates of cystoviruses and used crosses against a common fast mobility phi 6 strain to monitor the production of hybrids with intermediate mobility, thus estimating the amount of genetic exchange. Cystoviruses from different geographic locations have very different reassortment rates when measured against phi 6, with viruses isolated from California showing higher reassortment rates than those from the Northeastern US.
   Conclusions: The results confirm that cystoviruses from different geographic locations have remarkably different reassortment rates -despite similar genome structure and replication mechanisms-and that these differences are in large part due to sexual reproduction. This suggests that particular viruses may indeed exhibit diverse sexual behavior, but wide geographic sampling, across varying environmental conditions may be necessary to characterize the full repertoire. Variation in reassortment rates can assist in the delineation of viral populations and is likely to provide insight into important viral evolutionary dynamics including the rate of coinfection, virulence, and host range shifts. Electrophoretic mobility may be an indicator of important determinants of fitness and the techniques herein can be applied to the study of other viruses.

AB  - Pylaisia polyantha moss growing near intensive traffic in Gelezinis Vilkas street at Vingis Park (Vilnius) was selected as an indicator of environmental pollution. Two models were applied for the study: the Gaussian plume model - for zinc emission from automobiles calculation and mathematical model - for recalculating the zinc emission from transport to zinc concentration in moss. Moss samples were collected during spring, summer and autumn. There were no significant changes in Zn concentrations between these periods. Zn emission dispersion from pollution source was calculated only for one vehicle, in order to reach relationships between environmental conditions and dispersion of Zn emission from vehicle exhaust fumes pipe. It was detected that the concentration of Zn tends to decrease with the distance from the pollution source. It was observed that there was a strong relationship between wind speed and Zn concentration - the slower the wind speed, the higher concentration of zinc in moss.

AB  - The vegetation of the Chernihiv city sands (natural and technogenic origin) has rather high syntaxonomic diversity (17 associations and 5 initial communities) and the ruderal phytocoenoses prevail. Natural phytocenoses are represented to a small extent (Cyperetum flavescentis Koch 1926, Dichostylidi-Helochloetum alopecuroidis (Timar 1950) Pietsch 1973, Artemisia scoparia-Dianthus borbasii community, Kochietum arenariae Fijalk 1978). Synanthropic psammophytes species communities that are more resistant to anthropogenic influence, are formed under urban conditions. The ecological range of vegetation of sandy alluvia varies from xerophytic phytocoenoses in mineral-poor sand (Kochietum arenariae) to the communities, which indicate waterlogged areas with increased mineralization of water and saline bottom sediments (Typhetum laxmannii Nedulcu 1968). Itispossibletoobserve the adventization and apophization of sand vegetation, one of the indicators of which is the rupture of coenotic connections between the species of the community. These phenomena indicate that the process of synanthropization of the vegetation cover of the city keeps intensifying, and first of all, occurs in places of newly formed technogenic ecotopes.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are an important source of food and livelihoods to coastal communities around the world. Understanding the seasonality of fisheries catch and composition is crucial to fisheries management, particularly in the context of changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions. While seasonal variability directly impacts the lives of fishers, most fisheries studies focus on longer-term change. Here we examine seasonal variability in the small-scale fisheries of Baja California Sur, Mexico based on 13 years of government fisheries data. We investigate how four fisheries indicators with direct relevance to ecological resilience-magnitude and variance of landed fish biomass, taxon richness and the proportion of top-trophic-level taxa in total catch-vary within and among years and at multiple spatial scales. We find that these resilience indicators vary both seasonally and spatially. These results highlight the value of finer-scale monitoring and management, particularly for data-poor fisheries.

AB  - The coastal plains of the Red Sea constitute an important breeding area for the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Vegetation analysis was undertaken in the coastal plain of Sudan to provide a frame of reference for studies on desert locust ecology and distribution. Vegetation releves (> 60 in any season) were made at peak vegetation cover during three subsequent winters, 1999-2002. Four plant communities were distinguished by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis. They are named by the dominant plant species: Suaeda monoica Forssk., Heliotropium spp., Panicum turgidum Forssk., and Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne. These plant communities reflect underlying differences in elevation, soil texture, water availability and land use. The spatial extent of these plant communities is mapped. The resulting vegetation classification is easy to use under field conditions and can be used for ecological studies and practical monitoring of the desert locust. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Though oxygen demands are critical measurements for waste water treatment plant operation and water quality management, they are of little relevance to assess or rank the environmental quality of detergents. It is argued that: (1) No accurate measurements of the oxygen demand of bleach detergents can be made, because these products release oxygen during the measurement. (2) When waste water is adequately treated, under normal operating conditions the oxygen demand (organic loading) of the raw sewage has no influence on river quality. (3) Oxygen demand values are narrowly focused on environmental exposure, while they do not take into account the potential for ecotoxicological effects. (4) Short-term biological oxygen demand measurements are useful for the monitoring of 'average sewage', but they are unreliable to assess the biodegradability of more specific substances or products. Instead of oxygen demands, more holistic evaluations based on risk assessment or on life cycle analysis are scientifically preferred.

AB  - A new risk assessment system for pesticides has been developed for use by a wide variety of end-users from agronomists to farmers. This system replaces the old, predominately hazard-based approach that was originally used by the UK's EMA software package. The approach adopted is consistent with current regulatory assessments but adjustments are made to reflect the local conditions and the environmental costs and benefits of varying management practices. This paper presents an overview of the software and provides examples of its use and evaluation via case studies. The first of the case studies examines how the approach compares with the original EMA methodology and a variety of other indicators that were compared during the EU CAPER project. Other case studies apply the new system to assess whether differences in risk can be identified between different farm management systems-conventional agriculture and Integrated Crop Management.

AB  - Sampling of deposits at the Queen's Hotel site, York, produced a substantial number of small terrestrial vertebrate remains from the Anglo-Scandinavian features. By studying bone surface modification, fragmentation and skeletal completeness as taphonomic indicators, it was possible to demonstrate that the assemblage had resulted from two very different modes of accumulation and deposition. Refuse pits situated within the boundaries of the tenements had acted as accumulators of the fragmented and abraded small mammal and amphibian bones that existed as a sub-surface death assemblage within the local environment. In contrast, the excellent preservation and skeletal completeness of numerous frogs recovered from the basal fill of a wooden well could be accounted for by their direct entry into the burial environment as a result of pit-fall trapping. This paper also discusses the implications that the temporal and spatial variation in deposition demonstrated by the micro-faunal remains has for the reconstruction of local ecological and environmental conditions within this site, and for other such sites.

These maps allow an understanding of the geochemical nature of the rock assemblages, the mineral potential of the area, the ecological situation, soil fertility and chemical pollution level of the arable horizon, and recommendations on nature management.

Spatially comprehensive, and quantitative, Ecological Potential (EP) data provide a baseline for comparison to current rangeland vegetation conditions and trends. Here, we define EP as potential fractional cover (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush) represented in the least disturbed areas and most productive years of the Landsat satellite archive (1985-present) for each 30-m pixel. We produce EP maps across rangelands in the western United States by training regression tree models using Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP) time-series fractional cover maps in ecologically intact sites (with limited annual herbaceous cover, no recent disturbance or vegetation treatment, and less bare ground cover than expected). As independent predictor variables in these models, we use digital soils and topography data and six bimonthly composites of the 90th percentile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and associated spectral bands from the 1985-2020 Landsat archive. EP predictions were successful in capturing biophysical gradients present in the independent variables and depicting potential cover in the absence of disturbance; we found no influence of fires or land treatments in the data. Next, we compared EP to contemporary (2018) cover, to create departure maps that can be used as a screening tool indicating degradation and providing an early warning of vegetation state change. Finally, we used a dichotomous key to convert the 1985 and 2018 RCMAP cover and EP cover into vegetation states important to land management decisions (invaded sagebrush steppe, annual grasslands, etc.). We found that in 1985, 21.2% of the study area had a different vegetation state than EP, and this percentage increased to 24.2% by 2018. More than 50% of the EP native sagebrush steppe was converted to an annual grassland, perennial grassland, or nonsagebrush shrub by 2018, and an additional 7% was classified as invaded sagebrush steppe, at risk of transition to another state. EP products provide a spatio-temporal reference of vegetation conditions from the last three decades across rangelands in the western United States. Use of the EP reference can improve adaptive management practice by providing monitoring and control data, which are often lacking, and assist in differentiating treatment effect from confounding factors.

AB  - Global food security is challenged by increasing levels of CO2, O-3 and temperature trough their impacts on production and grain quality of wheat, one of the major C-3 crops and staple food across the world. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of elevated levels of CO2 (EC; 550 ppm) and tropospheric O-3 (EO; 70 ppb) as well as of combined interactive treatment [EC X EO; ECO] on plant growth, yield and grain quality of two wheat cultivars (HD-2967 and C-306) grown during 2016-17 and 2017-18 using free air ozone and carbon dioxide enrichment (FAOCE) facility under field conditions. Individually, EC, increased leaf area index (LAI; 15.9-28.2%), photosynthetic rate (Pn; 11.4-20.3%) and yield (8.2-20.9%) whereas EO declined LAI (5.1-12.5%), Pn (2.8-11.8%) and yield (2.2-14.2%) over ambient conditions (Amb: 405.2 ppm CO2 and 30.7 ppb O-3). Under ECO condition, EC increased LAI (2.2-17.1%), Pn (2.8-17.6%) and grain yield parameters (4.4-24.3%) across the cultivars in both years, but reduced the positive effects of EO on quality as compared to Amb. Dilution effect of increased yield under EC condition have reduced total protein, micro- and macro-nutrient concentrations whereas EO increased them notably compared to Amb. Starch in grains increased under EC but reduced under E0 as compared to Amb. AOT40, the sum of averaged difference of O-3 h(-1) concentration beyond 40 ppb for 7 hours (31233 ppb h(-1)) in FAOCEs rings during the crop growth period led to reduction in average grain yield of HD-2967 and C-306 by 11.6 and 8.5% or by 1.6 and 1.3% yield loss per ppb increase of O-3, respectively. The growth, yield and quality parameters of both wheat cultivars responded similarly but to different extent to all treatments. EC was able to offset the negative effects of E0 on yield and yield components only, but not those concerning the quality of grains. To stabilize global food security, precursor gases forming tropospheric ozone must be constrained.

AB  - Technologies can contribute to sustainable development (e.g., improving living conditions) and at the same time cause sustainability problems (e.g., emissions). Decisions on alternative technologies should thus ideally be based on the principle to minimize the latter. Analyzing environmental, economic, and social aspects related to technologies supports decisions by identifying the "more sustainable" technology. This paper focuses on social issues. First, it discusses the applicability of the social life cycle assessment (SLCA) guidelines for a comparative technology analysis, taking the example of two case studies in developing countries. Indicating technologies as "sustainable" also means that they are indeed operated over the expected lifetime, which, in development projects, is often not guaranteed. Consequently, social aspects related to implementation conditions should be considered in an SLCA study as well. Thus, a second focus is laid on identifying appropriate indicators to address these aspects.
   First, the SLCA guidelines were examined with regard to applying this product-related approach to two real case studies (analysis of technologies/plants for water supply and for decentralized fuel production) for a comparative technology analysis. Suitable indicators are proposed. To address the second focus, a literature research on technology assessment and implementation in developing countries was conducted. Moreover, socioeconomic studies in the investigation areas of the case studies were consulted. Based on this, indicators addressing implementation conditions were identified from the SLCA guidelines and additional literature.
   The study shows social issues and indicators found in the SLCA guidelines and considered suitable for a comparative technology analysis in the case studies. However, for a sustainability assessment of technologies, especially in developing countries, further indicators are required to address technology implementation conditions. A set of additional social indicators like reported trust in institutions or fluctuation of personnel is proposed. Though these indicators were derived based on specific case studies, they can also be suggested to other technologies and are not necessarily limited to developing countries.
   The study pointed out that an application of the SLCA guidelines considering the whole life cycle was not (yet) feasible for the case studies considered. This is mainly due to the lack of data. Regarding technology implementation, it was examined which indicators are available in this SLCA approach and which could additionally be integrated and applied. This is relevant as a potential contribution of technologies to sustainable development can only be achieved when the technologies are successfully implemented.

AB  - Major declines of populations of caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) that permanently reside on Arctic tundra have been attributed to short-term inaccessibility of forage through restrictive snow cover. Such density-independent phenomena would produce unpredictable changes in populations of Arctic tundra caribou, In 1985, Inuit correctly predicted mass emigration from the winter range of a caribou subpopulation on Fore Peninsula (FP, southern Baffin Island, Canada. During 1982-94, we conducted aerial surveys, satellite telemetry: and physical condition studies to examine features of the predicted range shift. Between 1984 and 1992, caribou density oil upland terrain on FP dropped (P < 0.001) from 6.2 to 0.3 caribou/km(2). Cows began to emigrate en masse during winter 1988-89 (P = 0.10) toward Meta Incognita Peninsula (MIP), where caribou showed greater fidelity to thai wintering area during 1988-94 (P = 0.005). Density of caribou on upland. terrain on PI MIP increased (P = 0.001) from 0.2 to 5.0 caribou/km(2) between 1982 and 1992. In April 1992, body size did not differ (P greater than or equal to 0.47) between FP and MIP. Cows on MIP had. greater (P less than or equal to 0.04) fat and muscle reserves than cows on FP while only fat reserves of MIP bulls were greater than (P less than or equal to 0.03) those of FP bulls. Our results support Inuit observations of declining physical condition of FP caribou in the early 1980's, and their view that the range shift was caused by cumulative annual overgrazing of the winter range during the previous 10 to 30 yr. Fewer cows on FP were pregnant (2 of 8) than on MIP (10 of 10: P = 0.002). Calf:cow ratios were higher (P = 0.05) on MIP than on FP in 1992. Although few caribou had occupied MIP for 50 yr before 1988-89. MIP caribou were in relatively poor condition by April 1992 compared to those on overgrazed Coats Island during mild. winters. Winter range shifts and population declines by Arctic tundra caribou may be predictable. Ecological indicators ma) enable managers to mitigate the effects of overgrazing on caribou populations through intensive harvesting at critical stages during long-term population increases.

AB  - Chlorine is a common natural water disinfectant, but it reacts with ammonia's nitrogen to form chloramines, which affects the accuracy of free chlorine measurement. In this case, total chlorine can be used as an indicator to evaluate the content of the effective disinfectant. In this article, a novel method to detect total chlorine using an electrode array in water has been proposed. We made the total chlorine sensor and captured the cyclic voltammetry curve of the electrode at different concentrations of chlorine ammonia. Principal component analysis and a peak sampling method were used to extract cyclic voltammetry curves, and the total chlorine prediction model was established by support the vector machine and extreme learning machine. The results show that the best predicting power was achieved by support vector regression with principal component analysis (R-2 = 0.9689). This study provides a simple method for determining total chlorine under certain conditions and likely can be adapted to monitor disinfection and water treatment processes as well.

   In recent years the condition of spruce stands in Beskid Slaski and Zywiecki (S Poland) has decreased drastically. This process consists of many factors. One of them is intense anthropopressure, therefore monitoring of forest pollution is extremely important. An analysis of four chosen trace elements (Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn) in soil and bark of Norway spruce from 7 locations in Beskid Slaski and Zywiecki was conducted. Tree bark was considered as a very good bioindicator of environmental gaseous and dust pollution. The concentrations of investigated elements in the material did not exceed the physiological concentrations, only in the bark of spruce trees from Beskid Zywiecki elevated levels of cadmium (2 mg/kg d.w.) were measured.

AB  - Interest in natural resources and the environment has led to the development of new federal monitoring efforts, the expansion of existing federal inventory programmes, and discussions of inter-agency collaboration for natural resource assessment data collection. As federal programmes evolve, knowledge gained from existing long-term survey programmes can provide valuable contributions to statistical and operational aspects of survey efforts. This paper describes the National Resources Inventory (NRI), which has been conducted by the US Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service in cooperation with the Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory for several decades. The current NRI is a longitudinal survey of soil, water, and related environmental resources designed to assess conditions and trends every five years on non-federal US lands. An historical overview is provided highlighting the development of the survey programme. Sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures used in the 1992 NRI are described, and statistical issues related to long-term monitoring are discussed.

AB  - The rapid growth of population and agricultural and industrial activities has caused an increase in demand on the Jeffara aquifers of Gabes (southeast Tunisia). In fact, the over-pumping of this aquifer system has resulted in water-level declines ranging from 0.25 to 1 m/year during the past three decades. The aim of this study is to identify favourable artificial recharge sites of this aquifer system based on the combined use of remotely sensed data, a geographic information system (GIS), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) product and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique. The delineation of artificial recharge zones shows high to moderate potential for groundwater recharge (40%) in the Gabes region, with high precision of good potential proposed sites. Recharge processes need to account for natural conditions and ecosystems.

AB  - The investigations aimed at the evaluation of nickel bioaccumulation ability of plants from various families (Poaceae-maize, Fabaceae-field bean and Asteraceae-lettuce). The research was conducted under hydroponic conditions. The experimental design comprised ten objects differing with nickel concentrations in the solution (ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 mg Ni dm(-3) of the nutrient solution). The parameters, assumed as the basis on which nickel bioretention by selected plant species was determined were: the yield, nickel content in various plant parts, uptake and utilization of this element by the plant, tolerance index (TI) and translocation factor (TF), the metal concentrations in the aboveground parts index (CI) and bioacummulation factor (BAF). On the basis of the obtained results it was found that, due to low tolerance of nickel, maize could be used as the indicator plant for the environment quality assessment.

AB  - Two lacustrine sporopollen records obtained from the Qaidam Basin (in the non-monsoonal region) and the Linxia Basin (in the monsoonal transition zone) indicate that during the early Pleistocene open forest-steppe/steppe vegetation developed in the Qaidam Basin, while in the Linxia Basin an open cypress forest-steppe shifted to a conifer/conifer-steppe and then to open forest- steppe vegetation. Existing sporopollen records from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) (in the monsoonal region) indicate that around the Sanmen Paleolake open forest-steppe shifted to pine/conifer-broadleaved mixed forest. The conifer cover then changed to a subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest distributed around the Nihewan Paleolake. These changes suggest that wetter conditions progressed from western China to the east, and the climate became more humid than that of today indicating a stronger Asian summer monsoon during the early Pleistocene.

AB  - During a study on Drama performance assessment, the many challenges of the assessment environment and assessment conditions became evident, along with the rich benefits and opportunities that performance assessment brings. This paper investigates one senior secondary performance assessment task from each of the six school sites which are aligned to one of the critical issues that emerged as themes in the analysis of data. These critical issues identify performance as fundamental to Drama, establish students aspirations when performing, describe students motivations for their performance efforts, investigate the capstone nature of Drama performance tasks, evaluate performance as a form of formative assessment, and establish the audiences role as an influencing factor on the assessment of Drama performances. This paper describes and problematises these critical issues, foreshadowing future areas for research in Drama assessment while allowing for new understandings of Drama performance assessment to be understood in the context of existing research.

AB  - The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is a key nontarget insect in environmental risk assessments of insect-resistant genetically modified crops. In controlled laboratory conditions, we evaluated the potential effects of Cry1Ie toxin on survival, pollen consumption, and olfactory learning of young adult honey bees. We exposed worker bees to syrup containing 20, 200, or 20,000 ng/ml Cry1Ie toxin, and also exposed some bees to 48 ng/ml imidacloprid as a positive control for exposure to a sublethal concentration of a toxic product. Results suggested that Cry1Ie toxin carries no risk to survival, pollen consumption, or learning capabilities of young adult honey bees. However, during oral exposure to the imidacloprid treatments, honey bee learning behavior was affected and bees consumed significantly less pollen than the control and Cry1Ie groups.

AB  - The progress of genetically engineered microbial whole-cell biosensors for chemosensing and monitoring has been developed in the last 20 years. Those biosensors respond to target chemicals and produce output signals, which offer a simple and alternative way of assessment approaches. As actual pollution caused by human activities usually contains a combination of different chemical substances, how to employ those biosensors to accurately detect real contaminant samples and evaluate biological effects of the combined chemicals has become a realistic object of environmental researches. In this review, we outlined different types of the recent method of genetically engineered microbial whole-cell biosensors for combined chemical evaluation, epitomized their detection performance, threshold, specificity, and application progress that have been achieved up to now. We also discussed the applicability and limitations of this biosensor technology and analyzed the optimum conditions for their environmental assessment in a combined way.

AB  - The relationship between ergosterol content in ericaceous hair roots and ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) colonization versus dark septate endophytic (DSE) hyphal colonization was examined in a dwarf shrub-dominated subarctic mire in Northern Sweden. Ergosterol content in hair roots did not correlate with ErM colonization in corresponding root samples. However, a significant positive relationship was found between hair root DSE hyphal colonization and ergosterol content. This is the first study to demonstrate that ergosterol cannot be used as a colonization indicator for ErM in hair roots growing under natural conditions. It also suggests the possibility of using ergosterol as an estimate of DSE hyphal colonization in ericaceous dwarf shrubs. This study has implications for the interpretation of results in field studies where ergosterol was used as a sole proxy for ErM colonization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A computer-based decision support tool (p-EMA) has been developed to support UK Government policy of optimising agricultural pesticide use. The system estimates risks to a wide range of taxonomic groups and environmental compartments using methods consistent with current regulatory assessments, but also allows adjustments to reflect formulation, the local conditions and the environmental costs and benefits of varying management practices. Simple models of the dispersion pathways of the pesticide in the local environment are used to estimate predicted environmental concentrations in the field and margin soil, surface water and groundwater. Exposure estimates are then combined with the toxicological properties of the pesticide in the form of toxicity: exposure ratios. Concentrations in groundwater are calculated on the basis of a meta-version of the MACRO model linked to environmental and pesticide databases. Surface water concentrations are taken as the maximum of those arising from inputs via spray drift and drainflow.

AB  - Larval chironomid mouthpart deformities are used as indicators of anthropogenic stress. However, there are limited data on the incidence of naturally occurring deformities. Chironomid larvae were collected from 252 reference sites throughout the Great Lakes by Environment Canada from 1991 through 1993. Overall incidence of mentum deformities was 2.27% for Procladius (SE = 0.46, n = 1055), 2.15% for Chironomus (SE = 0.51, n = 839), 1.27% for Heterotrissocladius (SE = 0.57, n = 393), 1.38% for Tanytarsus (SE = 0.61, n = 363), and 3.25% for Polypedilum (SE = 1.07, n = 277). The most common deformity was one missing tooth in the mentum. Deformity frequency was highest in Northern Channel and Georgian Bay of Lake Huron. However, incidences were homogeneous among regions (G-test, p > 0.05). In examining contaminated conditions, a result greater than one 95% confidence interval above these reference deformity frequencies should be considered significantly elevated from baseline levels.

AB  - In fissured aquifers, hydrodynamic phenomena combined with a network of permeable fissures imparts varying degrees of vulnerability depending on the type of contaminant. The study presented here examines the impact on a karst aquifer of a river which receives effluents from a sewage treatment plant just upstream from the point of recharge. This recharge constitutes a source of bacteriological and chemical pollution. The aquifer is accessible by boreholes at discrete points, facilitating investigation of the evolution of three of the contaminants characteristic of treatment station effluents, NH4+ and two biological contaminants with different survival capacities. The study was undertaken both under normal climatic conditions and during a flood occurring after a long dry period. The rate of infiltration, of subsurface transport, and of dissemination of contaminants into a zone usually protected from contamination was recorded. The results confirm the vulnerability of fissured aquifers to contamination.

AB  - The environmental risk of Chromium (Cr) pollution is pronounced in soils adjacent to chromate industry. It is important to investigate the functioning of soil microorganisms in ecosystems exposed to long-term contamination by Cr. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Cr on carbon mineralization in soil. The study was carried out in soils contaminated and uncontaminated with Cr near and away from a Cr mine in three different districts (Bozluk, Kizilyuksek and Yanikcam) of East Mediterranean Region, Turkey. Carbon mineralization were determined in soils humidified 80% of field capacity at 28 degrees C over 30 days under the same laboratory conditions. These results showed that carbon mineralization was greatly inhibited by the presence of Cr in all contaminated sites. Based on these results, microbial activity can use as an indicator for the Cr pollution level in the soil ecosystems.

AB  - Estuarine and marine near-shore environments are often subjected to heavy metal pollution. We establish a bioassay using the quantitative evaluation of metallothionein (MT) transcript in the fish hepatoma cell line, RTH-149, as a tool for detecting heavy metal pollution in brackish-marine water containing other pollutants in addition to heavy metals. RT-competitive polymerase chain reaction was used for the quantitative evaluation of the transcript in absolute units. Cadmium was used as a model pollutant to optimize two parameters of the assay: exposure periods (24, 96, 144 h) and salinity (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% sea water). Results revealed that salinity at or below 25% sea water at an exposure period of 144 h are the preferable conditions for detecting MT mRNA levels for in vitro assays employed on water samples from highly polluted brackish habitats.

AB  - The selectivity and efficiency of several enrichment broths used for the detection of salmonellas were comparatively evaluated under laboratory and environmental conditions. Media with selenite were less efficient in their inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive micro-organisms. Salmonellas grew slowly in tetrathionate broth and in media containing brilliant green. These media inhibited the growth of Salmonella typhi, which grew only in media containing selenite. The results obtained in the experiments with stressed salmonellas indicate that the media selenite F, selenite F with novobiocin, selenite cystine and Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV/43), in conjunction with the double agar layer technique, showed an optimal efficiency for the detection of stressed salmonellas. When natural samples (freshwater and seawater) were used to evaluate the media, however, those containing malachite green, whether or not supplemented with sodium novobiocin, enhanced the recovery of salmonellas.

AB  - Among grain legumes, faba bean is becoming increasingly popular in European agriculture due to recent economic and environmental interests. Faba bean can be a highly productive crop, but it is sensitive to drought stress and yields can vary considerably from season to season. Understanding the physiological basis of drought tolerance would indicate traits that can be used as indirect selection criteria for the development of cultivars adapted to drought conditions. To assess genotypic variation in physiological traits associated with drought tolerance in faba bean and to determine relationships among these attributes, two pot experiments were established in a growth chamber using genetic materials that had previously been screened for drought response in the field. Nine inbred lines of diverse genetic backgrounds were tested under adequate water supply and limited water conditions. The genotypes showed substantial variation in shoot dry matter, water use, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, transpiration efficiency, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13) C), relative water content (RWC) and osmotic potential, determined at pre-flowering vegetative stage. Moisture deficits decreased water usage and consequently shoot dry matter production. RWC, osmotic potential, stomatal conductance and Delta(13) C were lower, whereas leaf temperature and transpiration efficiency were higher in stressed plants, probably due to restricted transpirational cooling induced by stomatal closure. Furthermore, differences in stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, Delta(13) C and transpiration efficiency characterized genotypes that were physiologically more adapted to water deficit conditions. Correlation analysis also showed relatively strong relationships among these variables under well watered conditions. The drought tolerant genotypes, ILB-938/2 and Melodie showed lower stomatal conductance associated with warmer leaves, whereas higher stomatal conductance and cooler leaves were observed in sensitive lines (332/2/91/015/1 and Aurora/1). The lower value of Delta(13) C coupled with higher transpiration efficiency in ILB-938/2, relative to sensitive lines (Aurora/1 and Condor/3), is indeed a desirable characteristic for water-limited environments. Finally, the results showed that stomatal conductance, leaf temperature and Delta(13) C are promising physiological indicators for drought tolerance in faba bean. These variables could be measured in pot-grown plants at adequate water supply and may serve as indirect selection criteria to pre-screen genotypes.

AB  - Rotifers are a group of zooplanktons which mainly reside in fresh water habitats in the aquatic ecosystem. Due to the presence of crown of cilia surrounding the mouth, they are commonly called as "wheel animalcules". They are an important part of live supplementary feed for fishes. They can also be regarded as water quality indicators. The changing climatic conditions due to the Global Warming may also be responsible for changing diversity of rotifers species. The present research was carried out in the Washim district, Maharashtra during a period of five months from August to December 2018 for analysing the diversity of rotifers along with their ecological role. Samples were collected from four different water bodies viz. Padmatirtha Talav, Dev Talav, Narayan Baba Talav and Adol Dam and the analysis of the samples revealed a total of 19 different species of rotifers belonging to 2 orders (Ploima and Flosculariaceae) and 6 families (Brachionidae, Trochosphaeridae, Tricocercidae, Lepadellidae, Asplanchnidae, Synchaetidae). Brachionidae family was dominant followed by Trochosphaeridae.

AB  - Macrophytes from some high Andean lakes of Ecuador and their low potential as bioindicators of eutrophication. The occurrence of macrophyte in three high Andean lakes of Ecuador, Lago San Pablo, Laguna La Mica and Lago Cuicocha was recorded in 5-9 transects per lake. The first two lakes are eutrophic, the third is an extremely oligotrophio caldera lake. The dominant species in eutrophic lakes are Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum quitense, Potamogeton illinoensis, P. striatus and Elodea matthewsii. In the oligotrophic lake P pectinatus, P. illinoensis, and the Characeae Chara rusbyana, Ch. globularis and Nitella acuminata occur. The maximum depth of the macrophyte's presence can be used as an indicator of the trophic state, ranging from about 5 m in Mica to 35 m in Cuicocha. The bioindication value of the macrophyte species in these high Andean lakes is low, because few species occur and because some of them are not specific to environmental conditions.

AB  - A proper understanding of Quaternary environments requires assessment of the possible existence of perennially frozen ground. Furthermore, the structural and mineralogical changes induced by permafrost are commonly irreversible and still affect the present soils, so that it is important to be able to recognize them. However, the regions that suffered severe, but dry periglacial conditions during cold Quaternary periods, as in southeastern Siberia, show few periglacial features. Five exposures investigated in the circum-Baikal area show permafrost features, although the same phenomena occur throughout southeastern Siberia. These exposures demonstrate that, even though evidence of permafrost may be lacking or equivocal, thorough analysis can reveal indicators of permafrost such as neoformed clays, secondary precipitates of iron, calcite, and sulphates with peculiar crystalline features, as are found in other past or presently perpetually frozen ground. In combination with sedimentary structures and the geomorphic environment, these indicators affirm the definite existence of permafrost. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of chlorine-organic insecticide endosulfane (thiodan) on phenotypic and genetic variation in four morphological traits of Drosophila melanogaster (wing length, thorax length, the number of orbital bristles and the number of sternopleural bristles) were examined. In addition, the effect of this pesticide on stability of development measured as fluctuating asymmetry of bilateral traits was estimated. On the medium with endosulfane, phenotypic variation of morphometric traits was significantly higher. No difference in fluctuating asymmetry between the stressed and the control samples was found. The among-line variance of morphometric traits of flies reared on the endosulfane-containing medium was significantly higher as compared to the corresponding variance under control conditions. The efficiency of using fluctuating asymmetry and phenotypic variation of morphometric and meristic traits as indicators of environmental stress in insect populations is discussed.

AB  - Human eel lines cultured under standardized conditions are found to react after a wide variety of aggressive but sub-lethal treatments by expressing stress proteins, mainly of the HSP68, HSP70 and HSP90 families. The stress reaction is a repair mechanism which rapidly takes place after minute damages caused to cell structures. It was therefore proposed to develop a sensitive biomarker to monitor environmental pollution, especially related to metals, based on the evaluation of stress protein production. This was achieved by computer-assisted densitometric analysis of autoradiographies of electrophoretically separated S-35-labelled proteins. The results indicate that our biological models consisting in HT29 and HepG2 cell-lines react to low concentrations of cadmium or nickel by a clear-cut increase of stress proteins expression. In most cases, this effect is much more significant and much more rapid to observe than changes in growth curves. It may constitute a reliable index of cell susceptibility to environmental aggressions.

AB  - Field trials were conducted in July-August and October 2012 to quantify the inactivation rate of Escherichia coli O157:H7 when mixed with fecal slurry and applied to romaine lettuce leaves. Lettuce was grown under commercial conditions in Salinas Valley, California. One-half milliliter of rabbit, chicken, or pig fecal slurry, containing an average of 4.05 x 10(7) CFU E. coli O157:H7 (C-0), was inoculated onto the upper (adaxial) surface of a lower leaf on 288 heads of lettuce per trial immediately following a 2.5 h irrigation event. To estimate the bacterial inactivation rate as a function of time, fecal matrix, irrigation and seasonal climate effects, sets of lettuce heads (n = 28) were sampled each day over 10 days and the concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (C-t) determined. E. coli O157:H7 was detected on 100% of heads during the 10-day duration, with concentrations ranging from <= 340 MPN/head (similar to 5-log reduction) to >3.45 x 10(12) MPN/head (similar to 5-log growth). Relative to C-0, on day 10 (C-t (= 12)) we observed an overall 2.6-log and 3.2-log mean reduction of E. coli O157:H7 in July and October, respectively. However, we observed relative maximum concentrations due to bacterial growth on day 6 (maximum C-t (= 8)) apparently stimulated by foliar irrigation on day 5. From this maximum there was a mean 5.3-log and 5.1-log reduction by day 10 (C-t (= 12)) for the July and October trials, respectively. This study provides insight into the inactivation and growth kinetics of E. coli O157:H7 on romaine lettuce leaves under natural field conditions. This study provides evidence that harvesting within 24 h post irrigation has the potential to increase the concentration of E. coli O157:H7 contamination, if present on heads of romaine lettuce; foliar irrigation can temporarily stimulate substantial regrowth of E. coli O157:H7.

AB  - Gaza central seawater desalination plant is a promising solution to alleviate the problem of water crisis in the Gaza Strip. The plant in the short term, phase (I), will desalinate seawater for potable uses with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters per year, while in the long term, phase (II), the plant capacity will be doubled to 110 million cubic meters per year of freshwater. As a product from the reverse osmosis process, a huge amount of brine with salinity reaches to 75,000 mg/L will be redirected to seawater; nearly 12,200 m(3)/h of brine will be rejected from phase (I) while in the long term, a brine flow rate of 24,400 m(3)/h will be disposed from phase (II). In order to minimize the negative impacts of the rejected brine on the marine environment, it is urgent to modeling numerically the impact of the discharged brine through various disposal systems to define the most environmental system. Various scenarios were defined and simulated using CORMIX model to study the efficiencies of onshore surface open channel, offshore submerged single port as well as offshore submerged multiport outfalls taking salinity variations as an indicator. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the most influencing input parameters on the simulation results as well as to evaluate the optimal environmental disposal system which can mitigate the adverse impacts of brine on the marine ecosystem as much as possible in the worst seawater conditions. The simulation results showed that the discharge via surface open channel is not environmentally feasible where the seawater salinity rose by more than 2000 mg/L at RMZ. The single-port scenario can meet the regulations at RMZ but the standard atGMZ was not met, where the rejected brine from phase (I) through single port at 1500m offshore raises the seawater salinity at GMZ by more than 600 mg/L. The staged multiport outfall, capped by 24 ports, achieves acceptable brine dilution at seawater depth of about 7.5 m, and in the worst ambient conditions in the case of phase (II) in operation, the brine's excess salinity was 536, 497, and 379 mg/L above the salinity of seawater at RMZ, GMZ, and ROI, respectively.

TI  - Evaluating the relevance of seasonal differentiation of human health intake fractions in life cycle assessment
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - The intake fraction (iF) is the fraction of an emitted mass of chemical that is ultimately taken in by an entire population, and it is used as an indicator of human health potential impacts related to environmental chemical persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain. In chemical screening applications, the iF can be predicted using multimedia and multipathway fate and exposure models. One of the sources of iF uncertainty is the natural seasonal variability of the input parameters used in the models, i.e., the physicochemical properties of the pollutant and the landscape and exposure parameters. The objective of this article is to determine the relevance of including seasonal differentiation when assessing iFs in life cycle assessment. This was done by calculating and comparing seasonal iFs with each other and with iFs at 25 degrees?C, for both Canadian and global contexts. Two Canadian seasonal models based on the IMPACT 2002 predictive tool, and 2 models for the global context based on the USEtox consensus model were developed to calculate summer and winter iFs. Emissions into air and water and a set of 35 representative organic chemicals were considered. Partition coefficients for seasonal conditions were calculated using an integration of the van't Hoff equation. First-order degradation rate constants were calculated assuming that the rate constant doubles with each 10 degrees?C increase in temperature. For Canadian air emissions, results indicated that iFs for winter emissions could be up to 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than summer iFs or iFs calculated at 25 degrees?C. For Canadian water emissions, results showed that iFs for both summer and winter conditions were, in general, closer to each other with outliers within 1 order of magnitude to iFs calculated at 25 degrees?C. Results also indicated that seasonal variability was of lesser importance when assessing iFs within a global context. Because the ranking between chemicals was maintained, it can be concluded that seasonal variability is not relevant within a comparative context. However, this difference might be significant when comparing the magnitude of human toxicity impacts versus other impact categories contributing to human health damages.

AB  - In modern society, the search for pedagogical conditions for the successful socialization of youth is an urgent scientific problem. The result of successful socialization is a formed social competence, which is understood as an integrative personal education, including knowledge, skills, abilities, which are formed in the process of socialization and allow a person to quickly and adequately adapt in society and effectively interact with the social environment. An important component of social competence is the motivation for socially significant activity, which serves as a prevention of destructive behavior in society. The authors put forward the thesis about the need to build a comprehensive work aimed at the formation of social competence, including pedagogical support (a set of pedagogical conditions that contribute to the formation of social competence), strengthening the educational component in education and building relationships with young people. The results of a study conducted at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at Orenburg State University FSBEI of HE with the use of funds from the Orenburg Regional Palace of Children and Youth Creativity GBUDO, confirmed the hypothesis: the formation of social competence of youth will be effective when implementing a set of pedagogical conditions aimed at managing the process of socialization of youth: a coordinated space is formed (based on the use of the potential of the general and complement education), which contributes to the integration of youth in the system of public relations; pedagogical support (through the educational component) of the process of socialization of youth in a coordinated space was provided; motivation (personal meaning) for socially significant, creative activity is actualized. Personal needs, motivation, a positive attitude to work, creativity (motivational sphere) are formed due to the awareness of the personal significance of socially useful activities. The authors conclude that in the process of successful socialization of youth, the formation of social competence takes place, and the motivational sphere plays a leading role in this process. The following motives are central to motivation: the motive of success (achievement), the motive of fear (failure) and the motive of self-affirmation. Motivation for success is one of the indicators of successful socialization of youth, preventing the formation of destructive actions. Self-realization in socially significant activities contributes to the self-assertion of the individual. The motive of self-affirmation in constructive activity serves as a prevention of destructive, anti-social behavior.

AB  - This article presents a combined pollen and phytolith record of a 1.70-m sediment core from the wetlands of India Muerta (33 degrees 42' S, 53 degrees 57' W) in the lowland Pampa (grasslands) of southeastern Uruguay. Six C-14 dates and the pollen and phytolith content of the samples permitted the recognition of four distinct climatic periods between 14,850 C-14 yr B.P. and the present. The Late Pleistocene period (between ca. 14,810 and ca. 10,000 C-14 yr B.P.) was characterized by drier and cooler conditions indicated by the presence of a C3-dominated grassland. These conditions prevailed until the onset of the warmer and more humid climate of the Holocene around 945 0 C-14 yr B.P. The early Holocene (between around 10,000 and 6620 C-14 yr B.P.) was characterized by the establishment of wetlands in the region as evidenced by the formation of black peat, the increase in wetland taxa, and the replacement of C3 Pooideae by C4 Panicoideae grasses. During the mid-Holocene, around 6620 C-14 yr B.P., began a period of environmental change characterized by drier climatic conditions, which resulted in the expansion of halophytic communities in the flat, low-lying areas of the wetlands of India Muerta. About 4020 C-14 yr B.P. a massive spike of Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae coupled with a radical drop in wetland species indicates another major and more severe period of dryness. After ca. 4000 C-14 yr B.P., a decrease of halophytic species indicates the onset of more humid and stable climatic conditions, which characterized the late Holocene.
   The findings reported in this article substantially improve our knowledge of the late Glacial and Holocene climate and vegetation in the region. The data provide a detailed record of the timing and severity of mid-Holocene environmental changes in southeastern South America. Significantly, the mid-Holocene drying trend coincided with major organizational changes in settlement, subsistence, and technology of the pre-Hispanic populations in the region, which gave rise to early Formative societies. This study also represents the first combined pollen and phytolith record for southeastern South America reinforcing the utility of phytoliths as significant indicators of long-term grassland dynamics.

AB  - The replicator-mutator dynamic was originally derived to model the evolution of language, and since the model was derived in such a general manner, it has been applied to the dynamics of social behavior and decision making in multi-agent networks. For the two type population, a bifurcation point of the mutation rate was derived, displaying different long-run behaviors above and below this point. The long-run behavior would naturally be subjected to noise from the environment, however, to date, there does not exist a model that dynamically accounts for the effects of the environment. To account for the environmental impacts on the evolution of the populace, mutation rates above and below this bifurcation point are switched according to a continuous-time Markov chain. The long-run behaviors of this model are derived, showing a counterintuitive result that the majority of initial conditions will favor the dominated type.

AB  - Several studies have presented morphometric analysis as the key to understanding hydrological behavior or support tool for the assessment of natural resources and environmental risks in a river basin. The Rio Grande Basin has great socioeconomic and environmental relevance for Brazil; however, its morphometric characterization is not widely known. Therefore, we present the morphometric characteristics of the Rio Grande Basin (BHRG), from the geometric, relief, and drainage variables. Data processing was carried out using the Geographic Information System (GIS), from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The results indicate that the BHRG is of the fifth order, presenting a dendritic drainage pattern, low susceptibility to flooding under normal precipitation conditions, sinuous watercourses, and an undulating relief. In addition, the BHRG is permeable, poorly drained, and displays low capacity to generate and maintain drainage tracts. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of hydrological behavior on a river basin and support integrated water resource plans.

AB  - Many mountainous, arid and semi-arid regions sustain rural communities with cultural and socio-productive characteristics, which are adapted to the biophysical conditions of such environments, such as transhumant pastoralism from North-West Patagonia. In these contexts, it has been proposed that the urbanization process can have implications in the sedentarization of the communities, in the ecological and agronomic fragmentation of landscapes and in its cultural practices. These changes entail social, productive and ecological consequences. The aim of this study was to analyze if there is evidence of an urbanization process in Northern Neuquen, Argentina, its spatial and temporal magnitude as measured by demographic and educational indicators, and its association with current regional infrastructure levels. Results are discussed in the light of proposals for territorial development and governance and their implications for transhumant pastoral activity.

AB  - Water security is related closely to ecological, environmental, economic, social, and political problems, and may possibly even affect national security. The problem is especially important in arid inland watersheds. In this paper, we assess the water resources security of three watersheds in the Hexi Corridor (Northwest China) using a multi-level, multi-target, analytical hierarchy process approach. We constructed an assessment system based on the current situation and future development of the region's water resources in the context of the society, economy, and environment of these inland watersheds. The assessment used 21 indicators that describe the ratio of water supply to demand, the ecological environment, food security, drinking-water security, disaster control capacity, water resources management, and economic conditions. The level of the water resources security was highest in the Shulehe watershed, followed by the Heihe watershed and the Shiyanghe watershed. Strategies to promote water security for all three watersheds are discussed.

AB  - The Verwey transition in magnetite is a crystallographic phase transition occurring in the temperature range 80-125 K and depends on stoichiometry and cation substitution, which may in turn serve as an indicator of the conditions under which magnetite was formed or altered in nature. We have analysed the distribution of Verwey transition temperatures (T-v) in a large set of samples (N = 1110) from a wide variety of rocks, sediments, and other natural and synthetic materials containing magnetite, mined from the database of the Institute for Rock Magnetism and from published studies. The analysis is restricted to measurements of remanence while warming through the transition from which T-v was determined by the derivative method. Our analysis showed that the T-v distribution exhibited a generally bimodal distribution of Verwey transition temperatures, both for the entire data set and for almost all of the lithological subsets. There is a sharp peak for values in the range 118-120 K, and a broad, relatively flat or polymodal distribution from about 98 to 118 K. The upper end of the distribution was sharp, with only a few values exceeding 124 K, and the tail on the lower end extended down to about 80 K. Virtually all of the sample types exhibited polymodal distributions, almost always with one peak near 120 K, and with one or more additional peaks at lower temperatures. Biogenic magnetites produced by magnetotactic bacteria had the lowest modal value of T-v (100 K). Loesses (103.5 K) and igneous extrusives (102.5 K) also had low modal transition temperatures and distributions with dominant low-T-v peaks. Lithological groups with the highest modal transition temperatures were modern soils (119.5 K), silicate minerals with exsolved magnetite (119 K) and sedimentary rocks (119 K). Numerical experiments confirmed that the derivative method for the determination of T-v was reasonably robust and that the observed distributions cannot be explained as an artefact related to the determination of T-v from individual thermomagnetic runs but rather is a general characteristic of natural magnetites. The results provide context for studies that interpret T-v in particular samples in terms of natural processes or conditions during formation or alteration of magnetite.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive demands maintaining or attaining good quality of the water bodies within the territory of the member states, which is strictly connected with the planning process of the water resources management. The water management plans have to include the assessment of the water body quality condition and further propose the actions to be implemented to enhance the quality of the European water resources. In order to answer the question of whether there is a risk of failure to achieve the WFD objectives, an assessment of the current status should be carried out, followed by an estimate on how likely achieving a good water status in the future is. One of the most popular valorization methods used for the water quality assessment is the River Habitat Survey (RHS) that enables the determination of two indicators, which summarize many single basic parameters, to assess the hydromorphological properties of rivers in a numerical form. Two indices are used most widely: Habitat Modification Score (HMS), which defines the range of transformations in river morphology and Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA), which is based on the presence and diversity of natural elements of the stream and river valley. The application of the above mentioned numerical indices allows calculating the hydromorphological quality status of the studied section following the expectations of the Water Framework Directive. Five ecological classes are distinguished. RHS is described as objective, suitable for statistical analyses, multidirectional and applicative method. However. the final valorization results are strongly affected by the presence of vegetation. which varies during the whole year. This contribution describes the analysis and comparison of the RHS results over the four seasons, namely: spring, summer, autumn and winter of three small lowland rivers in Poland (Zielawa, Zwolenka and Zagozdzonka). It was unequivocally found that the value of the HQA parameter varied during the seasons, and the changes in its numerical value mainly depended on the condition, development level of vegetation, and the number of species observed. It was demonstrated that depending on the season, the Habitat Quality Assessment variation could change in about 5% of the maximal value, which could lead to a step from one hydromorphological class to another.

AB  - Changes in species diversity following volcanic eruptions have been studied extensively, but our knowledge on functional diversity and community assembly under such conditions is very limited. Here, we study the processes following the destruction of vegetation after a volcanic eruption. Specifically, we investigate (1) the temporal patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity over time since a previous eruption (alpha diversity) and beta diversity, (2) the temporal patterns of 26 individual traits (vegetative characteristics, plant taxa ecological preferences, and regenerative characteristics) providing more detailed information on species strategies at the initial and later stages of succession, and (3) the processes driving species assembly and whether they changed over time since the eruption an eruption. We analyzed data recorded during five floristic censuses that took place between 1911 and 2011, calculated alpha and beta facets of taxonomic and functional diversity and examined how community structure changed over time, using 26 functional characteristics, based on their ability to discern primary from later colonists, including longevity, growth form, Ellenberg's indicator values, seed production and weight, flower size and sex, pollination type, and dispersal mode. Null model analysis was used to test whether the observed functional diversity deviates from random expectations. Alpha diversity, both taxonomic and functional, increased over time after an eruption, while beta diversity did not display a clear trend. This finding indicates that mainly abiotic processes determine species assembly over time after an eruption (at least for the time span studied here), contrary to theoretical expectations. It is most interesting that, simultaneously, some aspects of diversity indicated the effect of biotic interactions (facilitation and competition) on the assembly of species a few years after an eruption. This finding implies a legacy effect, since a high percentage of perennial species was noticed in the assemblage right after the eruption, as well as the effect of the harsh environmental conditions on the assembly of the plant communities. In conclusion, our results indicate the role of legacy effects in succession (most probably through the survival of underground plant parts) and underline the importance of disturbance history in providing the context needed for understanding effects of past events on succession.

AB  - The magur catfish (Clarias magur) is a facultative air-breather and regularly encounters with various environmental changes along with exposure to various bacterial pathogens in its natural habitats. Occurrence of various biochemical adaptational strategies related to nitrogen metabolism in magur catfish is already known. The present investigation aimed at determining the possible induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) production in this catfish while challenging with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) treatment, and also to determine the involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) in induction of inos gene. Intra-peritoneal injection of LPS led to more production and accumulation of NO in different body tissues of magur catfish as a consequence of induction of iNOS activity. The induction of iNOS activity was associated with the induction of inos gene as evidenced by more expression of inos mRNA and more abundance of iNOS enzyme protein in different tissues of magur catfish with certain variations in zonal specific expression patterns. Similar observations related to more production of NO and induction of inos gene were also made when the isolated hepatocytes were treated with LPS in vitro condition. LPS treatment also led to activation of NF kappa B in hepatic cells. However, in presence of a specific inhibitor of NF kappa B, the LPS-mediated induction of inos gene and extra production of NO were almost blocked, thereby suggesting that the induction of inos gene due to LPS treatment was mediated via the NF kappa B in magur catfish. It is hypothesized that the induction of iNOS activity, and more synthesis and accumulation of NO could serve as indicators to determine the pathophysiological conditions of the fish living in bacterial contaminated water bodies. Further, it can be contemplated that more synthesis of NO through iNOS enzyme probably serves as an important pharmacological tool against fish pathogen and also plays an important role in host defense mechanisms in this unique group of magur catfish.

AB  - The evergreen holm oak Quercus ilex L. is the most representative tree in Mediterranean forests. Accurate estimation of the limiting factors of photosynthesis for Q. ilex and the prediction of ecosystem water-use efficiency by mechanistic models can be achieved only by establishing whether this species shows heterogenic stomatal aperture, and, if so, the circumstances in which this occurs. Here, we collected gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence data in Q. ilex leaves from a nursery to measure the effects of stomatal oscillations on PSII quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) under water stress. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was used as an integrative indicator of the degree of water stress. Images of chlorophyll fluorescence showed heterogeneous Phi(PSII) when g(s) was < 50 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1), representative of severe drought and corresponding to a container capacity < 45%. Stomatal patchiness was related to a coefficient of variation (CV) of Phi(PSII) values > 2.5%. A parallel study in the forest confirmed heterogeneous Phi(PSII) values in leaves in response to declining water availability. Three kinds of Q. ilex individuals were distinguished: those resprouting after a clear-cut (resprouts, R); intact individuals growing in the same clear-cut area as resprouts (controls, C); and intact individuals in a nearby, undisturbed area (forest controls, CF). Patchiness increased in C and CF in response to increasing drought from early May to late July, whereas in R, Phi(PSII) values were maintained as a result of their improved water relations since the pre-existing roots were associated with a smaller aerial biomass. Patchiness was related to a % CV of Phi(PSII) values > 4 and associated in the summer with mean g(s) values of 30 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1). Under milder drought in spring, Phi(PSII) patchiness was less strictly related to g(s) variations, pointing to biochemical limitants of photosynthesis. The occurrence of heterogenic photosynthesis caused by patchy stomatal closure in Q. ilex during severe drought should be taken into account in ecosystem modelling in which harsher water stress conditions associated with climate change are predicted.

AB  - A multi-proxy study involving palynology, phytoliths, sedimentology, clay mineralogy, carbon isotopes and magnetic mineralogy was carried out on Wadhwana Lake sediments from sub-humid zone of mainland Gujarat to determine the mid-Holocene climatic fluctuations, and its possible impact on the Harappan culture. The 1.03 m sediment profile of Wadhwana Lake shows five paleoclimatic phases. The study reveals high lake stand during Phase I (similar to 7500-5560 cal yr BP). A considerable cool and moist climatic condition during Phase I is inferred due to the presence of pollen belonging to wet evergreen taxa and high phytolith climatic index 'lc'. Later part of Phase I show gradual replacement of evergreen to deciduous pollen taxa, decrease in Ic value and dominance of smectite over kaolinite, indicating a reduction in wet climatic condition due to decline in the precipitation and prevalence of seasonally dry climate. However, a large variety of Madhuca, Meliaceae, Asteraceae pollen taxa, abundant fresh-water algae Chrozophora and Ceralia pollen in this period provides evidence of intensified arboriculture and agricultural activity. Low lake level and dry climate have been documented during Phase II (5560 to similar to 4255 cal yr BP) and are synchronous with the lake records of western Indian region. High values of phytolith aridity index Iph, high primary minerals, increase in the delta C-13 values provide evidence for excessive dry climatic conditions at similar to 4255 cal yr BP. Phase III shows a gradual strengthening of SW monsoon after similar to 3500 cal yr BP. Phase IV shows a short pulse of dry climatic conditions (similar to 3238 to similar to 2709 cal yr BP) followed by somewhat similar to present day climate for Phase V. The study concludes that onset of dry climate after 5500 cal yr BP is a regionally spread synchronous event that has been documented in several lake records of western India. It is surmised that the urbanization in Harappan civilization in North West India was coincident with the initial phase of declining rainfall of mid-Holocene. The emergence of cultural complexity of Harappan civilization should be seen as an initial adaptation to earliest phase of environmental deterioration and its subsequent decline is probably linked with the changing seasonality pattern and excessive dry climate of later phase (similar to 4200-4255 cal yr BP) of mid-Holocene.

AB  - The restrictions imposed on the use of formaldehyde in wood panel adhesives have been the driving force behind the development of formaldehyde-free resins for the manufacture of wood products. Considering as a boundary condition the idea that the use of fossil-based raw materials should be replaced by biological options, there is growing interest in the environmental assessment of different alternatives for soy-based adhesives, as possible options to replace commonly used synthetic resins. This report includes the environmental profiles of soy-based adhesives taking into account the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. In addition, in order to increase their potential to replace synthetic resins, a sensitivity analysis of the main contributors to environmental damage was performed, thus giving an open guide for further research and improvement. This study aims to provide innovative alternatives and new trends in the field of environmentally friendly bio-adhesives for the wood panel industry.

AB  - We examined the annual number of pups born, pup mortality, and pup weights of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) at San Miguel Island, California, and related them to large and small-scale oceanographic indices in the central California Current System (CCS) between 1997 and 2011. Annual variability in the number of pups born and pup mortality was best explained by the muditvariate ENSO index (MEI) that tracks the El Nino/La Nina cycle. Annual variability in average pup weights was best explained by a sea surface temperature anomaly index (SSTA); average pup weights were lower in years when the SSTA was greater than 1 degrees C above normal. We demonstrated that California sea lions are sensitive to large and small-scale changes in ocean conditions through changes in their reproductive success, pup growth, and pup mortality. Therefore, California sea lions are an ideal indicator species for the IEA of the CCS.

AB  - A series of recent studies have investigated the development, cold tolerance and winter field survival of glasshouse biological control agents that are non-native to the UK: Neoseiulus californicus, Macrolophus caliginosus, Delphastus catalinae, Eretmocerus eremicus and Typhlodromips montdorensis. The combined data sets for these species have been analysed to identify laboratory indices of cold tolerance that correlate with the duration of survival under winter field conditions. A strong correlation was found between the laboratory LTime(50) at 5 degrees C and maximum field survival time. Both N. californicus and M. caliginosus survived substantially longer in the laboratory and in the field than the other species. It is suggested that the LTime(50) at 5 degrees C may provide a reliable 'first stage' screen of establishment potential for candidate non-native biological control agents in the UK.

AB  - Thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) of shallow heavy oil by cyclic steam injection or steamflooding is a commercial technology that has evolved over the past 30 years. Although TEOR may have adverse effects on the environment, these can be mitigated by careful management of standard oil field practices during TEOR process implementation. Poorly plugged old wells, natural fracturing, vertical communication between oil reservoirs and underground aquifers, and impact on air quality are a few of the environmental factors under consideration that may limit production of the midcontinent heavy oil resources. Air quality conditions and legislation are compared to those in California, which has air quality standards that are more stringent than those of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Early in the life of determining the feasibility of TEOR for a specific site, the combined resources of engineering, geological and economic feasibility, process design, and environmental assessment must be coordinated to determine the environmental impact of process implementation.

AB  - This study finds that industries and other permit requiring activities (PRA) exert a significant cumulative pressure on 20 out of 34 examined specifications to the Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives (EQO), affecting the fulfilment of 12 out of 16 of these EQOs. PRA undergo thorough examination before receiving permits, and the permits come with detailed conditions. The permitting process is hence an important opportunity to contribute to the achievement of the EQOs. However, this opportunity has so far not been employed to any great extent since the quantitative significance of environmental impact from PRA on the national EQOs has not been well-known or expressed. We suggest that quantification of activities that can be regulated by environmental permitting may be of importance for the achievement of other instances of management by objectives in general, such as the global sustainable development goals and the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the ecological status regulated by the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - For more than 70 years, Hutchinson's concept of the fundamental niche has guided ecological research. Hutchinson envisioned the niche as a multidimensional hypervolume relating the fitness of an organism to relevant environmental factors. Here, we challenge the utility of the concept to modern ecologists, based on its inability to account for environmental variation and phenotypic plasticity. We have ample evidence that the frequency, duration, and sequence of abiotic stress influence the survivorship and performance of organisms. Recent work shows that organisms also respond to the spatial configuration of abiotic conditions. Spatiotemporal variation of the environment interacts with the genotype to generate a unique phenotype at each life stage. These dynamics cannot be captured adequately by a multidimensional hypervolume. Therefore, we recommend that ecologists abandon the niche as a tool for predicting the persistence of species and embrace mechanistic models of population growth that incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.

AB  - Policy-making to protect threatened species implies dealing with uncertainty and ignorance. Conservation management of the Eastern gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population through the regulation of whale watching in the lagoon Ojo de Liebre, Mexico, is a useful example of policy-making challenged by lack of scientific knowledge regarding the negative long-term effects of whale watching. We present a pragmatic approach to provide Mexican authorities the technical information they need to justify the establishment of a maximum number of boats under conditions of deep uncertainty. Operationally, our approach combines system dynamics modelling, to simulate the boats' impact on the breeding habitat, with ecological risk assessment, to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold, which is associated to a risk of severely reducing the gray whale abundance in the lagoon. Thus, our approach addresses the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of boats to protect threatened species.

AB  - Coastal North Carolina, USA, has experienced three extreme tropical cyclone-driven flood events since 1999, causing catastrophic human impacts from flooding and leading to major alterations of water quality, biogeochemistry, and ecological conditions. The apparent increased frequency and magnitudes of such events led us to question whether this is just coincidence or whether we are witnessing a regime shift in tropical cyclone flooding and associated ecosystem impacts. Examination of continuous rainfall records for coastal NC since 1898 reveals a period of unprecedentedly high precipitation since the late-1990's, and a trend toward increasingly high precipitation associated with tropical cyclones over the last 120 years. We posit that this trend, which is consistent with observations elsewhere, represents a recent regime shift with major ramifications for hydrology, carbon and nutrient cycling, water and habitat quality and resourcefulness of Mid-Atlantic and possibly other USA coastal regions.

AB  - The study aims to assess the identification of the specific species of plants for selection of certain plant species and utilization of selected one's in experimental biomonitoring studies. The purpose of the proposed study was to develop and apply new techniques, methods and methodologies for air quality assessing in the context of climate change and updating of international environmental studys. The novelty of the active biomonitoring method using plants is an innovative research area for the National Research and Development Institute for Industrial Ecology in terms of the use of sentinel species. The first stage research activity was aimed to identify plant species with specific response to certain environmental pollutants, in our case, ozone. By exposing higher plants (from the Solanaceae family) to various environmental conditions, a direct impact measurement of ground-level ozone was considered - as an indicator of environmental pollution (air) - there was a significant difference relationship between soil level ozone variation and foliar necrosis.

AB  - Tourism is mostly concentrated in protected areas. The highest level of protection of nature and landscape represents national parks, which are important biosphere reserves. Tourism in national parks has to be developed with a thoughtful and considerate approach to the environment and in accordance with sustainable development values, which are based on economic, social and environmental principles. The object of the study is the Tatra National Park, whose task is to preserve and protect the original conditions of the natural environment in the protected landscape and utilise its potential for recreational, medical and sport purposes. In the last decade, the territory of the national park has been undergoing major innovations associated with the construction and improvement of tourism facilities. The aim of the article is to examine the sustainability of tourism in the Tatra National Park based on indicators developed by UNWTO (2004) in terms of visitors with an emphasis on social and environmental aspects.

AB  - The dynamic monitoring system continuously performs the monitoring of physicochemical quality indicators of water quality in investigated areas. In case of ecological risk due to accidental pollution situations, the system alarms in real time the decision factors for the diminution of the environmental impacts and other negative effects. The distributed networks of the system are composed of floatable structures of Buoys Monitoring (BM) type, autonomous and adaptable to the environmental conditions specific to a continental climate. They are able to work with reduced maintenance in isolated locations. The BM floatable structure incorporates the sensors and the hardware-software system of data acquisition, processing and transmission. So equipped, BM becomes operational instrument in the infrastructure of the networks of surface waters quality monitoring. The BM model developed allows the continuous in situ evaluation of the health status of the monitored surface water with the scope of warning in case of ecological risk.

AB  - Sustainable development indicators (SDIs) may have good potential to bring environmental concerns to the policy agenda. However, different understandings of sustainability, definitions of SDIs and measurement procedures may give completely different assessments of whether society moves towards a sustainable development path or not. Compilation of statistical indicators for environmental change and sustainability comprises not only a selection of facts in some technical sense, as the choices involved are conditioned by societal interests and implicit values embedded in the data-generating processes. This implies that statistical offices cannot ignore the role that values play in the generation of accurate data sets. To give an assessment of sustainability, we need not only to address historical trends but also to evaluate policy choices made today and how they may influence future development. SDI sets should be evaluated according to how they contribute to deliberation on sustainability in learning processes involving participants beyond the sciencepolicy interface.

AB  - The properties of nanoparticles and their increased use have raised concerns about their possible harmful effects within the environment. Most studies on their effects have been in aqueous systems. Here we investigated the effect of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles on wheat growth and soil enzyme activities under field conditions. Both of the nanoparticles reduced the biomass of wheat. The TiO2 nanoparticles were retained in the soil for long periods and primarily adhered to cell walls of wheat. The ZnO nanoparticles dissolved in the soil, thereby enhancing the uptake of toxic Zn by wheat. The nanoparticles also induced significant changes in soil enzyme activities, which are bioindicators of soil quality and health. Soil protease, catalase, and peroxidase activities were inhibited in the presence of the nanoparticles; urease activity was unaffected. The nanoparticles themselves or their dissolved ions were clearly toxic for the soil ecosystem.

KW  - chlorine free ecological disinfectant
KW  - disinfection of drinking water
KW  - disinfection of treated wastewaters
AB  - This paper presents the importance of using the chlorine free disinfectants in the disinfection of drinking water and treated wastewaters. SANOSIL (R) SUPER 25 is an ecological disinfectant, it is chlorine free, and it has a health approval according to European Regulations, which ensure a high quality drinking water, without toxic secondary components, and an effluent of treated wastewaters, which do not alter the quality of surface waters.
   In this context, SANOSIL (R) SUPER 25 is highly applicable for the drinking water supply of industrial units, that have their own sources (drilled wells), and for the disinfection and natural recirculation of certain domestic and industrial treated wastewaters with a flow up to 1000 m(3)/day.
   Because the disinfection with SANOSIL (R) SUPER 25 has multiple advantages, it is recommend that the "free residual chlorine" indicator (parameter) should not be a mandatory condition to prove that certain water has been disinfected.

AB  - A biological process with activated sludge is used for the treatment of urban and industrial waste water produced by the Chelghoum Mid city. This station plays an important role within the framework of environmental protection.
   Our study is on one hand intended to estimate the quality of the untreated water and the water at various stages of treatment (screening, grit and oil separation, biological treatment and settling), and on the other hand to verify the efficiency of the station by considering the volume of muds indicator.
   According to the obtained results, we conclude that the pH and the dissolved oxygen meet the standards. What is more, an important decrease of the organic matter represented by the COD and BOD5 is to be noted. The experiments conducted to verify the settling. by measuring the volume of muds indicator, showed that the settling is made in proper conditions, assured by controlling this indicator regularly.

AB  - Subsidies linked to production have been classified as environmentally harmful by the OECD. A core element of the EU 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is to decouple income support from production. This paper estimates the environmental consequences of this policy reform. An agricultural sector model using a modified version of the positive mathematical programming method depicts the complex natural, structural, and political relationships of Austrian farming. Changes in management measures can be analyzed with respect to their environmental effects by using appropriate indicators. Simulation results show that the 2003 CAP reform will reduce the average cost of production, and may improve environmental conditions regarding soil, water, and greenhouse gases when compared to a scenario without reform. Thus, the new CAP is likely to bring about outcomes which the previous reform (Agenda 2000) promised but did not deliver. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill exposed common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Barataria Bay, Louisiana to heavy oiling that caused increased mortality and chronic disease and impaired reproduction in surviving dolphins. We conducted photographic surveys and veterinary assessments in the decade following the spill. We assigned a prognostic score (good, fair, guarded, poor, or grave) for each dolphin to provide a single integrated indicator of overall health, and we examined temporal trends in prognostic scores. We used expert elicitation to quantify the implications of trends for the proportion of the dolphins that would recover within their lifetime. We integrated expert elicitation, along with other new information, in a population dynamics model to predict the effects of observed health trends on demography. We compared the resulting population trajectory with that predicted under baseline (no spill) conditions. Disease conditions persisted and have recently worsened in dolphins that were presumably exposed to DWH oil: 78% of those assessed in 2018 had a guarded, poor, or grave prognosis. Dolphins born after the spill were in better health. We estimated that the population declined by 45% (95% CI 14-74) relative to baseline and will take 35 years (95% CI 18-67) to recover to 95% of baseline numbers. The sum of annual differences between baseline and injured population sizes (i.e., the lost cetacean years) was 30,993 (95% CI 6607-94,148). The population is currently at a minimum point in its recovery trajectory and is vulnerable to emerging threats, including planned ecosystem restoration efforts that are likely to be detrimental to the dolphins' survival. Our modeling framework demonstrates an approach for integrating different sources and types of data, highlights the utility of expert elicitation for indeterminable input parameters, and emphasizes the importance of considering and monitoring long-term health of long-lived species subject to environmental disasters. Article impact statement: Oil spills can have long-term consequences for the health of long-lived species; thus, effective restoration and monitoring are needed.

AB  - Groundwater is the main resource for irrigation and drinking supply in most parts of Syria, as for most Mediterranean countries, however this resource suffers from mismanagement. In the study area (northeast of Mt. Hermon), the lack of information makes water management in this area extremely difficult. Assessing groundwater pollution risk is the most essential issue for water resources management, especially in the regions where complex interaction between climate, geology, geomorphology, hydrogeology, water scarcity and water resource mismanagement exist. This complexity leads to significant complication in determining pollution risk of studied system. In the present work, we adopted an integrative approach to assess groundwater pollution risk in the study area. This methodology is based on the analysis of hydrogeological characteristics of aquifer systems and the available information about socioeconomic context and physiochemical groundwater conditions that might affect this system. This approach allowed us to delineate the groundwater pollution risk map based on the analysis of concerning parameters/indicators. The degree of risk was assessed as the sum and average of rating of these parameters and indicators for each subarea. Typically, very high pollution risk index was identified over the Quaternary/Neogene horizon, i.e., shallow and unconfined aquifer and in the lower part of Jurassic aquifer. In these two parts, the majority of anthropogenic activities are concentrated. Low pollution risk index was found for the outcropping of low permeable Quaternary basalt at the Southern part of the study area. A moderate pollution index was identified for the low/moderate permeability of silt, clay and marly limestone-rich horizons of the major part of Neogene aquifer outside of the intersected zones with Quaternary aquifer and for the Paleogene formations. The spatial analysis shows that about 50% of the study area is characterized as being at very high and high pollution risk index. Hence, the overall natural protective capacity of this area is still poor. This study demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed approach to assess groundwater pollution risk in local complex aquifer system characterized by lack of information and data in order to reduce the risk of future groundwater pollution.

TI  - An assessment of the geochemical impacts of greenfields mining projects in South Africa on both sides of the mine drainage pH divide - A geochemical modelling approach
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - WITWATERSRAND BASIN
AB  - Environmental geochemical risk assessments have become a routine practice in the environmental evaluation of most greenfields and brownfields mining and mineral processing related projects. Brownfields projects, e.g. extension of an existing tailings facility, usually have timeseries monitoring data which can be used in the risk assessment. The greenfields scenario is more complex in that very little, if any, existing data is available, thus often requiring follow-up studies.
   In terms of the assessment of environmental geochemical risks from leachate from mineral waste facilities, there is, at least in some circles, a prevailing misconception that acidic conditions cause environmental impacts due to leaching of contaminants from mineral waste facilities, while neutral to alkaline conditions does not.
   This paper is aimed at in identifying a decision strategy to guide project managers in determining when follow-up studies specifically for greenfields mineral waste generating projects is warranted and also addresses the notion of pH being an indicator of risk. These two aspects will be addressed by applying numeric geochemical modelling, which takes geochemical processes over time into account to determine likely impacts from mineral waste Tailings from two types of ore will be considered. The first is an acid producing tailings material from the Witwatersrand gold mining basin, while the second is tailings material from a Fluorspar mining project (non-acid producing Both types of tailings contain iron sulphides which have the potential to produce acid mine drainage. The difference is the host geology of the two deposit types, with the Fluorspar ore associated with and located in dolomitic lithologies. Even though the Fluorspar tailings is likely to generate a neutral leachate from the tailings, it also contains SO42- and As in concentrations exceeding regulatory guideline values. This demonstrates that even though a mineral waste facility may have circum neutral pH values, it may still contained potentially hazardous dissolved components in excess of regulatory guideline values. The Fluorspar tailings material also contains F- below, but within 20%, of the regulatory guideline value, implying that follow-up studies may be warranted. This can be done relatively inexpensively with potential significant financial implications of the project net present value. Both of these types of tailings material are associated with greenfields projects.

AB  - This work examines the performance of a residential building-integrated micro-cogeneration system during the winter by means of a whole building simulation software. The cogeneration unit was coupled with a multi-family house composed of three floors, compliant with the transmittance values of both walls and windows suggested by the Italian Law; a stratified combined tank for both heating purposes and domestic hot water production was also used for storing heat. Simulations were performed considering the transient nature of the building and occupant driven loads as well as the part-load characteristics of the cogeneration unit.
   This system was described in detail and analyzed from an energy point of view in the companion paper. In this paper the simulation results were evaluated in terms of both carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and operating costs; detailed analyses were performed in order to estimate the influence of the most significant boundary conditions on both environmental and economic performance of the proposed system: in particular, three volumes of the hot water storage, four climatic zones corresponding to four Italian cities, two electric demand profiles, as well as two control strategies micro-cogeneration unit were considered. The assessment of environmental impact was performed by using the standard emission factors approach, neglecting the effects of local pollutants. The operating costs due to both natural gas and electric energy consumption were evaluated in detail, whereas both the capital and maintenance costs were neglected; the revenue from selling the electric energy surplus was also taken into account.
   The performance of the proposed system was also compared with those of a conventional system composed of a natural gas-fired boiler (for thermal energy production) and a power plant mix connected to the national central grid (for electricity production) in order to assess its suitability in comparison to the systems based on separate energy production from both environmental and economic point of views.
   The analyses were carried out with respect to the Italian scenario, by considering the most meaningful indexes suggested in current literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - On the French marine shelf, marine aggregates are currently dredged by trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHD), without screening, with an overflow process, with or against currents. In the framework of the Groupement d'Interet Scientifique (GIS) Suivi des Impacts de l'Extraction de Granulats Marins (SIEGMA), the dynamics of the turbid plume formed by the overflow was studied at an experimental dredging site (0.6 km(2)), located in the Bay of Seine (eastern English Channel), a macrotidal environment where the seabed is composed of sandy gravel. An original field strategy based on Lagrangian monitoring, using the back-scattered signal of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry (LISST) measurements, water samples, and aerial photographs, has shown good results in describing suspended sediment concentration (SSC) dynamics from a turbid plume. The behaviour of suspended sediment has been studied, for the first time, to our knowledge, from their release at the dredger overflow to their deposition on the seabed. A fluid mixture, overflowed from the TSHD, with a mean concentration of 6 g L-1 of mineral and organic silty sands, induces the formation of a turbid plume at the rear of the TSHD, with an immediate dilution effect about 10-100 on SSC. Then, the SSC decreases through the process of lateral dispersion and sedimentation until the plume disappear in 2 hours. Evolution of the plume characteristics (SSC, particle size and nature, geometry) makes it possible to quantify the processes involved: dilution, advection, dispersion, and settling. The passive and dynamic behaviours of the plume are analysed. Extensions of deposits are calculated for spring tide conditions: 800 m for sand and 6.5 km for silt. This study has been conducted in macrotidal and specific dredging conditions (orientation of the dredging tracks against currents, dredger speed, loading capacity, overflow type), whose effects on plume dispersion have been quantified. Indicators relative to the effect of the plume on the water column (I/R) and to the plume duration (T1.25SSC) are proposed.

AB  - Total mercury (THg) concentrations in streams draining cultivated watersheds in Minnesota, USA are strongly correlated with total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations, varying widely in response to precipitation-driven inputs of soil-derived suspended sediments. Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in these waterways have not been studied, and little is known about mercury uptake mechanisms in resident fish populations. To begin to identify factors influencing MeHg concentrations and loadings in these streams, we measured THg and MeHg concentrations in unfiltered whole water samples from the Minnesota River and two of its major tributaries, the Blue Earth and Le Sueur Rivers. Land use in the watersheds of these rivers is over 90% row-crop agriculture, and extensive artificial drainage systems deliver runoff and associated solids quickly to local streams and rivers. THg concentrations were elevated (>10 ng/l) during much of Spring 2000 and part of the summer when runoff from precipitation events increased stream discharge and carried soil materials into the streams. Reduced precipitation resulted in low flow conditions from August through October, and THg concentrations decreased to <4.0 ng/l in all three rivers. MeHg concentrations in the Le Sueur River ranged from 0.07 to 0.42 ng/l between June and December. Higher MeHg concentrations (>0.2 ng/l) were measured during summer months when THg and TSS concentrations were high after precipitation events. Elevated MeHg concentrations were also observed in late October after leaf litter inputs. Conditions on the Blue Earth River were different, with elevated MeHg concentrations (>0.5 ng/l) observed during low flow in August and September. These higher concentrations coincided with a period of enhanced microbial growth stimulated by high late-summer temperatures. A late-October increase in MeHg concentration attributed to leaf litter inputs was also observed in this river. MeHg concentration trends in the Minnesota River were similar to those in the Blue Earth River. Indicators of biological productivity (chlorophyll a, volatile suspended solids, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen) were higher in the Blue Earth and Minnesota Rivers compared to the Le Sueur River, which may signal a connection between higher biological activity and increased MeHg concentrations.

AB  - The main aim of the paper was a visual comparison of lichen distribution with urban environmental factors. This paper presents a cartographic method for representing the spatial distribution of anthropogenic and natural factors in atmospheric air pollution and prevalent elements of the natural environment and their correlation to occurrences of two selected lichen species - the acidophilous Hypogymnia physodes and the nitrophilous Xanthoria parietina in the area of Torun (Central Poland). Lichens are a good indicator of changes in habitat conditions. Analyses of the occurrence of lichens in Torun were conducted for data covering a period of more than 60 years. A choropleth map method (a square tile grid map) was used, based on a grid of 144 one-kilometre squares (ATPOL). An inventory of taxa was made in 137 squares (localities). This recorded the type of substrate and abundance (extent) of occurrence.

AB  - Natural forest, oil palm and rubber plantations are economically and environmentally important for Peninsular Malaysia. The present study analysed four years of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data to develop spectral indices of vegetation, water availability and moisture stress for the study area. The indices - the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalised Difference Water Index and the Moisture Stress Index - were applied to the three different habitats to monitor drought and develop a Malaysia Southwest Monsoon (M-SWM) classification. By integrating indicators of the Southwest Monsoon, the Standard Precipitation Index, mean precipitation and temperature and spectral indices correlation analysis, M-SWM classification showed greater sensitivity to drought conditions than any of the individual indicators alone. The results also found that July is the driest month; it was the only period classified as 'Very Dry' based on the M-SWM.

AB  - Double-porosity is an important characteristic of microstructure in a large range of geomaterials. It designs porous media with connected fissures/fractures or aggregated soils. The origin of double-porosity can be natural or/and it can result from mechanical, chemical or biological damage. The presence of double-porosity can significantly affect the behaviour of geomaterials. In this paper we provide an experimental evidence of the double-porosity effects by performing laboratory experiments. Series of tracer dispersion experiments (in saturated and unsaturated steady-state water flow conditions) in a physical model of double-porosity geomaterial were carried out. For the comparative purposes, experiments of the same type were also performed in a singleporosity model medium. The results clearly showed that the double-porosity microstructure leads to the non-Fickian behaviour of the tracer (early breakthrough and long tail) in both saturated and unsaturated cases.

AB  - Regulation of an intracellular acidic environment plays a pivotal role in biological processes and functions. However, spatiotemporal analysis of the acidification in complex tissues of living subjects persists as an important challenge. We developed a photo-inactivatable bioluminescent indicator, based on a combination of luciferase-fragment complementation and a photoreaction of a light, oxygen, and voltage domain from Avena sativa Phototropin1 (LOV2), to visualize temporally dynamic acidification in living tissue samples. Bioluminescence of the indicator diminished upon light irradiation and it recovered gradually in the dark state thereafter. The recovery rate was remarkably sensitive to pH changes but unsusceptible to fluctuation of luciferin or ATP concentrations. Bioluminescence imaging, taken as an index of the recovery rates, enabled long-time recording of acidification in apoptotic and autophagous processes in a cell population and an ischemic condition in living mice. This technology using the indicator is widely applicable to sense organelle-specific acidic changes in target biological tissues.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry levels were measured in fourth-instar Chironomus riparius larvae collected from various sampling sites in Galicia ( northwest Spain) subjected to different types and degrees of stress. Specifically, we selected sites with contamination of anthropogenic origin, ranging from urban and industrial sewages to organic wastes, as well as two sites without chemical contamination, but with marked diurnal variations in their physicochemical conditions. Fluctuating asymmetry levels were determined for various structures of the head capsule ( antennal segment I length, antennal segment II length, mentum width, and number of pecten epipharyngis teeth). The results obtained group the sampling sites in a similar way to other measures of stress. In particular, grouping resulted to be similar to that obtained after analysis of head capsule deformities. Moreover, results of our work are consistent with the hypothesis that some characters may possibly be useful indicators of specific types of stress.

AB  - In order to study the financial and economic returns and the stability of grain prodution in the multicropping system using cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and corn Zea mays (L.), several agroeconomic indicators were estimated. Crop yields were affected by planting densities, both in the single and mixed cropping systems. The results of the analysis indicated two alternatives of multicropping with higher returns with production stabilities: the treatment with 10.000 plants/ha of the IPA 201 cowpea x 30.000 plants/ha of corn in the ecological region of Pamamirim; and, the tratment with 12.500 plants/ha of the IPA 202 cowpea x 37.500 plants/ha of corn in the environmental conditions of Serra Talhada. Among the agroeconomic indicators, the marginal net return (RLMa) and the marginal production costs (CMaP) were shown to be the most efficient in the evalution of the multicropping agroecosystem in relation to the single cropping from the financial and-economic point of view.

AB  - To avoid killing day-old male chicks, one possibility is to keep dual-purpose chicken strains. Here, the hens were kept for egg production, and the roosters were kept for meat production. Both sexes had moderate performances compared to the respective hybrid chicken strains. However, until now, little has been known about whether male dual-purpose chickens may profit from enrichment in the environment in which broiler chickens are raised under conventional conditions. This study aims to further investigate the suitability of elevated structures for dual-purpose chickens (Lohmann Dual) with moderate growth and for fast-growing male broiler chickens (Ross 308). In two consecutive trials, we kept 686 Ross and 672 Dual chickens in 24 compartments (2 trials x 2 strains x 6 compartments). Half of the compartments were equipped with elevated grid platforms at a height of 50 cm (enriched group). In the other half of the compartments, no platforms were installed (control group). We analyzed the usage of the elevated platforms by scan sampling and assessed animal-based (walking ability, plumage cleanliness, and foot health) and management-based (litter quality) indicators. Both strains showed increasing use of the elevated platforms from the first week of life onwards. However, the fast-growing chickens used the elevated platform less than the slow-growing chickens. At the end of the fattening period, the birds used the elevated grids more at night than during the daytime. Slow-growing chickens kept in enriched compartments showed a better walking ability. In general, slow-growing chickens had better plumage conditions and foot health compared to fast-growing chickens. Our results show that natural behaviors such as perching can be supported by offering elevated platforms and that animal-based indicators such as walking ability can be improved, at least in slow-growing chickens. Moreover, the use of an alternative chicken strain avoids killing day-old male chicks, and in addition, these chickens show fewer animal welfare problems than a conventional fattening strain. Thus, the use of male chickens of a dual-purpose strain can substantially contribute to improving animal welfare in broiler meat production.

AB  - Background The artificial mussel (AM) is a passive sampling device that was originally developed for monitoring metal concentrations in the marine environment, but is also increasingly used in freshwater environments. The AM consists of a non-permeable Perspex tube, which is closed on both sides with a semi-permeable membrane. The space in between contains Chelex-100 beads, which bind metals. The AM allows the determination of the dissolved, bioaccessible metal fraction in water bodies without killing organisms, as well as environments with unfavorable conditions for living bioindicators. In the present study, the use of the AM was adapted for the monitoring of platinum (Pt) in a freshwater ecosystem. Results The elution of Pt from the Chelex-100 beads was optimized. Two modifications to the original method for the use of AMs are recommended, i.e., washing and separation of the beads through centrifugation and elution with a mixture of 4.5 mL HNO3 and 0.5 mL HCl for approximately 2-3 h to ensure the release of all Pt bound to the beads. Additionally, the uptake kinetics of the AM were determined under laboratory conditions over a wide exposure concentration range (0.1-1000 mu g/L) showing highly correlated Pt accumulation in the AMs with the aqueous exposure concentration. For the tested Pt exposure concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L, the Pt concentrations in the AMs increased during the exposure period of 6 weeks. At the highest exposure concentration of 1000 mu g/L, the increase stagnated after 3 weeks. To validate the AM in the field, the Pt accumulation of the AM was assessed together with that of freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminalis africana), muscle and liver tissue of the three fish species sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), as well as water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes) at two sampling sites in the Pt mining area of South Africa. Conclusion Results from the present study showed that the AM is a promising tool to monitor Pt concentrations in the freshwater environment at contaminated sites.

AB  - Tourism is the primary economic activity on the Riviera Maya in Quintana Roo, Mexico. The area's main attractions are the fringing coral reefs along the coast and the myriad white sand beaches produced by them. Rapid growth of tourism and supporting industries generates jobs and a steady flow of immigrants, increasing demand for housing and services. It also increases pressure on coastal and marine resources through impacts such as pollution, overfishing, coastal zone modification, etc. In this context, Akumal a small tourism-support town associated to the coastal tourism center Akumal Beach, was selected to assess its level of dependence and appropriation of marine resources. A two-pronged approach included a characterization of the town's population socio-economic indicators, as well as their use and perception of easily identifiable marine resources (coral reef, fish and water quality), applying surveys with close-ended questions. And the second approach was the interview of key local business owners and tours operators to establish their vulnerability to coral reef degradation, and their disposition towards conservation efforts. The relationships between community involvement and resource appropriation, as well as, socioeconomic indicators and local perceptions about the past, present and future condition of marine resources were explored using redundancy analysis (RDA), and additionally important variables identified were tested for significance with a Chi-squared test. Surveys highlighted two socioeconomic factors: its high employment rate (90%) with 80% working directly in tourism (but earning average wages 25% lower than the regional average), and the heavy out-of-state immigration. Surveys also brought up two phenomena among newcomers: deterritorialization (or social alienation), consisting in lack of involvement by the local community in decision-making processes, scarce participation in natural resources use, and shifting baselines associated to ignorance of current resource condition. Interviews with local stakeholders found that they felt only partially vulnerable in a hypothetical situation of total reef loss, and were open to support conservation efforts as long as transparency and full cooperation from all stakeholders was ensured. The measures recommended to coastal managers, broadly applicable to the Mexican Caribbean, focus on development of local strategies addressing the root causes of social mistrust and misperceptions, leading to environmental degradation.

AB  - We use basic characteristics of statistical significance test to argue the abandonment of hypothesis testing in environmental standard (or criterion) compliance assessment. The typical sample size used for environmental assessment is small, and the natural variation of many water quality constituent concentrations is high. These conditions lead to low statistical power of the hypothesis tests used in the assessment process. As a result, using hypothesis testing is often inefficient in detecting noncompliance. When a noncompliance is detected, it is frequently due to sampling or other types of error. We illustrate the problems using two examples, through which we argue that these problems cannot be resolved under the current practice of assessing compliance one water at a time. We recommend that the hypothesis testing framework be replaced by a statistical estimation approach, which can more effectively leverage information from assessments on similar waters using a probabilistic assessment approach.

AB  - The main goal of this work is to present a possibility to evaluate the performance of a sample of countries in the South-Eastern European area related on the main important directions of sustainable development: migration and its impact. The paper used a Data Envelopment Analysis method for investigating the efficiency levels of sustainable development in the selected group of countries for the years 2013-2060. These efficiency levels depend on each country's specific conditions in migration management using two indicators correlated to economic and environmental features of migration. The application of the method led to obtaining an efficiency frontier, and the possibility of ranking the countries in accordance with their relative scores of sustainable performance. The results highlight that Austria and Italy would not register enough efficiency in using its economic, social and ecological resources, since consistent possibilities to improve the sustainable performance existed.

AB  - Market-based approaches are increasingly being advocated as tools for achieving the conservation of ecosystem services. We examine the reasons why markets so far appear to have failed to provide an efficient allocation of many ecosystem services, and identify the conditions under which markets deliver efficient resource allocation. We discuss different forms of market-based approaches to ecosystem services and identify the characteristics of services that make them better suited to one or another of these approaches. We find that lack of low-cost measurability and valuation currently precludes efficient allocation of many ecosystem services through market-based approaches. Still, some forms of market-based approaches hold promise for cost-effectively managing some ecosystem services provided by and to agricultural lands. In many cases some form of well-designed government involvement will be required to seek outcomes that protect the public interest. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Petrol has been extracted from Achuar territory in the Northern Peruvian Amazon since the 1970s. In spite of early identification of negative impacts on the environment and repeated attempts by the Achuar to improve conditions, very little research has been done on specific environmental and health impacts. Some recent governmental studies have shown extremely high blood lead and cadmium levels in Achuar communities. In this paper we apply an environmental justice framework to review the evidence of pollution and health status available in existing studies, as well as government and operating company actions over the last 30 years. We identify gaps in our knowledge which hamper efforts to respond to the environmental and health situation, as well as negligent actions on the part of the State and petrol companies.

AB  - Developed countries have traditionally used benthic macroinvertebrates as biological indicators, incorporating them into the environmental quality evaluations of fluvial systems. These studies are less frequent in Latin America, where the environmental protection standards for aquatic resources are just beginning to be elaborated. Thus, in Chile, the use of biocriteria for such studies remains a possibility. This study of the Chilldn River (Chile) adapts these biotic indexes (IBE, BMWP, IBF, and SIGNAL) for their application and comparison in a Mediterranean basin. The results showed the same behavior pattern for all indexes, defining some areas as having good conditions and others, which, from a biological perspective, have been strongly impacted. Specifically, the IBF and SIGNAL indexes are more sensitive to disturbances than the IBE and BMWP. Application feasibility and the advantages of the different indices are discussed, proposing a new methodology for central Chile.

AB  - Production and consumption of meat and fish have serious consequences for global food security and the environment. An understanding of the factors that influence meat and fish consumption is important for developing a sustainable food production and distribution system. For a sample of 132 nations, we use ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression to assess the effects of modernization and ecological context on per capita meat and fish consumption. We find that ecological conditions in a nation, such as resource availability and climate, influence meat and fish consumption. Additionally, indicators of modernization, particularly economic development, influence the consumption of both meat and fish. However, the effect of economic development on consumption patterns is distinctly different among geographic regions. We conclude that in order to understand national dietary patterns, researchers need to take into account not only ecological context and economic development, but also regional/cultural factors.

AB  - An Environmental Resource Assessment and Management System (ERAMS) has been developed for determining present and potential pastoral productivity of arid and semiarid regions. ERA MS determines productivity of mapped land units on the basis of soil-water availability which is in turn dependent on annual rainfall,slope, soil depth, salinity, and soil physical and chemical constraints. Stock carrying capacity is dependent oil soil type and vegetation state or condition (which is based oil foliage cover and botanical composition), and nutritive value of the pasture. Physical and biological features are determined by field surrey. ERAMS has been used to examine the likely impacts of management strategies that alter the degree of erosion, or vegetation type and state. Comparison of present arid potential production indicates the economic benefits of programs designed to increase carrying capacity through improved vegetation corer and land stability.

AB  - Digital image colorimetry (DIC) on smartphone is regarded as a powerful, fast and low-cost analysis method to measure target analyte with color changes of digital image obtained by the built-in camera. We summarized the basic procedure of DIC, the color spaces (RGB, CMYK, HSB/HSL, CIE XYZ, L*a*b*, and YUV), the principal architectures (tools for capturing image, lighting conditions, and color quantification APPs and DIC APPs), and current status of DIC on smartphone in analysis of metals/heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics, biological and medical indicators, natural compounds, and bacteria/viruses. The advantages and disadvantages of DIC are also revealed. Nowadays, DIC on smartphone must be further refined with controlled geometry and standard lighting sources to become robust and reliable analytical procedures. And it will be improved in the near future with the continuous development of smartphones owing to the rapid development of smartphone's camera technology and the continuous optimization of related software.

AB  - Two colonies of the social wasp Apoica flavissima were collected and analyzed to verify the population and morphometric averages of the individuals. Both colonies were in bushes at 700 mm above the floor, close to forest creeks. The colonies were at the beginning of their development stage and showed a reduced number of individuals, when compared with other studies on this genus. Means of adult parameters were: body length 21,6 mm; width of thorax 3,8 mm; and width of head, 3,5 mm. Pupae presented these averages: body length 20,05 mm; width of thorax 3,75 mm; and width of head 3,51 mm. Natural environment must offer good conditions for the development of wasps and their pattern nesting. Thus, high growth rates and different nesting behavior can demonstrate environmental influences on biology of this wasp group.

AB  - Pastoral production systems in the Spanish Pyrenees have changed dramatically in recent decades, leading to the loss of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We documented TEK of pastoralists from two valleys in the western Central Pyrenees of Aragn and explored its potential applications to resource management and adaptation. Pyrenean pastoralists possess extensive knowledge of relationships between terrain, climate, vegetation and animal nutrition and behavior. TEK could contribute to sustainable stewardship and facilitate adaptation by informing pasture monitoring; providing traditional practices to manage mountain vegetation; and preserving knowledge of extensive livestock production strategies, such as transhumance. Institutional barriers to applying TEK include weak economic cooperation among stockmen, their dependence on EU subsidies, and lack of voice in regional government decisions about local resources. A more collaborative, place-based stewardship of the Central Pyrenees might begin with direct involvement of pastoralists in designing monitoring of pasture conditions and vegetation type changes.

AB  - Phytoplankton community structure in coastal areas is a result of various environmental factors such as nutrients, light, grazing, temperature, and salinity. The Yucatan Peninsula is a karstic tropical region that is strongly influenced by submerged groundwater discharge (SGD) into the coastal zone. Phytoplankton community structure and its relationship with regional and local water quality variables were studied in four ports of the northwestern Yucatan Peninsula. Water quality was strongly related to SGD, and variations in phytoplankton community structure were related to local nutrient loading and hydrographic conditions, turbulence, and human impacts. Our study provides an ecological baseline for the Yucatan Peninsula and serves as a basis for establishing monitoring programs to predict changes at sites with high hydrological variation and in developing an early alert system for harmful toxic algal blooms.

AB  - In historical buildings, surface cracks are important indicators of potential structural damage. Natural disasters and indirect human factors, which are frequently encountered in recent periods, negatively affect historical buildings and structures. Fast and cost-effective crack detection methods play a key role in structural health monitoring of historical buildings. This paper presents methodologies for identifying concrete cracks using deep learning. We propose ReCRNet, a deep learning architecture designed for classifying images of cracks. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods such as AlexNet, VGG 19, linear support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). The results show that ReCRNet achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), in comparison with the other crack classifiers. Accordingly, the proposed approach is recommended for automatic monitoring of historical buildings and building condition assessments.

AB  - Samples for sediment and two species of native mangrove plants were collected from seven sampling sites for assessing the level of metal contamination. Results of the studied metals displayed the order of pollution as Fe > Ti > Zr > Rb > Zn > Sr > Pb > Y > Cu > Cr > As accordingly. Geoaccumulation index and contamination factor revealed that the sediment samples were unpolluted to moderately polluted by Zn, Fe, Ti, Rb, Y, and Zr. Ecological risk factor depicted a pollution-free condition in the study areas. PCA, CA, and correlation coefficient indicated that the source of the metals in the environment was anthropogenic. Bioconcentration factor values were found to be below 1 in both plant species. Conversely, transfer factor values for most heavy metals were found to be > 1 in both plant species, which reflects the phytoremediation ability of plants.

AB  - This paper discusses the ecological optimisation of municipal waste management systems. The purpose of this paper is to help local decision-makers in designing integrated waste management solutions that are ecologically optimal. The study uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to build a model and test different waste management scenarios in order to see whether the waste management hierarchy is influenced by regional conditions. The study also tests to which variables in waste management systems the end results of the LCA are most sensitive. The discussion is built around a case study in Lithuania where several waste management scenarios have been analysed and compared in the LCA framework. The paper reveals several methodology-related issues and discusses what implications waste-related policy intervention would have on the environmental outcomes of different waste management scenarios.

AB  - Knowing that diatoms are good indicators of stream ecological conditions, the aim of our research program was to test on a pilot data-set the interest and efficiency of using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) as an ordination technique to determine and to classify types of river ecosystems. Such neural networks have already been successfully used for other aquatic communities patterning. Diatoms, waterchemistry and stream morpho-dynamical parameters were characterised for 49 non impacted sampling stations spread over the Adour-Garonne watershed (South-Western France). Combining the SOM to the Structuring Index we selected in a second step the most relevant species (called "structuring species") influencing this typology. In this way, three main homogeneous regions were characterised, as regards to diatom communities and abiotic parameters, allowing us to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements concerning stream ecoregional classification.

AB  - Sipunculids have been used as ecological bioindicators in the areas of the harbour of Piombino (Livorno, Italy), the near pier in Follonica (Grosseto) and the harbour of Portoferraio (Elba Island, Livorno). The species of the collected samples were identified by molecular analysis of the 18S rRNA sequence: a genetically homogeneous population of Phascolosoma granulatum Leuckart, 1828, was found to be present in all the three analysed areas. The sipunculids, collected from different sites of the three areas exposed to identical environmental conditions (depth, temperature and solar radiation), were analysed in parallel to quantify the expression of HSP70, a molecular biomarker of ecological perturbation and contamination. This analysis showed that the largest amount of HSP70 is expressed in specimens taken from sites of the Piombino harbour, an area particularly exposed to industrial waste. The expression of an isoform larger in size than the conventional HSP70 was highlighted in these specimens.

AB  - The vegetation of abandoned arable fields on dry sandy soils was investigated in 1986 and again in 2000. Comparison of the two data sets by ordination, calibration based on indicator values, and statistical modelling revealed that the vegetation in 2000 differed significantly from the vegetation in 1986. Part of this difference could be explained by field age, but significant difference remained after correction for age. The analysis showed that species indicating nutrient-rich and acidic conditions were more abundant in the 2000 samples than expected from the age of the fields. Possible causes for the observed differences are discussed, and the role of airborne nitrogen deposition and landscape changes is emphasised. Changing course of successional processes may place serious constraints on future habitat restoration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process, as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels, indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the formation of involvement and its management.
   The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E. Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The measure of compliance is the "resource of engagement" of a person, which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The instrumental component includes various aspects of self- regulation of activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity. The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of including a person in an environment with specific characteristics.
   The authors conducted an empirical study of the "resource of engagement" of students of two large universities in the Russian Far East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the student and the educational environment were identified. These are subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty; selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in the educational space are determined.

AB  - To determine the effects of exercise, high heat and humidity and acclimation on plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, beta-endorphin and cortisol concentrations, five horses performed a competition exercise test (CET; designed to simulate the speed and endurance test of a three-day event) in cool dry (CD) (20degreesC/40% RH) and hot humid (30degreesC/80% RH) conditions before (pre-acclimation) and after (post-acclimation) a 15 day period of h timid heat acclimation. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations pre-acclination were significantly increased compared with exercise in the CD trial at the end of Phases C (P < 0.05) and D (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and at 2 min recovery (P < 0.01), with adrenaline concentrations still elevated after 5 min of recovery (P < 0.001). Plasma P-endorphin concentrations were increased at the end of Phases C (P < 0.05) and X (P < 0.01) and at 5 and 30 min recovery (P < 0.05) in the pre-acclimation session. Plasma cortisol concentrations were elevated after the initial warm up period pre-acclimation (P < 0.01) and at the end of Phase C (P < 0.05), compared with the CD trial. A 15 day period of acclimation significantly increased plasma adrenaline concentrations at 2 min recovery (P < 0.001) and plasma cortisol concentration at the end of Phase B (P < 0.01) compared with pre-acclimation. Acclimation did not significantly influence noradrenaline or beta-endorphin responses to exercise, although there was a trend for plasma beta-endorphin to be lower at the end of Phases C and X and after 30 min recovery compared with pre-acclimation. Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, beta-endorphin and cortisol concentrations were increased by exercise in cool dry conditions and were further increased by the same exercise in hot humid conditions.
   Exercise responses post-acclimation suggest that adrenaline and noradrenaline may play a role in the adaptation of horses to thermal stress and that changes in plasma beta-endorphin concentrations could be used as a sensitive indicator of thermal tolerance before and after acclimation. The use of plasma cortisol as a specific indicator of heat stress and thermal tolerance before or after acclimation in exercising horses appears limited. U 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - 1. Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses have been widely used to examine the sources of differences in the long-term deterministic growth rate (r = log lambda) of stage-structured populations that live in spatially distinct habitats or under distinct experimental conditions. However, existing methods for LTRE analysis ignore the fact that persistent temporal variation in matrix elements results in a long-term stochastic growth rate (a = log lambda(s)) that is different from the deterministic growth rate (r) and thus do not take into account environmental stochasticity.
   2. Here, we develop a stochastic extension of LTRE methods that can be used to compare stochastic growth rates among populations that differ in the observed variability of their matrix elements over time. We illustrate our method with actual data and explore a range of questions that may be addressed with these new tools. Specifically, we investigate how variability in weather conditions affected the population dynamics of the short-lived perennial plant species Anthyllis vulneraria and examine how differences in stochastic growth rates (a) are determined by contributions of mean matrix elements and variability in matrix elements.
   3. We find that, consistent with the life history of the species, differences in mean fertility and growth made the largest contribution to differences in a, whereas in terms of variability fertility made the largest contribution in most populations. However, we also find that in all populations, the magnitude of the total contribution of mean matrix elements outweighed that of variability. Finally, increasing soil depth significantly lowered contributions of variability in matrix elements, but it was not related to contributions of differences in mean matrix elements.
   4.Synthesis. Stochastic life table response experiment analysis described here provides the first systematic way of incorporating observed differences in temporal variability into the comparison of natural populations. A key finding from this study is that populations occurring on relatively deeper soils were better buffered against climatic variation than populations occurring on shallow soils. We expect this new approach to analyse temporal variability to prove especially useful in the analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental change.

AB  - The terrestrial arthropod fauna of wetlands has been largely ignored by scientists compared to other ecological elements, yet these organisms are among the most important influences on the ecology of these systems, with the vast majority of the biodiversity in wetlands found among the terrestrial arthropods. Wetlands present a range of habitat for terrestrial arthropods, with unique faunas being associated with soils and ground litter, living plant substrates, and peatlands. Myriapoda, Araneae, Collembola, Carabidae, Formicidae, and assorted herbivorous Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are the terrestrial arthropod groups that most influence the ecology of wetlands. Despite their success, most terrestrial arthropods possess fairly rudimentary adaptations for life in wetlands, with most simply moving to higher ground or up vegetation during floods, although some species can tolerate immersion. Many terrestrial arthropods are environmentally sensitive and show considerable promise as bioindicators of wetland ecological conditions.

AB  - Ecosystems can undergo sudden shifts to undesirable states, but recent studies with simple single-species ecosystems have demonstrated that advance warning can be provided by the slowing down of population dynamics near a tipping point. However, it is unclear how this 'critical slowing down' will manifest in ecosystems with strong interactions between their components. Here we probe the dynamics of an experimental producer-freeloader ecosystem as it approaches a catastrophic collapse. Surprisingly, the producer population grows in size as the environment deteriorates, highlighting that population size can be a misleading measure of ecosystem stability. By analysing the oscillatory producer-freeloader dynamics for over 100 generations in multiple environmental conditions, we find that the collective ecosystem dynamics slow down as the tipping point is approached. Analysis of the coupled dynamics of interacting populations may therefore be necessary to provide advance warning of collapse in complex communities.

AB  - A simple, inexpensive yet highly selective colorimetric indicator-displacement assay array for the simultaneous detection and identification of three important biothiols at micromolar concentrations under physiological conditions and in real samples has been developed in this work. With use of an array composed of metal indicators and metal ions, clear differentiation among cysteine, homocysteine and glutathione was achieved. On the basis of the colour change of the array, quantification of each analyte was accomplished easily, and different biothiols were identified readily using standard chemometric approaches (hierarchical clustering analysis). Moreover, the colorimetric sensor array was not responsive to changes with 19 other natural amino acids, and it showed excellent reproducibility. Importantly, the sensor array developed was successfully applied to the determination and identification of the three biothiols in a real biological sample.

AB  - This paper reports the development of methods for assessing the environmental risks of pesticide use in a farm-level evaluation tool. The basic risk indices that were used, and the criteria used to define different levels of risk, were designed to be consistent with national and EU regulatory risk assessment procedures. They took account of both toxicity and exposure and were responsive to the influence of local conditions and practices, such as pesticide application methods and habitat structure. They also took account of 'higher tier' risk assessments carried out for pesticide approvals. The outputs of the system were designed to provide clear and meaningful information for users at various levels of detail, from the individual pesticide application to an overall farm eco-rating. It is recommended that the principle of consistency with regulatory risk assessment should also be applied to the development of other policy instruments such as consumer labels and pesticide taxes.

AB  - An odor impact assessment had been carried out in order to evaluate the negative impact on the population living in the neighborhood of Zhengwangfen wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Beijing. The results indicated that the discharged NH3 and H2S concentrations were highest in the pretreatment and biological treatment units, while the discharged odor index was highest in the pretreatment, biological, and sludge treatment units in the two existing WWTPs. Using the method of the odor index evaluation for H2S and NH3, we concluded that the maximum concentrations of NH3 and H2S in Zhengwangfen WWTP were 0.0043 and 0.059 mg/m(3), respectively. On the basis of Gaussian point source diffusion model, the maximum protective distance of different treatment units was 196.43 m, which indicated that the 200 m setback distance for WWTPs, dictated by local regulation, appeared to be sufficient under usual operating and normal weather conditions.

AB  - In this study we developed and applied a multimetric index to assess the biological water quality of rivers in Vietnam as a complementary tbol to the traditional physical-chemical analysis. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected at 15 monitoring sites in the Cau river basin, Northern of Vietnam. Eighteen candidate metrics were tested for their range, stability, sensitivitY and responsiveness to anthropogenic impacts. The MMI was calculated as the arithmetic mean of five metrics that were retained being the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) - Viet, total number of taxa, Margalef index, number of ephemeroptera, plecoptera and trichoptera (EPT) and percent of insects. The MMI is split up in five water quality classes, ranging from class one (high biological status) to class five (bad biological status). The study demonstrated that the multimetric approach is suitable for application in the Vietnamese national monitoring and assessment program. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantifying the environmental vulnerability and the resilience of rapidly changing Mediterranean landscapes under climate change is a crucial undertaking for the sustainable management of regions experiencing intense human pressure. This paper diachronically (19752006) analyses the impact of land-use changes (LUCs) on land vulnerability to desertification at two coastal sites in southern Italy with different environmental and socio-economic conditions to identify landscape responses to territorial reconfiguration. We found that both initial land vulnerability and its increase over time are higher in areas experiencing LUCs than in areas with stable patterns of land-use. Stable, low levels of land vulnerability to desertification were associated with forests and semi-natural areas, while urbanisation and agricultural intensification led to marked increases in land vulnerability. The procedure outlined in this paper is suitable for identifying land-use trajectories associated with the desertification processes and may inform policies aimed at preventing soil and land degradation.

AB  - The relative risk model (RRM) was applied to evaluate the ecological risk characterization of the freshwater ecosystems in China, from both overall and region-specific levels. Ten large-scale river basins (further broken into 15 risk regions) in China were chosen as the study objects; 10 sources, two habitats, and seven endpoints were identified as risk components. The results reveal the status of ecosystem conditions, key ecological risk issues, and the spatial heterogeneity of the freshwater ecosystems in China. The policy implications for the ecosystem-based water management contained in the results are discussed. The results obtained in this article provide a deeper understanding of the ecological risk characterization of the freshwater ecosystems in China, and aid in promoting the applications of the RRM as the tool for ecosystem-based water management.

AB  - Small molecules play crucial roles in every major cellular process. Despite this, detecting their levels within cells remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe intracellular sensors of coenzyme B-12 that make use of the exquisite molecular detection capabilities of a naturally occurring riboswitch. These probes sensitively detect their target using colorimetric, fluorescent, or luminescent reporters. To assess their utility in the study of biological systems, the sensors were applied to examine the synthesis and the import of coenzyme B-12. The sensors were able to monitor the effects of genetic deletions, recombinant expression of foreign genes, and varied growth conditions on both of these processes. These results indicate that riboswitch-based sensors can provide valuable information on intracellular small molecule concentrations that can be employed in the study of related cellular processes.

AB  - Deadwood is a key ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Its occurrence is fundamental since it represents a microhabitat for hundreds of species of invertebrates, fungi, bryophytes, lichens, amphibians, small mammals and birds. In recent years, deadwood has been recognized as a relevant indicator for the assessment and monitoring of forest biodiversity. In this paper the methodology for surveying woody necromass proposed by the ForestBIOTA project under Regulation (EC) No 2152/ 2003 (Forest Focus) is described. The amount of deadwood found on 91 Intensive Monitoring Level II plot of the EU and ICP Forest condition monitoring programme range from 0 to 258 m(3) ha(-1). In the examined areas, total deadwood volume does not differ significantly among forest types, due to the high intra-type variability. On the other hand, its distribution between coarse and fine necromass and among necromass components is highly dependent on forest types.

AB  - The assessment of sustainable development is crucial for constituting sustainable development strategies. Assessment methods that exist so far usually only use an indicator system for making sustainable judgement. These indicators rarely reflect dynamic characteristics. However, sustainable development is influenced by changes in the social-economic system and in the eco-environmental system at different times. Besides the spatial character, sustainable development has a temporal character that can not be neglected; therefore the research system should also be dynamic. This paper focuses on this dynamic trait, so that the assessment results obtained provide more information for judgements in decision-making processes. Firstly the dynamic characteristics of sustainable development are analyzed, which point to a track of sustainable development that is an upward undulating curve. According to the dynamic character and the development rules of a social, economic and ecological system, a flexible assessment approach that is based en tendency analysis, restrictive conditions and a feedback system is then proposed for sustainable development.

TI  - Fish as sentinels of aquatic environment: Pertinence and optimisation of sanitary parameters.
T2  - BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE
LA  - French
AB  - Fish are more and more used as proper sentinels of environment and many methods are now based upon the study of communities, physiological responses and metabolic and cellular reactions of fish. Among these methods, the evaluation of the health condition appears certainly as one of the most pertinent.
   Nevertheless, by reason of understanding and financial motives, very few indicators have been proved to be really pertinent. These indicators are not widely practised and they are exceptionally integrated within biomonitoring programmes : in the reality of to-day, only the parasite Trichodina sp. has been validated and could be integrated in the <<fish-index>>.
   The present paper will first describe the main sanitory parameters and their ecological means and, secondly, so far their use is possible and the ways to improve the sanitory tool.
   The improvement of this tool implies to build up an epidemiological survey network in order to organize and coordinate the specific competencies and to connect all the available informations.

AB  - The utility of Sr/Ca ratios in otoliths as indicators of thermal history in fish was investigated for juvenile Girella elevata. There was no direct relationship between ratios of Sr/Ca and temperature of the water, as has been assumed in many previous studies. Sr/Ca ratios did not decrease when water temperature was elevated from 19 to 28 degrees C. Elevation of ambient Sr levels in the sea water caused a significant increase in Sr/Ca ratios in otoliths, and there was a detectable increase in Sr/Ca ratios in otoliths of some individuals fed an Sr-enriched diet. Multiple factors may influence natural Sr/Ca ratios in otoliths of juvenile G. elevata and their interactions make it difficult to interpret the chronology of conditions experienced by an individual fish during early life in the pelagic or benthic environment.

AB  - Sociology, as it came to be constructed from the late 19th century onwards, deliberately concentrated on human societies, giving little attention to the natural world which constitutes the very condition of its existence and development. Today, some sociologists claim that the environmental problems of today constitute a challenge to this classical sociological understanding. By critically discussing environmental sociologists' claim for the necessity to include biophysical facts in sociological analysis, this article seeks to elaborate a sociological perspective on environmental problems. From the point of view of epistemology and the sociology of knowledge, the article contrasts naive realism with social constructivism. It is here stated that even though social constructivism seems to be more in line with sociological thought a realistic standpoint regarding the environmental threat seem to be a necessity. By way of conclusion it is stated that a proper sociological understanding has to take into account nature's constructedness as well as realistic side. Thus nature cannot be understood outside of society or society outside of nature.

AB  - Agriculture exerts a strong pressure on the environment and can both preserve biodiversity, diversify and improve landscape quality, and cause declines in farmland biodiversity. In response to growing environmental concerns, the European Union has introduced dedicated measures including the "Organic Farming" (OF) Measure, which is implemented in Poland under the Rural Development Programme. The Measure is the subject of the research presented in this article. In the context of the challenges faced, the uptake of subsidies depends on appropriate spatial targeting of organic farming support by making it better suited to the environmental conditions (potential) prevailing in a specific area. Therefore the aim of the study is to investigate the spatial match (i.e. consistency between the natural potential of a region and funding policy) between OF support and the prevailing natural conditions. Three indicators are used in the research: the indicator of environmental suitability of land for organic farming (IESAOF), the indicator of uptake of organic farming funds (IUOFF), and the indicator of spatial fit of organic farming support (ISFOFS). They pertain to both the spatial differentiation of the absorption of organic farming funds and to selected environmental indicators measuring the quality of individual natural components. The analysis relied, inter alia, on spatial autocorrelation methods: Moran's I and LISAs. The study has been carried out using Poland as an example at different spatial scales: the regional (16 regions; NUTS2) and the local (2175 LAU level 2 units). The use of the synthetic ISFOFS index has allowed the spatial discrepancies between IESAOF and IUOFF and areas with spatial mismatch to be identified. The study has established areas with untapped potential and those where OF funds are underutilised given their environmental potential. The situation described is detrimental to the effectiveness of support, which is contrary to the CAP principles. The key findings are important in the context of monitoring and evaluating the EU's agricultural policies, which should take more account of the characteristics of the individual countries, including their natural regional and local specificities.

AB  - Karoo paralysis in South Africa is induced in livestock by feeding female Ixodes rubicundus ticks when infestation densities on hosts exceed certain critical levels. It has been shown previously that Angora goats are at a higher risk of being paralysed than Merino sheep, and such differences have been related to differences in feeding behaviour and spatial distribution of the two small-stock breeds. We hypothesized that differences in infestation densities with Karoo paralysis ticks would also occur between Merino and Dorper sheep breeds. A study was conducted under natural conditions in the south-western Free State, to compare infestation burdens of the two sheep breeds and also to investigate seasonal patterns and annual variations in terms of rainfall and temperature. Ten animals of each breed ran free in an area with a known history of Karoo paralysis and were examined on an approximately fortnightly basis, from March 1992 to December 1995, to determine tick abundance. Differences between the two breeds were significant (P < 0,05) during 1992 and 1993, but not during 1994. During the first two years, peak abundance of ticks was reached earlier in Dorper than in Merino sheep, and it also reached higher levels in Dorper than in Merino sheep ((x) over bar = 17,9 and 7,3, respectively). In 1993, two Dorper, but no Merino sheep, were paralysed. Dorper sheep are clearly at a higher risk of being paralysed than are Merino sheep, and as such, they can serve as indicators of adult tick activity and hence of the time to commence prophylactic treatment. Differences between the two breeds are probably related to differences in grazing patterns. Marked Variation in abundance and the time of onset of peak activity of I. rubicundus occurred over the years. Tick numbers were high in 1993 and 1995, but very low in 1992. In 1993, peak activity occurred earlier (April) than during the other years (June or July). These differences are related to differences in prevailing environmental conditions that influence tick activity in a complex manner. Heightened humidity and lower temperatures during the early stages of seasonal activity of the tick (April or May), normally result in peak abundance of ticks on hosts at that time.

AB  - Studying the responses of phytoliths to warming is a new approach to interpret how grassland ecosystems respond to global change. We used an infrared radiator to simulate warming on Phragmites communis in the Songnen Grassland, China - three warming treatments and a control were used to study the relationships between phytolith size and temperature. Warming changed the size of different types of phytoliths. During June-October, the average size of saddle phytoliths decreased and that of hair cell phytoliths and silicified stomata increased with warming. The responses of phytolith size to warming differed among months. With warming, the size of saddle phytoliths, hair cell phytoliths and silicified stomata increased in July and September, but decreased in October. Overall, the results demonstrate that P. communis phytoliths were sensitive to warming. This study provides experimental evidence for phytoliths as reliable proxy indicators for reconstruction of paleo-environments.

AB  - Phenotypically plastic characters may respond to multiple variables in their environment, but the evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon have rarely been addressed theoretically. We model the evolution of linear reaction norms in response to several correlated environmental variables, in a population undergoing stationary environmental fluctuations. At evolutionary equilibrium, the linear combination of environmental variables that acts as a developmental cue for the plastic trait is the multivariate best linear predictor of changes in the optimum. However, the reaction norm with respect to any single environmental variable may exhibit nonintuitive patterns. Apparently maladaptive, or hyperadaptive plasticity can evolve with respect to single environmental variables, and costs of plasticity may increase, rather than reduce, plasticity in response to some variables. We also find conditions for the evolution of an indirect environmental indicator that affects expression of a plastic phenotype, despite not influencing natural selection on it.

AB  - Our paper presents a detailed comparative analysis and methodology of selection of a reclamation procedure for the Gorka hazardous waste landfill in Trzebinia, Poland. The most favorable solution offered by the authors is based on the measurable evaluation criteria and the decision analysis. Evaluation criteria have been selected to meet the assumptions of a sustainable development concept and take into account ecological, economical, and social aspects of the analyzed options. At the same time, the most favorable technical and technological solutions have been proposed. The principal conditions of the properly carried out reclamation include:
   Permanent elimination of harmful environmental effects caused by the solid waste landfill and leachate from the reservoir, mainly through reduced emission of pollutants to ground and surface waters.
   Reclamation of soil within the disused quarry up to the standards required by Polish Law.
   Reclamation and land development according to municipal zoning plan guidelines.

AB  - I investigated life-history and parasitism in the salt marsh snail, Cerithidea californica Latitude and growing conditions were important factors determining maturation size. After accounting for environmental variation, there was a negative association between the maturation size of snails and the prevalence of parasitic castration by larval trematodes. As predicted by life-history theory, this may represent an adaptation against parasitism that is similar to previous observations of life-history adaptations in species subject to predation or disturbance. However, it was unclear whether this adaptation was due to phenotypic plasticity or genetic differences among populations resulting from natural selection so I conducted a reciprocal transplant between sites with high and low prevalence and found source population differences in maturation size. It appears, therefore, that the life-history differences between.these populations are at least partially genetic or may represent an adaptive developmental switch that was initiate prior to the transplant.

AB  - The alkenone-pCO(2) method is one of the most widely used approaches to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 in the Cenozoic. The method depends upon fractionation of stable carbon isotopes during algal photosynthesis, expressed as epsilon(p)(37)(:2), and a physiological scaling parameter, b, that accounts for biological factors such as growth rate, cell size, and membrane permeability. Alkenone-derived CO2 records for the late Pleistocene, however, are poorly correlated with ice core CO2, challenging the classic model that considers most of the CO2 used for coccolithophore photosynthesis to be acquired through simple diffusion. In this study, we investigate the nature of the b term and the underlying patterns of the sensitivity of epsilon(p)(37)(:2) to pCO(2) changes. We generated two new epsilon(p)(37)(:2) records from the South China Sea (MD01-2392) and tropical Atlantic Ocean (ODP 668B) and compiled other published epsilon(p)(37)(:2) records over glacial-interglacial cycles. Using the epsilon(p)(37)(:2) data, ocean temperature estimates, and ice core CO2, we were able to back-calculate the corresponding values of b. At all locations, b varies over glacial cycles. The highest values of b correspond to peak interglacial stages, indicating that the phytoplankton growth rate is faster or cell size is smaller during interglacials than during glacial periods. We further show that the range of epsilon(p)(37)(:2) between glacial and interglacial conditions, Delta epsilon(p)(37)(:2), scales with growth conditions, consistent with the predictions of the carbon isotope fractionation model based on CO2 diffusion. In other words, the sensitivity of epsilon(p)(37)(:2) to pCO(2) changes increases where the modern b values are large, contradicting the recommendations that oligotrophic sites are the best for alkenone-CO2 applications because of the presumed stability of b. Using the average back-calculated b value for each site, the composite pCO(2) estimates from MD01-2392 and ODP 668B - the two sites with adequate Delta epsilon(p)(37)(:2) sensitivity - show broad agreement with the ice core CO2 record.

AB  - Sphagnum peatlands represent a globally significant pool and sink of carbon but these functions are threatened by ongoing climate change. Testate amoebae are useful bioindicators of hydrological changes, but little experimental work has been done on the impact of water table changes on communities.
   Using a mesocosm experimental setting that was previously used to assess the impact of drought disturbance on communities and ecosystem processes with three contrasted water table positions: wet (-4 cm), intermediate (-15 cm) and dry (-25 cm), we studied the capacity of testate amoeba communities to recover when the water table was kept at -10 cm for all plots. The overall experiment lasted three years. We assessed the taxonomic and functional trait responses of testate amoeba communities. The selected traits were hypothesised to be correlated to moisture content (response traits: shell size, aperture position) or trophic role (effect traits: mixotrophy, aperture size controlling prey range).
   During the disturbance phase, the mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the wet and intermediate plots, while the community shifted to a dominance of "dry indicators" (Corythion dubium, Nebela tincta, Cryptodifflugia oviformis) and corresponding traits (loss of mixotrophy, and dominance of smaller taxa with ventral or ventral-central aperture) in dry plots. During the recovery phase we observed two contrasted trends in the previously wet and intermediate plots: communities remained similar where the Sphagnum carpet remained intact but species and traits indicators of drier conditions increased in plots where it had degraded. In the former dry plots, indicators and traits of wet conditions increased by the end of the experiment.
   This is one of the first experiment simulating a disturbance and subsequent recovery in ex-situ mesocosms of Sphagnum peatland focusing on the response of testate amoebae community structure as well as functional traits to water table manipulation. The results generally confirmed that testate amoebae respond within a few months to hydrological changes and thus represent useful bioindicators for assessing current and past hydrological changes in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB  - 1.There has recently been increasing interest in patterns of beta diversity but we still lack a comprehensive understanding of these patterns in various regions (e.g. the tropics), ecosystems (e.g. streams) and organism groups (e.g. invertebrates). 2.Our aim was to investigate the patterns of beta diversity of stream macroinvertebrates in relation to key environmental (i.e. stream size, pH and habitat degradation) and geographical variables (i.e. latitude, longitude, altitude) in a tropical region. We surveyed a total of 810 riffle sites in each of 34 streams (altogether 337 riffle sites were sampled) in Peninsular Malaysia to examine variation in macroinvertebrate community composition at within-stream and among-stream scales. 3.Based on test of homogeneity of dispersion, we found that the streams studied differed significantly in within-stream variation in community composition (i.e. among-site variation of within stream beta diversity). The patterns were similar based on BrayCurtis coefficient on abundance data, Sorensen coefficient on presenceabsence data and Simpson coefficient on presenceabsence data. We also found that within-stream beta diversity was significantly related to stream size, pH and latitude, with each of these variables individually accounting for around 20% of the variation in beta diversity in simple regressions, while the total variation explained by the three significant variables amounted to around 50% in multiple regressions. By contrast, habitat degradation, longitude and altitude were not significantly related to beta diversity. We also found that the factor drainage basin accounted for much of the variation in beta diversity in general linear models, suppressing the effects of environmental variables. 4.We concluded that within-stream beta diversity is mainly related to a combination of the identity of a drainage basin and stream environmental factors. Our findings provide important background for stream environmental assessment and conservation planning by emphasising that (i) macroinvertebrate communities within streams are not homogeneous, but show considerable beta diversity, (ii) streams differ in their degree of within-stream beta diversity, (iii) stream size and water pH should be considered in applied contexts related to within-stream beta diversity and (iv) historical effects may be different in different drainage basins and may affect present-day patterns of within-stream beta diversity.

AB  - Understanding the evaporative response of ecosystems to heatwaves is critical for managing ecosystem services and water resources, especially under a changing climate. In this study, we examine the land-atmosphere exchange of water and heat fluxes under heatwave and nonheatwave conditions across five different land cover types, including grasslands, shrublands, croplands, deciduous broadleaf forests, and evergreen needleleaf forests, using data from eddy covariance towers. Results show that net radiation and sensible heat flux increase from nonheatwave to heatwave conditions across all five land cover types but latent heat flux shows contrasting responses to heatwaves. An attribution analysis further demonstrates that heatwave-induced changes in evaporative fraction are mainly caused by changes in vapor pressure deficit (positive contribution) and changes in surface resistance (negative contribution). The imbalance between the positive and negative contributions varies across the five land cover types and is responsible for their contrasting evaporative responses to heatwaves.
   Plain Language Summary A heatwave is a period of extremely hot weather. Under a warming climate, heatwaves are expected to become more frequent, stronger, and longer lasting. Heatwaves are amongst the deadliest natural disasters. Within such contexts, key questions that need to be addressed include how different ecosystems respond to heatwaves differently and, more importantly, what factors control such contrasting responses. In this study, we employ an analytical attribution framework and combine it with observational data to explore the responses of evaporative fraction, a key indicator of the partition between sensible and latent heat fluxes, to heatwaves over five major land cover types. We quantify the contributions of various land surface and atmospheric factors in controlling changes in the evaporative fraction under heatwaves. Our analysis indicates that the vapor pressure deficit and surface resistance are the dominant factors but play opposing roles, with changes in the vapor pressure deficit enhancing the evaporative fraction but changes in the surface resistance reducing the evaporative fraction. Their relative contributions vary across land cover types, thereby explaining the contrasting ecosystem responses to heatwaves. By identifying the key factors controlling the ecosystem responses to heatwaves, our results provide novel insights into how to manage ecosystem services and water resources.

AB  - Manures are important soil nutrient conditioners and source of several pathogenic bacteria that potentially contribute to groundwater and surface water pollution. The best management practices need a solid understanding of manure sources, concentrations, and strategies to limit the number of bacteria in natural soil environment. In this study, a series of soil column experiments were conducted to investigate how bacteria mobility can potentially be influenced by retention mechanisms while moving through undisturbed saturated soil. This was assessed by bacteria retention profiles and mobility indices including the maximum transported (Cmax-T) and retained (Cmax-R) concentrations, filtration coefficient (lambda(f)) and the maximum depth of bacteria transport (Z(max)). Three different soil samples (sandy, loamy and silty clay loam) were enriched with three types of manures (cow, sheep, and poultry), placed on top of three soil columns (16 cm diameter, 30 cm height) with an equivalent of 10 Mg ha(-1) (dry basis) summing up to a total of 36 columns. Leaching was performed under saturated steady-state conditions (i.e., 1.62 cm min(-1)) for a duration of 4 pore volumes. After percolation, soil columns were sliced into six 5-cm interval layers and slices were characterized for retained bacteria. Results showed irregular exponential or quasi-exponential bacteria retention profiles for cow and sheep manures, whereas uniform-shaped profiles occurred for poultry manure. The latter variant also switched to exponential shape for the sandy soil at the highest and lowest Cmax-T and Cmax-R values due to higher pore water velocity. The lambda(f) and the Z(max) values were also found to be affected by soil texture and manure origin. The lambda(f) was higher for poultry manure due to higher free-cell transport of bacteria most probably induced by higher amount of soluble mobile components. However, the greater amounts of transported wooden materials released from cow and sheep manures acted as harbors for bacteria. Accordingly, the filtration rate decreased and tailing effects for bacteria transport increased. The results also suggest that the practices and strategies for using manures could be optimized according to the respective transport behavior to manage the bacteria retention with respect to soil and manure types to reduce soil and water pollution.

AB  - Both environmental filtering and dispersal filtering are known to influence plant species distribution patterns and biodiversity. Particularly in dynamic habitats, however, it remains unclear whether environmental filtering (stimulated by stressful conditions) or dispersal filtering (during recolonization events) dominates in community assembly, or how they interact. Such a fundamental understanding of community assembly is critical to the design of biodiversity conservation and restoration strategies.
   Stream riparian zones are species-rich dynamic habitats. They are characterized by steep hydrological gradients likely to promote environmental filtering, and by spatiotemporal variation in the arrival of propagules likely to promote dispersal filtering. We quantified the contributions of both filters by monitoring natural seed arrival (dispersal filter) and experimentally assessing germination, seedling survival and growth of 17 riparian plant species (environmental filter) along riparian gradients of three lowland streams that were excavated to bare substrate for restoration. Subsequently, we related spatial patterns in each process to species distribution and diversity patterns after 1 and 2years of succession.
   Patterns in initial seed arrival were very clearly reflected in species distribution patterns in the developing vegetation and were more significant than environmental filtering. However, environmental filtering intensified towards the wet end of the riparian gradient, particularly through effects of flooding on survival and growth, which strongly affected community diversity and generated a gradient in the vegetation. Strikingly, patterns in seed arrival foreshadowed the gradient that developed in the vegetation; seeds of species with adult optima at wetter conditions dominated seed arrival at low elevations along the riparian gradient, while seeds of species with drier optima arrived higher up. Despite previous assertions suggesting a dominance of environmental filtering, our results demonstrate that non-random dispersal may be an important driver of early successional riparian vegetation zonation and biodiversity patterns as well.
   Synthesis. Our results demonstrate (and quantify) the strong roles of both environmental and dispersal filtering in determining plant community assemblies in early successional dynamic habitats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dispersal filtering can already initiate vegetation gradients, a mechanism that may have been overlooked along many environmental gradients where interspecific interactions are (temporarily) reduced.

AB  - Ex-situ cultivation of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) is a promising technology to produce materials that can induce the recovery of biocrusts in the field for the purposes of preventing soil erosion and improving hydrological function in degraded ecosystems. However, the ability of artificially cultivated biocrusts to survive under adverse field conditions, including drought and heat stresses, is still relatively unknown. Mosses can bolster biocrust resistance to the stresses (e.g., drought and heat) and the resistance may be introduced prior to field cultivation. In this study, we subjected the well-developed artificial moss biocrusts (dominant species of Didymodon vinealis (Brid.) Zand.) that we cultivated in the phytotron to a dehydration-rehydration experiment and also a heat stress experiment and measured the activities of protective enzymes (including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) and the contents of osmoregulatory substances (including soluble proteins and soluble sugars) and malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of oxidative stress) in the stem and leaf fragments of mosses. The results showed that, during the dehydration process, the activities of protective enzymes and the contents of osmoregulatory substances and MDA gradually increased with increasing duration of drought stress (over 13 days). During the rehydration process, values of these parameters decreased rapidly after 1 d of rehydration. The values then showed a gradual decrease for 5 days, approaching to the control levels. Under heat stress (45A degrees C), the activities of protective enzymes and the content of soluble proteins increased rapidly within 2 h of heat exposure and then decreased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. In contrast, the contents of soluble sugars and MDA always increased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. This study indicates that artificial moss biocrusts possess a strong drought resistance and this resistance can be enhanced after a gradual dehydration treatment. This study also indicates that artificial moss biocrusts can only resist short-term heat stress (not long-term heat stress). These findings suggest that short-term heat stress or prolonged drought stress could be used to elevate the resistance of artificial moss biocrusts to adverse conditions prior to field reintroduction.

AB  - Deforestation due to the development of agriculture was one of the most important indications of human pressure on the environment in past centuries. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, however, socioeconomic and political changes resulted in the abandonment of the poorest arable lands and their subsequent afforestation. In Poland, as in many other European countries, postagricultural forests established at different times can frequently be seen. Pine forests are the most common communities among plantation stands because sites with poor soil are the first to be abandoned.
   The aim of this study was to quantify the floristic, structural and ecological differences between ancient and recent, post-agricultural pine forests, established at different times. 202 Phytosociological releves were collected in pine forest communities of Peucedano-Pinetum W. MAT. (1962) 1973, in the regions of Masuria and Kurpie (central Poland). The origin of each forest stand was ascertained with the help of historical topographical maps dating from 1800. The data set was divided into 4 categories: ancient forests and 3 groups of recent forests with different regeneration periods (forest persistence). The communities' structural parameters, biodiversity metrics, species frequency, mean Ellenberg's indicator values and mode of seed dispersal were all used to quantify the differences between the categories. Significant differences in the herb layer structure and plant species composition between ancient and recent forests were noted. Four species groups characteristic of different forest categories were distinguished. No significant differences in total species richness were found, but ancient forests were seen to be richer in ancient forest indicators, though none were confined exclusively to their stands. The results show differences with the noted lists of ancient forests species. The study points to specific ecological characteristics (light and soil conditions) of the species groups. Overall, the regeneration of pine forests proceeds very slowly. To promote the recovery of forest species, afforestation should be located in the vicinity of ancient stands; furthermore, adequate conditions for the development of forest species should be ensured.

AB  - Mangrove dynamics in the Cispata lagoon system (Colombian Caribbean) during last 900 years. The lagoon complex of Cispata (old Sinu river delta) located at the Northwestern coast of the Colombian Caribbean, encloses one of the biggest mangrove areas in this region. This area has changed during the last 330 years because of several environmental and climatic causes, mainly changes in the position of the delta (Sinu River), which is the main freshwater source in this area, and sea level rise. We hypothesized that the climatic and geomorphologic dynamics has caused changes in the extension and composition of mangrove vegetation, especially during last 150 years. The dynamics of mangroves during the last 900 years was reconstructed based on the changes in the stratigraphy, pollen record, calcite concentrations (CaCO3) and C/N ratio, along two sediment cores from La Flotante and Navio lagoons, located in Cispata complex. The age model was built based on lineal interpolation of Pb-210 ages and changes in granulometry. Establishment and expansion of mangrove forests during the last 900 years were related to fluviomarine dynamics in the area and the lagoon formation. During the period encompassed between 1064 and 1762 A.D., the Mestizos spit was formed when marine conditions predominated in the surroundings of La Flotante Lagoon. At the site of Navio, a river dominated lagoon, terrigenous conditions dominated since 1830. Although the colonization of herbaceous pioneer vegetation started between 1142 and 1331 AD., mangrove colonization only took place since 1717 A.D. Mangrove colonization was a result of the delta progradation. In 1849 A.D. the Sinu river delta migrated to the Cispata bay. The eustatic sea level rise, the increase in river discharges and sedimentation rates produced the establishment of mangrove forests dominated by Rhizophora since 1849. Since 1900 a marine intrusion was recorded in both lagoons. In 1938, the migration of the delta toward its actual location in Tinajones gave place to the formation of the present lagoon system and to the expansion of mangrove forests, which reflects the balance between the high alluvial sediment input and the current sea level rise as has been recorded in similar ecosystems.

AB  - Cassava has the potential to be a promising crop that can adapt to changing climatic conditions in Indonesia due to its low water requirement and drought tolerance. However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (ISA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP (R) and ArcGIS (R) environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R-2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAW, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields. This developed integrated model could be implemented for the management of land allocation and yield assessment in cassava production to ensure regional food security in Indonesia.

AB  - Purpose - The comparative study between urban regions gathered by the 2010 National Project of Relevant Interest financed by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR - PRIN 2010) re-opened, in Italy, the debate on regional comparison of data, especially the ones of land use monitoring, which are difficult to collect, and to compare. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate some results of comparative studies based on regional and national data sets of land use indicators. Further considerations of land use change (LUC) assessment and its effect on environmental policies extended to the whole metropolitan area of Milan are outlined.
   Design/methodology/approach - The adopted methodology collects different types of information from the existent databases on land uses/land covers (national/regional) and presents an assessment between the selected case of studies (urban regions), leading a shift from a quantitative evaluation to a qualitative one. A comparative study was conducted applying a geographical and statistical difference of land uses among different time thresholds. Subsequently, a cross-tabulation analysis allows an in-depth LUC analysis for the Milan urban region.
   Findings - The results of the study display an autonomous pattern for the Milan urban region, which is the most densely populated area in Italy and seems to be the only comparable to other international cases of studies due to its extension and characteristics. Nevertheless, it is not the urban region that is affected by the highest rate of land take, which takes place in the Italian context where densities of settlements are lower and sprawled. According to Soja's (2011) interpretation, the post-metropolitan condition of Milan seems to be proved.
   Originality/value - The study was aimed at creating the first online National Atlas which has been used to overcome traditional problems of homogenization of LUC data in Italy. The quantification and qualification of LUC patterns allow us to understand if, and where, post-metropolis condition occurs. This research gives a clear indication of the kind of ongoing phenomena for policy orientation to planners and administrators, especially the one of the green infrastructure approach at the city-region level to solving the emerging environmental challenges.

AB  - Growth within tree populations varies among individuals due to changes in biotic and abiotic factors. The degree of such variation, defined as growth inequality, serves as a useful indicator of the uniformity of growth within a population in response to the prevalent environmental conditions. By application of the Gini coefficient (G), an index for inequality, we characterized the early growth inequality of ninety crosses of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) and their open-pollinated parental lines. Tree cumulative height was measured annually for 8 consecutive years. Both the crosses and parental lines exhibited temporal changes in growth inequality. The inequality of total height among the crosses decreased logarithmically with age by nearly 3-fold after 13 growing seasons, suggesting that tree height became less variable among the crosses as trees grew larger. Interestingly, the Lorenz asymmetry, an index reflecting the shape of the Lorenze curve from which G is derived, revealed that the inequality of annual height increment among the crosses resulted from an alternate contribution of the fast-growing and slow-growing trees. Among parental lines, two provenances with the smallest and the largest overall inequality in total height showed a similar pattern of changes in annual growth inequality, and the provenance differences were consistent over time. Compared to the other provinces, a local provenance exhibited less variation in total height among individual trees as reflected by a smaller value of inequality, and was better adapted to the field conditions. Our results demonstrated the sensitivity and usefulness of the Gini coefficient and Lorenz asymmetry for the analysis of growth inequality in non-natural populations. Growth inequality is a potentially useful evaluation criterion for early selection. Given comparable initial growth, provenances/families with lower growth inequality values would likely outperform those with higher growth inequality, and eventually tree size of the latter would be more variable due to greater variations among individual trees. Assessment of growth inequality at early ages will advance our understanding of variability of tree growth within a population, facilitate forest genetics improvement programs, and enhance the efficiency of tree breeding.

AB  - Global warming is predicted to affect ecosystems, particularly in high-latitude regions where polar amplification accelerates temperature rise and environmental changes. Here, where plants grow under adverse conditions, a warmer climate provides more favourable conditions for growth and regeneration. At the alpine and polar tree line in Finnish Lapland, rising temperatures are assumed to promote densification and expansion of conifers towards fell tops and treeless boreal heathlands beyond the recent tree-line position. In this study, we analysed vegetation changes in the pine treeline ecotone in six study sites in Finnish Lapland using multi-spectral satellite data during 1984-2017. All of the six sites were established in fell areas, covering the transition from closed forest stands of the lower elevations to the open fell tops beyond the treeline position. The southern sites were located in pine dominated-stands, where treelines were of alpine character. The northern sites were located in the polar treeline ecotone where mountain birch forests already dominate the landscape. We assessed shifts in the vegetation pattern of the fell sites using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a RandomForest land-cover classification as indicators of potential change. We did not find clear trends for advancing coniferous tree lines towards open fell tops or treeless heath vegetation, neither by NDVI change detection nor by the land-cover classification. However, we found evidence for densification of open forest stands and sparse vegetation cover in lower elevations and the expansion of deciduous vegetation in higher elevations of previously vegetation-free or sparsely covered fell tops. Increasing stand density was detected mostly in the southern, pine-dominated sites, while the northern sites indicated increasing biomass near the fell tops. Prominent changes in vegetation patterns originated rather from human impact in the southern sites appearing as recent roads, clear-cuttings or infrastructure constructions in skiing areas. In the northern sites, distinctive changes arose from human impact or from biotic disturbance events such as moth outbreaks defoliating mountain birch stands at site Karigasniemi.

AB  - Managing forests for multiple, often conflicting values, coupled with the uncertainty of global environmental change, requires a more flexible approach to maintaining functioning ecosystems into the future. Adaptive management offers such flexibility, but is often hampered by a lack of targeted monitoring data collected in a consistent manner the evidence base. Moreover, effective management of expansive forest ecosystems requires data on both landscape scale processes, as well as finer-scale data on vegetation structure and composition. To address the challenges of adaptive management in forest ecosystems, we tested the ability of a small set of multi-scale indicators to inform management of Minnesota's Northern Great Lakes forest. Using remotely sensed and field data, we monitored changes in forest condition over a 20-year period in the 42,000 ha Manitou forest landscape in northeastern Minnesota. We used multi-temporal remote sensing data to assess landscape-scale changes in disturbance rates, patch size and age structure. With field data, we used a chronosequence method to assess management effects over time on finer scale characteristics such as canopy composition, tree regeneration, vertical structure and coarse woody debris. Combining remotely sensed and field data provided a more robust evidence base for decision-making than either approach could have provided alone. For example, examining remote-sensing data alone indicates that the rate of severe disturbance (timber harvest) peaked during the 20-year analysis period, and has declined in recent years. As disturbance rates declined, patch size and the proportion of forest in later successional stages all increased from year 2000 levels. These indicators of landscape structure showed positive shifts towards conservation objectives, but only tell part of the whole story. Field data elucidate a number of negative trends, including poor regeneration of key species (Picea glauca, Pinus strobus, Thuja occidentalis, Betula alleghaniensis), and simplified structure in young and mature growth stages. In addition, much of the mature forest transitioning into later-successional growth stages lacks the long-lived species and structural characteristics needed to develop late successional conditions. An evidence base compiled from data gathered at both the stand and landscape scale provides the flexibility on which sound adaptive management depends. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data characterizing the mineralogy, hydrochemistry and geomicrobiology of the Tono region of central Japan were used to interpret geochemical constraints on the origin and stability of the Tono Uraniurn Deposit. The derived constraints are compatible with models of deposit formation, which call for leaching of uranium from the upper weathered zone of the Toki Granite by relatively oxidizing groundwaters that are near-neutral to moderately alkaline and carboniferous. The oxidizing groundwaters then migrate into mudstones and sandstones of the overlying Toki Formation, where the Litany] species is reduced by water-rock-microbe interactions to uranous species, sorbed by various detrital and authigenic phases and eventually precipitated as uraninite, coffinite and the metastable, amorphous hydrous oxide, UO2(am).
   Formation of the Tono deposit may have been more or less continuous LIP to the present time. The modern hydrochemical system, upon which the genetic model is based, began to evolve about 15 Ma when seawater was flushed Out of the sedimentary cover and basement granite by fresh, meteoric waters during a period of uplift and erosion preceding Pliocene to Pleistocene sedimentation. Recharge with meteoric water continued to the present, which Suggests that palaeohydrochemical conditions were probably similar to those observed in the region today when the Tono deposit began to form about 10 Ma.
   Redox environments in the Tono region inferred from in-situ Eh measurements in deep boreholes and calculated potentials for the SO42-/HS- redox couple appear to be controlled by heterogeneous reactions involving Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides. Metastable equilibria and particle-size effects associated with these reactions produce a range of possible redox environments that are equally compatible with both the relatively oxidizing and reducing groundwaters of the Toki Granite. This compatibility extends to sedimentary porewaters, where the redox environment is also controlled by microbially mediated sulphate reduction, oxidation of organic matter and precipitation of sulphide minerals. Redox conditions have been stable during at least the past several tens of thousands of years based on palaeoredox indicators interpreted from the trace element contents of fracture calcites. The pH and carbonate contents of palaeogroundwaters and modern groundwaters of the Tono region were, and are, controlled mainly by calcite equilibrium.

AB  - Forest understory vegetation is largely influenced by disturbances and given local abiotic conditions. Our research focuses on the early response of understory vegetation to various forest management intensities in Dinaric fir-beech forests in Slovenia: (i) control, (ii) 50% cut of stand growing stock, and (iii) 100% cut of stand growing stock. Apart from identifying overstory removal effects, we were interested in fine-scale variation of understory vegetation and environmental determinants of its species composition. Vegetation was sampled within 27 karst sinkholes, which represent a dominant landform in studied forests. Within each sinkhole, five sampling plots, varying in slope aspect (centre, north, east, south, west), were established (135 in total), where pre-treatment (in 2012) and post-treatment (in 2014) floristic surveys were conducted. The sampled understory species were characterized in terms of Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs) and plant functional traits (plant height, seed mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content). Diversity metrics (species richness, total cover, Shannon index) increased in plots where the silvicultural measures were applied. Tree species richness also increased in 100% cutting. A redundancy analysis revealed that species composition was related to environmental variables, which are directly influenced by management interventions (overstory canopy cover, microclimate-maximum daily temperature, soil properties-thickness of organic soil layer) as well as by topographic factors (slope inclination and surface rockiness). EIVs for light were significantly affected by treatment intensity, whereas soil-related EIVs (moisture, reaction, nutrients) depended more on the within-sinkhole position. Canopy gaps, compared with uncut control plots, hosted a higher number of colonizing species with a higher plant height and smaller seeds, while leaf traits did not show a clear response. We found a negative correlation between pre-treatment species (functional) richness and post-treatment shifts in floristic (functional) composition. Plots with higher richness exhibited smaller changes compared with species-poor communities. Incorporating different perspectives, the results of this study offer valuable insights into patterns of understory vegetation response to forest management in fir-beech forests.

AB  - The Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and of the four subspecies originally recognized, recent extinctions mean that only two now persist. Recent genetic analyses have cast doubt on the generally accepted taxonomy of the species, where four subspecies were distinguished by coat colour and horn morphology, and propose the distinction of two subspecies based on their mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphism. These analyses make clear the need for a comprehensive revision that integrates genetic and morphological approaches resulting in a definitive description and differentiation of the subspecies.
   Studies of ibex behavioural ecology and health status are scarce and generally descriptive. They should be implemented in an integrative way, taking into account the ecological requirements of the species, current population status, the presence of other sympatric wild and domestic ungulates, and the type of hunting regime and management in their distribution areas.
   A natural expansion of the species is currently taking place. Ibexes are present and well established in all the main mountain ranges of the Spanish Iberian Peninsula, and have recently expanded their range into the north of Portugal. Other authors estimated a total population of more than 50 000 individuals 10 years ago, distributed over more than 60 000 km(2), with an average population density of 2.7 ibex/km(2). However, these estimates were obtained prior to the species' recovery from recent epizootics of sarcoptic mange and should be updated. Survey methods, mainly direct count-based methods, should be adjusted to suit mountainous conditions, where it is difficult to estimate accurately the surveyed surface.
   A series of threats to ibex conservation have been identified, such as population overabundance, disease prevalence and potential competition with domestic livestock and invasive ungulates, along with negative effects of human disturbance through tourism and hunting.
   Applied ecological issues focused on the proper management of populations should be prioritized, along with the identification of current threats based on empirical, ecological data obtained from populations living in various ecological conditions in different regions.

AB  - Major and trace elements, minerals, and grain-size were analysed from the early to mid-Holocene (12 to 4 ky BP) period of a sediment core from the Alpine lake Oberer Landschitzsee (ObLAN, 2076 m a.s.l.), which is located on predominantly crystalline bedrock on the southern slopes of the Austrian Central Alps. Geochemistry and mineralogy were compared with diatom-inferred (Di-) 'date of autumn mixing' (A(mix)), DOC, pH, and selected indicator pollen species from the same sediment core. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a positive correlation between processes triggered by temperature and precipitation (e.g., lake mixing, DOC). PCA grouped indicators of physical weathering and enhanced catchment run-off (sand, quartz, feldspar), elements of weathering (e.g., Ti, Rb, Mn) under dryer conditions (clay to silt fractions), and elements that probably were related to changes in redox conditions (Cu, Fe, S, Zn). The duration and height of the snow-pack played an important role in this high-alpine environment, affecting weathering, erosion, pH, and lake stratification. Low Alnus viridis pollen abundance, together with markers for increased elements of erosion, indicated extensive snow-pack. Changes in S coupled with As, and elements indicating increased weathering, reflected climate oscillations. LOI was affected by productivity and erosion. High (late) Di-A(mix) coupled with increased Di-DOC indicated prolonged summers with increased productivity. Cold and wet (snow-rich) phases and subsequent melting caused low pH and a decoupling of the significant linear correlation between sedimentary Ca and Di-pH. Weathering and leaching during climate deteriorations opposed the long-term trend in a loss of cations and forced in-lake alkalinity generation during the following lake warming. Overall, the multi-proxy study indicated complex climate-driven processes within different time-scales (long-term trends, climate oscillations, seasonality). The climate oscillations within 12-5 ky BP corresponded well with the cool and wet phases known from central Europe suggesting a dominant common Atlantic climate impact. When Mediterranean climate established between 5 and 4 ky BP, its influence on the southern slopes of the Alps increased.

AB  - The impact of soil cover organization on the forest community has been studied in a 19-ha tract at Piste de St Elie station in French Guiana. 195 species each represented by at least 10 individuals were chosen from records of the position, diameter at breast height (dbh) and precise identification by botanical sampling of 12 104 ligneous plants (dbh greater than or equal to 10 cm).
   Spatial variations in the soil were mapped using the method proposed by Boulet et al. (1982). The soil mapping units correspond to the successive stages of evolution of a currently unbalanced ferralitic cover. These stages describe firstly the thinning by erosion of the microaggregated upper horizon and secondly the mineralogical changes under more or less extended hydromorphic conditions. The degree of evolution of ferralitic cover is also related to the hydrodynamic functioning and chemical properties of the soil. Geological substrate, topography and slope have also been taken into account.
   Analysis of the influence of environmental variables on plant cover has been performed using the Ecological Profiles method and Correspondence Analysis (CA) of the table of ecological profiles.
   The forest community seems to be dependent on the soil and the topographical features that govern it. There are significant, exclusive soil-species links for each soil functioning mapping unit. However, the highest proportion of significant positive links is connected with a thick microaggregated horizon (25%). Several species are of real value as indicators and more particularly enable differentiation between the forest stands of typical ferralitic soil and the ones of thinned out, transformed and hydromorphic soils. The CA of the species by environmental variables matrices reveals two significant factorial axes. The first can be associated with the drainage mainly related to the thinning of the soil and the second with the hydromorphic conditions related to the topography. The vegetation ordination of the stands (congruent to 0.25 ha) delimited in the various soil domains clearly shows that changes in ferralitic cover and in particular the transition from soil with deep vertical drainage to soil with superficial lateral drainage is accompanied by substantial changes in the forest community.

AB  - Plant phenology characterises the seasonal cyclicity of biological events such as budburst, flowering, fructification, leaf senescence and leaf fall. These biological events are genetically pre-determined but also strongly modulated by climatic conditions, particularly temperature, daylength and water availability. Therefore, the timing of these events is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts and as a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation climate interactions. In situ observations, empirical or bioclimatic models and remotely sensed time-series data constitute the three possible ways for monitoring the timing of plant phenological events. Remote sensing has the advantage of being the only way of surface sampling at high temporal frequency and, in the case of satellite-based remote sensing, over large regions. Nevertheless, exogenous factors, particularly atmospheric conditions, lead to some uncertainties on the seasonal course of surface reflectance and cause bias in the identification of vegetation phenological events. Since 2005, a network of forest and herbaceous sites has been equipped with laboratory made NDVI sensors to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy structure and phenology at an intra-daily time step. In this study, we present recent results obtained in several contrasting biomes in France, French Guiana, Belgium and Congo. These sites represent a gradient of vegetation ecosystems: the main evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in temperate climate region, an evergreen tropical rain forest in French Guiana, an herbaceous savanna ecosystem in Congo, and a succession of three annual crops in Belgium. In this paper, (1) we provide an accurate description of the seasonal dynamics of vegetation cover in these different ecosystems (2) we identify the most relevant remotely sensed markers from NDVI time-series for determining the dates of the main phenological events that characterize these ecosystems and (3) we discuss the relationships between temporal canopy dynamics and climate factors. In addition to its importance for phenological studies, this ground-based Network of NDVI measurement provides data needed for the calibration and direct validation of satellite observations and products.

AB  - Leperditiid and beyrichiid ostracodes in marine margin deposits of the Devonian Catskill magnafacies of New York State document brackish conditions in what were previously considered freshwater floodplain deposits. The very low diversity ostracode fauna (two species) includes an abundance of anomalously thin-shelled individuals that belong to the genera Leperditia? and Welleria. This ostracode fauna is one of the oldest reported from brackish water in the stratigraphic record, and it documents the early ecological radiation of ostracodes into waters of reduced salinity. Associated fossils, including the bivalve Archanodon and the conchostracan Euestheria, have been considered to be freshwater forms, partly because of their occurrence in these rocks that were assumed to be: fluvial in origin. Nearly everywhere, however, the ostracodes are associated with cosmine-bearing fish fragments, lingulid brachiopods, and the feeding trace Spirophyton, which have a marine or brackish-water affiliation. The presence of open carapaces on bedding planes as well as adults and several instar stages of each ostracode species indicate lack of postmortem transport. At least one ostracode-bearing mudstone contains the mineral amesite; associated calcareous mudrocks interbedded with these units contain symmetrical ripple marks, mudcracks, and locally intense manganese-oxide staining. Collectively, these features indicate extreme environmental conditions and suggest highly variable salinities in shallow pools or embayments along the paleoshoreline. The presence of brackish-water faunas, perhaps estuarine in origin, indicates an aspect of the diversity of Devonian paleoenvironments along this portion of the Catskill deltaic complex not previously recognized. The deposits are widespread, although not ubiquitous, within thick sequences of fine-grained flood-basin deposits. Because mast previous paleoecological studies of fossils from these rocks assumed the sediments to be of freshwater origin, the new interpretation of brackish-water communities presented here could have important implications for understanding the evolution of early terrestrial organisms. For example, some animals may have evolved in brackish estuarine environments rather than in freshwater rivers as assumed in previous studies. Recognition of this brackish facies elsewhere in the Catskill succession will not only aid future identification of paleoshoreline position but may also help clarify whether early terrestrial organisms made the transition to land via brackish or freshwater environments.

AB  - Liverworts are non-vascular cryptogamic plants with wide geographic distributions due to their capacity to disperse their spores over long distances, although they have no epidermal cuticle, sensitive to external environmental conditions, found only in very specific microenvironments - and are therefore widely used as bioindicators. We evaluated the floristic composition of liverworts in localities located in different Atlantic Forest vegetation types in southeastern Brazil to address the following questions: Is the liverwort flora distributed uniformly or randomly, or does it demonstrate environmental niche restrictions at regional scales? If the distribution of liverworts is deterministic, do geoclimatic variables act as environmental filters for this flora? Can liverwort species be considered bioindicators of the different Atlantic Forest vegetation types? We undertook floristic surveys in 26 localities to evaluate the beta diversity of the liverwort flora and its correlation with environmental gradients (geoclimatic variables) using multivariate analyses and the Mantel Test. Ordination and classification methods indicated elevated beta diversity in a deterministic distribution of the liverwort flora along the Atlantic coast of southeastern Brazil. Altitude was significantly associated with the first axis of the CCA, demonstrating a floristic gradient between Lowland Forests and High Montane Forests and "Campos de Altitude". Five floristic groups were identified and 34 species could be considered bioindicators. The principal geoclimatic variables that explained the floristic groupings of liverwort species were altitude, temperature, and precipitation. The prediction that liverwort plants demonstrated environmentally determined distributions was confirmed by the Mantel Test (rM 0.557; p < 0.0001). Our results support the idea that the liverwort flora of the coastal Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil comprises part of a regional pool of species whose establishment and survival are determined by abiotic filters acting in those habitats. The low similarities between localities and the high numbers of indicator species suggest that the liverwort vegetation has a deterministic distribution at the regional level which corroborates their use as bioindicators of vegetation types and of environmental conditions. Although species distributions are principally determined by environmental niches, geographical distances (dispersal limitation) are important in regions such as oceanic islands and coastal mountains.

AB  - A novel catalytic kinetic method is proposed for the determination of Se(IV), Se(VI) and total inorganic selenium in water based on the catalytic effect of Se(IV) on the reduction of bromate by p-nitrophenylhydrazine at pH 3.0. The generated bromine, Br-2 or Cl-2 plus Br-2 in 0.1 M NaCl (or NaBr) environment efficiently decolorized Calmagite and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 523 nm as a function of time. In this indicator reaction, bromide acted as an activator for the catalysis of selenium (IV) and a reducing agent for selenium (VI) at pH 3.0, which allowed the determination of total selenium. The fixed time method was adopted for the determination and speciation of inorganic selenium. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration graph are linear in the range 1 - 35 mu g L-1 of Se(IV) for the fixed time method at 25 degrees C. The detection limit based on statistical 3S(blank)/m-criterion was 0.215 mu g L-1 for the fixed time method (7 min). All of the variables that affect the sensitivity at 523 nm were investigated, and the optimum conditions were established. The interference effect of various cations and anions on the Se (IV) determination was also studied. The selectivity of the selenium determination was greatly improved with the use of the strongly cation exchange resin such as Amberlite IR120 plus. The proposed kinetic method was validated statistically and through recovery studies in natural water samples. The RSDs for ten replicate measurements of 5, 15 and 25 mu g L-1 of Se(IV) and Se(VI) was changed between 2.1 - 4.85%. Analyses of a certified standard reference material (NIST SRM 1643e) for selenium using the fixed-time method showed that the proposed kinetic method has good accuracy. Se(IV), Se(VI) and total inorganic selenium in environmental water samples have been successfully determined by this method after selective reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV).

AB  - This study aimed at integrating postexposure feeding and some biochemical parameters in the responses of the estuarine polychaeta, Hediste diversicolor, to controlled laboratory exposure conditions and to in situ exposures scenario of sediment contamination. Since H. diversicolor feeding may be considered as a major rate-limiting step in the processing of detritus in European estuaries, a reduction in feeding activity may have implications not only at the individual and population level of the species but also in detritus processing and in organic matter decomposition rates at the ecosystem level. The biochemical parameters were chosen as indicators of four key physiological functions: neurotransmission, metabolic condition, detoxitication processes and antioxidant defences. The Mira and Sado estuaries, located in the Southwest coast of Portugal and classified as undisturbed and impacted, respectively, were selected as sites for this study. A significant depression in H. diversicolor postexposure feeding (from 30 to 70%) was consistently detected in all impacted sediments, supporting the sensitivity and responsiveness of feeding as a sublethal toxicity endpoint. Alongside with a reduced energy intake, an increased rate of organisms' anaerobic metabolism, as evidenced by an enhancement of lactate dehydrogenase activity (up to 1.5-fold), suggested a rapid need of additional energy to ameliorate chemical stress. Moreover, oxidative stress was shown to be an important mechanism of toxicity of the impacted sediments in H. diversicolor, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the glutathione redox status (up to 6.5-fold) and an increase in lipid peroxides levels (up to 2.3-fold) in organisms exposed to the most impacted sediments. Results of the in situ assay, conducted to assess the ecological relevance of sediment laboratory toxicity estimates and their application to make valid field extrapolations, revealed a lack of agreement in the response of catalase in organisms exposed to moderate impacted sediments. Our results support the utility of integrating responses at individual and sub-individual level to evaluate potential toxicant-induced changes in key physiological functions of H. diversicolor and to interpret their potential ecological consequences.

AB  - The Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental history from Pacific slopes of the western Andes is reconstructed by pollen analysis of 32 samples from two marine sediment cores from the Panama Basin, eastern equatorial Pacific: core ODP 677B (83 degrees 44.2200' W, 1 degrees 12.1440'N, 3473 m water depth) is 185 cm long and spans the last 39,410 years, core TR 163-38 (81.583 degrees W, 1.337 degrees N, 2200 m water depth) is 103 cm long and covers the last 17,380 years. Six ecological groups were established: mangrove, brackish and fresh water swamps, terra firma lowland forests, broad range taxa, Andean forests, and open vegetation. A good correspondence was found between the changes of these ecological groups in the two cores. The records evidence the continuous presence of all vegetation types during the last 39,410 years and specially the uninterrupted occurrence of tropical rain forest. They record a development from: (1) a cold and humid phase (39,410-28,120 yr cal BP) with moderately high sea levels, (2) the coldest and driest phase in the record (28,120-14,500 yr cal BP) accompanied by the lowest sea levels, (3) a transitional phase when sea level rose and humid conditions dominated, (4) a stage (11,300-5600 yr cal BP) of the highest sea levels and moisture conditions including a drier period similar to 7000 yr BP, to (5) a final period (5600 yr cal BP-Present) when sea level reached its present height, humidity persisted, and indicators of disturbance expanded. Peaks in pollen and spore concentration, associated with high river discharge periods, indicate periods of higher precipitation around 33,500, 28,000 and 12,000-9000 yr cal BP. Although main vegetation responses seem to reflect rainfall and moisture variations, a good correspondence was found between delta O-18 values and percentages of Andean and lowland pollen, suggesting that vegetation also responded to tempearture changes.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental variables were evaluated at 45 stream sites throughout the Puget Sound Basin, Washington, USA. Environmental variables were measured at 3 spatial scales: reach, local, and whole watershed. Macroinvertebrate distributions were related to environmental variables using canonical correspondence analysis to determine which variables and spatial scales best explained the observed community composition and to identify biota-land cover optima. The calculation of a biota-land cover optimum was a 2-step process. First, an individual taxon's optimum was estimated for a particular land cover by weighting the mean value for that land cover by the abundance of that taxon at all sites. Second, the biota-land cover optimum was determined as the point at which the greatest numbers of taxa, at their calculated optima, appeared for a particular land cover. Sampling reaches were located on streams in watersheds with varying levels of forest, agriculture, and urban/suburban land cover that represented the full range of physical conditions typically found in Puget Sound streams. At the reach scale, taxa composition was correlated with conductivity and mean velocity. At the local and whole-watershed scales, taxa composition was correlated with % forest and agricultural land cover and % forest and bedrock land cover, respectively. For all of the scales, the dominant environmental variables represented an anthropogenic gradient. There was little difference in the amount of variability explained by each spatial scale. At the local-watershed scale, a biota-land cover optimum of similar to80 to 90% forest land cover was identified. The total number of taxa at their optima declined rapidly as forest land cover within the local scale declined below 80 to 90%. At the whole-watershed scale, a biota-land cover optimum of 70 to 80% forest land cover was identified. The total number of taxa at their optima declined rapidly as forest land cover within the whole watershed declined below 70 to 80%. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrates can be used both as quantitative indicators of environmental conditions at multiple scales and indicators of land cover optima. Further examination of these optima could be used to establish priorities for conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - We address the task of determining the effects, on mean population density or other parameters, of an unreplicated perturbation, such as arises in environmental assessments and some ecosystem-level experiments. Our context is the Before-After-Control-Impact-Pairs design (BACIP): on several dates Before and After the perturbation, samples are collected simultaneously at both the Impact site and a nearby "Control."
   One approach is to test whether the mean of the Impact-Control difference has changed from Before to After the perturbation. If a conventional test is used, checks of its assumptions are an important and messy part of the analysis, since BACIP data do not necessarily satisfy them. It has been suggested that these checks are not needed for randomization tests, because they are insensitive to some of these assumptions and can be adjusted to allow for others. A major aim of this paper is to refute this suggestion: there is no panacea for the difficult and messy technical problems in the analysis of data from assessments or unreplicated experiments.
   We compare the randomization t test with the standard t test and the modified (Welch-Satterthwaite-Aspin) t test, which allows for unequal variances. We conclude that the randomization t test is less likely to yield valid inferences than is the Welch t test, because it requires identical distributions for small sample sizes and either equal variances or equal sample sizes for larger ones. The formal requirement of Normality is not crucial to the Welch t test.
   Both parametric and randomization tests require that time and location effects be additive and that Impact-Control differences on different dates be independent. These assumptions should be tested; if they are seriously wrong, alternative analyses are needed. This will often require a long time series of data.
   Finally, for assessing the importance of a perturbation, the P value of a hypothesis test is rarely as useful as an estimate of the size of the effect. Especially if effect size varies with time and conditions, flexible estimation methods with approximate answers are preferable to formally exact P values.

AB  - Soil development and landscape evolution were studied in the basin-shaped Phobjikha Valley at 2900-3200 m a.s.l., to the west of the Black Mountain Range, West Central Bhutan. The local environmental setting with strong along-valley winds, frequent freeze-thaw cycles, extensive dry periods and sparse vegetation cover seems to encourage the generation and short-distance transport of silt-sized particles. The effects of this process are evidenced in the smooth valley morphology and in the nature of the examined pedons. Their involvement in continuing redistribution of local sediments is reflected by a homogeneous silty-clayey and stone-free texture, varying profile depths, buried topsoils and weakly developed recent A horizons. In protected locations, in situ weathering of metamorphic parent materials results in alu-andic features with bulk densities <0.9 g cm(-3), (Al-o + 1/2Fe(o)) > 2%, and phosphate retention >95%. Dominance by Al-hydroxy interlayered clay minerals and large amounts of well-crystallised iron oxides indicate an advanced stage of weathering. in areas of preferred eolian deposition, argic and ferralic features emerge, with clay contents of up to 60% and surface areas of >50 M-2 g(-1). Under forest, umbric horizons can develop. CECeff is below 10 cmol(c) kg(-1) at all sites. Cluster and factor analyses of soil chemical and physical parameters confirm the redistribution of local sediments as a dominant factor behind the measured variables. No clear indication of glacial activities in the area was found, whereas the massive silty sediments in the lower parts of most profiles, the presence of debris slopes, and the asymmetric cross sections of the side valleys suggest periglacial conditions. Buried topsoils dated at about 2000 conventional C-14 years BP indicate a weakening or absence of sediment influx under wetter conditions towards the end of the Holocene climate optimum. Charcoal on top of paleosols suggests that human activities of deforestation, grazing and arable agriculture may have contributed to the reactivation of local sediment redistribution until today.

AB  - Little is known about the importance of the forest overstorey relative to other factors in controlling the spatial variability in understorey species composition in near-natural temperate broadleaved forests. We addressed this question for the 19 ha ancient forest Suserup Skov (55 degrees 22' N, 11 degrees 34' E) in Denmark, one of the few old-growth temperate broadleaved forest remnants in north-western Europe, by inventorying understorey species composition and environmental conditions in 163 100 m(2) plots. We use unconstrained and constrained ordinations, variation partitioning, and Indicator Species Analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of the forest overstorey in controlling understorey species composition. Comparison of the gradients extracted by unconstrained and constrained ordinations showed that the main gradients in understorey species composition in our old-growth temperate broadleaved forest remnant are not caused by variability in the forest overstorey, but are related to topography and soil, edge effects, and unknown broad-scale factors. Nevertheless, overstorey-related variables uniquely accounted for 15% of the total explained variation in understorey species composition, with the pure overstorey-related (R-po), topography and soil (R-pt), edge and anthropogenic disturbance effects (R-pa), and spatial (R-ps) variation fractions being of equal magnitude. The forward variable selection showed that among the overstorey-related variables understorey light availability and to a lesser extent vertical forest structure were most important for understorey species composition. No unique influence of overstorey tree species identity could be documented. There were many indicator species for high understorey light levels and canopy gap centres, but none for medium or low light or closed canopy. Hence, no understorey species behaved as obligate shade plants. Our study shows that, the forest overstorey has a weak control of understorey species composition in near-natural broadleaved forest, in contrast to results from natural and managed forests comprising both conifer and broadleaved species. Nevertheless, > 20% of the understorey species found were indicators of high light conditions or canopy openings. Hence, variability in canopy structure and understorey light availability is important for maintaining understorey species diversity.

AB  - Pinna nobilis is a large bivalve endemic to the Mediterranean Sea that lives in shallow coastal areas. Due to its size and relatively fast shell growth rates, it is an interesting taxon for high-resolution study of nitrogen isotopes of carbonate bound organic matter (delta N-15(CBOM)). In this study we tested if P. nobilis shells can be used as an indicator of the nitrogen isotope baseline of the system, if it can provide high-resolution data on environmental delta N-15 variability, and if the chemical properties of the shell and biomineralization process change in response to mass mortality events spreading in the Mediterranean. Shells were opportunistically collected during 2019 and 2020 by skin diving, as a part of a project on mortality monitoring, from four shallow coastal localities in the eastern Adriatic. Shell powder for delta N-15(CBOM) analysis was collected by milling sample swaths from the internal (low-resolution) and external (high resolution) shell surface. Significant differences in delta N-15(CBOM), obtained from the internal shell surface, were observed between sampling localities with different anthropogenic influences, with lowest values (similar to 3-4 parts per thousand) recorded for shells obtained from Pag Bay, and highest (similar to 6-8 parts per thousand) for shells sampled in Lim and Kastela Bays. High-resolution samples from the external shell surface of Pinna nobilis showed spatial and temporal variations in delta N-15(CBOM) values, with temporal resolution of 1-3 weeks. High-resolution delta N-15(CBOM) data obtained from the shell Kas1 corresponded to a time interval from spring 2018 to summer 2019 and had a pronounced increase of delta N-15(CBOM) values closest to the shell margin coupled with a decrease in delta C-13(shell) values, indicating that this animal was experiencing stressful conditions several months prior to its death. According to our findings, delta N-15(CBOM) values from P. nobilis shells can serve as an indicator of the isotopic baseline of the ecosystem potentially as a powerful tool to study bivalve physiology.

AB  - Variation in pH (acidification) and salinity conditions have severe impact at different levels of biological organization in fish. Present study focused to assess the effects of acidification and salinity changes on physiological stress responses at three different levels of function: i) hormonal and oxidative response, ii) osmoregulation and iii) reproduction, in order to identify relevant biomarkers. Second objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of plant (Mucuna pruriens) extract for alleviating pH and salinity related stress. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were exposed to different pH (6.0, 5.5, 5.0) and salinity (1.5, 3.0, 4.5 ppt) for 7, 14 and 21 days. Following exposure to stress for respective duration, fish were fed diet containing methanol extract of Mucuna seeds (dose 0.80 gm/kg feed) for 7, 14 and 21 days to measure their possible recovery response. Stress hormone (cortisol), hepatic oxidative stress parameters [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRd), glutathione peroxidise (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)], gill osmoregulatory response (Na+-K(+)ATPase activity), sex steroid profiles and mating behaviours (gonopodial thrust and gestation period) were estimated. Cortisol and MDA levels increased with dose and duration of acid and salinity stress, and cortisol levels were higher in males than in females. Effect on Na+-K(+)ATPase activity was more intense by salinity stress rather than pH induced stress. Both acid and salinity stress reduced sex steroid levels, and mating response was highly affected by both stresses in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. Mucuna treatment reduced stress-induced alteration of cortisol, MDA, Na+-K(+)ATPase activity and reproductive parameters. Dietary administration of Mucuna seed extract decreased the intensity of environmental stressors at all three functional levels. Mucuna treatment was more effective against salinity stress than acid stress. Thus, cortisol, oxidative stress marker MDA and Na+-K(+)ATPase could be effective indicators for acid and salinity stress in wild and domestic fish populations. Dietary administration of Mucuna extract may limit the detrimental effects of acidification and salinity variations that are the inevitable outcomes expected under global climate change conditions.

AB  - Mediterranean karst aquifers are sensitive systems vulnerable to contamination, exhibiting high rates of diversity and endemicity. In the present pilot-study, we aimed to detect the most suitable bioindicators of contaminant accumulation and mobilization within a Mediterranean karst river (Krka River, Croatia), whose lowermost sections belong to a designated protection area (national park). To meet our goal, we sampled water, drift and benthos (macroinvertebrates and periphytic microfauna) at the two Krka River sites, located upstream and downstream from town Knin and its urban influences. We compared: 1) environmental conditions (water physico-chemical parameters, trace- and macroelement concentrations); 2) abundance and diversity of periphyton and macroinvertebrate taxa constituting benthos; and 3) macroinvertebrate benthos-drift relationships between the two sites. Despite higher values of all measured physico-chemical parameters, and most trace- and macro-element concentrations at the urban-influenced site, the concentrations of contamination indicators (i.e., COD, nutrients, metals) at both sites were generally low. This is likely a result of specific "self-purification ability" of the Krka River, mediated by relatively high contaminant retention potential of the underlying tufa (i.e., calcareous) and/or macrophyte substrates. Between-site differences in water quality further affected the spatial variation of macrozoobenthos, drift, and periphytic microfauna. We suggest that increased COD and orthophosphate concentration, and macrophyte presence at the urban-influenced site, supported higher densities and diversity of benthic organisms dominated by eurivalent (i.e., contamination-tolerant) taxa. The most numerous macroinvertebrate taxa in benthos were amphipod Gamma us balcanicus and the representatives of the endemic Dinaric karst taxa - gastropods Emmericia patula and Radomaniola curta germari, and another amphipod Echinogammarus acarinatus. Although we expected to observe significantly increased drift at the urban-influenced site due to the degraded environmental conditions, it was not observed. The observed benthos-drift patterns suggest that freshwater amphipods (i.e., gammarids), which were found most numerous in drift, could be considered as the most suitable bioindicators of a contaminant (i.e., metal) accumulation and mobilization within karst aquifers comparable to Krka River.

AB  - Water pollution problems related to rapid economic development have received considerable attention in recent years, and water eutrophication has become one of the greatest threats to aquatic environments around the world. In this study, we introduce a eutrophication risk assessment method to address the urgent need for simple but effective modeling tools to support environmental management. This method is based on a bioaccumulation model and algal growth dynamics. The water eutrophication risk is expressed by the ratio of the algal concentration in a water body and the critical algal concentration for eutrophication. The combined and cumulative effects of meteorological factors (e.g., temperature and light intensity), water quality factors (e.g., TN, TP, and NH3-N), and biological factors (e.g., algal settlement and normal death) on eutrophication are considered. We examine the advantages of our eutrophication risk assessment model using the seasonal, mesotrophic Xikeng Reservoir (Shenzhen City, China) as a case study and analyze three typical sets of meteorological and water quality conditions. Prior parameter distributions were chosen based on both a literature survey and experimental research. The results indicate that the combined actions of multiple external factors have a long impact on the eutrophication risk of the Xikeng Reservoir. Eutrophication was observed on the 6th day of the simulation time in the Xikeng Reservoir under the influence of higher temperature (T= 28.3 degrees C), higher light intensity (I = 6037 lx), and higher pollutants concentration (C-TN = 5.40 mg/L, C-TP = 0.391 mg/L, CNH3-N = 4.18 mg/L). These findings indicate that Xikeng Reservoir influence by similar environmental conditions should receive more of our attention to prevent eutrophication. Finally, we highlight the benefits of the new eutrophication risk assessment model, including its simple calculation process, reduced parameter set, and accurate prediction of eutrophication tendency. These features make the model perfectly suited for stakeholders and policy makers who need to make risk management assessment of environmental water, especially for the environmental management of areas where data are unavailable.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the research on biogenic sediments from the Jalewka profile (Podlasie region, NE Poland) situated at the foot of a dry valley slope. A 35 cm monolith of sediments was collected from the excavation pit. The sediments were deposited beneath 4 m thick mineral sediments. Interdisciplinary research helped to reconstruct the possible transformations of the local environment. Palynological, physical, and geochemical analyses were applied to organic sediments, and plant macroremains were examined. Five local pollen zones were identified in palynological terms and correlated with the late Warta Stadial (MIS 6) of the Odra Glaciation (Saalian), and four older periods of the Eemian Interglacial: MIS 5e (E1, E2, E3 and E4). Younger zones have not been preserved. They were eroded in the early Vistulian. During the late MIS 6, there was a eutrophic water body with highly transparent water, characterized by a relative stable water level. The landscape was dominated by tundra with a high proportion of Juniperuse-Artemisia. Curves of oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotopes confirmed the boundary between MIS 6 and MIS 5e. The beginning of the interglacial vegetation succession (E1) was characterized by expansion of birch-pine-spruce forests. Probably at the end of this period, the lake became shallower. E2 is distinguished by the dominance of pine and birch. The lake was replaced by a peat bog. The sequence of vegetation succession in the landscape was as follows: Quercus (E3), Corylus, Fraxinus-Alnus and Tilia (E4). Probably, the peat bog drained in the E4 and the water level rose again in the climate optimum of the Eemian Interglacial. The results of physical and geochemical analysis clearly corresponded with climatic changes determined by palynological analysis. They provided evidence of the changing redox conditions, variability and intensity of denudation, the scale of biological productivity, and fertility of the environment. The studied sediments were characterized by reducing conditions. The increase in terrigenous silica content and the relatively high N:K ratio indicated the predominance of mechanical denudation during the late glacial period of the Warta Stadial and the E2 period.

AB  - Purpose. To summarize and formalize the estimates of landslide risk levels based on the proposed classification of relevant environmental or man-made risks in the regions of Ukraine and local territories, including a gully-ravine network and man-made slopes of technology-related objects that represent certain environmental or man-made risk for residential areas.
   Methods. To achieve the objective, the following methodological approaches have been applied: analysis of the literature regarding state-of-the-art research on the issues of landslide phenomena assessment and prediction at regional and local levels, zonal-statistical analysis of orographic data for the each region of Ukraine with calculations of the relief integral coefficients, methods for comprehensive evaluation of natural and man-made slopes stability with the consideration of their geometry, water saturation, geoclimatic conditions and technogenic impacts; methods of geomechanical assessment, environmental evaluation and forecasting of landslide risk in natural geosystems and man-made slopes based on the stability factor, and scientific generalization of landslide risks using mathematical models developed by the authors and proposed criteria for watering extent and soil deformation in natural and man-made slopes.
   Findings. The five-level scale for evaluating landslide risk for natural and man-made slopes has been substantiated in terms of their stability control. The proposed landslide risk scale makes it possible to forecast reliably the geomechanical state of the rock mass depending on the values of the slope stability factor in changing geoclimatic conditions and substantiate effective anti-landslide engineering measures. Landslide risk classification of natural slopes according to the stability factor value has been proposed. The scale is recommended for assessing the stability of man-made slopes comprised of solid and bulk rocks and for forecasting the environmental risk from landslides resulting from emergency situations
   Originality. It has been proved that the number of landslides per unit of precipitation in a region with certain relief is a constant value. The dependences for determining the critical amount of precipitation that will cause a single landslide within the gully-ravine network depending on the specific area of the landslide- prone site and on the relief have been obtained.

AB  - The composition and ecological-geographical features of the rarest endemic species of vascular plants of Siberia are considered, including 50 species known so far only from their classical location (so-called stenoendemics). Their share is about 1% of the flora of vascular plants of Siberia. For the first time, according to floristic zoning, the composition of the chorological groups of the stenoendemics of Siberia has been established. The zones of concentration of their ranges are determined. The largest number of species studied (23) is concentrated in the Altai-Siberian ecoregion. A significant number of stenoendemic species is also represented in the Baikal-Siberian (10) and West Siberian (8) regions. It has been quantitatively proven that the most favorable conditions for the existence of stenoendemics are in Southern Siberia. The mountain systems of Altai and Sayan provide the most diverse spectra of habitats for the successful implementation of microevolutionary processes, as well as the level of isolation sufficient to isolate new species. For the determination of the environmental conditions conducive to the speciation processes, the grouping of the studied species according to their belonging to floristic complexes is carried out. More than a third of the studied species of the Altai-Siberian ecoregion (9 out of 23) are confined to the high-mountain floristic complex. Stenoendemics of the forest floristic complex are concentrated in the Altai-Siberian and West Siberian ecoregions and form a grouping comparable in value to the high-mountain floristic complex types. In the Baikal-Siberian, species of the steppe floristic complex predominate, which is due to the diversity of the steppe areas and their insular character. It has been established that the level of state protection of the studied species is unacceptably low, since none of them are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. To assess the degree of study and the prospects for further research on endemic species, a methodology for their ranking by quantitative indicators has been developed and tested. The recommendations presented in the article should be the basis for the consideration of questions regarding the inclusion of the studied endemic species of vascular plants of Siberia into the lists of rare and endangered plants of the Russian Federation.

AB  - To find a solution regarding sustainable arable land use pattern in the important grain-producing area during the rapid urbanization process, this study combined agricultural production, locational condition, and ecological protection to determine optimal arable land use. Dongting Lake basin, one of the major grain producing areas in China, was chosen as the study area. The analysis of land use transition, the calculation of arable land barycenter, the landscape indices of arable land patches, and the comprehensive evaluation of arable land quality(productivity, economic location, and ecological condition) were adopted in this study. The results showed that (1) in 1990-2000, the arable land increased by 11.77%, and the transformation between arable land and other land use types actively occurred; in 2000-2010, the arable land decreased by 0.71%, and more ecological area (forestland, grassland, and water area) were disturbed and transferred into arable land; (2) urban expansion of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan city cluster (the major economy center of this area) induced the northward movement of the arable land barycenter; (3) the landscape fragmentation and decentralization degree of arable land patches increased during 1990-2010; (4) potential high-quality arable land is located in the zonal area around Dongting Lake, which contains the Li County, Linli County, Jinshi County, Taoyuan County, Taojiang County, Ningxiang County, Xiangxiang County, Shaoshan County, Miluo County, and Zhuzhou County. The inferior low-quality arable land is located in the northwestern Wuling mountainous area, the southeastern hilly area, and the densely populated big cities and their surrounding area. In the optimized arable land use pattern, the high-quality land should be intensively used, and the low-quality arable land should be reduced used or prohibitively used. What is more, it is necessary to quit the arable land away from the surrounding area of cities appropriately, in order to allow more space for urban expansion. This study could provide guidance for sustainable arable land use by both satisfying the future agricultural production and the local economic development, which can be used for the other major grain-producing areas in this rapid developing country.

AB  - A study on coccolithophores from the sediment trap samples, collected over a period of one year (January 1992-December 1992) from three trap locations in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) were used to understand their production and export processes in relation to diverse oceanographic regimes associated with the reversing monsoons. A total of 25 species of coccolithophores were identified, which include some of the ecologically important species: viz: Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Florisphaera profunda, Umbellosphaera irregularis, Emiliania huxleyi, Oolithotus antillarum, U. tenuis, Helicosphaera carteri and Calcidiscus leptoporus. The total coccolithophore fluxes increased from the northern to southern Bay of Bengal where G. oceanica, U. sibogae and E. huxleyi were dominant species displaying seasonality with peak fluxes occurring during southwest (SW) and northeast (NE) monsoons reflecting their affinity for nutrient-rich waters brought in by river plumes, divergences and cyclonic eddies. U. irregularis, an indicator of oligotrophic/warm water, recorded peak abundance fluxes only during the spring intermonsoon period at all trap locations thus inferring its preference for oligotrophic conditions caused by increased Sea Surface Temperature (SST), stratification and lack of nutrient supply due to weak wind velocities. The deep dwelling species. F. profunda recorded high fluxes during the fall interrnonsoon (October/November) in the northern and southern traps during the spring intermonsoon. The peak fluxes observed during the spring intermonsoon (April/May) in the central and southern traps indicated the prevalence of a deep nutridine when oligotrophic conditions prevailed at the surface. The interannual variability of coccolithophore assemblages between the years 1992 and 1994 may be attributed to the prevalence of ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) and negative IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) during 1992 and moderate ENSO and positive IOD with different ocean dynamics in 1994. Interestingly, dissolution was encountered as evidenced by the presence of corroded coccoliths. Similarly, mechanical breakage of coccoliths was also observed. It is believed that the biologically mediated processes were the main factors responsible for both the dissolution and mechanical breakage of coccoliths. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large-river floodplains have been subjected to profound human-caused alteration, but subsequent effects on landbirds in these habitats are largely unknown. To assess the extent to which landscape measures might serve as ecological indicators in these systems, we examined patterns of habitat use by forest birds along a 380-km stretch of the Wisconsin River, USA. We surveyed forest bird communities during the breeding season in 1999 and 2000 at 48 sites divided among six reaches of the 100-year floodplain. Several tree and bird species thought to be characteristic of floodplain forests in Wisconsin, based on earlier surveys, appear to have declined in abundance or were absent altogether, even in reaches located in a 150-km undammed stretch of the river. Bird species richness was similar among reaches, but overall abundance was notably lower at the two northernmost reaches. The most widespread and abundant birds were those that are typically associated with forest edge habitats, but several species associated with forest interior conditions were also relatively abundant. A canonical correspondence analysis based on a model derived from the entire pool of environmental variables indicated that most of the variation in avian community structure was accounted for by geographic variables describing latitudinal changes and distance from potential source habitats along the Mississippi River. Partial ordinations and univariate variance partitioning, however, showed confounding among environmental variable sets and revealed that local-habitat measures tended to explain somewhat more variation than geographic variables. Metrics describing landscape pattern and composition accounted for the least amount of independent variation among the three variables sets. Our results indicate that landscape measures are necessary, but not sufficient to describe patterns of habitat use by forest birds in the Wisconsin River floodplain. Moreover, our data suggest that, while maintaining habitat for forest birds is still possible in these areas, it may be more difficult to conserve species with an affinity for conditions that characterize floodplains. This study further demonstrates that, for some species, designations such as "forest interior" or "edge" are not always portable from one region to another or even over relatively short distances within a region.

AB  - Most previous studies on mangrove cover have focused on a single study site or environmental factor. There is a lack of regional studies that consider the integrated effects of multiple climatic and hydrological factors on mangrove cover. Multi-year-averaged data can reveal general relationships between mangrove cover and macro-climatic and hydrological conditions but often obscures the relationships at a finer temporal scale. Using data from 1990 to 2011, we extracted the annual mangrove area for one tropical and six subtropical important mangrove nature reserves in southern China. Annual and categorized macro- climatic and hydrological variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and evapotranspiration) were also derived for each site. We then applied Kendall rank correlation and Bayesian regression to identify the relationships between mangrove variables and macro- climatic and hydrological variables. To investigate and validate the relevance of key factors that affect mangrove growth, we analyzed the changes in patterns of macro- climatic and hydrological conditions using the Pettitt test and a t-test. The tropical mangrove area exhibited only limited correlations with these factors, while the subtropical mangrove areas exhibited relatively strong correlations with precipitation and temperature. At the annual scale, the effects of precipitation were highly dependent on the local salinity background and the salt tolerance of dominant species and were stronger in drier regions and in drier periods. In subtropical regions, an increase in temperature was always positively correlated with mangrove expansion. The percentage of hot days ( > 30 degrees C) in a year, as opposed to cold days, can better explain mangrove area variations. Our results indicate that subtropical regions are more influenced than tropical regions by macro- climatic and hydrological factors. Precipitation and temperature are the governing macro- climatic and hydrological factors associated with mangrove area variations. Although previous studies have reported a positive relationship between precipitation and mangrove growth, the relationship is not necessarily positive at finer temporal resolutions. While freezes are recognized as one of the main causes of mangrove die-back in many other parts of the world, indices based on hot weather may be more suitable for explaining and predicting changes in mangrove areas in warmer regions such as southern China.

AB  - Large wood in streams can play an extraordinarily important role in influencing the physical structure of streams and in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Since wood is continually lost from streams, predicting the future input of wood to streams from riparian forests is crucial to assessing or managing stream ecosystems. Unfortunately, regional monitoring protocols have no established capacity to provide this information. The goal of this research is to propose one or more methods that could meet this need. This goal is pursued by using stream wood delivery models to aid in the design of a monitoring method. Two questions are asked. First, does simpler data change model predictions of future contributions of wood from riparian ecosystems to the stream? The answers to this first question enable monitoring design to be tailored to details affecting estimates of future stream condition. These answers are important, because more detailed data is typically more costly. Second, which metrics, if any, correlate well with model predictions? If such metrics can be identified, then these measures can serve as effective indicators of ecosystem function directly, without using ecosystem models.
   These questions were addressed by collecting highly detailed field observations of riparian forests from 109 forested riparian sites in the Coast Range, Willamette Valley, and western Cascades of northwestern Oregon. Detailed and simplified versions of these data were used in models that forecast the potential of riparian forests to provide wood to the stream. Model predictions with less detailed data typically provided answers different than did predictions made with more detailed data. Thus, ecosystem assessments requiring these types of model predictions would benefit from more detailed data. in contrast, riparian metrics easily observed in the field (e.g. number of basal area of trees) or derived from remotely sensed imagery (e.g. number or height of canopy trees) were well correlated with model predictions of potential stream wood recruitment. When direct model predictions or model scenario analyses are not required, these metrics can serve as effective indicators of the potential of riparian forests to provide wood to the future stream network.

AB  - The Norumbega fault system in the Northern Appalachians in eastern Maine experienced complex post-Acadian ductile and brittle deformation from middle through late Paleozoic times. Well-preserved epizonal ductile shear zones in Fredericton belt metasedimentary rocks and granitic batholiths that intrude them provide valuable information on the nature, geometry, and evolution of orogen-parallel strike-slip Norumbega faulting. Metasedimentary rocks were ductilely sheared into phyllonite schistose mylonite, whereas granite into mylonite within the ductile shear zones.
   Ductile shearing took place at conditions of the lower greenschist facies with peak temperatures on the order of 300-350degrees based on comparison of plastic quartz and brittle feldspar microstructures, confirming a shallow crustal environment during faulting. Ductile shear strain was partitioned into two major shear zones in easternmost Maine-the Waite and Kellyland zones-but these zones converge toward the southwest. Megascopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic kinematic indicators confirm that fault motion in both zones was dominantly dextral strike-slip. Detailed mapping, especially in the plutonic rocks, reveals a complex ductile deformation history in the area where the Waite and Kellyland zones converge. Shear strain is broadly distributed in the rocks between Kellyland and Waite zones, and increases toward their junction. Multiple dextral high-strain zones oblique to both zones resemble megascopic synthetic c' shear bands. Together with the Kellyland and Waite master shear zones, these define a megascopic S-C' structure system produced in a regional-scale dextral strike-slip shear duplex that developed in the transition zone between the deeper (south-central Maine) and shallower (eastern Maine) segments of the Norumbega fault system.
   Granite plutons caught within the strike-slip shear duplex were intensely sheared and progressively smeared into long and narrow slivers identified by this study. The western lobe of the Deblois pluton and the Lucerne pluton have been recognized as the sources, respectively of the Third Lake Ridge and Morrison Ridge granite slivers. Restoration of both granite slivers to their presumed original positions yields approximately 25 km of dextral strike-slip displacement along only the Kellyland and synthetic ductile shear zones.

AB  - Molybdenum in sedimentary rocks and sediments has evoked interest as a paleo-environmental indicator of reducing conditions. This application demands better understanding of Mo deposition mechanisms and in turn, requires improved knowledge of Mo speciation in anaerobic natural waters. In sulfidic solution, molybdate undergoes sulfidation in four steps that conserve Mo-VI and lead to tetrathiomolybdate: MoOxS4-x2- + H2S(aq) reversible arrow MoOx-1S5-x2- + H2O(l), 1 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 4. Equilibrium constants (K(4-x)(5-x)) and rate constants (k((4-x)(5-x))) have been measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. At 25 degrees C, I = 0.8-2.2 M, log K-01 = 5.19 +/- 0.03, log K-12 = 4.80 +/- 0.12, log K-23 = 5.00 +/- 0.13, log K-34 = 4.88 +/- 0.28. The monothio to trithio-intermediates have negligible stability fields. If H2S(aq) increases slowly enough to maintain near-equilibrium conditions, a sharp switch will occur from MoO42- to MoS42- at similar to 11 mu M H2S(aq) (298 K, 1 atm). Sulfide actuation of the switch depends on a(H2S)(4), so a similar to 3-fold change in a(H2S) produces a similar to 100-fold change in MoO42-/MoS42-. Conversion of the predominant anion from a hard to a soft base alters Mo's geochemical behavior, increasing its susceptibility to scavenging. Because each successive sulfidation reaction is similar to 1 order of magnitude slower than the previous one, dithio- reversible arrow trithio- and trithio- reversible arrow tetrathiomolybdate equilibria might not be achieved in seasonally or intermittently sulfidic waters. In such environments, unstable mixtures of intermediate thiomolybdates can predominate, contradicting thermodynamic predictions. The sulfidation reactions are acid catalyzed. Anoxic sediment porewaters, which are enriched relative to overlying waters in Bronsted acids, will promote conversion of molybdate to thiomolybdates. This may account for observations that Mo deposition in euxinic environments occurs often by diagenetic pathways rather than by water column scavenging. Slow hydrolysis and oxidation of MoS42- suggests that it could serve as a reservoir of fixed, but acid-labile sulfide in oxic waters. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Plants generally use soil inorganic nitrogen, ammonium (NH4+-N), and nitrate (NO3--N) as sources of nitrogen, an essential nutrient. The assimilation processes after uptake differ considerably from ammonium to nitrate. Nitrate must be reduced to ammonium in plant tissue before it is synthesized to amino acids, while ammonium is directly and immediately synthesized to amino acids after its uptake. Nitrate reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of nitrate assimilation, reducing nitrate to nitrite. It is a substrate-inducible enzyme, and the capacity to induce nitrate reductase varies greatly among plant species. In vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA) is generally measured as a nitrite production rate during incubation using fine cut pieces of plant tissue, and it is applicable as an indicator on plant nitrate use. Here we present in vivo NRA of leaves from a total of 108 species including arboreal trees, small trees, shrubs, herbs, a vine and a moss. For 75 of the species, NRA in fine roots was also determined. At least 20 species in sampled plants were imported and planted for scientific or industrial purposes, but most sampled species were native to Japan. Several inventory studies of plant NRA have been conducted, mainly in Europe, and they provided information on the species-specific capacity of nitrate use by plants in Europe. However, to our best knowledge, there has been hitherto no published inventory of the NRA of plants in Japan where many endemic species are distributed. Our dataset contains plant NRA with species, family name, life form, leaf lifespan (evergreen or deciduous), growth stage, the season of sample collection, growth conditions (natural or cultivated) and other treatments/conditions when applicable. The data provided by this study may contribute to future works that require information regarding the plant species characteristics for nitrate use capacity or nitrate preference. The complete data set for this abstract published in the Data Paper section of the journal is available in electronic format in MetaCat in JaLTER at .

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Understanding that solar energy is the main source of the majority of biological, chemical and physical processes on Earth, investigation of its influence on different climatic fields allows us to define the features of its space and hour fluctuations. To define radiation and temperature regime of the territory it is necessary to determine climatic features of the spreading surface, which absorbs and will transform solar energy. Considering the fact that modern climatic changes and their consequences cover all components of the system, today there is a problem of their further study for comprehension of atmospheric processes, modeling weather conditions on different territories depending on the properties.
   The purpose of the article is to determine interrelations between indexes of solar radiation (the Wolfs number) and air temperature, atmospheric pressure on the territory of Ukraine during 1965-2015, their change in space and time.
   Methods. Correlative method is one of the main methods of a statistical analysis which allows us to receive correlation coefficients of solar radiation variability indexes, air temperature, atmospheric pressure on the territory of the research. This technique estimates the extent of solar radiation influence on temperature regime of the territory and distribution of atmospheric pressure.
   Results. Coefficients of correlation, which characterize variability of solar radiation indexes, air temperature and atmospheric pressure on the explored territory have been received by means of statistical correlation analysis method. This technique allows us to estimate the degree and nature of solar radiation influence on a temperature regime of the territory and distribution of atmospheric pressure. It has been defined that direct correlative connection between indexes of solar radiation is characteristic of air temperature and atmospheric pressure fields. Significant statistical dependence between incoming solar radiation on the territory of Ukraine and atmospheric pressure has been noted during the spring and autumn periods mainly at the majority of stations. Between indexes of solar radiation and air temperature the inverse correlative connection in winter will be transformed to a direct connection during the spring and summer periods.
   Scientific novelty and practical significance. Physical processes, which happen in the atmosphere, are characterized by complex interrelations. For further research it is important to define solar radiation value and the extent of influence on climatic conditions.

AB  - Due to climate change, the assessment of environmental variations associated to phenology and ecophysiology of iconic Sonoran Desert plants such as Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum (Cag), during their interaction with the native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and soil nutrients availability, is the keystone to understand its biological significance in the extreme conditions of semiarid environments. Seasonal patterns of high solar radiation regimes and extreme daily air temperatures thresholds were reflected in a high accumulation of heat from physiological maturity (2699 degrees D) until the end of reproduction season (4002 degrees D)). In treatments without chemical fertilization, low and intermediate P availability, the native AMFCag inoculum significantly increased Cag's relative growth rates and changed the biomass allometric allocation patterns causing a lower partition to the roots and a higher partition to the growth of shoots and photosynthetic assimilation surface. Depending on the phenological stage, the levels of P availability and the levels of native AMF propagules in the soil, significantly modified the content of C, H, S, P, N, Ca, Fe, Mn or Ni in the shoots. The native AMFCag inoculum significantly increased the functional colonization (Arum-Paris type) of roots except with higher P availability. However, when AMF propagules in the soil are low, P increase and presence of other mineral nutrients is detrimental to symbiotic establishment. Conversely, when AMF propagules in the soil are high, symbiotic traits indicate that the native AMF taxa tested, have different tolerance capabilities to colonize functionally the roots to obtain the carbon for their development even under a high P and other mineral nutrients availability in the soil. In extreme conditions of sunlight and air temperatures, Cag's phenological and ecophysiological traits were enhanced by the native AMFCag inoculum in different P availability levels, however, the mycorrhizal growth response decreased significantly as the availability of P increases, and the highest level of native AMF propagules in soil was the factor that promoted the increase of reproductive yield of Cag plants, not the increase of nutrients availability. This study provides novel information on AMF-Cag symbiotic interactions during plant development and phenological stages, as well as proposes different insights and hypothesis of research about Cag-AMF ecophysiology.

AB  - Background: Problems associated with resistant mosquitoes and the effects on non-target species by chemicals, evoke a reason to find alternative methods to control mosquitoes, like the use of natural predators. In this regard, aquatic coleopterans have been explored less compared to other insect predators. In the present study, an evaluation of the role of the larvae of Acilius sulcatus Linnaeus 1758 (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) as predator of mosquito immatures was made in the laboratory. Its efficacy under field condition was also determined to emphasize its potential as bio-control agent of mosquitoes.
   Methods: In the laboratory, the predation potential of the larvae of A. sulcatus was assessed using the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823 (Diptera: Culicidae) as prey at varying predator and prey densities and available space. Under field conditions, the effectiveness of the larvae of A. sulcatus was evaluated through augmentative release in ten cemented tanks hosting immatures of different mosquito species at varying density. The dip density changes in the mosquito immatures were used as indicator for the effectiveness of A. sulcatus larvae.
   Results: A single larva of A. sulcatus consumed on an average 34 IV instar larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus in a 24 h period. It was observed that feeding rate of A. sulcatus did not differ between the light-on (6 a.m. - 6 p.m.), and dark (6 p.m. - 6 a.m.) phases, but decreased with the volume of water i.e., space availability. The prey consumption of the larvae of A. sulcatus differed significantly (P < 0.05) with different prey, predator and volume combinations, revealed through univariate ANOVA. The field study revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in larval density of different species of mosquitoes after 30 days from the introduction of A. sulcatus larvae, while with the withdrawal, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in larval density was noted indicating the efficacy of A. sulcatus in regulating mosquito immatures. In the control tanks, mean larval density did not differ (p > 0.05) throughout the study period.
   Conclusion: the larvae of the dytiscid beetle A. sulcatus proved to be an efficient predator of mosquito immatures and may be useful in biocontrol of medically important mosquitoes.

AB  - Soil erosion is a global problem that negatively affects the quality of the environment, the availability of natural resources, as well as the safety of inhabitants. Soil erosion threatens the functioning of urban areas, which was the reason for choosing the territory of the Master Plan of Belgrade (Serbia) as the research area. The calculation of soil erosion loss was analyzed using the G2 erosion model. The model belongs to a group of empirical models and is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). The estimation of soil degradation was analyzed in two time periods (2001 and 2019), which represent the time boundaries of the management of the Master Plan of Belgrade. The novel approach used in this research is based on using the land cover inventory as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. Land cover was identified using remote sensing, machine learning techniques, and the random forest algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission in combination with spectral indices. Climatic parameters were analyzed on the basis of data from meteorological stations (first scenario, i.e., 2001), as well as on simulations of changes based on climate scenario RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathways) concerning the current condition of the land cover (second scenario). A comparative analysis of the two time periods identified a slight reduction in total soil loss. For the first period, the average soil loss value is 4.11 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). The analysis of the second period revealed an average value of 3.63 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). However, the increase in non-porous surfaces has led to a change in the focus of soil degradation. Increased average soil loss as one of the catalysts of torrential flood frequencies registered on natural and semi-natural areas were 43.29% and 16.14%, respectively. These results are a significant contribution to the study of soil erosion in urban conditions under the impact of climate change.

AB  - One of the main factors limiting the potato yield in Western Siberia is various crop diseases, among which soil and tuber infections hold a special place. The sore issue in potatoes production is black scab. The economic significance of this disease is estimated at 50 % yield loss during the growing season. The results of analyzing the effect of previous crops (potatoes, oats and tendergreen) and mineral fertilizers (N40P40K80) on pathogenesis of black scab in potato plantations, and also crop productivity are presented in the paper. Evaluation of the used techniques effect on development of black scab was performed on natural backgrounds in conditions of forest-steppe zone of Priobye in the Novosibirsk region. The seasonal dynamics of the Rhizoctonia solani fungus in the soil has a characteristic increase in the number at the end of plants growing season. In the conditions of Western Siberia, in the course of pathological process of black scab, the soil infection (proportion of the factor effect - from 50 % during the phase of full germination to 90 % to the flowering phase) plays the most important role. Oats and tendergreen had been affecting on the agent of black scab disease during two years after cultivation as a precursor, and oats affected the pathogen more strongly in the second year of potato cultivation. On average according to factors, oats and tendergreen with mineral fertilizers (N40P40K80) reliably reduce development of black scab on plants 1.1-1.3 times as compared to potatoes cultivated in monoculture, and mineral fertilizers significantly (1.3 times) increase the plants performance. The predecessors (on average) had practically no effect on this indicator. The yield of potatoes in monoculture and after oats is almost the same, and after tendergreen it is insignificantly higher (1.1 times). Mastering environmentally friendly technologies for protecting potatoes from soil and tuber infections and implementation of those into production will contribute to obtaining stable crops of a high quality culture, and, as a result, formation of efficient agro-industrial complex ensuring the country's food security.

AB  - Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) depth limit is used as an environmental indicator in Danish coastal waters in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) to evaluate coastal waters and their ecological condition. Even after decades of reduced nutrient loadings the reestablishment of eelgrass has not yet succeeded. The mechanisms hindering/delaying eelgrass recovery were recently identified: 1) lack of sediment anchoring capacity, 2) resuspension created by drifting ephemeral macroalgae, 3) seedling uprooting created by current and wave forces, 4) ballistic stress from attached macroalgae and 5) burial of seeds and seedlings by lugworms. These processes were quantified and introduced to an ecological MIKE 3D model. The developed model was calibrated and validated on two Danish estuaries, Odense Fjord and Roskilde Fjord. Analyses of the simulations were performed on area distribution maps. The parameterized stressors impact has been investigated over a three-year period.
   The results indicate accumulated effects from multiple stressors weakening the capability of eel grass to recolonize. Combining all stressors in the model decreased the total area covered by eelgrass 83.72% in Odense Fjord and 80.30% in Roskilde Fjord compared to simulation without stressors. Eelgrass peak biomass declined in both fjords from 33.4 to 4.55 ton C km(-2) in Odense Fjord and from 24.42 to 5.58 ton C km(-2) in Roskilde Fjord. Combining lugworm burial of seeds and seedlings with resuspension from macroalgae and wave forcing had the second strongest negative impact on eelgrass growth, area reduction of 78.31% and 73.14% in Odense and Roskilde Fjord was seen. Ballistic stress from attached macroalgae also reduced growth drastically. Light conditions, sediment organic content along with shear stress at the sediment surface impact the ability of eelgrass to cope with above mentioned stressors. The spatial resolution of the model setup made it possible to generate maps where eelgrass is exposed to lowest stress, revealing areas for potential eelgrass recovery. The developed eelgrass model is now used as a national tool to predict areas where eelgrass restoration effort may be initiated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to prepare a statement on a framework for the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of transition metals (e.g. iron and copper) used as active substances in plant protection products (PPPs). Non-degradability, essentiality and specific conditions affecting fate and behaviour as well as their toxicity are distinctive characteristics possibly not covered in current guidance for PPPs. The proposed risk assessment framework starts with a preliminary phase, in which monitoring data on transition metals in relevant environmental compartments are provided. They deliver the metal natural background and anthropogenic residue levels to be considered in the exposure calculations. A first assessment step is then performed assuming fully bioavailable residues. Should the first step fail, refined ERA can, in principle, consider bioavailability issues; however, non-equilibrium conditions need to be taken into account. Simple models that are fit for purpose should be employed in order to avoid unnecessary complexity. Exposure models and scenarios would need to be adapted to address environmental processes and parameters relevant to the fate and behaviour of transition metals in water, sediment and soils (e.g. speciation). All developments should follow current EFSA guidance documents. If refined approaches have been used in the risk assessment of PPPs containing metals, post-registration monitoring and controlled long-term studies should be conducted and assessed. Utilisation of the same transition metal in other PPPs or for other uses will lead to accumulation in environmental compartments acting as sinks. In general, it has to be considered that the prospective risk assessment of metal-containing PPPs can only cover a defined period as there are limitations in the long-term hazard assessment due to issues of non-degradability. It is therefore recommended to consider these aspects in any risk management decisions and to align the ERA with the goals of other overarching legislative frameworks.

AB  - Texturally complex monazite grains contained in two granulite-facies pelitic migmatites from southern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, were mapped by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (using spot sizes <= 5 mu m) to quantitatively determine the spatial variation in trace element chemistry (with up to 1,883 analyses per grain). The maps highlight the chemical complexity of monazite grains that have experienced multiple episodes of growth, resorption and chemical modification by dissolution-precipitation during high-grade metamorphism. Following detailed chemical characterization of monazite compositional zones, a related U-Pb data set is re-interpreted, allowing petrologically significant ages to be extracted from a continuum of concordant data. Synthesis of these data with pseudosection modelling of prograde and peak conditions allows for the temporal evolution of monazite trace element chemistry to be placed in the context of the evolvingP-Tconditions and major phase assemblage. This approach enables a critical evaluation of three commonly used petrochronological indicators: linking Y to garnet abundance, the Eu anomaly to feldspar content and Th/U to anatectic processes. Europium anomalies and Th/U behave in a relatively systematic fashion, suggesting that they are reliable petrochronological witnesses. However, Y systematics are variable, both within domains interpreted to have grown in a single event, between grains interpreted to be part of the same age population, and between samples that experienced similar metamorphic conditions and mineral assemblages. These observations caution against generalized petrological interpretations on the basis of Y content, as it suggests Y concentrations in monazite are controlled by domainal equilibria. The results reveal ac. 45 Myr interval between prograde metamorphism and retrograde melt crystallization in the study area, emphasizing the long-lived nature of heat flow in high-grade metamorphic terranes. Such long timescales of metamorphism would be assisted by the growth, retention and dominance of high-Th suprasolidus monazite, as observed in this study, contributing to the radiogenic heating budget of mid- to lower-crustal environments. Careful characterization of monazite grains suggests that continuum-style U-Pb data sets can be decoded to provide insights into the duration of metamorphic processes.

AB  - Depositional slope systems along continental margins contain a record of sediment transfer from shallow-water to deep-water environments and represent an important area for natural resource exploration. However, well-preserved outcrops of large-scale depositional slopes with seismic-scale exposures and tectonically intact stratigraphy are uncommon. Outcrop characterization of smaller-scale depositional slope systems (i.e. < 700 m of undecompacted shelf-to-basin relief) has led to increased understanding of stratigraphic packaging of prograding slopes. Detailed stacking patterns of facies and sedimentary body architecture for larger-scale slope systems, however, remain understudied. The Cretaceous Tres Pasos Formation of the Magallanes Basin, southern Chile, presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the stratigraphic evolution of such a slope system from an outcrop perspective. Inherited tectonic relief from a precursor oceanic basin phase created shelf-to-basin bathymetry comparable with continental margin systems (similar to 1000 m). Sedimentological and architectural data from the Tres Pasos Formation at Cerro Divisadero reveal a record of continental margin-scale depositional slope progradation and aggradation. Slope progradation is manifested as a vertical pattern exhibiting increasing amounts of sediment bypass upwards, which is interpreted as reflecting increasing gradient conditions. The well-exposed, seismic-scale outcrop is characterized by four 20 to 70 m thick sandstone-rich successions, separated by mudstone-rich intervals of comparable thickness (40 to 90 m). Sedimentary body geometry, facies distribution, internal bedding architecture, sandstone richness and degree of amalgamation were analysed in detail across a continuous 2.5 km long transect parallel to depositional dip. Deposition in the lower section (Units 1 and 2) was dominated by poorly channellized to unconfined sand-laden flows and accumulation of mud-rich mass transport deposits, which is interpreted as representing a base of slope to lower slope setting. Evidence for channellization and indicators of bypass of coarse-grained turbidity currents are more common in the upper part of the > 600 m thick succession (Units 3 and 4), which is interpreted as reflecting increased gradient conditions as the system accreted basinward.

AB  - Use of diatoms in monitoring water quality is well acknowledged in developed countries, but only recently has the assessment started gaining importance in developing countries. Diatoms can be obtained from natural and artificial substrates. Appreciating the differences and similarities of diatom assemblages on both substrates may contribute to a better understanding and standardization particularly during monitoring of water quality. During this study we assessed diatom assemblages, biodiversity and trophic indices in relation to water quality along the Nairobi River. Fifteen sites were sampled in September 2000 during the dry season. Diatoms were collected from natural substrates (stones, pebbles) and artificial substrates (100% acrylic wool). On artificial and natural substrates, a total of 190 and 151 taxa were found, respectively, the majority of these taxa (80%) have cosmopolitan distribution and are also widespread throughout tropical African. Species composition changed downstream, five taxa dominated upper and mid stream sites whereas lower stream sites were dominated by one or two taxa. Species richness, diversity, dominance and evenness were positively correlated with NO3, O-2 and altitude but decreased markedly downstream with a simultaneous increase in total dissolved solids, alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand and PO4. Ordination and classification (CANOCO and TWINSPAN) showed that diatom assemblages in the Nairobi River responded strongly to water quality changes with respect to concentrations of NO3, NO2, total dissolved solids and temperature. Taxa common at less impacted upstream sites included Gomphonema gracilis, Anomoeoneis brachysira and Fragilaria biceps; while common taxa at midstream sites with agricultural catchments were Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cryptocephala, N. schroeteri, N. bryophila, N. halophila, Nitzschia linearis var. linearis and Cymbella silesica. Achnanthes minutissima var. saprophila, Gomphonema angustum, Navicula subminuscula, N. arvensis, Nitzschia palea and N. umbonata were most common at urban sites, which were polluted by residential and industrial effluents. Trophic diatom indices suggested that water quality was poor at most sites in the Nairobi River. Most sites along the river had low Generic Diatom Index values, GDI (< 12) and high Trophic Diatom Index values, TDI 73-78 (median = 76) and 75-84 (median = 77) for artificial and natural substrates, respectively. This study showed that diatoms' response on natural and artificial substrates were similar and reflected environmental conditions correctly.

AB  - We report extensive major and trace element data for the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) at Meishan, China. Analyses of 64 samples from a 2.5 m section span the last 75 kyr of the Permian and the first 335 kyr of the Triassic, from beds 24 to 34. We also report data for 20 acetic acid extracts that characterize the carbonate fraction. Whole rock major element data reflect the change of lithology from carbonate in the Permian to mudstone and marl in the Triassic, indicate an increase of siliciclastic input and MgO in and above the extinction interval (beds 24f-28), and silica diagenesis in carbonates below the extinction horizon. Above bed 27, enrichment factors calculated with respect to Al and Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) are similar to 1 for most trace elements, confirming that siliciclastic input dominates trace element distributions in the Triassic. Within the extinction interval, beds 24f and 26 show increases in As, Mo, U and some transition metals. V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ba are variably enriched, particularly in bed 26. Below the extinction interval, the top of bed 24d shows enrichment of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ba in a zone of diagenetic silicification. Trace elements thus reflect siliciclastic input, diagenetic redistribution, and responses to redox conditions. Trace element patterns suggest either a change in provenance of the detrital component, or a change in the proportion of mechanical to chemical weathering that is coincident with the beginning of the extinction in bed 24f. Ba, Zr, and Zn behave anomalously. Ba shows little variation, despite changes in biological activity and redox conditions. The enrichment factor for Zr is variable in the carbonates below bed 24f, suggesting diagenetic Zr mobility. Zn shows a sharp drop in the extinction horizon, suggesting that its distribution was related to phytoplankton productivity. Rare earth element content is controlled by the siliciclastic fraction, and carbonate extracts show middle rare earth enrichment due to diagenesis. Ce and Eu anomalies are not reliable indicators of the redox environment at Meishan.

AB  - Intertidal nematode assemblages along three beaches with different types of anthropogenic activity were collected in the northern part of the Persian Gulf, near Bandar Abbas (Iran). Forty-two genera of free-living nematodes belonging to 17 families were identified. Daptonema, Ptycholaimellus, and Promonhystera were the most abundant taxa in the area. The nematode assemblage structure was negatively affected by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and total organic matter (TOM), with an impact gradient from the polluted Power Plant (PP), over Khur Gursuzan (KG), to the cleaner 'Resalat' site (RE). The PP sites, characterized by industrial infrastructures, were mainly impacted by PCBs, while Khur Gursuzan (KG) is under the influence of domestic discharges, with high sedimentary TOM levels. However, PCBs and TOM seem closely associated and they likely lead to compounding effects on the fauna. Among the bioindicator genera found, Spirinia, Chromadorina, and Terschellingia may be recognized as resistant taxa to PCBs, while Daptonema, Sabateria, Promonhystera and Ptycholaimellus are opportunists able to exploit organic load, and Oncholaimus and Pomponema appeared sensitive genera being characteristic to unpolluted sediments. As expected, the spatial effects between the stations and concomitantly the different types of anthropogenic impacts played a much more important role than seasonal variability and related changes. This confirms that anthropogenic impact can be a major control factor at Persian Gulf beaches. Nematode female:male ratios were in favor of the females, especially in the sediments impacted by PCBs, corroborating the hypothesis that stressful conditions sustain the increasing female frequency in nematode populations. In terms of the ecological quality (EcoQ) status, genus percentages indicated lower EcoQ at PP and highest at RE. In contrast, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') did not detect variations of EcoQ status at the three locations, while the Maturity Index did not indicate the presence of stressful conditions at PP, but it did at KG. It is possible that MI performs better when considering organic pollution compared to PCB contamination. However, we do not recommend its use in intertidal or transitional areas that are characterized by strong natural variations of the physical and chemical variables.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are emerging contaminants that are increasingly detected in surface waters around the world. Despite the rise in environmental detections, measured concentrations are still typically low, raising the importance of environmental risk assessments that focus on ecologically relevant sublethal endpoints, such as altered behavior. Neuroactive pharmaceuticals, like mental health medications, pain killers, etc., may be particularly potent in this regard as they are specifically designed to cause behavioral changes without causing physiologic impairment in mammalian systems. We screened 15 different popular neuroactive pharmaceuticals, ranging from antidepressants (including 3 major antidepressant metabolites), anxiety medications, and pain killers, under three different exposure scenarios (repeated, late acute and early transient exposure) to look for behavioral effects in larval zebrafish using the visual motor response (VMR). Drugs were screened at 0, 1, 10, and 100 pg/L in the repeated exposure scenario, and at 0 and 100 mu g/L in the late acute and early transient exposure scenarios. Eight of the 15 compounds tested, specifically the antidepressants amitriptyline, fluoxetine, nor-fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, nor-sertraline, venlafaxine, and the antipsychotic drug haloperidol decreased swimming activity by 25% to 40% under repeated exposure conditions. Five of the compounds (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, nor-fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline) also significantly decreased activity by 17% to 31% in the late acute exposure paradigm. Three compounds (fluoxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine) significantly altered swimming activity with early transient exposure, however creating a hyperactive response and increasing activity from 24% to 28%, while haloperidol significantly decreased activity by 31%. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first to screen so many neuroactive pharmaceuticals, including major metabolites, in parallel under multiple exposure conditions. We show that antidepressants most consistently alter VMR swimming activity. Additionally, we show that major antidepressant metabolites can potentially alter behavior as much as their parent compounds. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude and direction of behavioral effect is dependent on the exposure duration and period, indicating that a more diverse experimental approach might be needed to more accurately assess the risk these compounds pose to the environment.

AB  - Biogenic minerals such as dental apatite have become commonly analysed archives preserving geochemical indicators of past environmental conditions and palaeoecologies. However, post-mortem, biogenic minerals are modified due to the alteration/replacement of labile components, and recent moves to utilise micro-mammal tooth delta O-18 signatures for refined Cenozoic terrestrial palaeoclimate reconstructions has lacked consideration of the chemical effects of predator digestion.& para;& para;Here, the physical and chemical condition of laboratory-raised mouse (Mus musculus ) teeth have been investigated in conjunction with their bulk phosphate and tissue-specific delta O-18 values prior, and subsequent, to ingestion and excretion by various predator species (owls, mammals and a reptile). Substantial variability (up to 2 parts per thousand) in the delta O-18 values of both undigested teeth and those ingested by specific predators suggests significant natural heterogeneity of individual prey delta O-18. Statistically distinct, lower delta O-18 values (similar to 0.7 parts per thousand) are apparent in teeth ingested by barn owls compared to undigested controls as a result of the chemically and enzymatically active digestive and waste-pellet environments. Overall, dentine tissues preserve lower delta O-18 values than enamel, while the greatest modification of oxygen isotope signals is exhibited in the basal enamel of ingested teeth as a result of its incompletely mineralised state. However, recognition of O-18-depletion in chemically purified phosphate analyses demonstrates that modification of original delta O-18 values is not restricted to labile oxygen-bearing carbonate and organic phases.& para;& para;The style and magnitude of digestive-alteration varies with predator species and no correlation was identified between specific physical or minor/trace-element (patterns or concentrations) modification of ingested teeth and disruption of their primary oxygen isotope values. Therefore, there is a current lack of any screening tool for oxygen isotope disruption as a result of predation. These results point to the need for careful application of the micro-mammal oxygen isotope palaeoenvironmental proxy in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban public transportation sector in general is heavily dependent on fossil - oriented fuels, e.g., diesel. Given the fact that a major proportion of urban pollution and the consequent threats towards public health are attributed to this sector, serious efforts at both technical and political levels have been being made to introduce less-polluting fueling regimes, e.g., partial replacement of diesel with biodiesel. In line with that, the present study was aimed at evaluating the emissions attributed to 5% blends of waste cooking oil (WCO) and poultry fat (PF) biodiesel fuels (i.e., B5-WCO and B5-PF fuel blends) when used in urban buses during idle operation mode. Moreover, the attributional and consequential environmental impacts of using these fuel blends were also investigated through a well to wheel life cycle assessment (LCA) by considering the real-world condition combustion data using ten urban buses. The findings of the ALCA revealed that the application of 1 L B5-WCO fuel blend could potentially reduce the environmental burdens in human health, ecosystem quality, and resources damage categories compared with using the B5-PF fuel blend. The situation was opposite for climate change damage category in which using 1 L B5-PF fuel blend had a lower impact on the environment. Overall, the environmental hotspots in the B5-WCO and B5-PF life cycles were identified as the combustion stage as well as the diesel production and transportation. From the consequential perspective, using 1 L B5-WCO fuel blend could potentially decrease the environmental burdens in human health, ecosystem quality, and resources damage categories. While, the situation was different for climate change damage category where using 1 L B5-PF fuel blend could have a lower impact on the environment. In conclusion, using B5-WCO fuel blend as an alternative for diesel could be an environmentally-friendly decision for the Iranian urban transportation sector at the policy level as long as the marginal suppliers of oil would be the same as the countries considered herein, i.e., Malaysia and Argentina.

AB  - Evidence suggests that patterns of benthic community structure are functionally linked to estuarine processes and physical characteristics of the benthos. To assess these linkages for coarse-sediment shorelines, we used a spatially nested sampling design to quantify patterns of distribution and abundance of both macroinfauna and macroepibiota. We examined replicate beach segments within a site (similar to 1 km), sites within areas of relatively uniform salinity and temperature (similar to 10 km). and areas (similar to 100 km) in the two major basins of Puget Sound, Washington. Because slight variations in physical characteristics of a beach can lead to significant alterations in biota, we minimized confounding physical influences by working only in the predominant shorefine habitat type in Puget Sound, a mixture of sand, pebbles and cobbles. Species richness decreased steadily from north to south along gradients of declining wave energy, increasing temperature and decreasing salinity. A few taxa were confined to the South Basin. but many more were found in the North. Most of the variability in population abundance was captured at the smaller spatial scales. Physical conditions tend to become increasingly different with distance among sites. Communities became more different from north to south as species intolerant of more estuarine conditions dropped out. There was significant spatial autocorrelation among populations on neighboring beach segments for 73 of the 172 species sampled. Populations of these benthic species may be connected via dispersal on scales of at least km in Puget Sound. Our results strengthen prior conclusions about the strong linkages between the biota and physical patterns and processes in estuaries. It is important for monitoring and impact-detection studies to account for natural variation of physical gradients across the sampling scales used. Nested, replicated sampling designs can facilitate the detection of environmental chan e at spatial scales ranging from global (e.g.. warming or El Ni (n) over tildeo), to regional (e.g.. estuary-wide changes in salinity patterns), to local (e.g., from development at a site).

AB  - Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) can provide key information about the state of photosynthesis and offers the prospect of defining remote sensing-based estimation of Gross Primary Production (GPP). There is strong theoretical support for the link between SIF and GPP and this relationship has been empirically demonstrated using ground-based, airborne, and satellite-based SIF observations, as well as modeling. However, most evaluations have been based on monthly and annual scales, yet the GPP:SIF relations can be strongly influenced by both vegetation structure and physiology. At the monthly timescales, the structural response often dominates but short-term physiological variations can strongly impact the GPP:SIF relations. Here, we test how well SIF can predict the inter-daily variation of GPP during the growing season and under stress conditions, while taking into account the local effect of sites and abiotic conditions. We compare the accuracy of GPP predictions from SIF at different timescales (half-hourly, daily, and weekly), while evaluating effect of adding environmental variables to the relationship. We utilize observations for years 2018-2019 at 31 mid-latitudes, forested, eddy covariance (EC) flux sites in North America and Europe and use TROPOMI satellite data for SIF. Our results show that SIF is a good predictor of GPP, when accounting for inter-site variation, probably due to differences in canopy structure. Seasonally averaged leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and canopy conductance provide a predictor to the site-level effect. We show that fPAR is the main factor driving errors in the linear model at high temporal resolution. Adding water stress indicators, namely canopy conductance, to a multi-linear SIF-based GPP model provides the best improvement in the model precision at the three considered timescales, showing the importance of accounting for water stress in GPP predictions, independent of the SIF signal. SIF is a promising predictor for GPP among other remote sensing variables, but more focus should be placed on including canopy structure, and water stress effects in the relationship, especially when considering intra-seasonal, and inter- and intra-daily resolutions.

AB  - As part of efforts to address the root causes of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion, many regions in the world are considering sustainable biomass feedstocks for renewable energy production. Prior to making such large-scale shifts in primary energy feedstocks, location-specific research is still needed to understand the environmental impacts and benefits of biomass associated with its many potential applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate environmental and energy impacts associated with generating 1 MJ of thermal energy from direct combustion of short rotation willow (SRW) pellets for 2 purposes: to determine where improvements could be made in the life cycle of SRW bioenergy to reduce impacts, and to compare SRW bioenergy to fossil fuel (light fuel oil and natural gas) for thermal energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using primary data on SRW biomass production collected from field trials at the Guelph Agroforestry site in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, as well as carbon sequestration rates modeled based on local conditions. Results showed that direct combustion of SRW pellets reduced global warming potential (GWP) by almost 85% relative to the fossil fuels. However, relative to fossil fuels, SRW energy had higher impacts in certain categories (e.g. eutrophiEation and respiratory effects), due to biomass combustion and N inputs (inorganic fertilizer and SRW leaf inputs) for biomass production. Soil nitrous oxide emissions, from the N inputs, dominated the GWP, but a sensitivity analysis showed that soil carbon sequestered by SRW biomass during growth could reduce the GWP by 23%. Pelletizing the SRW biomass prior to combustion affected the energy ratio and accounted for almost 85% of non-renewable energy use in the life cycle of bioenergy. Location specific factors that affected environmental performance of the bioenergy system included agro-climatic conditions, management practices, and conversion technologies. Nevertheless, most of the impacts associated with SRW thermal energy generation can be minimized through better fertilizer management, by using alternate sources of fertilizer, by improving yields, and by the use of cleaner wood combustion technologies with emissions controls.

AB  - Cyanobacteria dominance is often associated with economic, ecological and health problems. The potential production of toxic compounds calls for frequent monitoring of cyanobacteria and their toxin production in many aquatic systems. Methods to simplify this process and facilitate management responses to sudden environmental changes are needed to improve the capability of risk-assessment. We tested the effectiveness of two different functional approaches (Functional Groups - FG, Reynolds et al., 2002; and Morphology-Based Functional Groups - MBFG, Kruk et al., 2010) as well as single species and taxonomic classifications as the best proxy of spatio-temporal phytoplankton dynamics and dominance of toxic algae in an impacted transitional river-reservoir system in the tropics. The Paraiba do Sul River and Funil Reservoir are located in one of the most heavily impacted regions of Brazil, and the latter system has a history of intense, long-lasting toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Sampling was conducted over the two climatological periods of the region: warm-rainy (October/2011 and January/2012) and cold-dry (July/2011 and May/2012), with stations in the following areas: tributary, reservoir and river (downstream from the dam). Our results showed that the MBFG classification was the most effective approach, i.e., best explained the response of the phytoplankton community to environmental variations. Environmental factors including light, nutrients, water temperature and hydrology increased the occurrence of different MBFGs on both spatial and temporal scales. The lotic areas showed a more diverse composition of MBFGs, including species with high to moderate tolerance to light limitation and flushing conditions (MBFGs I, III, IV, V and VI). In Funil Reservoir, phytoplankton biovolume was dominated by bloom-forming cyanobacteria (MBFGs III and VII) and remained high throughout the study. This dominance was related to the overall eutrophic conditions, low light availability and increased water column stability of the reservoir. The seasonal dynamics in the reservoir was mainly related to changes in temperature and hydrology. Our results show for the first time that morphology captures efficiently eco-strategies of bloom-forming cyanobacteria and the MBFG approach can be used to predict and monitor the development of cyanobacteria HABs in temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Soils from natural ecosystems have specific physical, chemical and biochemical properties determined by the conditions in which these soils have developed. These soils that develop without external disturbance reach a balance amongst their properties. Thus, the creation of a model that represents the established balance of different soil properties from stable ecosystems can be used as a soil quality index, thus any perturbation must lead to modifications in this natural balance. Two regression models with soils from undisturbed forest regions in eastern Spain were previously developed, representing the balance between organic carbon and some physical, chemical and biochemical properties. For undisturbed forest soils, the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOCc) with the calibrated models should be similar to the actual value of this variable (SOCa) (SOCc approximate to SOCa). Consequently, the residuals (SOCc - SOCa) should be around 0. On the contrary, disturbance practices cause a disruption in the balance defined between the different properties and SOC. As a consequence, residuals must be < or >0. Furthermore, the more the degree of degradation increases, the more the values of SOCc must differ from the values of SOCa. According to this, two soil quality indices (SQI) were defined, one for each model, by the calculation of the model residuals (SQI = SOCc - SOCa). The SQIs have been applied to different undisturbed forest soils to evaluate their validity. In addition, they have also been applied to severely altered soils, like agricultural soils, and abandoned agricultural fields, to assess the sensibility of this index to perturbations. After applying the soil quality indices to eleven undisturbed forest soils, it has been verified that a balance exists between organic matter content and different physical, chemical and biochemical properties in forest soils from SE Spain, and the proposed calibrated models are capable of reflecting that balance (SQI = 0). Our results confirm that our models are sensitive to soil perturbation, because agricultural and abandoned agricultural soils have shown an imbalance between organic carbon content and the physical, chemical and biochemical properties (SQI > 0). Moreover, soils from abandoned fields showed lower deviation in the natural equilibrium, indicating a recovery of soil quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) has been suggested as an indicator of light use efficiency (LUE), and for use in the improvement of estimating gross primary production (GPP) in LUE models. Over the last two decades, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations from remote sensing have been used to evaluate the distribution of GPP over a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, both PRI and SIF observations have been decoupled from photosynthesis under a variety of non-physiological factors, i.e., sun-view geometry and environmental variables. These observations are important for estimating GPP but rarely reported in the literature. In our study, multi-angle PRI and SIF observations were obtained during the 2018 growing season in a maize field. We evaluated a PRI-based LUE model for estimating GPP, and compared it with the direct estimation of GPP using concurrent SIF measurements. Our results showed that the observed PRI varied with view angles and that the averaged PRI from the multi-angle observations exhibited better performance than the single-angle observed PRI for estimating LUE. The PRI-based LUE model when compared to SIF, demonstrated a higher ability to capture the diurnal dynamics of GPP (the coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.71) than the seasonal changes (R-2= 0.44), while the seasonal GPP variations were better estimated by SIF (R-2= 0.50). Based on random forest analyses, relative humidity (RH) was the most important driver affecting diurnal GPP estimation using the PRI-based LUE model. The SIF-based linear model was most influenced by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The SIF-based linear model did not perform as well as the PRI-based LUE model under most environmental conditions, the exception being clear days (the ratio of direct and diffuse sky radiance > 2). Our study confirms the utility of multi-angle PRI observations in the estimation of GPP in LUE models and suggests that the effects of changing environmental conditions should be taken into account for accurately estimating GPP with PRI and SIF observations.

AB  - In this study we explored the use of less conventional diatom metrics (motility, nuclear abnormalities and ecological guilds) to measure changes in diatom assemblages related to the transfer of epipelic communities from urban impacted streams to less impacted sites. Three lowland streams in the Argentine Pampean plain were selected, and two sites were established per stream for a total of six sites. Three sites were referenced as low urban impact (LI), as they run through pert-urban areas, and three downstream sites were referenced as high impact sites (HI), since they run through a dense urban area. Six germination trays filled with stream sediment were placed at each HI site, and three at each LI site, and left to be colonized for 30 days before transferring three trays from the HI sites to their respective LI site upstream. Samples were collected at days 0, 15, 30 and 45 days from each tray, and diatom species were identified and classified into ecological guilds. Motility variables were measure per individual of the genera Nitzschia (path length, velocity and maximum velocity) through video recording. Also, the frequency of abnormal nuclear locations and nuclear membrane breakage were determined. Results showed that there were no significant differences in any motility metrics, while the nuclei variables exhibited higher proportion of abnormally positioned nuclei and nuclear membrane breakage at the HI sites. The proportion of nuclear membrane breakage decreased over time in the translocated assemblage, indicating that it could be a sensitive indicator of water quality improvement, while the ecological guilds showed significant differences on the proportion of high profile and motile diatoms. The improvement in water quality produced a significative increase in the proportion of the high profile guild in the translocated biofilm. Despite the motile forms being the dominant group, the water quality improvement allowed the high profile forms, to colonize the substrate. These results emphasize the possible use of the ecological guilds as a suitable indicator of water quality improvement in Pampean streams, especially in nutrient rich environment. These tools can provide a rapid assessment of diatom condition and could be considered supplementary to biomonitoring protocols in lowland streams.

AB  - Consumers and organizations worldwide are searching for low-carbon alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on the environment. Natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel has made significant inroads in the light and heavy duty vehicles market over the last fifteen years. In a sustainable development view, both vehicle emissions and energy supply chain analysis from well-to-wheel must be addressed. The aim of this research is to provide a Well-to-Wheel (WtW) assessment of energy consumptions and GHG emissions for 25 combinations of automotive fuel and matching powertrain systems, with a special focus on the natural gas pathways. Although several well-to-wheel studies available in literature are comprehensive in relation to developed countries' conditions, it is problematic to apply the results to developing countries fuel markets, since the local fuel conditions and respective vehicle powertrain technologies are considerably different. This study deal with a comparative well-to-wheel analysis of natural gas, diesel and gasoline fuels looking at the Pakistanis situation but the models and approaches for this study can be applied to other countries having similar characteristics, as long as all the assumptions are well defined and modified to find a substitute automotive energy source and establish an energy policy in a specific region. The well-to-tank step was made using the GREET model, developed by the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory while tank-to-wheel analysis was performed using AVL Cruise, a commercially-available backward vehicle simulator. Later both stages were integrated in a well-to-wheel stage where relevant indexes were proposed and discussed. The results indicate that natural gas vehicles are 5-17% and 23-36% less fuel efficient, depending on the engine technology employed as compared to gasoline and diesel powertrain, respectively. Natural gas appears as an environmental efficient pathway regarding GHG emissions, especially compared to gasoline. In addition, using 20-year GWPs instead of 100-year GWPs increases WtW GHG emissions by 19-26% for natural gas pathways.

AB  - Anchovy and sardine are small pelagic species occupying similar geographic areas in the Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic). Their biomass is strongly dependent on recruitment, making the annual assessment of TAC (Total Allowable Catch) a risky strategy due to uncertainty in predicting the magnitude of recruitment. Monitoring these resources more often and throughout their life cycle could allow management strategies to be adjusted based on observations which indicate the level of recruitment. In order to achieve a more frequent monitoring, an innovative data collection strategy involving a partnership between fishermen and scientists, was developed in 2009 and 2010 called "pilot sentinel surveys". This paper details the partnership, the information such a partnership can.provide and how it can be useful for adaptively managing such resources. The method was based on short surveys undertaken by commercial vessels several times per year, in two spatially limited "key areas" known to be potential recruitment habitats. Acoustic surveys and fishing operations enabling biological sampling, were combined in each key area. Only one scientist was on board and an ad hoc sampling strategy was adopted during each survey by the Captain Scientist team depending on the local conditions. This partnership allowed scientists to benefit from fishermen's experience and therefore adopt a sampling strategy which was optimized in time and space. The sentinel survey data were complemented with data collected during annual spring acoustic surveys carried out by the research vessel (RV) Thalassa. The RV was accompanied by commercial vessels allowing additional fishing operations and acoustic echo interpretation to be performed. This experiment showed that the sentinel observations in limited areas cannot provide reliable abundance indices, but are adequate to provide significant biological information on the seasonal progress, of the life cycle of each species, such as growth, timing of in-coming recruitment and migration pattern. In addition, these "pilot sentinel surveys" significantly improved the mutual understanding between fishermen and scientists. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomonitoring of contaminants (metals, organotins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs) was undertaken in Milford Haven Waterway (MHW) and a reference site in the Tywi Estuary (St Ishmael/Ferryside) during 2007-2008. Bioindicator species encompassed various uptake routes-Fucus vesiculosus (dissolved contaminants); Littorina littorea (grazer); Mytilus edulis and Cerastoderma edule (suspension feeders); and Hediste (=Nereis) diversicolor (sediments). Differences in feeding and habitat preference have subtle implications for bioaccumulation trends though, with few exceptions, contaminant burdens in MHW were higher than the Tywi reference site, reflecting inputs. Elevated metal concentrations were observed at some MHW sites, whilst As and Se (molluscs and seaweed) were consistently at the higher end of the UK range. However, for most metals, distributions in MH biota were not exceptional. Several metal-species combinations indicated increases in bioavailability upstream, which may reflect the influence of geogenic/land-based sources-perhaps enhanced by lower salinity. TBT levels in MH mussels were below OSPAR toxicity thresholds and in the Tywi were close to zero. Phenyltins were not accumulated appreciably in M. edulis, whereas some H. diversicolor populations appear subjected to localized (historical) sources. PAHs in H. diversicolor were distributed evenly across most of MHW, although acenaphthene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene were highest at one site near the mouth; naphthalenes in H. diversicolor were enriched in the mid-upper Haven (a pattern seen in M. edulis for most PAHs). Whilst PAH (and PCB) concentrations in MH mussels were mostly above reference and OSPAR backgrounds, they are unlikely to exceed ecotoxicological thresholds. Bivalve Condition indices (CI) were highest at the Tywi reference site and at the seaward end of MH, decreasing upstream-giving rise to several significant (negative) relationships between CI and body burdens. Despite the possible influence of salinity gradient as a complicating factor, multivariate analysis indicated that a combination of contaminants could influence the pattern in condition (and the biomarkers metallothionein and TOSC). Integrating bioaccumulation data with biological and biochemical endpoints is seen as a useful way to discriminate environmental quality of moderately contaminated areas such as MHW and to prioritise cause and effect investigations.

AB  - Leaf morphology of native vegetation tias often been interpreted as a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions, presumably as a result of natural selection. If environmental pressures act as a selective force on community leaf morphology, then we would expect a high degree of similarity in similar environments, regardless of biogeographic origin of the flora.
   A comparative study of full regional floras of alpine vascular plants was undertaken to test the sensitivity of leaf morphology to macro-environmental conditions. Five alpine sites and one lowland (control) site were selected in southern New Zealand spanning 1.5 degrees latitude and 2323 m. Three sites with equivalent alpine environments were selected in South America across a 60 degrees latitudinal and 4200 m altitudinal span with subtropical forest used as a control. A further alpine site from the European Alps was included as an outlier. Twenty leaf parameters were obtained for 2143 taxonomic entities x sites.
   Both the mean and the frequency distribution of leaf size and shape parameters were distinctive for each locality. Several morphological trends were found. Means of New Zealand contiguous low-alpine and high-alpine site pairs differed in. length -33%, width -14%, length/width -20%, leaf area -44%, entire margin -2% (variable), coriaceousness -18%, folded +22%, pubescence +40%. At higher elevations, leaves become smaller but rounder, considerably softer, are more often folded into crypts or similar structures and are more often pubescent. These changes corresponded to reductions of 2-3 degrees C in mean annual air temperature, c. 10% in mean minimum relative humidity and 7% in CO2 partial pressure.
   Despite the biogeographic and environmental differences, New Zealand and South American low-alpine sites were consistently similar in their morphological parameters and consistently different from high-alpine sites (except in Tierra del Fuego). High alpine sites were also consistently similar across the Pacific. Several parameters were found to have multimodal frequency distributions that were not significantly different in widely separate localities with different floras. The results suggest that plant community morphology is an emergent property, the magnitude of which is environmentally constrained.

AB  - Compound weather events may lead to extreme impacts that can affect many aspects of society including agriculture. Identifying the underlying mechanisms that cause extreme impacts, such as crop failure, is of crucial importance to improve their understanding and forecasting. In this study, we investigate whether key meteorological drivers of extreme impacts can be identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a model environment, a method that allows for automated variable selection and is able to handle collinearity between variables. As an example of an extreme impact, we investigate crop failure using annual wheat yield as simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop model driven by 1600 years of daily weather data from a global climate model (EC-Earth) under present-day conditions for the Northern Hemisphere. We then apply LASSO logistic regression to determine which weather conditions during the growing season lead to crop failure. We obtain good model performance in central Europe and the eastern half of the United States, while crop failure years in regions in Asia and the western half of the United States are less accurately predicted. Model performance correlates strongly with annual mean and variability of crop yields; that is, model performance is highest in regions with relatively large annual crop yield mean and variability. Overall, for nearly all grid points, the inclusion of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit is key to predict crop failure. In addition, meteorological predictors during all seasons are required for a good prediction. These results illustrate the omnipresence of compounding effects of both meteorological drivers and different periods of the growing season for creating crop failure events. Especially vapour pressure deficit and climate extreme indicators such as diurnal temperature range and the number of frost days are selected by the statistical model as relevant predictors for crop failure at most grid points, underlining their overarching relevance. We conclude that the LASSO regression model is a useful tool to automatically detect compound drivers of extreme impacts and could be applied to other weather impacts such as wildfires or floods. As the detected relationships are of purely correlative nature, more detailed analyses are required to establish the causal structure between drivers and impacts.

AB  - Predicting the drivers of incursion and expansion of vector-borne diseases as part of early-warning strategies (EWS) is a major challenge for geographically extensive diseases where spread is mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and other environmental drivers. Geospatial data on these environmental drivers are increasingly available affording opportunities for application to a predictive disease ecology paradigm provided the data can be synthesized and harmonized with fine-scale, highly resolved data on vector and host responses to their environment. Here, we apply a multi-scale big data-model integration approach using human-guided machine learning to objectively evaluate the importance of a large suite of spatially distributed environmental variables (>400) to develop EWS for vesicular stomatitis (VS), a common viral vector-borne vesicular disease affecting livestock throughout the Americas. Two temporally and phylogenetically distinct events were used to develop disease occurrence-environment relationships in incursion (2004) and expansion years (2005), and then to test those relationships (2014, 2015) at two scales: (1) local and (2) landscape to regional. Our results show that VS occurrence at a local scale of individual landowners was related to conditions that can be monitored (rainfall, temperatures, streamflow) or modified (vegetation). On-site green vegetation during the month of occurrence and higher rainfall four months prior combined with either cool daytime (expansion) or nighttime (incursion) temperatures one month prior were indicators of VS occurrence. Distance to running water (incursion) and host density based on neighboring ranches (expansion) with infected animals were also important in individual years. At landscape-to-regional scales, conditions that favor specific VSV biological vectors were indicated, either black flies in incursion years or biting midges in expansion years. Changes in viral genetic lineage were less important to patterns in VS occurrence than factors affecting the host-vector-environment interactions. In combination with our onset map based on latitude, elevation, and long-term annual precipitation, this year- and scale-specific information can be used to develop strategies to minimize effects of future VS events. This big data approach coupled with expert knowledge and machine learning can be applied to other emerging diseases for improvement in understanding, prediction, and management of vector-borne diseases.

AB  - The hydrocarbon and pyrrolic nitrogen compound compositions of 21 crude oils from reservoirs in the Heath-Tyler-Amsden and Swift-Morrison formations of central Montana have been investigated by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The biomarker and aromatic hydrocarbon data enabled recognition of three composition types within the Heath-Tyler-Amsden oils. The Swift-Morrison oils displayed different hydrocarbon characteristics and are classified as a separate oil group.
   A number of geochemical parameters, e.g. dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene, C-20-triaromatic steroid hydrocarbon/(C-20 + C-28 triaromatic steroid hydrocarbons) indicate strong variations in petroleum composition from north to south across the region. Oils from the central Montana uplift with high relative C-27-diasteraneS/C-29 alpha alpha alpha steranes and Ts/(Ts + Tm) suggests increasing clay contribution to the source, while abundant gammacerane indicates the development of hypersaline conditions with restricted circulation. Oils from the Bull Mountain Basin, represented by the Amsden oils, show relatively low C-27-diasteraneS/C-29 alpha alpha alpha steranes and Ts/(Ts + Tm) ratios indicating increasing carbonate contribution to the source, while the decrease of a gammacerane contribution suggests decreasing salinity levels, which may explain the dominance of tricyclic terpane and hence their precursors to the source organic matter.
   While the changes recorded by the biomarker and aromatic hydrocarbon compositions show strong regional variations, the nitrogen compounds do not respond so strongly. However, weak trends coinciding with source carbonate content were apparent in the following ratios: 1,8-dimethylcarbazole/(1,8-dimethylcarbazole + 1-ethylcarbazole) and carbazole/sum of C-2-carbazoles. The second parameter may be responding to variations in salinity since it co-varies with the behaviour exhibited by the tricyclic terpanes.
   The source information that can be extracted from biomarkers and aromatic hydrocarbons suggests that primary migration and compositional fractionation during expulsion has exerted little influence on this fraction of petroleum. Meanwhile, primary migration and compositional fractionation during expulsion appear to effect the carbazole and benzocarbazole distributions thereby limiting their application as indicators for source rock facies composition. circle dot 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vanadium exists in multiple valence states in silicate and oxide systems, namely V(2+), V(3+), V(4+) and V(5+). This special characteristic has been exploited in several ways to estimate the redox conditions of high-temperature planetary processes, such as partial melting and core formation. However, the use of V as a universal redox indicator (i.e. suitable for the entire range of oxygen fugacities found in the inner Solar System) requires precise knowledge of the partitioning of all of its several valence states. Here we report the results of a series of 1 atm (1300 degrees C) and high-pressure (1-3 GPa, 1315-1450 degrees C) experiments carried out over a range of redox conditions sufficiently large (from QFM-13 center dot 3 to QFM+11 center dot 4, where QFM is the quartz-fayalite-magnetite oxygen buffer) to constrain the full panoply of V chemical behaviour. Partition coefficients between the major upper-mantle minerals (olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, spinel and garnet) and silicate melt were precisely measured with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for V and other selected heterovalent and homovalent elements (Al, P, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ga, Y, Zr and Nb). The particularly large range of redox conditions investigated here enabled concentrations of V(2+) and V(5+) to be constrained along with V(3+) and V(4+), allowing modelling of the change in bulk V partition coefficient with oxygen fugacity to be performed in a robust thermodynamic fashion. As in previous studies, we found a trend of increasing incompatibility from V(3+) to V(4+) to V(5+) for all phases. Partition coefficients for V(2+) can be either higher or lower than for V(3+), depending on the phase. Additionally, we found evidence for changes in the oxidation state of Cr (Cr(2+) <-> Cr(3+)), Fe (Fe(2+) <-> Fe(3+)) and Ti (Ti(3+) <-> Ti(4+)). There is also indication that P may behave as a heterovalent element, occurring as a trivalent cation at very reducing conditions (P(3+) <-> P(5+)). For all other trace elements, the oxidation state remained constant. The data presented here can be used to implement methods of estimating the redox state of mantle and mantle-derived planetary samples from bulk-rock concentration and crystal/melt partitioning with only minor extrapolation and bias, allowing better precision and accuracy than previously possible. The method of estimating the redox conditions of basalt suites from bulk-rock V concentrations relative to homovalent elements with similar compatibility (e.g. V/Sc and V/Ga) was tested using databases for mid-ocean ridge, ocean island and island arc basalts. Within the many assumptions involved in forward trace-element modelling (e.g. degree and style of melting, source composition, constant partition coefficients), we show that the redox states of the source regions of these different types of terrestrial basalts are indistinguishable from each other, having relative oxygen fugacities at similar to QFM +/- 1. The fact that arc magmas have higher Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) ratios than other types of basalts, making them appear to be more oxidized, may be due to late-stage processes rather than derivation from a more oxidized part of the asthenosphere.

AB  - Not only the occurrence of distinct organic-rich intervals (sapropels). but also the relative contents of key major and minor elements and isotopes in the sediments of the eastern Mediterranean, appear to be cyclic and to be astronomically associated, interpretations of the environmental conditions leading to sapropel formation are based on results from sedimentological, micropalacontological and geochemical studies of the dark-coloured layers and the cream/brownish sediments that occur above and below them. Part of the signal may be removed by early diagenetic processes. The extent and direction of these processes are ultimately controled by the amount and reactivity of organic matter.
   The interval of dark colour associated with a sapropel is often somewhat thicker than that defined by the >2% C-org definition and usually has a sharp colour change at upper and lower boundaries, A grey so-called 'proto-sapropel' layer of variable thickness underlies most sapropel layers. A few centimeters above the most recent sapropel S1, is usually found a clear dark-brown layer 2-3 cm thickness is usually found, which has a diffuse, often mottled, upper boundary and a relatively abrupt colour transition at its lower boundary. The colour is characteristic of Mn oxyhydroxide enrichments. In the interval from the dark-brown layer to the visible upper S1 boundary, there is usually an increasingly red-brownish colour.
   The distinct upper manganese Marker-Bed has been related to the Santorini (Minoan) eruption in 3356+/-18 BP (Bruins, H. J., & Van Der Plicht, J. (1996). The Exodus enigma. Nature, London. 382, 213-214), but is more likely to be associated with a Basin-wide re-ventilation event induced by changing climatic (humidity) conditions.
   Using barite-Ba as a paleo-productivity indicator, enhanced fluxes, and hence increases in accumulation rates of organic carbon to the seafloor, must have occurred from approximately 9 to 5 ky BP. The perfect correlations between observed C-org and calculated C-org from the C-org/Ba relation in the visible S1 interval, anti the total lack of such correlation in the interval between the darkbrown layer and the visible S1 layer are remarkable. It seems, therefore, that S1 deposition lasted from 9 to 5 ky BP but the organic carbon for the upper part has been removed. The double barium peak visible in 3 number of sediments studied in high-resolution, may be related to the `Flooding' of the Black Sea that occurred around 7150 BP (Ryan, W. B. F., Pittman, W. C., Major, C. O., Shimkus, K., Moskalenko, V., Jones, G. A., Dimitrov, P., Gorur, N., Sakinc, M., & Yuce, H. (1997. An abrupt drowning of the Black Sea shelf. Marine Geology, 138, 119-126).
   Using various 'proxies', the (initial) occurrence of eastern Mediterranean sapropels appears cyclic and to be strongly related to the Monsoonal/Insolation Index. However, the relative value of an insolation maximum and initial C-org content of the corresponding sapropel are not always related in a simple way. This again points to additional (possibly hydrographic) factors determining (the intensity of) sapropel formation.
   Understanding the mechanisms of sapropel formation and their subsequent preservation is not only necessary if our reconstructions of palaeoenvironmental conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean are to be improved. but may also assist in understanding the present-day situation and in forecasting possible future developments.
   The observed paleoenvironmental variations are discussed in a geochemical and environmental context, and are illustrated using typical examples from the eastern Mediteranean. O 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transportation is a major component of the global commercial poultry production system and it can lead to various levels of stress in chickens, even under optimal conditions. It can cause harm ranging from slight disorders to death. Birds that die between loading at the farm and slaughtering are described as 'dead on arrival' (DOA). DOA is an important indicator of animal welfare and financial losses. It can be influenced by various factors such as ambient temperature, stocking density in crates, transport distance, lairage time in the holding barn and slaughter age. The aim of this survey was to determine the effects of some factors on the incidence of the phenomenon 'dead on arrival' in broiler chickens under commercial transport conditions. This survey was carried out in a commercial slaughterhouse on the basis of data for 4,062 transfers and 12,723,444 broilers under commercial conditions during 2018. The data related to slaughter age, transport distance, lairage duration, ambient temperature at the slaughterhouse and the incidence of DOA of broiler chickens was recorded by staff throughout the study. Slaughter age was divided into four groups (up to 39 days, 40 to 42 days, 43 to 44 days, 45 days or more); lairage duration was divided into five groups (up to 60 min, 61 to 120 min, 121 to 180 min, 181 to 240 min, 241 min or more); transport distance was divided into four groups (up to 15 km, 16 to 50 km, 51 to 101 km, 100 to 200 km) and ambient temperature at the slaughterhouse was divided into six groups (-5 degrees C to 0 degrees C, 0.1 degrees C to 5 degrees C, 5.1 degrees C to 10 degrees C, 10.1 degrees C to 15 degrees C, 15.1 degrees C to 20 degrees C and 20.1 degrees C to 28 degrees C).
   Across the present study, the overall DOA rate was 0.389%. The effects of slaughter age, transport distance, lairage duration and temperature on the DOA rate were all significant (P<0.001). The DOA rate at <= 39 days slaughter age was higher than that of the other groups (P<0.001). Furthermore, the DOA rate for transport distance up to 15 km (0.448%) was higher than that for the other distance intervals (P<0.001). As the transport distance increased, the DOA rate usually increased (P<0.001). In addition, there was a positive relationship between DOA rate and lairage duration (P<0.001). As the lairage duration increased, the DOA rate increased. In addition, the DOA rate was highest (0.622%) at cold ambient temperatures (-5 degrees C - 0 degrees C) and lowest at 5.1 degrees C to 10 degrees C (0.334%).
   In conclusion, the results of the current study regarding DOA rates clearly showed that short or long distance transport and long lairage duration were extremely detrimental to the health of broiler chickens. It is therefore important to avoid long or short distance transportation and long lairage duration, especially in adverse environmental conditions such as sub-zero and high temperatures. In addition, broiler chickens of up to 40 days of age were more susceptible to pre-slaughter stress than other ages. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the management of broilers in this age range in the pre slaughter period.

AB  - A comprehensive research of rare and endangered species plays an important role in the conservation of biological diversity. Cypripedium calceolus L. (fam. Orchidaceae Juss.) is a rare species included in the Red Data Book of Kirov region. It needs biological control in its territory. The aim of this study was to investigate the ontogenetic structure and morphometric parameters, and to identify the vital structure of C. calceolus cenopopulations in Kirov region.
   In 2014, we examined the state of five C. calceolus cenopopulations (CP) on limestone deposits along the Vyatka river valley slopes (southern taiga subzone, Kirov region, Russia) (See Table 1). To study the conditions of coenopopulations, we used approaches and methods of plant population biology (Uranov, 1975; Coenopopulations ..., 1976, 1977, 1988; Zaugol'nova et al. 1993; Zhukova, 1995). Ontogenetic spectra were typifed according to the "delta-omega" classification (Zhivotovsky, 2001), determining age (Delta) and efficiency (omega) indices. In each habitat, we laid transects which were then divided into plots where individuals at different onthogenetic state were registered. The coenopopulation vitality structure was investigated using the method of calculating the IVC index (Ishbirdin and Ishmuratova, 2004) and the method of calculating the Q index (Zlobin, 1989, 2009). The variability and correlation structure of C. calceolus populations was studied according to classification of NS Rostova (2001). To study morphometric characteristics of plants we considered their height, the number of leaves and flowers, the size of the leaf (length and width), the number of leaf veins, the size of the lip (length and width), the length of the blade lip. We analyzed up to 30 generative individuals in each CP.
   It was defined that ontogenetic structure of all 5 coenopopulations was normal, incomplete, right-side type with maximum on generative plants. The proportion of generative plants varies from 47 to 72%. Virginile individuals dominate in pregenerative group, 26 to 46%. Immature plants take 0.34 to 8.44% (See Fig. 1). Seedlings and juvenile plants of seed origin were not marked, which proves that population quantity of the studied CPs is promoted vegetatively. We marked insignificant fluctuations of quantitative proportions of different ontogenetic states. Based on the ratio of age index (Delta) and efficiency (omega), all studied C. calceolus coenopopulations, excluding CP4, are defined as ripening. CP4 is characterized as mature (See Fig. 2). Based on the analyses of morphological parameters of variability structure it was determined that the least variable parameters of C. calceolus are the number of leaves, the size of the lip (length and width), and the length of the blade lip; generative sprout height varies the most. The number of flowers can serve as an ecological indicator (See Fig. 3). Analyses of vitality structure allowed revealing that the most favorable conditions for C. calceolus form in spruce herbaceous forests with fir and pine (CP 4), where maximum vitality index (IVC=1.14) and quality parameter (Q=28.0) were marked, as well as the largest number of individuals with high vitality, up to 60.98% (See Table 2). The least favorable conditions form on an anthropogenically transformed substrate of an old limestone open-cut overgrowing with pine, spruce, aspen and mixed herbs (CP5), where IVC and Q reach minimum values of 0.83 and 15.5, correspondingly. CP vitality type estimated by Q-criteria showed that almost all CPs are prosperous (excluding CP5, which is defined as depressed). The studied species has a narrow set of ontogenetic tactics: convergent, divergent, and divergent-convergent (See Fig. 4-6). The type of coherence in morphological structure of the plant revealed a stress-protective ontogenetic strategy (See Fig. 7). Complex estimation of organismic and populational characteristics of C. calceolus showed that most of the studied CPs are "Near Threatened" and need habitat protection measures (See Table 3). CP 1 depends on conservation.

AB  - Competition over limited water resources is one of the main concerns for the coming decades. Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as "hydro-political interactions"). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the trans boundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 "Water resources management", and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 "Transboundary cooperation".

AB  - The Miocene carbonates of the Latiurri-Abruzzi carbonate platform are known as "Calcari a Briozoi e Litotamni" Formation, late Aquitanian to Tortonian in age. The depositional profile obtained by using the relative position of facies belts, and the dependence of some skeletal components upon light penetration is a homoclinal ramp (BRANDANO, 2001; CIVITELLI & BRANDANO, 2005). The profile is the result of both the inherited substratum and the locus of carbonate production and accumulation. The inner ramp is characterized by rhodalgal and subordinately chlorozoan biota producing sediments in a high-enemy environment immediately below the littoral zone with sea grass meadows and associated maerl facies (sensu PERES & PICARD, 1964; BOSENCE, 1983b). The passage from the inner to the middle ramp is characterised by scattered coral carpets. In the middle ramp the main carbonate producers are larger foraminifera and coralline red algae (rhodalgal association). In the proximal outer ramp the main sediment-producing biota belong to the bryomol associations whereas in the distal part the molechfor association is dominant.
   Six red algal rich levels have been investigated from the inner to the middle ramp in the Burdigalian interval.
   The analysis of the algal assemblage evidences a bathymetric gradient. Melobesioideae percentage increases from the inner ramp (63.82%) to the middle ramp (97.68%), whereas the Mastophorideae are more abundant in the inner ramp (23.11%) and decrease moving toward the deeper paleoenvironment (1.16%). The Lithophylloideae are generally accessory (3.78%). An anomalous trend is recorded by the Sporolithaceae, a typical deep-water component, that is relatively abundant here in the inner ramp (24.12%), in particular in the sea grass meadows facies.
   By using the classical paleobathymetric and palaeoclimatic schemes of ADEY (1979), BOSENCE (1983b; 1991) and AGUIRRE et alii (2000), the recognized algal assemblages suggest a growth from the deepest part of the euphotic to the oligophotic zone; nevertheless these classical schemes are elaborated from modern tropical examples in reef systems in oligotrophic conditions. In the Latium Abruzzi carbonate ramp eutrophic conditions are inferred from facies, biota and stable isotope analyses (BRANDANO & CORDA, 2002; POMAR et alii, 2004), and evidence of a nutrient excess during the early to middle Miocene is widely recorded in the Mediterranean area (MUTTI et alii, 1997; 1999; BRANDANO & CORDA, 2002).
   An increase of the trophic resource determines a reduction of the light penetration because elevated nutrient flux supports significant phytoplankton densities in the water column and reduces light reaching bottom-dwelling communities (HALLOCK & SCHLAGER, 1986). Consequently a sciaphile red algae assemblage may develop in a shallower environment. Consequently in the Latium-Abruzzi platform oligophotic conditions may be present in a shallower environment.
   As suggested by BOSENCE (1991), rhodoliths are sensitive indicators of hydrodynamic conditions existing in shallow-water marine environments. The shape and structure of rhodoliths existing from the inner ramp to the middle ramp slope suggest frequent rhodolith displacement in the deeper environments possibly due to bottom-dwelling organisms moving the rhodoliths (STENECK, 1986; PRAGER & GINSBURG, 1989; MARRACK, 1999; GISCHLER & PISERA, 1999).
   The abundance presence of genus Sporolithon in the red algal assemblages suggest that carbonate sedimentation took place in tropical conditions as confirmed by the paleoclimate reconstructions of the Mediterranean area during the investigated interval (BRANDANO & CORDA, 2002; JOHN et alii, 2003; POMAR et alii, 2004).

AB  - Pyrite formation at low temperature during early diagenesis in (sub-)surface sediments is an essential step of Fe and S biogeochemical cycles and the presence of this ubiquitous mineral of surface environments is often used as an indicator of paleo-redox conditions. Pathways of pyrite formation are usually discussed in environmental settings by involving a variety of nanosized Fe-S mineralogical precursors as a function of the local geochemical conditions. However, the influence of trace element impurities such as Ni and As in the solution at the time of pyrite formation has been poorly studied, whereas specific chemical signatures of trace elements are commonly observed in sedimentary pyrites. A better understanding of the impact of Ni and As incorporation at trace levels on pyrite formation is essential to help refining the use of these elements as paleo-redox indicators and to evaluate the role of pyrite as a sink regulating the biogeochemical cycle of potentially toxic trace elements. In this study, we have performed syntheses of pyrite at low temperature via the polysulfide pathway using aqueous Fe(III) and H2S in the presence of trace amounts of Ni(II) (0.001 mol%Fe) and As(III) (0.001 mol%Fe). Analysis of the solids collected at different time steps over the course of the experiments using X-Ray absorption spectroscopy at both the Fe and S K-edges shows that pyrite starts to precipitate within 5 days in presence of Ni(II) and within 32 days in presence of As(III), while the control experiment showed an intermediate precipitation rate of 14 days. Shell-by-shell analysis of Fe K-edge EXAFS data shows that the initial mineralogical precursors are the same in all the experiments and correspond to poorly-crystalline FeS (3.0 +/- 0.1 Fe-S@2.25 angstrom; 1.7 +/- 0.2 Fe-Fe@2.67 angstrom). In addition, XANES qualitative analysis suggests the incorporation of small amounts of Fe(III) within these FeS precursors. Synchrotron-based XRD and WAXS-PDF analysis of the starting solids show that in addition to S(0), the FeS precursors correspond to a continuum of FeS particles that ranges from tetragonal nanocrystalline FeS (a = 3.70(2) angstrom, c = 5.24(7) angstrom, MCDab = 41 +/- 4 angstrom MCDc = 21 +/- 2 angstrom) to cluster-type FeS (MCDabc < 8.4 +/- 4.3 angstrom). We propose that Ni(II) and As(III) have a different type of interaction with these FeS precursors, resulting respectively in an increase and a decrease in the rate of pyrite nucleation. While Ni(II) would incorporate within the structure of the FeS precursors, As would interact with (poly)sulfides in solution to form thio-As, possibly binding or precipitating onto FeS surfaces and thus slowing FeS transformation to FeS2. Given that both Ni and As were introduced at trace levels in our experiments, these results suggest that the occurrence of trace amounts of impurities could have a strong influence on pyrite precipitation kinetics in natural settings such as pore-scale microenvironments. In addition to emphasizing the importance of trace elements such as Ni or As on the persistence of mobile colloidal FeS species in anoxic conditions, the results of the present study also point to the importance of considering the actual nature of the impurities when using pyrite composition for ancient environments and past climates reconstruction.

AB  - Experiments were focused on analysis of indicators of fattening performance, carcass value and meat quality in new-bred hybrid crosses in the conditions of Slovakia. Selection for the above indicators started in mothers of the terminal hybrid when gilts that had reached the weight of 100 kg at the age of 173 days and in vivo meat percentage of 53.2 (using a PIGLOG 105 apparatus) were included in the stock herd of a commercial farm. Sibs and/or half-sibs of mothers of the terminal hybrid of the new-bred hybrid cross had daily weight gain of 815 g, percentage of valuable lean cuts 51.19% and eye-muscle area 39.20 cm(2) in test conditions. Fathers of the terminal hybrid (specifically selected meat line) showed daily weight gain of 871 to 884 g, percentage of valuable lean cuts 53.0 and eye-muscle area 41.7 to 42.4 cm(2) under test conditions. The hybrids received three kinds of feed mixes with different contents of digestible protein substances (11.1, 13.9 and 15.2%), lysine (0.57, 0.73 and 0.85%) and energy (12.7, 12.9. and 13.1 IU ME) in the course of fattening trials. Under approximately the same conditions of external environment, at sex parity and average slaughter weight of about 110 kg the new-bred hybrids receiving the different feed mixes showed the following figures: percentage of lean cuts (neck, shoulder, loin and ham) amounting to 49.58, 50.92 and 51.55, respectively, percentage of meat from ham (in the weight of the side of pork) 19.92, 20.40 and 20.56, resp. percentage of meat from ham and loin 30.05, 31.20 and 31.28, resp. and eye-muscle area 39.61, 40.14 and 40.19 cm(2), resp. The percentage of lean meat content ante mortem and/or post mortem was 55.27 and/or 56.85, the percentage of fatty parts (separable fat from valuable lean cuts + kidney fat) in the weight of the side of pork amounted to 16.68, 14.93 and 14.46 resp. Statistically significant differences were calculated for a majority of the above indicators between the evaluated groups of new-bred hybrids and the Slovhyb 1 cross (Large White x White Pork x Synthetic Line - BU x BM x SL). Production indicators showed daily weight gains ranging from 697 to 752 g and feed conversion per 1 kg weight gain 3.28 to 3.39 kg. As for meat quality, the percentage of PSE meat was not higher than 10% in the new-bred hybrid cross. The results have documented that the test groups of hybrids coming after selected parents showed higher growth ability, better feed conversion and better carcass composition under the same conditions of the external environment. A comparison of these results with the results achieved in the neighboring countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria) has indicated that the new-bred hybrid cross mostly has the better carcass characteristics. The attained meatiness of the dressed carcass is at the level of the results in the countries with advanced pig breeding and is compatible with carcass grading according to the EUROP system.

AB  - Pulsatilla patens has a circumpolar distribution from Eurasia to North America. This species occurs in the central and central-eastern parts of Europe, where is a rare and threatened species. In Poland, the largest number of sites is found in the north-east. A study on populations of P patens was carried out in 2009-2010, at two wildlife refuges of the NATURA 2000 (N2000) network situated in North-Eastern Poland. Local names are following: the "Sejnenskie Lake District" (SLD) and the "Grasslands in the Military Training Grounds in Orzysz" (GMO). The current population structure of P. patens was estimated including the number, density and structure of different life cycle stages. Seventy-nine research plots of 2 m x 2 m were established at sites: dry heath, xeric sand calcareous grassland and pine forest. In each plot, all individuals were recorded and classified into life cycle stages: juvenile, vegetative and flowering individuals. The studies were carried out twice a year - in spring, during the full bloom of Easter pasque flower and in summer, in time of its fructification. The bioindication method was applied in order to determine the climatic and soil conditions of the habitats. Relationships were estimated between these population characteristics and habitat-related features such as the cover of phanerogams, cryptogams, litter, and bare soil. The population found on the GMO, was composed of 316 individuals which gives the density 6.4 ind. per plot while the one in SLD consisted of 202 individuals which gives the density 6.7 ind. per plot. The age structure of the populations proved that these were stable populations. This was evidenced by a large share of vegetative individuals - in both populations they prevailed (ca 64%). The highest share of juvenile individuals was noticed at the sites characterized by a moderate cover of cryptogams (21-35%). The analysis of correlations showed that on the non-forest habitats - dry heath and xeric sand calcareous grassland, the total number of individuals and number of vegetative individuals were negatively correlated with the cover of phanerogams and the cover of cryptogams. It was recorded negative impact of dense moss layer on the number of juvenile individuals. Moreover, the cover of litter had negative influence on the total number of individuals, number of juvenile and vegetative individuals. In contrast, the total number of individuals and number of juvenile individuals at that sites was positively affected by the cover of bare soil. A positive correlation was found between the number of vegetative individuals and phanerogams, and also between the number of juvenile individuals and the cover of bare soil at forest habitats. Negative impact on total number of individuals and the number of flowering individuals is exerted by the cover of cryptogams.
   Considering the ecological indicators set for the plant communities in which Pulsatilla patens appeared, it should be concluded that these were the habitats characterized by moderate light and moderately warm climate condition. The communities with Pulsatilla patens grew on dry and fresh soils, oligotrophic and mesotrophic ones, composed of sand and argillaceous clay. The pH ranging was from moderately acidic to neutral. The analysis of the age structure of the examined populations, the latter can be said to be stable. It can therefore be assumed that the Eastern pasque flower has met the favorable habitat conditions at the analyzed sites, therefore it is justifiable to claim that these sites will exist in the future and will constitute an important part of the resources of this species in Poland.

AB  - During the Toarcian, widespread deposition of organic-rich mudrocks (black shales) occurred across Europe, linked to a 3rd-order sea-level rise. We provide a high-resolution, multi-proxy chemostratigraphic study of the Dotternhausen sections in SW Germany embedded in a stratigraphic and palecological framework. Chemostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental reconstruction is based on Rock-Eval and elemental analysis of bulk organic matter and biomarker analysis of aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions. Aliphatic biomarker ratios applied to reconstruct the facies development include pristane/phytane and (pristane+phytane)/(nC(17)+nC(18)) ratios, carbon preference index, C-27/C-29 sterane, and hopane/sterane distribution. Results show that sea-level change exerted the major control on the composition of primary produced organic matter and on its redox-controlled preservation. Changes in primary production and in the ratio of terrestrially versus marine-derived organic matter take place drastically at the onset of black shale deposition. The relative proportion of terrestrial versus marine biomass accumulation is independently assessed by highly correlative bulk organic matter properties (HI values) and biomarker ratios (CPI). The terrestrially derived end-member yields HI values of 50-100 mg HC/TOC and CPI values of 1.4-2.0, whereas the marine end-member has HI values of 600-700 mg HC/TOC and CPI values of 0.95-1.05. Correspondingly, the shift in plant-versus bacteria-derived biomass is discriminated by HI values and hopane/sterane ratios. Data were grouped according to their position in the lowstand (LST), lower and upper transgressive (TST), highstand systems tract (HST), and maximum flooding surface (mfz) of the sequence stratigraphic framework. Occurrence of organic matter with a significant bacterial contribution is restricted to the LST and lowermost TST and shows hopane/sterane ratios of 0.25-0.5. Marine phytoplanktonic matter dominates the upper TST, HST, and mfz with organic matter giving hopane/sterane ratios between 0.5 and 1.7. Samples from the HST yield HI values between 450 and 500 mg HC/TOC, which is consistently lower by 150 mg HC/TOC when compared to the TST. The lower quality of the organic matter deposited in the HST is due to its longer settling times through a thicker oxygenated water column. A strong correlation with relative sea-level stand and the C-27/C-29 sterane ratio is observed. LST exhibits C-27/C-29 sterane ratios of 0.7, during transgression values increase to 1.0, reaching a maximum at 1.4 during sea-level highstand, thus reflecting decreasing terrigenous input and shifts in near-shore versus open marine algal communities.
   Episodic fluctuation of anoxia is discussed on the basis of a monsoonal climate model, which infers significant surface runoff during summer monsoon providing high nutrient supply and associated high primary productivity. In combination with a density-stratified water column, excellent preservation conditions for organic matter were established. Dry-winter conditions with inversion of the surface-water flow regime led to seasonal export of bottom waters and episodic establishment of dysoxic conditions. Variations in the extent of annual flushing of sub-basins on the Toarcian shelf controlled long-term organic matter accumulation rate. Paleoclimate variability and its connection with sea-level stand is thus of paramount importance for different modes of organic matter accumulation and redox system stability. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The simplicity of many bioeconomic models has been criticised several times, due to their lack of realism resulting from a deterministic nature and a single-species focus. In this context it was interesting to test the financial sensitivity of bioeconomic modelling against fairly well documented ecological effects in mixed forests. For this purpose our study linked existing results of ecological research with bioeconomic modelling. The presented methodological approach could not only show the importance of considering ecological effects in bioeconomic models; it in fact enabled prioritising ecological research from a financial point of view.
   In a first step, the possible influence of the tree species mixture on forest stand resistance, productivity and timber quality was derived from existing studies. In a second step, the available Monte Carlo simulations for Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), simulated under site conditions and risks typical of southern Germany, were extended by the mentioned ecological effects and then evaluated from a financial perspective.
   The results showed a clear influence of all tested ecological effects on the financial indicators, financial risk and return. While testing each ecological effect separately, an increased resistance against wind, snow and insect attacks had the greatest influence on financial risk and return. It over-proportionally enhanced the financial return while simultaneously the financial risk was reduced. In contrast, a degraded timber quality could eliminate the positive effect of risk compensation in mixed forests almost completely. The least influence on the financial indicators finally showed a changed volume growth in mixed forests.
   A combination of the separately tested ecological effects (increased resistance, changed volume growth and decreased timber quality), between both tree species, underlined the dominating importance of the stand resistance. The integration of ecological effects, induced by interdependent tree species, in our bioeconomic model resulted in significantly lower financial risk than ignoring these effects. Moreover, the financial return of mixed stand variants with a proportion of Norway spruce greater than 60% even exceeded that of the most profitable pure stand.
   In conclusion this paper clearly confirmed that ignoring ecological effects in bioeconomic models could lead to seriously biased financial results. While a changed volume growth proved rather to be of minor importance for European beech/Norway spruce stands, tree resistance and timber quality may change the financial results significantly.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between human transformations of land use/land cover and adult dragonfly diversity. Based on previous studies, we assumed that with increasing rates of environmental degradation and declining levels of naturalness, the representation of species with high conservation value would significantly decrease, which, however, would not affect the regional alpha diversity. Our results have shown that species richness did not correspond to habitat naturalness, but the occurrence of endangered species was significantly positively correlated with increasing naturalness; thus, habitat degradation and/or the level of naturalness significantly affected species composition, while species richness remained unchanged. Based on our analyses, it is evident that most natural areas, and therefore the least affected areas, provide suitable conditions for the largest number of endangered species. This research extends our knowledge about the impact of human activities, especially the conversion and degradation of habitats, on the composition of odonates and freshwater animals at the regional scale. Understanding the impact of the changing proportion of land-use patterns on species diversity is a critical issue in conservation biology, and odonates are good bioindicators of these environmental changes. Some freshwater ecosystems that have been modified due to human activities can serve as important secondary habitats for odonate assemblages; however, the majority of studies addressing the value of secondary habitats in industrial and urban areas for adult dragonfly diversity have been limited to the local scale, and the value of such habitats for gamma diversity is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between human transformations of land use/land cover and dragonfly diversity. We interpolated the information based on dragonfly occurrence per grid cell and land cover data, indicating naturalness and degradation in 677 grid cells in the Czech Republic. Species richness did not correspond to habitat naturalness, but the occurrence of endangered species was significantly positively correlated with increasing naturalness; thus, habitat degradation and/or the level of naturalness significantly affected species composition, while species richness remained unchanged. Threatened species that occur predominantly in natural areas and threatened species with a dominant occurrence in degraded squares were also separated, which indicated that the conservation of the latter should be prioritised.

AB  - This article examines phytoecological aspects of plant groups in the Chebket El Melhassa region (Tiaret-Ouest Algerien) by several types of analysis: biological, biogeographic and statistical. From the plant analysis, a list of 103 taxa distributed in 36 families was compiled, biologically characterized by a dominance of therophytes (45.6%) with species of the Mediterranean biogeographic type 20 species (19.8%) assuming particular importance. The ordination of the plant community was performed in the search for the optimum solution based on correlation with environmental factors, estimated using the phytoindication approach. The results reveal that the plants represented in the community, mostly prefer strongly lit places. Phytoindication shows a warm sub Mediterranean climate. Continentality corresponds to the sub-oceanic climate. The moisture regime ranges from strongly dry to dry soil. The plant community is formed on moderately acid soils. Plants are able to grow on both strongly acidic and neutral soils. The soil is very poor or poor in nitrogen. A four dimension variant of multidimensional scaling procedure was selected as the most appropriate decision. Dimensions selected after nonmetric multidimensional scaling were interpreted by computing weighted average scores of ecological factors for ordination configuration. Four of the plant species clusters were found to be the optimal solution on the basis of the Calinsky-Harabasz criteria. The clusters can be viewed as a functional group. Functional group A is quite diverse and represented by 42 species. This functional group is closest to the community optimum because in all four space dimensions the corresponding cluster is near the origin, which corresponds to the most typical ecological conditions. Species that constitute the group B prefer minimum values of dimension 2. This indicates a preference for illuminated sites with high temperature regime and low soil humidity. This group includes 32 species. A feature of group. is that it is located in the area of maximum values for dimension 2. Thus, this functional group is opposite to functional group B. This indicates a preference of species included in the functional group C for wetter soils. Functional group C comprises 21 species. Functional group D differs considerably from all others in its ecological characteristics. The difference is in the preference for minimum values for measurement 1. This suggests that more acid soils are optimal for a given functional group. Functional group E comprises 8 species.

AB  - Nonmarine ostracodes are often used as proxy indicators for the biotic response to climate as well as anthropogenic changes in large lakes. Their large numbers, small size and sensitivities to environmental conditions make them ideal for assessing how organisms respond to environmental perturbations. However, little is known about the various taphonomic processes related to preserving these organisms in the lacustrine fossil record. Without understanding the amount of time averaging associated with these assemblages, any interpretation of their biodiversity and paleoecology may be problematic.
   To address these issues, we conducted actualistic experiments to determine transport, time-averaging, and the amount of taphonomic bias in ostracode sub-fossil assemblages. Sand transport experiments revealed significant mixing at all sites at shallower depths and significant mixing on rocky substrates but not sandy ones. Comparisons with ostracode material collected along the experimental transects support this model and demonstrate time averaging in both the sandy and rocky substrates. Preservational models were derived from the experimental data and applied to interpreting the paleobiologic record of ostracodes from piston cores in both Lake Tanganyika and Malawi. The core record reveals assemblages that have undergone significant time-averaging, and in the case of Lake Malawi, preservational degradation. In the core examined from Tanganyika, most assemblages resemble the time-averaged experimental model with respect to species richness, percentage of articulated shells and heavy bias towards adult dead individuals. In the Malawi cores, most of the valves were preserved only as internal molds. The taphonomic signature of these samples resemble the time-averaged assemblages of Tanganyika cores, even though carapaces are not often present.
   Both the experimental and live/dead valve data suggest significant time-averaging and transport, smearing seasonaly-early data in some environments involved in using ostracodes to assess biotic changes as a result of climate and or anthropogenically-induced environmental change. Ostracode species richness estimates were impacted by time averaging because transport of dead valve material occurs at high percentages in the shallow depths and on the rocky substrates, suggesting that the ostracode death assemblages in these areas will not reflect living populations. In addition, ecologic models based only upon death assemblages will be less resolved than those based upon live assemblages. A time averaging index was derived using the % dead juveniles ratio, as well as sedimentation rate and information on the population dynamics, if known.

AB  - Cladocera serve as important bio- and paleo-indicators of lake food webs and environmental conditions. The ecological optima of cladocerans are often established by regional-scale calibration sets, with subsequent comparisons to limnological variables. However, due to logistical constraints when sampling large numbers of lakes, this approach often limits the length of the environmental gradients that can be examined. To extend spatial and limnological gradients, we combined 20 datasets (388 lakes) containing both cladoceran and environmental data, spanning multiple ecoregions across Canada and Alaska. These data were collected over c. 20 years using similar techniques in a single laboratory. Our continental-scale analysis examined the main chemical and physical variables that influenced cladoceran assemblages, and identified critical environmental thresholds structuring assemblages.
   Multivariate analyses were used to examine the influences of six environmental variables (depth [either maximum depth or coring depth, which are very similar], surface area, pH, calcium [Ca], total phosphorus [TP], and dissolved organic carbon) and ecoregion classifications on cladoceran assemblages. Gradients of pH and Ca were strongly related. Daphnia longispina spp. and Chydorus brevilabris/biovatus were associated with higher pH and Ca concentrations, while Bosmina spp. and Holopedium spp. were more common in lakes with lower pH and Ca. Dissolved organic carbon was highly correlated with TP. Chydorus brevilabris/biovatus was associated with higher-nutrient systems. Littoral chydorids, D. longispina spp., Holopedium spp., and Daphnia pulex spp. were associated with intermediate TP and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and Bosmina spp. was more closely associated with oligotrophic systems.
   Physical limnological variables influenced taxonomic composition on a continental scale. For example, D. longispina spp., D. pulex spp., Bosmina spp., and Holopedium spp. were associated with larger and/or deeper systems, and littoral chydorids were associated with smaller and/or shallower lakes. A multivariate regression tree identified two thresholds important for structuring assemblages based on pH (<7 and >= 7, probably closely tied to lakewater Ca concentrations) and depth (<6.45 m and >= 6.45 m at pH < 7, and <4.75 m and >= 4.75 m at pH >= 7).
   Our results highlight the sensitivity of several cladoceran taxa to multiple chemical and physical gradients. We demonstrate that the ecological responses of cladocerans to environmental variables-often established through regional-scale surveys-are applicable across ecoregions and broad limnological gradients, reinforcing the value of cladocerans as bioindicators of key chemical and physical variables in freshwaters and as paleoindicators for assessing human impacts on aquatic systems through time.

AB  - The natural grasslands of the Pampa biome (PB) are maintained by moderate grazing of large ruminants that traditionally occupy the area, offering a place where food production and natural habitat conservation may coexist. The conversion of natural grasslands (NG) into other land covers, and the consequent modifications of natural landscapes, highlights the need for better management strategies to maintain grasslands in good natural conditions. However, there are many factors that influence sustainability, and to understand the reality of each location and its needs to achieve a sustainable status are a challenge for public managers and for entrepreneurs. Therefore, it is important to evaluate where sustainable beef production is more indicated and which criteria demands more attention for a better sustainable scenario. Hence, this study proposed a composite index to evaluate areas of tension based on the concepts of sustainability and efficient beef cattle farming for NG in the Brazilian PB. The Sustainable Tension Index (STI) is a composite index of descriptor variables that represent the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The selection of this variables was based on a literature review and governmental documents. For each variable a weight was calculated by a principal components analysis. Each standardized variable was multiplied by the value of its weight, and the results were summed for each municipality to obtain the STI. The STI was classified into intervals by dividing the amplitude of the values by five from very low to very high tensions. Municipalities with low tensions across the three dimensions were considered closer to sustainable development. To evaluate the differences among mesoregions, a PERMANOVA was applied in R software. The STI was able to describe the localities regarding sustainable beef production variables and identified the critical factors in each municipality. Most of Pampa's municipalities presented intermediaries STI, but only three presented low tension in all the dimension, emphasizing the complexity of this issue. The southwest and southeast mesoregions were more apt to sustainable beef production, and the metropolitan mesoregion was the least indicated for this activity. Variables associated to education, income and land use had higher weight for the index. The proposed STI is a tool for both farm managers and political representants to support important decisions and its application presented an optimistic reality regarding the Brazilian PB, which if well managed and supported, has a great potential for sustainable beef cattle farming.

AB  - 1.Stream metabolism is increasingly used for monitoring and assessment of the biological condition of aquatic ecosystems. However, distal environmental drivers, such as land use, are typically not well connected to the proximate controls, such as stream chemistry, that are usually invoked as driving metabolism. This is particularly true for North American prairie streams and for grassland streams worldwide. 2.Stream metabolism was measured at the outflow of 19 subcatchments of the Red River in southern Manitoba, Canada. Subcatchments represented gradients of nutrient-producing human activities present in the region, that is, wastewater treatment (WWT), livestock production and crop cultivation. Stream metabolism was estimated at all sites using diel changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration over 1week in the middle of summer. Environmental parameters hypothesised to control stream metabolism were sampled across three spatial scales (stream reach, stream segment and catchment). Model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to determine linkages between environmental parameters and measures of stream metabolism. 3.Estimated rates of metabolism were within the range of past studies of metabolism in prairie streams, although most streams had negative values of net ecosystem metabolism. However, production-to-respiration ratios were >0.5, at all but three sites suggesting that autochthonous production was an important source of organic matter. 4.The a priori model that best predicted gross primary production (GPP) was the intensity of nutrient-producing human activities (i.e. WWT, livestock and crop cultivation) measured at the catchment scale. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was best predicted by the a priori model comprised of GPP, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). However, model averaging revealed that prediction of ER could be improved by including riparian cover and removing TP from the model. The positive association between GPP and ER suggested that heterotrophic compartments of the ecosystem were modest contributors to variation in respiration rates. 5.Overall, this study suggests that variation of metabolism in prairie streams of southern Manitoba is controlled by human activities occurring at the catchment scale, a finding consistent with current hierarchically structured riverine paradigms. Moreover, increased understanding of the hierarchical structure of stream metabolism drivers will help to ensure that assessment results can be used more effectively to inform management strategies for prairie ecosystems.

AB  - Chrysophyte cysts preserved in recent and pre-industrial lake sediment samples from 54 Muskoka-Haliburton (Ontario) lakes were used in a paleolimnological study to determine the impact of acidic precipitation and cottage development on water quality. A total of 246 cyst morphotypes were identified. Ecological preferences of cyst morphotypes were determined using multivariate statistical analysis, cluster analysis, and species-environment correlations. Recent cyst assemblages were related to water chemistry and lake morphometric variables using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The distribution of morphotypes was related to a gradient of acid neutralising capacity (ANC), expressed through the association of variables related to buffering (i.e. longitude, watershed area, and ionic concentration) with the first axis (lambda(1) = 0.29). Cyst assemblages were also defined, to a lesser extent (lambda(2) = 0.06), by a trophic status gradient, created through the combination of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), volume-weighted cottage density, and lake depth variables. The identification of lakewater pH and trophic status as important determinants of cyst assemblage structure allowed for the reconstruction of acidification and eutrophication related water chemistry changes using fossil cyst assemblages. The reconstruction of pre-industrial (pre-1850) water quality conditions with fossil cyst assemblages indicated that pH significantly decreased in 24.1% of the study lakes and increased in 16.7% of the lakes. Increases in pH in more alkaline drainage basins are attributed to alkalinity generation processes induced by acidic precipitation as has been shown in other studies. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly declined in 12.9% of the lakes and increased in 16.6% of lakes. Increases in [TP] were linked to cottage development. Decreases in trophic status may be due to landuse changes, the result of the acidification occurring in the area, or warmer and drier climates. A comparison of chrysophyte cyst and diatom water quality inferences show similar trends in pH changes. There is a good agreement between diatom and chrysophyte bioindicators with respect to [TP] changes in oligotrophic lakes (< 10 mu g/L); however, diatom inferences suggest that lakes with current [TP] values greater than 10 mu g/L have decreased in trophic status over time, while chrysophyte reconstructions suggest that these same lakes have become more productive systems.

AB  - Calcareous and rich fens harbour the unique biodiversity of plants and invertebrates. They are extremely sensitive to landscape changes because of their island nature. In the Carpathians, they are still well-preserved, but their number has substantially decreased. Knowledge about their variability and classification into vegetation units, a baseline for efficient nature conservancy, is still insufficient in the Eastern Carpathians, where phytosociology has used different methodolo-gies than in the Western Carpathians. It has resulted in artificial boundaries in the distribution of vegetation types and low compatibility with modern European habitat classification schemes. Here we gathered a large set of vegetation-plot records, sampled by the unified sampling protocol. The aim was to uncover the principal variation in compositional data, identify resulting clusters with the hitherto reported vegetation units, and create the unified classification system adjusted for the entire Carpathian territory. In line with previous ecological studies, the unsupervised clas-sifications (Twinspan, beta-flexible clustering method) largely mirrored the base saturation gra-dient and distinguished between relict fens and younger fen grasslands. We defined formally the cores of 10 vegetation units well reproduced by unsupervised classifications and used them as prototypes in semi-supervised k-means clustering. The final 10 clusters essentially correspond with phytosociological associations, with five of them being reported for the first time for Roma-nia. These vegetation units were well-separated in the principal coordinate analysis, whose first axis separated relict fens from younger fen grasslands, while the second axis followed the water level gradient largely. Groundwater pH and conductivity contributed to forming significant compositional gradients. Climate (temperature, precipitation, number of hot days above 30 degrees C) and specific edaphic conditions contributed to the diversification of the vegetation types. Our analyses supported the classification of fen grasslands into both the tufa-forming and the peat-forming ones, belonging to different associations and Habitat Directive units, both occurring in all countries including Romania, rather than having a single separate Eastern-Carpathian associa-tion. We provide strong evidence for distinguishing the Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnetalia order and its alliances Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis, Stygio-Caricion limosae and Saxifrago hirculi-Tomentypnion in Romania, the latter missing in other Carpathian countries. The final unified classification system will make Carpathian vegetation types of rich and calcareous fens applicable to continental habitat classification schemes.

AB  - 1. Dredging and related activities are common across nearshore marine environments, potentially threatening nearby ecosystems. Regulatory frameworks are essential for minimizing environmental impacts, yet rely heavily on a sound understanding of how ecosystems will respond to environmental stressors, and the thresholds that delineate benign and harmful conditions.
   2. Here, we use novel statistical approaches and mathematical tools to account for uncertainty in deriving in situ dose-response relationships and thresholds for the environmental management of dredging, based on estimates of the probability of non-zero mortality of corals during a dredging campaign at Barrow Island, Western Australia. Using modified receiver operating characteristic curves, we derive thresholds with explicit Type I and Type II errors rates, across the full range of primary stress pathways and exposure dimensions (intensity, frequency and duration).
   3. Monitoring coral health and mortality can be expensive and water quality indicators are often used to supplement direct receptor monitoring during dredging management. We found strong relationships between coral mortality and a range of water quality exposure metrics, lending support to the use of water quality metrics as management tools for protecting corals during dredging. Metrics based on sediment deposition were more statistically powerful than those based on either light or turbidity, but may be more difficult to implement in practice. Thresholds reflecting aversion to a false sense of security in environmental protection or aversion to the costs of false alarms varied substantially for all exposure metrics examined.
   4. Strategies for managing environmental harm under uncertainty are critical to achieving an informed risk-weighted balance between environmental protection outcomes and development costs. Our study demonstrates the complexities of how communities respond to variable environmental exposure across a range of pressures in time and space, and the value of integrating probabilistic approaches in environmental management to account for that complexity and its associated uncertainty. Coral mortality was strongly related to a range of water quality exposure metrics associated with dredging activities, and regulatory thresholds based on water quality can provide a solid and cost-effective foundation for protecting corals during dredging. The probabilistic dose-response relationships and thresholds presented here are the first to be derived from in situ data using dredging related coral mortality and represent a step forward in integrating formal decision science approaches into environmental management.

AB  - This paper provides an overview on the policy trends of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in Asia. SEA is promoted as a system of incorporating environmental considerations into policies, plans and programmes (PPP). SEA has evolved from an alternative of environmental impact assessments (EIA) to a potential environmental policy integration (EPI) tool in national policy planning. Nevertheless, SEA trends in Asia require a re-examination on its role and effectiveness to avoid SEA implementation in Asia mimicking SEA developments in Europe without customizing its application to local conditions in Asia. Policy trends of SEA in Asia indicate that it is currently an important environmental policy consideration for countries in the region with the formulation of SEA legislations in Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia. Nevertheless, SEA implementation also has been impeded by challenges in realizing practical SEA public participation especially in countries with traditionally high cultural power distance dynamics such as China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Meanwhile, countries such as Japan and Pakistan have voluntarily implemented SEA elements such as public participation without legislative provisions while countries such as Thailand, Philippines, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are resisting the adoption of SEA. The primary problem of SEA implementation in Asia has been its limited integration in strategic decision making due to the highly political nature of policy planning framed within the cultural context of Asian countries. Notable progress of SEA implementation in Asia has been the emerging awareness on the need for SEA. Interestingly, SEA prospects in Asia seem to be in the development of international regional cooperation on SEA capacity building. Meanwhile, SEA implementation range from the use of structured policy instruments such as legislative frameworks to nonstructured policy instruments such as stakeholder engagement. Consequently, the SEA paradigm analysis suggests that SEA integration in Asia requires a paradigm shift to address the primary strategic gap of over-reliance on structured policy instruments such as legislation. This fundamentally means an adaptation towards a hybrid of structured and non-structured policy instruments to super-stream the benefits of SEA. In conclusion, SEA trends in Asia indicate a sagacious realization that SEA in theory maybe a strategic and rationale approach to integrating environmental considerations. However, SEA in practice is a complex, dynamic and challenging process that requires political will, legislative framework and a transparent stakeholder engagement process framed within the cultural context of Asian countries.

AB  - Detailed information on species' ecological niche characteristics that can be related to declines and extinctions is indispensable for a better understanding of the relationship between the occurrence and performance of wild species and their environment and, moreover, for an improved assessment of the impacts of global change. Knowledge on species characteristics such as habitat requirements is already available in the ecological literature for butterflies, but information about their climatic requirements is still lacking. Here we present a unique dataset on the climatic niche characteristics of 397 European butterflies representing 91% of the European species (see Appendix). These characteristics were obtained by combining detailed information on butterfly distributions in Europe (which also led to the 'Distribution Atlas of Butterflies in Europe') and the corresponding climatic conditions. The presented dataset comprises information for the position and breadth of the following climatic niche characteristics: mean annual temperature, range in annual temperature, growing degree days, annual precipitation sum, range in annual precipitation and soil water content. The climatic niche position is indicated by the median and mean value for each climate variable across a species' range, accompanied by the 95% confidence interval for the mean and the number of grid cells used for calculations. Climatic niche breadth is indicated by the standard deviation and the minimum and maximum values for each climatic variable across a species' range. Database compilation was based on high quality standards and the data are ready to use for a broad range of applications.
   It is already evident that the information provided in this dataset is of great relevance for basic and applied ecology. Based on the species temperature index (STI, i.e. the mean temperature value per species), the community temperature index (CTI, i.e. the average STI value across the species in a community) was recently adopted as an indicator of climate change impact on biodiversity by the pan-European framework supporting the Convention on Biological Diversity (Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators 2010) and has already been used in several scientific publications. The application potential of this database ranges from theoretical aspects such as assessments of past niche evolution or analyses of trait interdependencies to the very applied aspects of measuring, monitoring and projecting historical, ongoing and potential future responses to climate change using butterflies as an indicator.

AB  - Quantitative reconstructions are made of Holocene changes in climatic and environmental conditions from analyses of pollen, chironomids and diatoms in identical stratigraphic levels of a sediment core from Vuoskku-javri (68degrees20'43 N, 19degrees06'00 E, 348 m a.s.l.) near Abisko in northern Sweden (Lapland). Transfer functions, based on regional calibration sets, are applied to reconstruct Holocene patterns in mean July air temperature (using all three indicators). mean January air temperature (pollen), annual precipitation (pollen) and lakewater pH (diatoms). During periods with 'good' fit to the modern calibration sets all mean July air-temperature inferences based on the three proxy indicators reveal a general trend of decreasing temperature: pollen-inferred mean July air temperature shows a decrease of c, 1.1degreesC since 7500 cal. yrs BP; the chironomids show a decrease of c. 1.2degreesC since the early Holocene whereas the diatoms show a decrease of c. 1.5degreesC since 6000 cal. yrs BP. Pollen-inferred mean January air temperature indicates that winters may have been warmer by c. 3.0degreesC during the early Holocene, followed by a gradual cooling until 8500 cal. yrs BP (c. 1.0degreesC warmer than today) and a subsequent warming until 7000 cal. yrs BP (c. 2.0degreesC warmer than today). Since 7000 cal, yrs BP, a gradual cooling towards the present-day values is inferred. According to the pollen, annual precipitation may have been considerably higher during the early Holocene than today (c. +150 mm) and increased until 7000 cal. yrs BP (c. +320 mm). Since 7000 cal. yrs BP, annual precipitation decreased continuously towards present-day values. Diatom-inferred pH trends show that natural acidification of c. 0.5 pH units followed deglaciation; present-day values were reached c. 5000 cal. yrs BP. The early Holocene is identified as a problematic time period for the application of modern calibration sets. as diatoms show 'poor' fit to the calibration set from 10 600 to 6000 cal. yrs BP. pollen from 10 600 to 7500 cal. yrs BP, and chironomids from 10 250 to 10 000 cal. yrs BP. Compared with estimates from the COHMAP GCM model, mean July air-temperature inferences based on biological proxies at Vuoskkujavri suggest a more moderate decrease in temperature over the past 9000 years.

AB  - Biological invasions by alien non-indigenous species are one of the major problems of the present era which impose massive environmental and socio-economic costs. In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly.
   The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim datable.
   To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. F-j3-score was utilized to measure the models' performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (x 100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIOS-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors.
   Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.

AB  - Degradation of the environment by agriculture affects the persistence and health of the amphibian populations. Characteristics related to reproduction of anuran can be used to evaluate the status of populations and as endpoints in environmental health assessment. In this in situ study the aspects related to the amplexus and ovipositions of the bioindicator species Rhinella arenarum that inhabits agroecosystems were analyzed. The hypothesis of this study is that perturbations of agroecosystems have a negative impact on the size of reproductive adults, on the size of ovipositions and eggs, and on the survival of eggs and embryos. Study area is located in the rural landscape of central Argentina. Four sampling sites were selected: Cl, C2 and C3 are ponds on agroecosystems; and SM is a reference site that is not affected by agriculture or livestock. Abundance of amplexus pairs, oviposition and tadpoles per site was recorded. Individuals' snout vent length (SVL) in am plexus was measured. The fecundity was calculated like number of eggs per oviposition. The eggs' Gosner stage, the diameter eggs and the frequency of dead and abnormal eggs were recorded by oviposition. Killing-power between egg-embryo and egg-tadpole was calculated. The higher phosphate concentration was detected in all agroecosystems and nitrate was detected in Cl and C2. Conductivity, salinity and SDT were higher in Cl site Male SVL from the SM site was lower than the other sites while the largest SVL was of female from the C3 site. The higher frequencies of sprouted eggs and of dead eggs were recorded in the C2 site. Egg diameter was associated with SM and correlated negatively to SVL of the male and female. No correlation between female SVL and oviposition size was recorded. Killing-power in the passage from egg to tadpole classes was higher in the three agroecosystems. The hypothesis of this study was corroborated in part. Reproductive adults in agroecosystems did not have smaller body size. However, in the agroecosystem ponds, the eggs with smaller diameter were registered, the oviposition had higher frequency of abnormal eggs and the higher mortality was registered. This confirms the high sensitivity of the early stages to environmental disturbances and sustains their use as endpoints for the environmental health assessment.

AB  - Data concerning the occurrence of emerging biological contaminants such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in aquatic environments in Sub-Saharan African countries is limited. On the other hand, antibiotic resistance remains a worldwide problem which may pose serious potential risks to human and animal health. Consequently, there is a growing number of reports concerning the prevalence and dissemination of these contaminants into various environmental compartments. Sediments provide the opportunity to reconstruct the pollution history and evaluate impacts so this study investigates the abundance and distribution of toxic metals. FIB, and ARGs released from hospital effluent wastewaters and their presence in river sediments receiving systems. ARGs (b/a(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bia(SHv), and aadA), total bacterial load, and selected bacterial species FIB [Escherichia coil, Enterococcus (ENT)] and species (Psd) were quantified by targeting species specific genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from 4 hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and their river receiving systems in the City of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The results highlight the great concentration of toxic metals in HOP, reaching the values (in mg kg(-1)) of 47.9 (Cr), 213.6 (Cu), 1434.4 (Zn), 2.6 (Cd), 281.5 (Pb), and 13.6 (Hg). The results also highlight the highest (P < 0.05) values of 16S rRNA, FIB, and ARGs copy numbers in all sampling sites including upstream (control site), discharge point, and downstream of receiving rivers, indicating that the hospital effluent water is not an exclusive source of the biological contaminants entering the urban rivers. Significant correlation were observed between (i) all analyzed ARGs and total bacterial load (16S rRNA) 0.51 to 0.72 (p < 0.001, n = 65); (ii) ARGs (except bla(TEM) and FIB and Psd 0.57 < r < 0.82 (p < 0.001, n = 65); and (iii) ARGs (except bla(TEM) and toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn) 0.44 to 0.72, (p < 0.001, n = 65). These findings demonstrate that several sources including hospital and urban wastewaters contribute to the spread of toxic metals and biological emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Questions How resilient is boreal forest vegetation growing on acidic podzols to the environmental change caused by alkaline kiln dust pollution? How adaptive is the vegetation, when species pool and time for dispersal do not limit? How constant is the species niche breadth along the soil pH gradient? Location Region of 30km around the Kunda cement plant, northern Estonia (59 degrees 30N, 26 degrees 32E), which has been continuously polluted last 140 years. Methods We sampled 20 forest stands on sandy gleyic podzols at various distances from the pollution source, leeward and windward of prevailing winds. Data processing: principal components analysis for gradient generalization, indicator species analysis for grouping species along the pollution gradient and generalized linear model analyses to estimate species reaction to pollution, considering covariates. Results The impact of alkaline dust accumulated over a century persisted despite resolute reductions of pollution. Forest soil conditions changed 10km leeward and 5km windward from the source: the litter pH level changed from 3.6 to 4.5 in unpolluted forests to 7.17.4 in the heavily polluted forests, and soil Ca content increased ten-fold. Soil alkalization has induced a remarkable succession from typical boreal vegetation toward vegetation of boreo-nemoral or calcareous habitats. We detected a linear increase of species richness from habitats on acidic soils (unpolluted) to newly formed alkaline soils (polluted habitats), reflecting the species pool composition and size, which is known to be large for calcicolous species. The establishment of several endangered calcicolous species shows the lack of dispersal limitation and points on their narrow soil pH niche. The niche breadth of species along the pH gradient varied among species, but only a few species appeared to be pH generalists. Conclusions Species ranking along the pH and/or Ca gradients indicates (1) the existence of different ecological guilds in terms of ecological niche use, and (2) the formation of a new community is dictated by the tolerance level of each species. This supports the individualistic community assembly rule suggested by Gleason. We find that such polluted regions with disturbed communities have high scientific value as long-term ecological experiments, but this might lead to conflict between the peculiar biodiversity complex and human well-being.

AB  - The discharge of untreated electroplating wastewaters directly into the environment is a certain source of heavy metals in surface waters. Even though heavy metal discharge is regulated by environmental laws many small-scale electroplating facilities do not apply adequate protective measures. Electroplating wastewaters contain large amounts of various heavy metals (the composition depending on the facility) and the pH value often bellow 2. Such pollution diminishes the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems and also endangers human health. The aim of our study was to observe/measure the toxic effects induced by a mixture of seven heavy metals on a bioindicator species Lemna minor L. Since artificial laboratory metal mixtures cannot entirely predict behaviour of metal mixtures nor provide us with informations relating to the specific conditions in the realistic environment we have used an actual electroplating wastewater sample discharged from a small electroplating facility. In order to obtain three more samples with the same composition of heavy metals but at different concentrations, the original electroplating wastewater sample has undergone a purification process. The purification process used was developed by Orescanin et al. [Orescanin V, Mikelic L, Lulic S, Nad K, Rubcic M, Pavlovic G. Purification of electroplating wastewaters utilizing waste by-product ferrous sulphate and wood fly ash. J Environ Sci Health A 2004; 39 (9): 2437-2446.] in order to remove the heavy metals and adjust the pH value to acceptable values for discharge into the environment. Studies involving plants and multielemental waters are very rare because of the difficulty in explaining inter-actions of the combined toxicities. Regardless of the complexity in interpretation, Lemna bioassay can be efficiently used to assess combined effects of multimetal samples. Such realistic samples should not be avoided because they can provide us with a wide range of information which can help explain many different interactions of metals on plant growth and metabolism. In this study we have primarily evaluated classical toxicity endpoints (relative growth rate, Nfronds/Ncolonies ratio, dry to fresh weight ratio and frond area) and measured guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity as early indicator of oxidative stress. Also, we have measured metal accumulation in plants treated with waste ash water sample with EDXRF analysis and have used toxic unit (TU) approach to predict which metal will contribute the most to the general toxicity of the tested samples.

AB  - Mental health in the workplace is a societal challenge with serious economical and human costs. Most prevalent mental disorders in the workforce (e.g., depression), however, are preventable. There is widespread agreement about the favorable effects of nature exposure and consequently, nature-based interventions (NBI) in the workplace have been proposed as a cost-effective approach to promote good health among employees. The objective of the present study was to systematically review scientific evidence on the effectiveness of NBI to promote mental health and well-being among actual employees in actual workplace settings. The review was conducted and presented in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The literature search was performed on five databases (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINHAL, and PsycINFO), hand-searching of field-specific journals, and the reference lists of retrieved papers over the past 5 years up to November (13(th), 2018). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (i) were randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials; (ii) comprised samples of actual employees; (iii) implemented a workplace-based intervention with exposure to nature; (iv) included comparison conditions that displayed a clear contrast to NBIs; and (v) investigated the quantitative effects on mental health or well-being. No restrictions on type of employees or workplace, publication period, or language of the publication were set. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane's RoB2 tool. Narrative synthesis was performed due to large heterogeneity in outcome variables. Of the 510 articles identified, 10 NBIs (nine papers) met the eligibility criteria. The outcomes were grouped in five categories: (i) mental health indices, (ii) cognitive ability, (iii) recovery and restoration, (iv) work and life satisfaction, and (v) psychophysiological indicators. Narrative synthesis indicates consistently positive effects on mental health indices and cognitive ability, while mixed results were found for the other outcome categories. Caution must be given when interpreting the current evidence in this emerging research field because of the diversity of NBIs and the overall high risk of bias in the individual studies. Although in this field often researchers have to balance scientific rigor and ecological validity, there is a need for large, well-designed and rigorously conducted trials grounded in contemporary theories.

AB  - There have been several ecological studies in forests of the Guayana Shield, but so far none had examined the changes in structure and composition of evergreen forests with altitude. This study describes and analyzes the structure, species composition and soil characteristics of forest stands at different altitudinal zones in Southeastern Venezuelan Guayana, in order to explain the patterns and the main factors that determine the structure and composition of evergreen forests along the altitudinal gradient. Inventories of 3 948 big (>10cm DBH) and 1 328 small (5-10cm DBH) woody stems were carried out in eleven plots, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0ha, along a 188km long transect with elevations between 290 and 1 395masl. It has been found that 1) hemiepihytes become more dominant and lianas reduce their dominance with increasing altitude and 2) the forest structure in the study area is size-dependent. Five families and 12 genera represented only 9% of the total number of families and genera, respectively, recorded troughout the gradient, but the two groups of taxa comprised more than 50% of the Importance Value (the sum of the relative density and the relative dominance) of all measured stems. Moreover, the results suggest that low species richness seems to be associated with the dominance of one or few species. Stand-level wood density (WD) of trees decreased significantly with increasing elevation. WD is an indicator of trees' life history strategy. Its decline suggests a change in the functional composition of the forest with increasing altitude. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated a distinction of the studied forests on the basis of their altitudinal levels and geographic location, and revealed different ecological responses by the forests, to environmental variables along the altitudinal gradient. The variation in species composition, in terms of basal area among stands, was controlled primarily by elevation and secondarily by rainfall and soil conditions. There are other interacting factors not considered in this study like disturbance regime, biological interactions, productivity, and dispersal history, which could affect the structure and composition of the forests in the altitudinal gradient. In conclusion, it appears that the structural and floristic variability observed in the studied transect is produced by a combination of different climates and randomly expressed local processes interacting across a complex physical landscape.

AB  - Development of an Assessment System to Evaluate the Ecological Status of Rivers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region (ASSESS-HKH) was a 3-year research project funded by the European Union (Contract number: INCO-CT-2005-003659). This article provides an overview of this research project by summarising the objectives, the approaches and the main achievements. The main objective was to develop and apply a biological assessment system to evaluate the river's ecological quality and to provide a scientific basis for the identification of sustainable water policy options and management strategies. The assessment tools were jointly developed by European partners, who provided their experience from recent research activities (STAR, AQEM) and Asian partners, who provided the knowledge about Asian river catchments and management necessities. The project was organised into eight work packages defining the time line for all phases, such as establishment of a stream typology and definition of reference conditions and stages of impairment classes for the rivers in the Asian countries, including a review of existing policies for water management. A specific part of the project was dedicated to increasing the overall poor knowledge of benthic invertebrates in the region and their value to the classification of the river's ecological quality. All activities were accompanied by information events for local residents, universities and water managers. A total of 396 multi-habitat samples, from 115 rivers in five different ecoregions, were taken in two different seasons and accompanied by information on 95 parameters describing river and catchment characteristics. The benthic invertebrates in the samples were taxonomically identified based on keys generated within the project. Taxalists, with abundances per site, and field protocol information were entered into a specifically developed software tool. This dataset was the basis for developing ecological river assessment methods, called HKHscreening (Rapid Field Assessment), HKHbios (HKH Biotic Score) and HKHindex (Multimetric Index). Furthermore, a software tool (ECODAT) for using these methods was developed. The monitoring tools will serve citizens and scientists of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region and will provide a scientific basis for policy recommendations, mitigation strategies, transnational water resource planning and sustainable ecosystem management. Additional outputs, including all sampling and laboratory protocols and project deliverables, together with the freely downloadable software, are available at the following website: http://www.assess-hkh.at.

AB  - Mediterranean drylands are particularly vulnerable to predicted increases in aridity which are expected to have negative consequences for biodiversity. To understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems, a framework for the selection of indicators based on the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) was proposed. In this framework, a functional approach has been suggested because functional traits have shown to be sensitive to smallscale environmental changes. Additionally, functional traits are also associated with ecosystem-limiting processes. In this context, we used ants as ecological indicators, as they are functionally important and respond in a measurable way to environmental changes. We identify which biodiversity-based indicators (e.g., taxonomic, single-trait and multi-trait indices) help track changes in Mediterranean drylands; for this, we used a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient in the western Mediterranean. Ants were sampled along an aridity gradient and identified to species level. Four continuous and seven categorical traits were measured or retrieved from literature. Continuous traits included Weber's length, which is indicative for body length, head length, eye length and femur length; categorical traits were diet, behavioral dominance, daily activity, nest preference, mound presence, worker polymorphism and foraging strategy. We calculated taxonomic, functional structure and single- and multi-trait functional diversity indices and correlated them with aridity. We found that ant taxonomic and multi-trait functional diversity were maintained along the aridity gradient. Despite maintenance of species and functional diversity along the gradient, ant functional structure responded to aridity with increases in mean trait values of Weber's length, eye length and femur length in the drier part of the gradient. Under wetter conditions, we found the highest proportion of ants with a seed-based diet, reflecting a potential increase in resource quantity. We observed a change in foraging strategy from group to individual as aridity increased. In conclusion, with a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient, this study shows the potential role of aridity as an environmental driver of ant trait values. These results highlight the value of ants and functional traits as indicators to track the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Finally, this study represents a starting point to monitor important species traits in the context of EBV and to use them as indicators to track the effects of aridity on Mediterranean dryland ecosystems.

AB  - Ostracod assemblages from Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, central Italy), the largest endorheic lake in Italy, were investigated relating their species distribution and ecology to modern physical, chemical and biological parameters. Nineteen living species were collected in the lake (Darwinula stevensoni, Candona (Candona) candida, Candona (Neglecandona) angulata, Fabaeformiscandona fabaeformis, Pseudocandona marchica, Cypria ophtalmica, Ilyocypris gibba, I. salebrosa, I. getica, Cypridopsis vidua, Eucypris virens, Trajancypris clavata, Herpetocypris helenae, Heterocypris salina, H. incongruens, Isocypris beauchampi, Cyprideis torosa, Limnocythere inopinata, and L. stationis). All the identified species belong to the fresh-water Italian ostracod fauna but Cyprideis torosa is documented in an oligohaline athalassic lacustrine environment in Italy for the first time. The occurrence of Ilyocypris salebrosa represents the southernmost record in Italy and the westernmost in Eurasia. The recovery of Limnocythere stationis represents the westernmost record in Eurasia. The distribution of the different ostracods recovered in Lake Trasimeno is linked to the dominant physical and chemical parameters for each ecological niche. Physical and chemical data along with substratum type, grain-size and presence of aquatic macrophytes have been related to different ostracods using a multivariate analyses approach (NMDS, CCA, Spearman's rank correlation test). These results allow to differentiate several ecological niches within the lake and indicate that the main parameters affecting the ostracod assemblages are the aquatic macrophyte coverage, the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and, to a lesser extent, temperature and type of substrate. Cyprideis torosa and Candona (Neglecandona) angulata have been recovered both in the distal part of the lake and in the lakeshore area. In both cases they are associated with scarce or absent aquatic macrophytes and low amounts of TOC. The alternate dominance of these two species in the distal deeper assemblages seems to be mainly linked with the bottom oxygen availability, being C.(N.) angulata dominant in the most oxygen-depleted sediments and C. torosa dominant in higher oxygen conditions. Along the lakeshore area they are often discovered together with other prevailing species, such as Cypridopsis vidua that is common in very shallow to shallow (20-140 cm) sites with high TOC content, abundant macrophytes and algae, and Limnocythere inopinata, which dominates slightly deeper areas (around 150-210 cm) where the previous species are almost absent. The Spearman's rank correlation test showed significant positive correlation between some ostracods and macrophyte species.

AB  - The devastating consequences of desertification and water scarcity can be seen and felt all over the world. About 3.6 billion of the world's 5.2 billion hectares of dryland used for agriculture have suffered erosion, soil degradation and salination. Desertification can also have a serious impact far beyond the borders of directly affected countries, can hinder efforts for sustainable development and introduces new threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies. Forced migration and potential for inter-state conflict add to the urgency of this global problem. Therefore, solutions are desperately needed, such as the improvement of drought and salinity tolerance of crops. A more recent idea is to take advantage of the genetic potential of crops still have (Glenn et al., 1998). This idea requires to first identify accessions of a crop species showing enhanced drought and/or salt tolerance. Another promising approach under discussion is to use (xero-) halophytes instead of glycophytic crops or to transfer genes from halophytes to regular crops to enhance their salt resistance. Halophytes grow in a wide variety of saline habitats, from coastal regions, salt marshes and mudflats to inland deserts, salt flats and steppes (El Shaer, 2003). Halophytes are introduced already at many sites to valorize highly salinized zones and non-conventional water resources such as waste water. However, the sustainable use of these plants depends under osmotic and ionic stress on the ability to exhibit a wide range of responses at molecular, cellular and whole plant levels. This includes the synthesis of compatibles solutes/ osmolytes, specific proteins and radical scavenging mechanisms, ion uptake and compartmentation of injurious ions. Acclimation of these plants to salinity depends also upon activation of cascades of molecular networks involved to stress sensing, signal transduction and the expression of specific stress-related gene and metabolites. The product of these genes may participate in the generation of regulatory molecules such as plant hormones. The deeper understanding and replicability of the physiological and biochemical basis of drought and salt resistance can provide a basis for the cultivation of suitable plants in regions threatened by desertification and water scarcity sustainable culture conditions. Even the drylands could offer tangible economic and ecological opportunities. The aim of this chapter is to screen the responses of halophytes with regard to drought and salt resistance to identify early indicators allowing successful breeding (Koyro et al., 2009).

AB  - Top predators, particularly seabirds, have repeatedly been suggested as indicators of marine ecosystem status. One region currently under pressure from human fisheries and climate change is the North Sea. Standardized seabird monitoring data have been collected on the Isle of May, an important seabird colony in the northwestern North Sea, over the last 10-20 years. Over this period oceanographic conditions have varied markedly, and between 1990 and 1999 a major industrial fishery for sandlance (Ammodytes marinus), the main prey of most seabird species, was prosecuted nearby. Sandlance fishing grounds close to seabird colonies down the east coast of the UK were closed in 2000 in an attempt to improve foraging opportunities for breeding seabirds, particularly black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Initially this closure seemed to be beneficial for kittiwakes with breeding success recovering to pre-fishery levels. However, despite the ban continuing, kittiwakes and many other seabird species in the North Sea suffered severe breeding failures in 2004. In this paper, we test the predictive power of four previously established correlations between kittiwake breeding success and climatic/trophic variables to explain the observed breeding success at the Isle of May in 2004. During the breeding season, kittiwakes at this colony switch from feeding on 1+ group to 0 group sandlance, and results up until 2003 indicated that availability of both age classes had a positive effect on kittiwake breeding success. The low breeding success of kittiwakes in 2004 was consistent with the late appearance and small body size of 0 group sandlance, but at odds with the two variables likely to operate via I group availability (lagged winter sea surface temperature and larval sandlance cohort strength in 2003). The reason for the discrepancy is currently unknown, but analysis of I group sandlance body composition indicated that lipid content in 2004 was extremely low, and thus fish eaten by kittiwakes during pre-breeding and early incubation were likely to be of poor quality. Monitoring of reproductive success of kittiwakes, although useful, was clearly not sufficient to tease apart the complex causation underlying the 2004 event. Monitoring programs such as this, therefore, need to be complemented by detailed research to identify the mechanisms involved, and to attribute and predict the effects of natural and human-induced environmental change.

AB  - It is essential to understand biodiversity's contribution to maintaining river ecosystem functioning and stability, which will us help to develop more effective strategies for river ecosystem conservation. However, knowledge regarding the relationship between multidimensional characteristics of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and stability in aquatic ecosystems remains limited. This study examined the relationships between macroinvertebrate multidimensional diversity, secondary productivity, and secondary productivity/biomass (P/B) ratios in natural river ecosystems to examine which kind of diversity could best indicate community stability. In this study, macroinvertebrates were extensively sampled from Chishui River (CSH, an undammed river) and Heishui River (HSH, a dammed river) in April and September 2019. We comparatively analyzed seasonal variations in different types of diversity (species diversity, SD; phylogenetic diversity, PD; and functional diversity, FD), secondary productivity, and P/B ratios between the two rivers. Structural equation models were used to reveal the relationships between multidimensional diversity, secondary productivity, and P/B ratios. The results showed that SD significantly decreased during September both in the undammed CSH which has dramatic seasonal hydrological fluctuations, and in dammed HSH which has stable seasonal hydrological conditions. These findings indicated that SD could not clearly distinguish the key factors that cause changes in biodiversity. Conversely, both PD and FD significantly declined during September in the undammed CSH, but they did not significantly change in the dammed HSH. This result indicated that PD and FD are more sensitive than SD for identifying the effects of disturbances on biodiversity in these natural river ecosystems. After severe hydrological disturbance, although species abundance, biomass, biodiversity, and secondary productivity decreased in CSH, the still high value of P/B ratios indicated the high functional redundancy of communities, which further demonstrated the high stability of macroinvertebrates in CSH. Structural equation models revealed that the effects of PD and FD on secondary productivity and P/B ratios were more significant than those of SD in both rivers, which suggested that PD and FD may be better indicators of macroinvertebrate community stability than SD in these natural river ecosystems. Our study provides evidence that biological functional traits and evolutionary history can help achieve a more complete understanding of biodiversity patterns that maintain river ecosystem functioning and stability.

AB  - Landfill site selection is one of the important steps in the management of municipal solid waste. Due to the detrimental environmental, economic, and ecological effects of landfill site selection, site selection must be done carefully and scientifically. This study aimed at finding the optimal site selection for a municipal landfill in Kerman City that has the least risk in the environment and is economically optimal. At first, the effective criteria were identified and quantified by fuzzy method. Then, the weight of criteria was also determined by analytic network process. Combination of multi-criteria decision-making method and geographic information system was used to analyze data. Then, using environmental impact assessment method, the selected landfill from aspects such as physical and chemical; biological and ecological; sociological and cultural; and economic and operational components were investigated at two stages of construction and operation. The results of multi-criteria decision-making showed that 1.86% of the land area had a high capability for landfill and 19.06% of the area had no capability. Finally, in the field study, three sites were selected because of their greater area, lower slope, and the proximity to the city as the best options for landfill through field survey. Of these three options, site 1 has a higher priority due to its better distance, greater area than the other two sites, and reduction in landfill transport costs. Also, environmental impact assessment of the selected landfill (option 1) showed that, in general, the negative impacts on the environment at the operation stage due to being in the group of very low and low impacts do not have much intensity of action, and this is due to the desired environmental conditions of the selected landfill for construction of a sanitary landfill. The research findings and field observations also showed that the weighted linear combination method and its integration with analytic network process technique have the flexibility and high potential for model decision-making and implementation and provided more accurate and objective results. Moreover, it is more reliable than other methods including analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy and can be used elsewhere to select the best landfill site selection.

AB  - Seasonal phenology of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon cycle and ecosystem productivity. In urban environments, vegetation phenology is also important because of its influence on public health (e.g., allergies), and energy demand (e.g. cooling effects). In this study, we studied the potential use of remotely sensed observations (i.e. Landsat data) to derive some phenology indicators for vegetation embedded within the urban core domains in four distinctly different U.S. regions (Washington, D.C., King County in Washington, Polk County in Iowa, and Baltimore City and County in Maryland) during the past three decades. We used all available Landsat observations (circa 3000 scenes) from 1982 to 2015 and a self-adjusting double logistic model to detect and quantify the annual change of vegetation phenophases, i.e. indicators of seasonal changes in vegetation. The proposed model can capture and quantify not only phenophases of dense vegetation in rural areas, but also those of mixed vegetation in urban core domains. The derived phenology indicators show a good agreement with similar indicators derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in situ observations, suggesting that the phenology dynamic depicted by the proposed model is reliable. The vegetation phenology and its seasonal and interannual dynamics demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern in urban domains with an earlier (9-14 days) start-of-season (SOS) and a later (13-20 days) end-of-season (EOS), resulting in an extended (5-30 days) growing season length (GSL) when compared to the surrounding suburban and rural areas in the four study regions. There is a general long-term trend of decreasing SOS (-0.30 day per year), and increasing EOS and GSL (0.50 and 0.90 day per year, respectively) over past three decades for these study regions. The magnitude of these trends varies among the four urban systems due to their diverse local climate conditions, vegetation types, and different urban-rural settings. The Landsat derived phenology information for urban domains provides more details when compared to the coarse-resolution datasets such as MODIS, thus improves our understanding of human-natural systems interactions (or feedbacks) in urban domains. Such information is very valuable for urban planning in light of rapid urbanization and expansion of major metropolitans at the national and global levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of agriculture, industry and urbanization, land-use and land-cover (LULC) change has resulted in significant deterioration of water quality and severe eutrophication in most of the lakes in China. Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

AB  - A critical review of biological parameters used to indicate pollutant impact on soil quality was conducted. These parameters mention some soil invertebrates. The value of an indicative organism depends on its life expectancy, life style and specific importance. Nematodes, mites, collembolans, enchytraeids, earthworms, isopods and molluscs are good potential biological indicators. Biological indicators of bioaccumulation and biological indicators of effects (toxicological and ecological) can bq distinguished. Bioaccumulation studies are difficult to interpret, as wide variations could be found, depending on taxonomic group, habitat, organ studied, soil type or even pollutant type. Some groups, such as Collembola, require in depth bioaccumulation studies. It is suggested to use a pool of macro-concentrators, including at least some earthworm, isopod and gastropod species. Toxicological indicators have been well studied and their lethal and sublethal pollutant effects are well known. However, studies have focused on only a few species, such as the earthworm Eisenia foetida or the collembolan Folsomia candida. These studies should be extended to other zoological groups, as well as to several species from the same group, to generate a representative test battery. Exposure biomarkers and physiological change studies should be emphasised, as they act as very early warning systems of contamination. Data are currently lacking on how soil biological processes malfunction due to pollution. We need to explore the links between pollutant effects on soil fauna and pollutant effects on soil functioning. Concerning ecological indicators, studies should develop sampling techniques and parameters, which are specific to ecotoxicological goals. Before-after impact control procedures should be carried out, to eliminate the background noise of the study site and only evaluate the influence of pollutants. On the other hand, ecological indices, such as taxonomic diversity or richness, should be used carefully especially concerning chronic pollution. Effects of pollutants on biological cycle studies seem very promising, but need further information on the life history strategies of many species. Furthermore, the pollutant tolerance of rare species should be considered. The different types of biological indicators yield complementary information on pollutant effects. They all need standard procedures. In this context, studies should be extended and diversified, and associate bioaccumulation, toxicological and ecological indicators to provide better information on soil quality.

AB  - The scale of forest and landscape restoration is expected to increase during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and its contribution to the provision of critical ecosystem services to society. Several models of forest restoration may improve ecosystem services, including soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. A review was carried out to access: (1) the variability of SOC storage between worldwide forest restoration models and, (2) the effects of climate, soil class, soil texture, and vegetation type on SOC storage. We reviewed 119 primary studies with information on SOC and soil texture for different forest restoration models. The restoration models were grouped into four categories: natural regeneration, monocultures, agroforestry, and mixed forest. SOC data was extracted from these four restoration models, other land uses (cropland, bare land, grassland, and natural forest), climate regimes, and soil properties. The SOC storage in the forest restoration models and other land uses at a global scale ranged between 0.1 to 514 Mg ha(-1). The overall mean value for SOC storage was higher for natural regeneration (112 Mg ha(-1)), followed by agroforestry (74 Mg ha(-1)), mixed forest (73 Mg ha(-1)), and monocultures (68 Mg ha(-1)). However, the average SOC storage was similar among the four restoration models in the moist warm climate zone. The SOC storage mean value in the moist cool zone was 23% higher than the dry cool zone (81 and 62 Mg ha(-1), respectively), and 50% higher for the moist warm zone when compared to the dry warm climatic zone (74 and 38 Mg ha(-1), respectively). The SOC storage of the restoration models was positively related to soil depth (0.59; p < 0.01), clay content (0.29; p < 0.01), and stand age (0.17; p < 0.01). Globally, the mean values of SOC storage were 26, 66, and 139 Mg ha(-1) at zero - 10, zero - 30, and zero - 100 cm depths, respectively. In addition, sandy soils showed smaller mean values of SOC storage than medium to clay soils, especially in deeper soil layers. Furthermore, SOC storage was positively related between restoration models and other land uses (0.93; p < 0.01), suggesting a prominent effect of climate and soil properties on SOC. Forest restoration models showed larger SOC storage when compared to croplands and bare land, but in general it was smaller or similar when compared to pasture and natural forest.

AB  - Global warming affects ecosystem services, communities and populations, influencing the physiology, behaviour or environment of living beings, and hence impacts its survival or breeding. Identifying species susceptibility to warming is relevant in assessing risks to animal populations and ecological processes. The progressive increase in ambient temperature as a result of global warming might have an effect on the timing of primary moult. This could affect a bird's annual cycle, influencing reproductive success and population dynamics. We describe a method to examine the potential effects of global warming on the primary moult process in a sedentary population of Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris rufa). We organised the factors that might influence the timing of moult end into a network and distinguished between environmental and intrinsic factors. We sorted the factors according to their contribution to quantitative moult models and constructed a diagrammatic scheme showing their interactions and effect on the end of primary moult over the annual cycle. In Red-legged Partridges, the timing of the end of moult varies according to age-sex class. We found no timing differences by age, but found significant timing differences by adult sex. More females overlap their moult with juveniles than males because female parental effort is higher, more females incubate and brood chicks. The timing of the end of moult varies by year due to conspecific interactions that change according to influences of the weather, habitat, and social and flock conditions. Parent birds synchronize their primary moult with the chick's growth, degree of cover and food resources. From the time of hatching to the following year, the date (day-length), social factors (conspecific interactions), and weather (resources) affect the timing of moult and the birds' annual cycle. Global warming affects the timing of the end of moult and that of the annual cycle. If the extent of the breeding period is shortened, there could be a negative effect on population outcomes. Middle size prey species are key in trophic chains. Our results suggest that the timing of the end of moult could be used as a proxy measure of warming impacts on wildlife and ecosystems and also as a tool for the management of game birds.

AB  - 1. Plant communities that are adapted to low levels of nutrient availability are particularly sensitive to the effects of elevated nitrogen (N) deposition. Although site-level manipulation experiments have been used widely to examine the effects of N deposition on (semi-)natural ecosystems under controlled conditions, relatively few studies have investigated field-scale impacts of elevated ambient N deposition on native plant communities and ecosystems.
   2. This study investigates the relationship between atmospheric N deposition, plant and soil nutrient status and microbial enzyme activities at 32 lowland heathland sites across the UK. Sites were chosen to cover a range of N deposition rates (13.3-30.8 kgN ha(-1) year(-1)), geographical areas and different geologies.
   3. Significant relationships were found between rates of N deposition (total, reduced and oxidized) and concentrations of N and phosphorus (P) in Calluna shoots, litter and soil; relationships were generally stronger with total and reduced forms of N, compared with oxidized N. Litter and humus layers were deeper at sites receiving higher atmospheric N inputs, suggesting increased rates of soil carbon and N accumulation, despite higher levels of phenol-oxidase activity (implying faster rates of organic matter decomposition) at these sites.
   4. The combination of elevated plant and soil P concentrations at sites receiving greater N inputs suggests strongly that N is increasing the availability and uptake rates of P, in addition to N. Furthermore, significant interactions between temperature and N deposition on indices relating to productivity and the turnover and uptake of nutrients highlight the influence of climate on ecosystem response to N deposition.
   5. Synthesis: Field-scale evidence of changes in rates of nutrient cycling, organic matter accumulation and plant biochemistry suggests that ambient levels of N deposition are affecting the functioning of many heathland ecosystems and that the magnitude of these effects is also influenced by climate. Since such changes are known to be associated with reduced resistance to environmental stress and loss of plant diversity, current (and predicted future) levels of N deposition are likely to have important implications for the conservation and long-term sustainability of nutrient-poor ecosystems, particularly in the face of climate change.

AB  - The health and physiological condition of anadromous salmon is of concern as their upriver migration requires navigation of human-impacted waterways and metabolism of stored energy reserves containing anthropogenic contaminants. Such factors may affect reproductive success of fish stocks. This study investigates chemical contaminant burdens and select gene expression profiles in Pacific Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon which traverse the Fraser River watershed during their spawning migration. Chemical analyses of muscle tissue and eggs of salmon collected from the lower Fraser River (pre-migration) and from upstream spawning grounds (post-migration) during the 2007 migration revealed the presence of numerous chemical contaminants, including PCBs, dioxins/furans, pesticides, and heavy metals. However, muscle tissue residue concentrations were well below human health consumption guidelines and 2,3,7,8 TCDD toxic equivalents (Sigma TEQs) in salmon eggs, calculated using WHO toxic equivalency factors (WHO-TEFs) for fish health, did not exceed the 0.3 pg g(-1) wet weight toxicological threshold level previously associated with 30% egg mortality in salmon populations. Quantitative real-time PCR probes were generated and used to assess differences in abundance of key mRNA transcripts encoding nine gene products associated with reproduction, stress, metal toxicity, and exposure to environmental contaminants. Gene expression profiles were characterized in liver and muscle tissue of pre- and post-migration Sockeye and Chinook salmon. The results of stock-matched animals indicate that dynamic changes in mRNA levels occur for a number of genes in both species during migration and suggest that Sockeye salmon exhibit a greater level of biological stress compared to the Chinook salmon population. Using a male-specific genotypic marker, we found that out of the 154 animals examined, one Sockeye was genotypically male but phenotypically female. This individual's gene expression profile in liver and muscle was reminiscent of, but not identical to, the female expression profile. These studies provide the first glimpse of the dynamic yet common nature of changes in the transcriptome that are shared between species during in-migration and highlight differences that may relate to population success. Continued longitudinal assessment will further define the association between contaminant burden, physiological stress, and modulation of gene expression in migrating Pacific salmon.

AB  - Sublittoral rocky reef habitats host important ecological communities in UK waters, but their ecological condition is difficult to monitor. Monitoring methods based on seabed imagery data are prone to inconsistencies in both the identification and enumeration of species, which is a major hurdle in detecting meaningful ecological change. To overcome this problem, our study used a single monitoring dataset, collected using one standard method at the Pisces Reef Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2016. We identified which method of data extraction from seabed imagery is best able to detect change along a gradient of anthropogenic resuspended sediments, which represents a pressure on the epifaunal community. We modelled the spatial distribution of the pressure, caused by nearby fishing activity, using an approach based on individual Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) ping data, rather than spatially homogenised data aggregated to a grid cell. We found that up to 22% of the biological variability across the three reef areas within the MPA is explained by the measured and derived environmental variables. The response of the epibenthic community at Pisces Reef MPA to the resuspended sediments pressure gradient is masked by commonly used univariate metrics such as species diversity and abundance of individuals. Conversely, a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) identifies community-level change caused by a low level of modelled resuspended sediments pressure. We found that a 0.05 decimal degree grid cell of seabed within 1 km of the MPA boundary, swept by demersal fishing gear as little as five times per year on average, can elicit such a community response. The data extraction metric best able to detect this change in the sublittoral rock community is the frequency of occurrence of taxa in images with an average field of view of 0.7 m2, using a 25-cell grid. More traditional metrics extracted from seabed imagery, such as raw counts and percentage cover estimates, are less sensitive to detecting such community change. The TITAN also identified taxon-level responses to the pressure gradient that could be considered for future monitoring programmes. The solitary coral genus Caryophyllia and cup-like sponges show a sharp and strong negative response to pressure exposure, and could represent a starting point for a future monitoring programme of UK sublittoral rock habitats. The implications for future monitoring are discussed, including survey design, environmental and biological data collection and improved pressure modelling.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP), as an important variable and ecological indicator in grassland ecosystems, can reflect environmental change and the carbon budget level. The Ili River Valley is a wetland nestled in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, which responds sensitively to the global climate change. Understanding carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the ecosystem of Ili River Valley has a significant effect on the adaptability of future climate change and sustainable development. In this study, we calculated the NPP and analyzed its spatio-temporal pattern of the Ili River Valley during the period 2000-2014 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model. Results indicate that validation showed a good performance of CASA over the study region, with an overall coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.65 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.86 g C/(m(2).a). Temporally, annual NPP of the Ili River Valley was 599.19 g C/(m(2).a) and showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2014, with an annual decrease rate of-3.51 g C/(m(2).a). However, the spatial variation was not consistent, in which 55.69% of the areas showed a decreasing tendency, 12.60% of the areas remained relatively stable and 31.71% appeared an increasing tendency. In addition, the decreasing trends in NPP were not continuous throughout the 15-year period, which was likely being caused by a shift in climate conditions. Precipitation was found to be the dominant climatic factor that controlled the inter-annual variability in NPP. Furthermore, the correlations between NPP and climate factors differed along the vertical zonal. In the medium-high altitudes of the Ili River Valley, the NPP was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature and net radiation. In the low-altitude valley and high-altitude mountain areas, the NPP showed a negative correlation with precipitation and a weakly positive correlation with temperature and net radiation. The results suggested that the vegetation of the Ili River Valley degraded in recent years, and there was a more complex mechanism of local hydrothermal redistribution that controlled the growth of vegetation in this valley ecosystem.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and the colored component of dissolved organic matter, CDOM, are key indicators of coastal water quality and biogeochemical state. Yet applications of space-based remote sensing to monitoring of CDOM variability across estuarine ecosystems and assessment of DOC exchanges along highly dynamic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces have been scarce, in part due to the coarse spatial resolution of most existing ocean color sensors and the seasonal and regional dependence of most existing algorithms. Here, we used a rich dataset of field observations to develop and validate new CDOM and DOC algorithms that are broadly applicable to different estuarine and coastal regions, over different seasons and a wide range of in-water conditions. Algorithms were applied to satellite imagery from MERIS-Envisat at a spatial resolution (300 m) that can resolve much of the spatial variability that characterizes estuaries and their margins. Multi-spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used to retrieve CDOM absorption at various wavelengths and CDOM absorption spectral slope in the 275-295 nm spectral range (S275-295). DOC concentrations were obtained from a tight relationship between the DOC-specific CDOM absorption and S275-295, two optical quantities that depend only on the quality of CDOM and strongly covary across spatial and temporal scales. Algorithm evaluation using MERIS satellite data across different estuarine and coastal environments (i.e., the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Delaware Bay, the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and the Middle Atlantic Bight coastal waters) and across different seasons over multiple years resulted in relative errors (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) of 29% (N = 17), 9.5% (N = 14), and 18% (N = 32), for a(CDOM)(300), S275-295, and DOC, respectively. These relative errors are comparable to those previously reported for satellite retrievals of CDOM and DOC products in less optically complex offshore waters. Application of these algorithms to multi-year MERIS satellite imagery over the Chesapeake Bay estuary allowed, for the first time, to capture the impact of tidal exchanges on carbon dynamics along wetland estuary interfaces, and resolved spatial gradients, seasonal variability, and year-to-year changes in estuarine carbon amount and quality associated with marsh carbon export, riverine inputs, and extreme precipitation events.

AB  - The Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB) comprises several oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems limited by phosphorus. These aquatic systems are dominated by a high prokaryotic diversity, shaped by the stress of low nutrient supplies and interspecific competition. Although fungi constitute a diverse and important component of microbial diversity, the microfungal diversity in the CCB remains to be unveiled. With the aim to explore microfungal diversity and ecological patterns in this area, we present the first investigation analyzing cultivable taxa from sediment and water, as well as lignocellulolytic taxa obtained from incubated submerged plant debris, and wood panels in three contrasting freshwater systems in the CCB: Churince, Becerra and Pozas Rojas. We chose a culture-based approach to analyze sediment and water samples in order to obtain fungal cultures, providing opportunities for a posteriori studies, and the possibility of ex situ preservation of the diversity. We evaluated sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer including the 5.8 rDNA region for 126 isolates, revealing 37 OTUs. These OTUs were phylogenetically affiliated to several genera in the fungal phyla: Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota. We recorded two OTUs with saline affinity, agreeing with previous findings on the prokaryotic communities with ancestral marine resemblances. All the studied systems showed moderate diversity levels, however discrepancies among the diversity indexes were observed, due to the occurrence of abundant taxa in the samples. Our results indicated that lignocellulolytic microfungal communities are dominated by transient fungal taxa, as resident species were not recorded perhaps as a result of the long-term strong competition with the highly adapted prokaryotic community. Moreover, the obtained microfungal taxa occurred mostly on the resident plant debris, rather than submerged wood panels, perhaps as a result of the high adaptation to specific environmental conditions. In conclusion, the CCB possess a moderate taxonomical diversity compared to other arid environments, probably as a result of high selective pressures. Nonetheless, due to high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the functional fungal diversity was considerable as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Decisively, the assessment of microfungal diversity freshwater systems is relevant, since this ecological group of microorganisms represents an important indicator of trophic complexity and biotic interactions among microbial communities, having important implications for understanding eukaryotic survival at the oligotrophic limit for life.

AB  - Odonates are suggested as bioindicators of human impact. However, their complex life cycles add additional challenges in the practical use as bioindicators, because the level of taxonomic identification could be dependent on life-history stage and, during their ontogeny, dramatic changes occur in their niche (ontogenetic niche shifts). Considering that larvae and adults have different biological characteristics, which could interfere in their performance as bioindicators, we first sought to understand how similar or different environmental factors affect larval and adult life stages in the Odonata. Second, we assessed the level of congruence between (larvae and adult) and within (adult genera and species) life-history stages, considering the taxonomic and numerical resolution. We sampled larvae and adults in 44 streams distributed along a riverine network in southwest Brazil. Larvae samples constituted 20 sampling units of 1 m length each, using the kick sampling method; adults were collected for 1 h at each site with a hand net along a 100-m transect parallel to the stream/river banks. The influence of environmental factors on larvae and adult was assessed by redundancy analysis coupled with forward selection. The congruence level between response matrices was determined by Procrustes analysis. Our results revealed that a set of environmental variables explained a portion of larvae and adults distribution and some environmental factors affect both between (larvae and adults) and within (adult genera and species) life-history stages. Larvae and adult were about 54% congruent, regardless of taxonomic level of adults. Abundance of adult genera and species were 94% congruent, but numerical resolution (abundance vs. incidence) decreased the congruency by 10%. Environmental variables could influence larvae and adults individually or via carry-over effects, i.e., larval environmental conditions that could affect adult fitness components or vice versa. In addition, some odonate behaviors, such as female selection of more appropriate habitats for laying their eggs, could also help us to explain our results, because it could determine larvae distribution. In a biomonitoring perspective, considering the cost-benefit of taxonomic level and sampling of larvae and adults, our results suggest that abundance of adult genera could be used in biomonitoring programs since they capture, respectively, 94% and 54% of the information carried by adult species and larvae.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) strengthened the need for environmental quality assessment with rapid and accurate results. Studies of estuarine benthic macrofauna communities often use 0.5-mm mesh sieves in samples processing. However, this represents a considerable increase in sampling and identification effort compared to the use of 1-mm mesh sieves. Therefore, it is relevant to determine if mesh size matters in environmental quality assessments.
   The objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to test whether sieves with different mesh sizes provided different environmental status assessments in transitional systems, (ii) to compare the performance of different ecological indicators based on data from 0.5- and 1-mm mesh sieves and (iii) to compare the costs involved in using these two mesh sizes.
   Data were collected in the fall of 2007 and winter of 2008 at four sampling stations located in the Mondego Estuary, Portugal. The relative performance of Margalef and Shannon-Wiener indices, AMBI-AZTI Marine Biotic Index, Pielou, Eco-Exergy and Specific Eco-Exergy indices was analysed. Additionally, the multimetric Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT) was applied. The samples from the 1-mm mesh sieve were processed 2.9 times faster than the samples from the 0.5-mm mesh sieves. As expected, the density, biomass and number of species retained in the 0.5-mm mesh sieve were significantly higher in both seasons than the density, biomass and number of species retained in the 1-mm mesh sieve. All indicators were significantly different for the two mesh sizes in at least one season. The Pielou index was significantly different for the two mesh sizes in both seasons. Most indices showed that the 0.5-mm mesh sieve captured more information from the study system. The first BAT analysis provided different Ecological Quality Status (EQS) assessments for the two mesh sizes. To use the EQS obtained from the 1-mm mesh sieve as a proxy for the EQS for the 0.5-mm mesh sieve, further modifications were done in terms of reference conditions and class boundary thresholds. Regarding the Mondego Estuary, the use of a 1-mm mesh sieve appeared to be advantageous on routine environmental quality assessment, giving unbiased results with relatively less effort. Nevertheless, the methodology needs further validation and additional tests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Benthic fauna is an important element of the aquatic trophic chain, the basic element of biomonitoring. Our research was aimed at demonstrating the sensitivity of benthic fauna to the diversified morphometry of a single lake on the example of Lake Wicko (southern coast of the Baltic Sea). Our results show that lake morphometry plays a major role as a structuring factor for macroinvertebrates communities. Two segments of the lake, different in size and depth, show decreasing differences in the trophic state, abundance, diversity and number of indicator species of benthic fauna with the depth gradient. The greatest differences in abundance were observed in the shallowest zone of the bottom (eulittoral), where the chironomids differed the most. In the sublittoral of both lake segments, a simplified structure of benthic communities was found. Differences between the two segments within the intermediate zone (infralittoral zones) were recorded for mollusks and large crustaceans and the Oligochaeta/Chironomidae abundance ratio. The feeding groups were dominated by shredders in the eulittoral and infralittoral of the deeper lake segment. We recommend testing benthic macroinvertebrates in lakes with different morphometrics individually for each depth zone. We investigated the response of benthic macroinvertebrates in the eulittoral, infralittoral, and sublittoral zones, in two segments of the freshwater Lake Wicko on the coast of the Baltic Sea. Our results showed that the morphometry of lakes plays a major role as a factor structuring the macroinvertebrates communities. Two parts of the lake, different in size and depth, show decreasing differences in the trophic state, abundance, diversity and number of indicator species of benthic fauna with the depth gradient. The most significant differences were observed between the littoral zones of both segments. Similar environmental conditions in the sublittoral zones corresponded to the simplified structure of the benthic macroinvertebrates communities. In the infralittoral zone, the most significant differences between the two segments, were recorded for mollusks and large crustaceans as well as the Oligochaeta/Chironomidae abundance ratio. In the sublittoral zone, the diversity of chironomids differed most strongly. Lower species diversity was found in the part of the lake with a slight depth decrease. Shredders reached significantly higher values in eulittoral and infralittoral of the deeper lake segment. Average Score Per Taxon increased with a depth gradient. We recommend testing benthic macroinvertebrates in lakes with different morphometrics individually for each depth zone.

AB  - Effective translation of research findings from laboratory to agricultural fields is essential for the success of biocontrol or growth promotion trials employing beneficial microorganisms. The rhizosphere is to be viewed holistically as a dynamic ecological niche comprising of diverse microorganisms including competitors and noxious antagonists to the bio-inoculant. This study was undertaken to assess the effects due to the soil application of an endophytic bacterium with multiple pathogen antagonistic potential on native bacterial community and its sustenance in agricultural soil. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was employed as a model system considering its frequent isolation as an endophyte, wide antagonistic effects reported against different phytopathogens and soil pests, and that the species is a known human pathogen which makes its usage in agriculture precarious. Employing the strain 'GNS.13.2a' from banana, its survival in field soil and the effects upon soil inoculation were investigated by monitoring total culturable bacterial fraction as the representative indicator of soil microbial community. Serial dilution plating of uninoculated control versus P aeruginosa inoculated soil from banana rhizosphere indicated a significant reduction in native bacterial cfu soon after inoculation compared with control soil as assessed on cetrimide-nalidixic acid selective medium against nutrient agar. Sampling on day-4 showed a significant reduction in P aeruginosa cfu in inoculated soil and a continuous dip thereafter registering >99% reduction within 1 week while the native bacterial population resurged with cfu restoration on par with control. This was validated in contained trials with banana plants. Conversely, P aeruginosa showed static cfu or proliferation in axenic-soil. Lateral introduction of soil microbiome in P aeruginosa established soil under axenic conditions or its co-incubation with soil microbiota in suspension indicated significant adverse effects by native microbial community. Direct agar-plate challenge assays with individual environmental bacterial isolates displayed varying interactive or antagonistic effects. In effect, the application of P. aeruginosa in rhizospheric soil did not serve any net benefit in terms of sustained survival. Conversely, it caused a disturbance to the native soil bacterial community. The findings highlight the need for monitoring the bio-inoculant(s) in field-soil and assessing the interactive effects with native microbial community before commercial recommendation.

AB  - One of the most significant biological impacts of global climate change is through alterations of organismal body temperature, which ultimately drives almost all physiological processes. Using a simple heat budget model ground-truthed using similar to 5 years of in situ temperature data collected using biomimetic sensors, we explored the sensitivity of aerial (low tide) mussel body temperature at three tidal elevations to changes in air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, wave height, and the timing of low tide at a site in central California, USA (Bodega Bay). Results suggest that while increases in air temperature and solar radiation can significantly alter the risk of exposure to stressful conditions, especially at upper intertidal elevations, patterns of risk can be substantially reduced by convective cooling such that even moderate increases in mean wind speed (similar to 1 m s(-1)) can theoretically counteract the effects of substantial (2.5 degrees C) increases in air temperature. Simulations further suggest that shifts in the timing of low tide (+1 h), such as occur moving to different locations along the coast of California, can have very large impacts on sensitivity to increases in air temperature. Depending on the timing of low tide, at some sites increases in air temperature will primarily affect animals in the upper intertidal zone, while at other sites animals will be affected across all tidal elevations. Field measurements and model predictions show that animal temperatures are often high even when air temperatures are not, confirming the importance of solar radiation in the heat budgets of intertidal ectotherms. Conversely, body temperatures are not always elevated even when low tide air temperatures are extreme due to the combined effects of convective cooling and wave splash. The results of these simulations. coupled with ongoing field measurements, suggest that the timing and magnitude of warming will be highly variable at coastal sites, and can be driven to a large extent by local oceanographic and meteorological processes. Moreover, they strongly caution against the use of single environmental metrics such as air temperature as indicators of past, current and future physiological stress on the west coast of North America, and instead advocate for approaches that consider the interactive roles of multiple physical drivers.

AB  - The development of forests undergoing restoration determines the structure of the vegetation, influencing ground-dwelling arthropod composition. Soil fertility can interact with vegetation structure, influencing the diversity and composition of arthropod assemblages through bottom-up effects on developing forests. We evaluated if soil fertility (here defined by the attributes directly related to macronutrient availability) and the vegetation structure in three adjacent areas from different land-use/cover categories (abandoned pasture, riparian forest undergoing restoration, and remnant riparian forest) influences ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages. These areas were subject to a gradient of soil fertility due to the presence of a corral that resulted in a local increase of soil nutrients in the three areas, enabling to evaluate the interaction between soil fertility and vegetation structure. We hypothesized that ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages have lower diversity in pasture, intermediate in forest undergoing restoration and higher diversity in the remnant forest. Furthermore, we expected that increasing soil fertility would have a positive effect in these assemblages through bottom-up effects. Environmental conditions were characterized by vegetation structure and soil chemical attributes variables, whereas arthropods were sampled with pitfalls and identified to morphospecies. Diversity indicators responded differentially to the studied effects. Abundances decreased with soil fertility, and were higher in the forest undergoing restoration, followed by pasture and remnant forest. Species richness also varied among categories, following the same pattern as abundances. On the other hand, diversity indices indicated an interaction between soil fertility and land use category, with larger effects of soil fertility on diversity in the more simplified habitats (pasture and forest undergoing restoration), whereas no bottom-up effects were recorded in the remnant forest; species evenness increased with soil fertility in all studied areas. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that both vegetation structure and soil attributes significantly influenced arthropod composition. Arthropod assemblages in areas undergoing restoration with higher soil fertility and low grass cover were more similar to assemblages in remnant forest when compared to areas with low soil fertility, independently of the vegetation structure, indicating an interaction between these two effects. Therefore, ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages responded both to increasing vegetation complexity resulting from the different land use/cover categories, and to increasing soil fertility, so that they are effective indicators to evaluate the recovery of ecosystems in forest restoration projects and to determine the importance of soil fertility in this process.

AB  - Bioturbation is one of the key mediators of biogeochemical processes in benthic habitats that can have a high contribution to seafloor functioning and benthic pelagic coupling in coastal waters. Previous studies on bioturbation were limited to point locations and extrapolations in single regions, but have not accounted for regional differences under changing environmental conditions, though there are indications that species contributions will differ across regions or with biotic and abiotic context. To capture those differences and assess global patterns and commonalities, mull-regional analyses are imperative. Here for the first time, bioturbation potential (BPc), a functional indicator of benthic community bioturbation, was estimated based on macrofauna data from four regions (i.e. German Baltic Sea, German North Sea, Belgian part of the North Sea and the Eastern English Channel). For each region and sediment type we identified key species contributing to BPc. Comparison within and across regions demonstrated regional differences, and both overlap and mismatch between species that are functionally important and those that are dominant in biomass. Knowledge on the functionally important species is crucial when management objectives include the protection of certain ecosystem functions. Available environmental layers were used as predictors to model the spatial distribution of BPc for each area and to explore the underlying drivers of differences. Random forest models were trained using as response variables either i) BPc initially calculated per station; or ii) BPp - the species-specific contribution to BPc - for key species (with subsequent summation of their predicted full-coverage distributions to Bp(c)). Maps of BPc distribution predicted by random forest were compared with those generated using natural neighbour interpolation. Overall, derived BPc values increased towards the German parts of the North and Baltic Seas. The relevance of BPc for ecosystem processes and functions, however, vary with biotic and abiotic settings. Results revealed a strong association of BPc with species diversity and region, but less with sediment grain size. A large range of BPc occurred when species richness was low. This suggests that the provisioning of high bioturbation activity is possible also under low diversity, where it is vulnerable due to reduced resilience. The executed mull-regional analysis allowed identifying regional differences in performance of macrofauna, suggesting the need for region-specific conservation and management strategies.

AB  - The Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME) is subject to moderate to high levels of fishing, mining and numerous other human pressures, all of which are set to intensify through current socio-economic development initiatives in Angola, Namibia and South Africa. There is, however, minimal spatial protection of marine and coastal ecosystems in the region, potentially reducing the sustainability of the planned development and the likelihood of achieving Sustainable Development Goals. As a precursor to Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) processes in the three countries, and to guide establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), this study aimed to: assess two headline indicators of ecosystem status, namely their potential threat status and current spatial protection levels; and to use Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) to prioritise specific areas for protection to achieve networks of MPAs that are representative of national and regional biodiversity. Two hundred and forty eight ecosystem types in the coastal (n = 134), offshore benthic (n = 86) and pelagic (n = 28) zones of the BCLME were classified, mapped and assessed. Overall, 35% of all ecosystem types in the study domain were threatened, with more threatened coastal (37%) and offshore benthic (37%) ecosystem types compared to pelagic ecosystem types (14%), although the same pattern was not necessarily evident within each country. Nearly two thirds (59%) of the BCLME ecosystem types were not protected in MPAs, and most of those that were well (19%) or moderately protected (14%) were coastal types that are within a single extensive MPA in Namibia. Notwithstanding, there was still a sufficient area of most ecosystem types that was assessed to be in good ecological condition in all three countries and that could be prioritised for representative protection of the region's biodiversity. A portfolio of priority conservation areas was identified from Marxan selection-frequency outputs, providing a spatial vision for protected areas in the BCLME that includes coastal, inshore and offshore areas in all three countries. This first assessment of marine ecosystem threat and protection status for an entire LME demonstrates a rapid science-based approach that can inform integrated ocean management and multiple development goals. The study provides a basis for identifying Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas, potential sites for MPAs or other spatial management in the region, and demonstrates the contribution of SCP and spatial management to MSP.

AB  - 1. The magnitude and spatial scales of human effects on stream habitats need to be correctly measured to achieve sound ecosystem management. We investigated whether the biogeochemical properties of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) might be indicative of reach-scale vs. catchment-scale effects on forested stream ecosystems.
   2. Along each of three forested streams, we established 4-5 sampling stations at 0.6-2.0-km intervals, which represent a range of local riparian forest conditions (e.g. vegetation types and forestry practices). At each station, rock biofilm (considered as a representative of stream-origin POM), FPOM in sediment (FPOM(S)) and suspended in water (FPOM(W)) and three species of benthic macroinvertebrates were collected during a summer low-flow period.
   3. Measures of delta(13)C, C:N and chlorophyll a:C for FPOMW, FPOMS and biofilm were longitudinally heterogeneous, reflecting the reach-scale, local environment. delta(13)C, C:N and chlorophyll a:C of FPOMS were significantly related to irradiance and streambed coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) abundance, suggesting that the relative contribution of in-stream primary production and CPOM breakdown are dominant controls of FPOM properties.
   4. In redundancy analysis, variations in FPOM properties were principally explained by local environmental factors correlated with stream size and/or longitudinal position of the sampling stations (irradiance, streambed CPOM, stream gradient, discharge, riparian vegetation). No significant effect of riparian forestry activities (logged, riparian reserve or no harvest in the past 75 years) was found on FPOM properties.
   5. Resource use by primary consumers was species dependent. delta(13)C of larval Lepidostoma roafi-depended on the relative abundance of stream-origin POM in pools of stored FPOM. Selective intake/assimilation of stream-origin POM by this species was probably enhanced when stream-origin POM was abundant. delta(13)C of larval Despaxia augusta or larval Paraleptophlebia spp. were not related to FPOMS delta(13)C, suggesting no linkage with FPOM composition.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The tight linkages between biogeochemical properties of FPOM, resource use by primary consumers, and reach-scale environment indicate that local effects were greater than signals transmitted from upstream in this study. The use of in-stream FPOM properties can help managers to measure reach-scale effects of environmental changes on forested stream habitats.

AB  - 1. Invasive species are present worldwide, yet predicting which invasive species will become problematic in which ecosystems remains an important ecological challenge. Floodplains are at particular risk for invasion, especially when subjected to anthropogenic disturbance.
   2. We examined how components of flood regime, habitat quality and habitat configuration influenced the presence and abundance of three invasive shrubs in the floodplain of the Wisconsin River. Shrub taxa included two non-natives (Lonicera spp. and Rhamnus spp.) and one native (Zanthoxylum americanum). Observations of taxa presence and abundance were recorded in nine forested river reaches, spanning three physiographic regions. We also compared the productivity of Z. americanum across a flood control levee in one reach.
   3. Physiographic region significantly predicted the presence and abundance of these three taxa, acting as a synthetic indicator of differences in climate, geography and topography. Invasion was greatest in regions where modifications to flood regime and land use were most pronounced. Physiographic region was excluded from subsequent analyses to assess more specific predictors of shrub distributions.
   4. Habitat configuration and quality both predicted shrub taxa presence and abundance. Shrub taxa were most frequently observed and most abundant in small forest patches, near roads, and in sandy soil with low nutrient content. Edge habitats have many of these characteristics. Edges appear to be favoured by avian shrub dispersers and provide conditions suitable for invasive establishment.
   5. Flooding influenced non-native and native invaders differently. Non-native taxa were observed less frequently and at lower abundances in frequently flooded areas, probably because of a sensitivity to flooding. However, the presence, abundance and productivity of the native invader increased with flooding. Anthropogenic modifications to the flood regime limited hydrologic connectivity and may have reduced the competitive advantage of flood-tolerant traits, which allowed the invasion of upland species.
   6. Synthesis. In the floodplain of the Wisconsin River, anthropogenic modifications that created edge habitat and altered flood regime facilitated shrub invasions, whereas unfragmented forest and intact flood regime limited invasion. Large patches of floodplain forest, less regulated flooding regimes, and lower road densities may help reduce the spread of invasive shrubs in temperate floodplains.

AB  - Sustainable agroecosystem management generally entails increased management ability and input. Decision making for sustainable management could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns. Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions. We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI. Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices: land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at least 85% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an average R-2 = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.

AB  - Recent advances in pollution control and monitoring technologies, improved analytical capability, changes in government priorities and results of scientific studies have substantially changed our views and perceptions towards marine pollution in the last two decades. Globally, the problems caused by eutrophication, water borne pathogens and xenobiotic compounds are likely to be exacerbated and pose significant ecological and/or public health risks in the coming years, especially in developing countries. The large amount of anthropogenic input of nutrients has caused major changes in the structure and function of phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic and fish communities over large areas, and such a trend is likely to continue in many coastal waters. Escalated public health risks associated with the increases in frequency and severity of toxic algal blooms are also of growing concern. Reduction of nutrient input through changes in land-use and farming practises, and the development of cost-effective methods for nutrient removal are required. Water borne pathogens affect large numbers of people through consumption of contaminated seafood and direct contact with contaminated water, and such problems are much more serious in developing countries. Current techniques in monitoring bacterial indicators in water and shellfish have clear limitations and cannot afford adequate protection to safeguard public health. Emerging molecular techniques, such as multiplex PCR and specific gene probes, are likely to provide new and cost effective tools for monitoring water borne pathogens in the coming years. Nowadays, xenobiotic compounds can be found almost everywhere in any marine ecosystems. Although these compounds normally occur at very low concentrations and their effects are not well understood, there is growing concern about the chronic exposure and bioconcentration/biomagnification of xenobiotic compounds. In particular, endocrine disrupters which may cause reproductive dysfunction and threaten species survival, are of growing concern. At present, most of our knowledge on toxic effects of xenobiotic compounds is derived from short-term exposure of a single species to high (environmentally unrealistic) and uniform concentrations under laboratory conditions. Data so derived are largely inadequate in predicting ecological effects in the field, in which multi-species are being exposed to varying, low concentrations under an interacting and complex environment. NOEC and LOEC for population/community/ecosystem, as well as the time required for population/community/ecosystems to recover after toxicant insult, are poorly known. These important topics,will become the major endeavours for ecotoxicologists in the years to come. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land degradation is a major environmental issue affecting numerous countries worldwide, including certain European states. An in-depth understanding of this complex process's spatial pattern requires multicriteria approaches such as MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) model, which can be extremely useful in identifying lands that are sensitive to degradation in countries that have yet to be explored in this respect, such as Romania. This paper aims to apply the well-established MEDALUS methodology for the first time in a nationwide analysis of Romania, based on various spatial data used as main indicators and sub-indicators (environmental parameters) considered to be driving forces of land degradation. The study aims to map and statistically assess lands with different degrees of sensitivity to degradation, considering seven main environmental quality indicators, four of which are featured in the original MEDALUS method (Climate Quality Index - CQI, Soil Quality Index - SQL Vegetation Quality Index - VQI and Management Quality Index - MQI), while three were proposed and added (Water Quality Index - WQI, Geomorphological Quality Index - GQI and Anthropic Quality Index - AQI) in order to capture the particularities of potentially degraded lands in Romania as accurately as possible. The seven quality indicators were processed by considering 24 geographical parameters, 14 of which were featured in the standard MEDALUS method, while 10 parameters were added in order to reflect the specific land degradation conditions in Romania. The final results, analysed using the Land Degradation Sensitivity Index (LDSI), showed that 29% (similar to 68,600 km(2)) of the country's total area is critically sensitive to degradation, if considering the most complex LDSI model, assessed based on all biophysical/natural (CQI, SQL GQI, VQI and WQI) and anthropogenic (MQI and AQI) indicators. If considering the LDSI obtained based only on biophysical indicators (which highlight the natural degradation of lands, not directly influenced by anthropogenic pressures), then only 18% (similar to 42,400 km(2)) of Romania's territory is critically susceptible to degradation. Spatially, it was found that extra-Carpathian areas are by far the most heavily threatened by degradation. The results provide a full overview of this process in Romania and can constitute a basic scientific support for implementing current and future policies aimed at fighting the negative ecological and socio-economic effects of this disrupting environmental process.

AB  - The aim of the work is to present (i) the economic issues included in the forest management plans and (ii) the methodical bases of an ex post economic expertise, which may be carried out in order to evaluate the previous economic period, and should be a part of the economic annex to the forest management plan. Such expertise allows to formulate postulates and objectives to achieve in the near future, which are important for the forestry economics. The transformation in Poland occurred when the third revision of the forest management plans and instruction of the 1980 and 1994 were applied and caused significant changes in the Polish forestry. As a result, the concept of sustainable development of forestry appeared and the indicators and criteria for sustainable forest development were elaborated. However, they concerned mainly natural and social aspects, while the economic aspect was marginalized. Gradually, foresters began to appreciate the role of the economic analysis. The first versions of such expertise was already elaborated for the individual forest districts. The experience gained will certainly contribute to their dissemination and appreciation of included analysis and forecasts. The economic annexes should include information on value of the forest with an indication of the value of land and the stands themselves. The knowledge on the value of the forest, except for registration, is also required in determining changes as a result of business (in the income statement). The valuation of timber resources is also necessary in the evaluation of the effectiveness of economic projects in forestry affecting the changes in their value. In practice, the valuation of the forest is also essential in case of a change in the ownership or land use status. This usually applies to the sale, purchase, conversion or liquidation of the co-ownership, and also compensation for expropriation because of the road or residential construction. Furthermore, determination of the forest value is necessary in assessing the share of agriculture in national income. This applies particularly to the integrated economic and environmental national accounts in forestry, conducted in some European Union countries. The presented methodology of economic expertise points out the possibility of application the formula that introduces standardization of analysis of economy in the last economic period. It is also the contribution to the discussion on the elaboration of a single, synthetic parameter, which may influence on objectivity of economic conditions of the functioning of the forest holding.

AB  - Application of paleoenvironmental approaches provides insight into the magnitude and timing of responses to climate warming in aquatic-ecosystems of northern Canada. We examined subfossil biological (Diptera:Chironomidae) and geochemical indicators (organic carbon and elemental nitrogen and stable isotope composition) in a sediment core from Buckland Lake, northern Manitoba, to assess the influence of recent warming (1981-2011) in the central subarctic region of Canada. The earlier part of the paleolimnological record (1830-1980) was characterized by relatively low chironomid diversity (N2 similar to 6), consisting primarily of profundal taxa (Orthocladius consobrinus and Chironomus), low organic matter content of sediments (< 12%), low C:N ratios (< 9), and high delta N-15 values (> 3 parts per thousand), indicative of a cold-water environment with low nitrogen demand. Between 1910 and 1980, there was a decline in profundal taxa, with small gradual increases in littoral taxa, such as Cladotanytarsus mancus-group. Post-1980 sediment core intervals had distinct geochemistry, with declines in delta C-13(org) from - 27.5 parts per thousand to almost - 29 parts per thousand, consistent with warming, increased terrestrial influence, and increased snowfall and runoff. We found substantial inferred warming (+ 1-2 degrees C), with several chironomid-inferred temperatures nearly 3 degrees C warmer than typical pre-1980 inferences. Concurrently, several warm-water-adapted littoral chironomid taxa (Cladopelma, Cryptochironomus, Polypedilum) recorded increases. The post-1990 records reflected continued increases in warm-water taxa, changes in the benthic:pelagic trophic structure, and reversal of previous trends in the delta C-13(org), %Organic Carbon, and delta N-15 profiles, suggestive of increased aquatic productivity. The meteorological station at Gillam, Manitoba, also recorded warming (1.5 degrees C) and a reduction in snowfall during that time period. A reduction in spring recharge may have increased littoral habitat associated with lake-level drawdown. The climate-driven shift observed similar to 1980 is in generally good agreement with other regional analyses, which show regime shifts occurred similar to 1995. The earlier lake response (similar to 1980), however, demonstrates the role of increased catchment-mediated influences on northern boreal lake productivity that may only appear in records with sufficiently high resolution and multiple paleolimnological indicators.

AB  - Even-aged management based on clear cutting has simplified the structure of boreal forests, which has adversely affected ecosystem services, including biodiversity. A potential way of combining economic, ecological and social sustainability in forest management is emulation of natural disturbance dynamics. However, ecological effects of alternative cutting methods have been little studied in northern Europe. We studied the responses of beetles (Coleoptera) to four cutting treatments selection, gap, patch and clear cutting compared to uncut control stands. We collected beetles one year before, and one and three years after cutting using flight-intercept window traps to assess the effects of treatment, proportion of removed trees, size of harvested gaps, and the volume of dead wood on the species richness and composition of beetles. The total number of species increased sharply in the first year after cutting in all the four treatments. Three years after cutting, the difference in species richness between controls and treatments had decreased. Both species richness and community structure formed a continuum according to treatment intensity. Selection cuts were most similar to the controls, while clear cuts differed from all the other treatments. Irrespective of the treatment, species richness of saproxylic beetles increased with the volume of dead wood, while the number of non-saproxylic species increased with gap size. Contrary to expectation, the proportion of species that were found both before and after cutting did not differ significantly between the treatments. According to an indicator species analysis, two species were associated with controls, 11 with a combination of controls and selection, gap or patch cuts, 17 with patch and clear cuts, and 38 with clear cuts. Our findings suggest that increasing harvesting intensity rapidly increases the total species richness of beetles in the studied spruce forests, but that community recovery may be faster in the less intensive treatments. In the short term, most beetle species inhabiting mature managed forests seem to tolerate cutting disturbances creating open conditions. Clear cuts hosted a large number of species, including species of conservation concern, which were missing from other cutting treatments. Even a moderate increase in the level of dead wood in managed forests is likely to enhance saproxylic diversity. If the aim of management is to preserve mature-forest beetle communities, selection or gap cutting should be used instead of clear cutting.

AB  - The paleoecological context of hominin occupation in South Asia during the early and middle Pleistocene is virtually unknown. Attirampakkam, India, is an archeological site of global importance, with an early Acheulian occupation (age bracket of similar to 1.07-1.77 Ma) succeeded by Middle Paleolithic levels. Here we report on the recovery of phytoliths from artifact-bearing Quaternary deposits in excavated trenches. We focus on the reconstruction of past vegetation during hominin occupation of the site. The present study provides information on hominin microenvironments and local habitats in South Asia, situating them in a more tangible ecological context than so far achieved. Results show that this region was arid during the earlier stages of the early Pleistocene, and was occupied by hominins living in a landscape locally lacking woody plants. Herbaceous vegetation was dominated by C-4 Chloridoid grasses. In the later phase of the early Pleistocene, the landscape was wooded and dominated by C-4 Panicoid grasses, with a significant reduction of C-4 Chloridoid grasses indicating a shift from a drier to a relatively more humid climate. A diverse husk and leaf phytolith assemblage of wild Oryza spp. (rice) occurring as natural annual or perennial components of the vegetation in the area, other herbaceous plants such as Cyperaceae (sedges), and the continuous presence of blackened phytoliths, suggest the establishment a grassland landscape with enclaves of wetland habitat affected by seasonal flooding and frequent fires. The transition from the early to the middle Pleistocene was marked by a moderately humid climate, with a shift toward aridity during the late Pleistocene, during which we note an environment dominated by C-4 Chloridoid grasses, by a sharp reduction of C-4 Panicoid grasses, and by a rise in woody taxa. During the middle to late Pleistocene, Middle Paleolithic populations would have witnessed water bodies near the site, as reflected by the presence of plants adapted to swampier conditions such as Cyperaceae and Oryza spp. The archeological record terminates in Layer 1, when human occupation decreased drastically, possibly because of increased aridity and/or greater environmental variability. The phytolith fingerprint at ATM sheds light on the co-occurrence of, vegetation, fire and early prehistoric land occupation. An important aspect is the evidence of Oryza spp., suggesting that wild rice occurred in the environment frequented by these early hominins.

AB  - This paper presents a whole farm bio-economic modelling approach for the assessment and optimisation of amphibian conservation conditions applied at the example of a large scale organic farm in North-Eastern Germany. The assessment focuses mainly on the habitat quality as affected by conservation measures such as through specific adapted crop production activities (CPA) and in-field buffer strips for the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), considering also interrelations with other amphibian species (i.e. common spadefoot toad (Pelobates fuscus), fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina)). The aim of the approach is to understand, analyse and optimize the relationships between the ecological and economic performance of an organic farming system, based on the expectation that amphibians are differently impacted by different CPAs.
   The modelling system consists of a set of different sub-models that generate a farm model on the basis of environmentally evaluated CPAs. A crop-rotation sub-model provides a set of agronomically sustainable crop rotations that ensures overall sufficient nitrogen supply and controls weed, pest and disease infestations. An economic sub-model calculates the gross margins for each possible CPA including costs of inputs such as labour and machinery. The conservation effects of the CPAs are assessed with an ecological sub-model evaluates the potential negative or positive effect that each work step of a CPA has on amphibians. A mathematical programming sub-model calculates the optimal farm organization taking into account the limited factors of the farm (e.g. labour, land) as well as ecological improvements. In sequential model runs, the habitat quality is to be improved by the model, while the highest possible gross margin is still to be achieved.
   The results indicate that the model can be used to show the scope of action that a farmer has to improve habitat quality by reducing damage to amphibian population on its land during agricultural activities. Thereby, depending on the level of habitat quality that is aimed at, different measures may provide the most efficient solution. Lower levels of conservation can be achieved with low-cost adapted CPAs, such as an increased cutting height, reduced sowing density and grubbing instead of ploughing. Higher levels of conservation require e.g. grassland-like managed buffer strips around ponds in sensible areas, which incur much higher on-farm conservation costs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A fisheries research cruise conducted in 2000 offered a first opportunity to take simultaneous measurements of the activities of three enzymes in mesozooplankton samples collected at a regional scale over the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay in the NE Atlantic, with the aim of characterizing main aspects of the functioning of the biotic environment of small pelagic fish populations. The activity of the digestive endopeptidase trypsin was selected to characterize the assimilation rate of proteins, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK) was chosen as an indicator of carbohydrate assimilation and aspartate transcarbamylase (ATC) provided an overall assessment of mesozooplankton productivity. The Bay of Biscay region is subject to various strong physical driving forces that directly affect the primary structure of the pelagic food web. On our cruise, the phytoplankton biomass distribution reflected these different physical influences: diatoms dominated the nutrient-enriched coastal water; picoplankton dominated the northern-centra I part where nutrients were depleted; and nanoplankton were abundant at the shelf break where internal waves provided an input of nutrients. These and other results (on bacteria, particulate organic carbon distribution, among others) illustrate the differences that exist in the microbial food webs of different sectors of the bay. The living matter produced was characterized by the quality and quantity of the smallest prey items that were available to higher trophic levels. Variations in mesozooplankton enzyme activities may agree well not only with classically expected results, but also present unexpected special features: high ATC specific activities were measured around the mouth of the Gironde, in the nutrient-rich desalted water of the plume, but surprisingly not in front of the Loire river. PK specific activities reflected preponderantly the balance between phytoplankton cells sizes and the related bacterial abundance resulting from nutrient limitation (mainly P), that induces varying carbohydrates production potential. Trypsin specific activities were moderately variable. except in a restricted area where a highly abundant protein content characterized the particulate matter and in the plume of water flowing out of the Gironde. It is concluded that the presented approach of the metabolism of mesozooplankton communities may provide novel views on crucial processes occurring at the mesoscale, which fits in generally well with the scales of ecological factors mostly influential on small pelagic fish populations.

AB  - This paper describes the development and application of an integrated framework for determination of sustainable carrying capacity in shellfish growing areas. This framework combines field data, experimental results and various types of models, ranging from individual shellfish growth models to broad-scale ecosystem models. The process by which we have integrated and coupled the various types of models is designed to capture the essential signal at each simulation scale, whilst allowing multi-year runs which provide results on cultivation of commercial species, nutrient and chlorophyll cycling, and other outputs of interest to decision-makers. The complete modelling framework enables integrated analyses of animal-environment interrelations affecting overall production at system-scales, according to different temporal and spatial scenarios, accounting for conservation aspects such as the presence of autochthonous wild species.
   This framework was applied to three loughs in Northern Ireland; Carlingford (a transboundary system), Strangford and Belfast, to provide estimates of harvestable biomass over typical cultivation cycles of 2-3 years in both the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The model accommodates different types of culture, whether subtidally on the bottom, suspended from rafts or intertidally on trestles.
   Results predicted for Carlingford and Strangford are within ranges of landings reported by fisheries agencies. In Belfast lough, where 10,000 ton live weight are reported annually, our model framework provides stable results of 8700 ton after a 10 year model run. These models are shown to be useful for driving farm-scale simulations, which are of great interest to producers, and also for analyses of the consequences of changed environmental conditions or in the timing, distribution and/or composition of culture practice. Examples are presented that include (i) an analysis of the spatial redistribution of mussel culture, illustrating changes both to production and to the Average Physical Product; (ii) assessment of the differential effects of climate change on mussel and oyster production, indicating that oysters are significantly less impacted; and (iii) investigation of the consequences of including wild suspension-feeding species in the model framework, resulting in an expected reduction in the capacity for production of cultivated shellfish. These scenarios were produced to illustrate the uses of the modelling approach, and enable better-informed discussion between different stakeholders, towards sustainable aquaculture (ecoaquaculture).

AB  - Recognizing the severity of road effects and need for developing a natural and self-sustained roadside vegetation cover, this study aimed to provide an ecological basis for selecting desirable native plants based on their autecological attributes by floristic analysis of naturally colonized plants in roadside microhabitats. We hypothesized that (i) vegetation zonation along roadsides is a function of the different microtopography and substrate types (microhabitats) created by road construction and (ii) plant colonization in these microhabitats is dependant upon the presence of suitable regeneration traits adapted to the specific microhabitats. We identified four distinct microhabitats namely shoulder, side slope, ditch and back slope from the edge of the road to the edge of the forest. We conducted vegetation and soil analyses in these microhabitats along 34 random transects running perpendicular to the road to the edge of forest in a 14 km section of the Trans Canada Highway (TCH) in Terra Nova National Park (TNNP), Newfoundland, Canada. The multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) confirmed that the plant communities of the four roadside microhabitats were significantly different from each other. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that composition of roadside plant communities was related to gradients of soil moisture content, bulk density, organic matter depth and pH. Several indicator plants, determined by indicator species analysis (ISA), were abundant in their respective microhabitats, indicating their affinity to particular sets of environmental conditions. The root-shoot analysis of selected dominant plants across the roadside habitats revealed that plants of a particular microhabitat had similar above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns. We found that floristic zonation along roadsides is a function of roadside microtopography, substrate type and environmental gradients created by the road building process. The similarities in above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns of dominant plants of respective microhabitats could be used as a basis of interpreting the role of autecological attributes of the species that enable them to establish in specific microhabitats. Several native plants, such as Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, Vaccinium angustifolium, Trifolium repens, and Anaphalis margaritaceae are naturally abundant in side slopes and possess autecological attributes such as low stature, widespread above- and below-ground parts, and drought tolerance. Presence of these desirable properties and their perennial habit make them excellent candidates for roadside revegetation. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused a strong agro-biodiversity decline in Europe, with high losses in rare arable plants. A better understanding of the relationship between these species, agricultural productivity, and other ecosystem functions can improve conservation management. The study was performed on an experimental field near Munich. To examine the results under field conditions, study plots were additionally established on ten arable fields distributed in the Munich Plain, an area with nutrient poor soils in southern Germany. We sowed a mixture of ten rare arable plant species at varying crop densities and compared them to plots without rare arable plants. To assess the effects on plant diversity and productivity, the cover and species richness of rare and common arable plants and the crop and arable plant biomass were assessed. The organic matter, nitrogen concentration, as well as the biomass and abundance of earthworm (biannually sampled for two years) were analyzed to determine the impact on soil fertility.
   Our results showed that sowing rare arable plants did not negatively affect crop biomass. Arable plant biomass and cover of rare arable plants were highest when no crops were sown. There was no difference between reduced and regular crop sowing densities on rare arable plant cover. In our field experiment, earthworm occurrence and soil organic matter were probably influenced by pre-crops (two years of clover grass before the experiment) and summer droughts during the study period. However, no significant effects of sowing rare arable plants on soil fertility were detected. These results were partly verified from results of the field study.
   At least on nutrient-poor soils, rare arable plant sowing may be a suitable tool to promote plant diversity conservation without negatively affecting crop production. That the sowing of rare arable plants did not significantly affect the indicators for soil fertility suggests that biomass production of rare arable plants was too low to have an impact on the crops and a benefit for soil fertility. Insignificant effects on crop biomass also suggest that sowing rare arable plants does not automatically lead to crop losses. As organic matter, nitrogen concentration and earthworm occurrence slowly respond to environmental changes, they should be investigated in further long-term experiments. This study shows that conservation of rare arable plants and food production on nutrient poor fields can be combined. Therefore, land sharing may be a suitable tool for nature conservation and ecosystem functionality on arable land.

AB  - Land cover changes are recognized to affect the organic matter fractions and other soil properties with a consequence for microbial and enzyme activities involved in nutrient cycling. The topsoil (0-10 cm depth) C, N, and P microbial [i.e., basal respiration (BR), substrate inducted respiration (SIR), microbial biomass-C, -N, and -P (MBC, MBN and MBP)] ratios, enzyme (i.e., urease, invertase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) activities, as well as the fractions of particulate organic matter (POC and PON) and dissolved organic matter (DOC and DON) were measured in a virgin natural forest dominated by Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica (natural forest), mono-species Quercus castaneifolia stand (plantation), land including Citrus sinensis and Citrus tangerina trees (garden), land dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum and Carex sylvatica (rangeland) and land including rice cultivation (agriculture), following 32 years of land cover changes, located in northern Iran. The results showed that the soil MBN, MBP, PON, and DON were significantly higher under the natural forest site, while plantation enhanced BR, DOC, MBC/C-org, POC/PON, and DOC/DON. The planting of Quercus castaneifolia and preservation of natural forest significantly increased the amounts of soil SIR, MBC, POC, BR/MBC, and BR/SIR in comparison with the other studied land covers. Although the natural forest decreased the soil MBC/MBN and MBC/MBP indicators, the enzyme activities with maximum values of geometric mean of enzyme (GME) activities, urease/C-org, acid phosphatase/C-org, arylsulfatase/C-org, invertase/C-org, urease/MBC, acid phosphatase/MBC, and arylsulfatase/MBC were enhanced by Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica stand. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in MBN/MBP ratio, Shannon's diversity index (H') for enzyme activities, and invertase/MBC index among the forest ecosystems and anthropogenic sites. Based on PCA, the natural forest followed by tree plantation presented good conditions of soil fertility as well as microbial and enzyme activities. While these characters were mostly suppressed in the non-forest land covers. As a conclusion, ecological stoichiometry of microbial indicators reveals clearly more soil responses to land cover changes than absolute microbial activities which can be used to measure long-term variations in the topsoil.

AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination from legacy gold mining in subarctic Canada poses an ongoing threat to lake biota. With climatic warming expected to increase As bioavailability in lake waters, developing tools for monitoring As variability becomes essential. Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) is an established group of lacustrine bioindicators that are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and lacustrine ecological health. In this study, As-tolerance of Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) in lake sediments (n = 93) in subarctic Northwest Territories, Canada was investigated. Arcellinida assemblage dynamics were compared with the intra-lake As distribution to delineate the geospatial extent of legacy As contamination related to the former Giant Mine (Yellowknife). Cluster analysis revealed five Arcellinida assemblages that correlate strongly with ten variables (variance explained = 40.4%), with As (9.4%) and S1-carbon (labile organic matter; 8.9%) being the most important (p-value = 0.001, n = 84). Stressed assemblages characterized proximal lakes< 10 km from the former mine site, consistent with a recently identified, geochemically-based zone of high As impact. The weighted average tolerance and optima (WATO) analysis led to identification of three arcellinidan groups based on the As-sensitivity: Low-Moderate Tolerance Group (As = 0-350 ppm); High Tolerance Group (As = 350-760 ppm); and, Extreme Tolerance Group (As > 750 ppm). The predictive capability of the Low-Moderate and Extreme tolerance groups is particularly strong, correlating with As concentrations in 66.6% (n = 20/30) of a test dataset. We propose that As influences the spatial distribution of the more nutrient-sensitive Arcellinida taxa (e.g., Cucurbitella tricuspis and Difflugia oblonga strain "oblonga") through suppression of preferred microbial food sources. These findings, which indicate that there is a variable species-level arcellinidan response to As contamination, showcases the potential of using the group as a reliable tool for inferring historical variability in As concentrations in impacted lakes, not possible using As itself due to the redox driven sensitivity of the metalloid to post-depositional remobilization. Arcellinida can also provide insight into the overall impact of As contamination on the ecological health of lakes, a metric not readily captured using instrumental analyses. Lakes with As-stressed arcellinidan faunas and high As concentrations may then be targeted for further As speciation analysis to provide additional information for risk assessment.

AB  - y Detailed knowledge of species ecological preferences and robust taxonomy of paleobioindicators are prerequisites for accurate paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental studies. This study aims to expand the knowledge of modern, Neotropical freshwater ostracode fauna, across an altitudinal gradient from the karst lakes in the lowlands of El Peten, Guatemala (100-500 m.a.s.l.), to the mid-elevation lakes of the Lacandon forest (500-1 000 m.a.s.l.), to the higher-altitude lakes of Montebello, Chiapas, Mexico (1 000-1 500 m.a.s.l.). Eighteen ostracode species were identified in 24 lakes. Ostracodes were absent in Lakes Amarillo and Lacandon (mid-altitude), and San Diego (lowlands); probably explained by a structural difference of habitats and species interactions. Statistical analysis indicated that the most abundant species, Cypridopsis vidua (O.F. Muller, 1776), Cytheridella ilosvayi Daday, 1905, Pseudocandona antilliana Broodbakker, 1983, and Darwinula stevensoni (Brady & Robertson, 1870) have a continuous distribution along the entire altitudinal gradient. Some species display more restricted distributions, determined by temperature, precipitation and conductivity. For example, Eucypris sp. is restricted to the lowlands, Vestalenula sp. and Cypria sp. were found only at middle elevations. Species diversity is slightly greater in lakes at middle altitudes (H-average = 1.09) than in water bodies in the lowlands (H-average = 0.94) and in cooler lakes in the highlands (H-average = 0.94), suggesting that mid-elevation lakes have a high potential for harboring microrefugia. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS regressions) provided ecological preference information for the four most frequent and widely distributed species, with respect to temperature, conductivity, bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration, precipitation, and pH. Darwinula stevensoni suggest an association more to cooler temperatures and lower conductivities proving its high tolerance range. Cypridopsis vidua is associated with warm and low-rainfall environments, such as recorded in the lowlands of Guatemala, and can be used as a paleobioindicator of vegetated littoral zones, because we found it always associated to this section of lakes. Cytheridella ilosvayi show preferences for warm and humid conditions, whereas P. antilliana prefer colder and humid environments. Such quantitative-ecological information will improve ostracode-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Southern Mexico and Northern Guatemala. In addition, our approach serves as a model for future paleoecological studies that employ other aquatic bioindicators, such as testate amoebae, cladocerans, and chironomids.

AB  - Wildfire activity is an important part of natural ecosystems and is strongly influenced by climate and vegetation changes. Given this, the reconstruction of wildfire history is crucial to understanding the interrelationships between past climate change and fire dynamics, especially in terms of revealing past climate change characteristics during particularly important periods. In this study we employed a macrocharcoal sequence to reconstruct the wildfire history in the Yinchuan Basin (an arid and semi-arid region in China) during the past 1.5 Ma. The responses of wildfire activity to climate and vegetation changes were compared with other obtained environmental indices such as magnetic susceptibility, pollen in the terrestrial basin core (the PL02 core), and delta O-18 in the marine core (LR04). The results confirmed that macro-charcoal records are an effective and sensitive indicator of environmental evolution in arid and semi-arid areas. The peak values of charcoal concentration and charcoal flux generally occurred during climate transition periods, especially in the transition period from humid to drought conditions (specifically in the MIS41-MIS40, MIS39-MIS38, MIS19-MIS18, MIS17-MIS16, MIS15-MIS14, MIS11-MIS10, MIS9-MIS8, and MIS3-MIS2 time intervals). Furthermore, we found that the biomass burned in wildfires (i.e., the high biomass burned as indicated by the peak levels of charcoal concentration) was controlled by the amount of vegetation, while the occurrence of wildfires was related to climate fluctuations. In addition, some Milankovitch cycles (such as 100-ka cycles, 40-ka cycles, and 20-ka cycles) were evident in the charcoal records, thus indicating that the main driving force of wildfire activity in the Yinchuan Basin was climate change caused by variations in the Earth's orbit. Among these, the 40-ka cycles disappeared after 0.72 Ma, accompanied by changes in wildfire activity characteristics. We also discovered that the 400-ka cycles were stable throughout time. This study provides reliable evidence for some remarkable climate events, including the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) and the Mid-Brunhes Event (MBE), from the charcoal records in the Yinchuan Basin (an arid and semi-arid region in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere).

AB  - In the first section of the article, factors affecting the magnitude of mineral and organic nitrogen-phosphorus (NP) use, such as per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and population density, are discussed. Nutrient balances, especially those of N and P, are important environmental indicators. In recognition of their importance, the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group have an obligation to submit yearly calculations on soil surface N and P balances. The NP balance studies should always be combined with investigations on the distribution of soil NP status of the investigated area. The negative NP balances and worsening NP status in central- and eastern European (CEE) countries, including those that have recently joined the European Union (NEU12), are in sharp contrast to past practices in the EU15 countries, where strong positive NP balances and oversupply of NP may lead to environmental and ecological threats. There is evidence that the level of oversupply in many of these countries is on the decline. In the CEE countries, on the other hand, worsening levels of NP undersupply may result in increasingly low yields and in economic and agronomic problems. Cooperation within the European Union should help to solve both the environmental threat facing the western part of the community and the agronomic and economic problems in the central and eastern parts. Fertilizer recommendation systems should function on the principle of providing sustainable and economically sound NP nutrition for crops without threatening the environment with the NP oversupply. In a perfectly correct and justifiable manner, the European Union made investments in environment protection, a strict condition for the accession of the central European countries to the EU. One essential obligation was the satisfactory disposal of sewage, as a water-protection measure. The EU should be as consistently strict in curbing the massive diffuse NP pollution caused by agriculture. Improvement of the EU Nitrate Directive and elaboration of the new EU Phosphate Directive should be based on environmental risk assessment. The principles of environmentally friendly crop nutrition should appear in the improved EU Nitrate Directive and in the new Phosphate Directive. The EU countries with higher per capita income and population density should be given special attention because of their environmentally friendly crop nutrition practice.

AB  - Field investigations and simulation modelling studies were conducted on an agriculturally perturbed watershed draining into the regulated Lower Clearwater-Snake Rivers of Idaho and Washington. Ecological-economic analyses were conducted to develop an integrated systems framework to assess the impacts of alternative farming practices on sustainable farming, sediment erosion and stream health on Tom Beall Creek, with ecological implications and consequences to Lower Granite Reservoir on the Snake River. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to spatially delineate field boundaries, soil types, drainage patterns and erosion rates. An AGNPS (agricultural nonpoint source) pollution model was interfaced with the GIS to project water quality impacts of land use in the watershed. The AGNPS model was integrated with a mixed integer linear programming model (MIP) to facilitate modelling cost effectiveness on land as it related to eroded soil entering the receiving streams. Biological health assessment was performed using benthic macroinvertebrates. The biological condition of Tom Beall Creek was rated as slightly and moderately impaired for 1992 and 1993, respectively. A wheat-pea rotation under conventional tillage and cross-slope farming had the highest weighted average on-site erosion damage of $20 per ha; the lowest damage was $3.63 per ha using a wheat-barley-fallow rotation with reduced tillage and divided slopes. Simulating a 'no programme' policy scenario, the MIP model showed the dramatic impact of the current farm programme with conservation compliance in the region of highly erodible land and high participation rate in the government farm programme. Under current farming practices and > 50 yr spring runoff event, it was estimated that nearly 5000 t of suspended solids would be exported from the Tom Beall watershed. During low flow years, less than 200 t were exported.
   Sedimentation in Tom Beall Creek is the most debilitating environmental factor impacting the aquatic biota. High erosion rates from all of the anthropogenically impacted streams above Lower Granite Dam tend to shorten the productive storage life of the reservoir, alter the hydroelectric power generating capacity and interfere with the ecological food web and biodiversity. Although the implementation of better conservation practices in anthropogenically disturbed watersheds will not eliminate watershed erosion, it will reduce the frequency and the amounts of sediment dredged from reservoirs in the future, and will reduce on-site and off-site costs of erosion and sediment damage.

We used a remote sensing methodology to map T. testudinum canopies over 400 km of coastline of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, comparing the depth distribution of canopy density, in terms of leaf area index (LAI), to a previously established ecological model of depth and LAI for this species in oligotrophic conditions. The full archive of Sentinel-2 imagery from 2016 to 2020 was applied in an automated model inversion method to simultaneously estimate depth and LAI, covering similar to 900 km(2) of lagoon with approximately 800 images. Data redundancy allowed for statistical tests of change detection. Achieved accuracy was sufficient for the objectives: LAI estimates compared to field data had mean absolute error of 0.59, systematic error of 0.04 and r(2) > 0.67 over a range of 0-5. Bathymetry compared to 46,000 ICESat-2 data points had a mean absolute error of 1 m, systematic error less than 0.5 m, and r(2) > 0.88 over a range of 0-15 m. The estimated total area of seagrass canopy was consistent with previously published estimates of similar to 580 km(2), but dense canopies (LAI > 3), which are the primary contributors to below-ground carbon storage, comprise only similar to 40 km(2). Within the year-to-year variation there was no change in overall seagrass abundance 2017-2020, but localised statistically significant (p < 0.01) patches of canopy extension and retraction occurred. 2018 and 2019 were affected by beaching of pelagic Sargassum and dispersion as organic matter into the lagoon. The multi-year analysis enabled excluding this influence and provided an estimate of its extent along the coast. Finally, the distribution of LAI with depth was consistent with the ecological model and showed a gradient from north to south which mirrored a well-established gradient in anthropogenic pressure due to touristic development. Denser canopies were more abundant in developed areas, the expected growth response to nutrient enrichment. This increase in canopy density may be a useful early bio-indicator of environmental eutrophication, detectable by remote sensing before habitat deterioration is observed.

AB  - The assessment of anthropogenic impacts and ecological status of coastal waters is an important task to accomplish under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EEC). Macroalgae are one of the biological quality elements that must be considered, but their assessment has been generally limited to intertidal areas due to the difficulties and costs associated with working in subtidal areas. In this work, the suitability of using landscape mosaicing techniques is analyzed for the application of the "Quality of Rocky Bottoms" index (CFR by its Spanish acronym) in subtidal areas. For this purpose, the sensitivity and accuracy of both the indicators that compose the CFR index (characteristic macroalgae coverage, fraction of opportunistics and characteristic macroalgae richness) and the index itself were tested against different sampling surfaces and validated through direct applications of the CFR carried out in situ by scuba divers. The study was carried out at three sites, located on the coast of Cantabria (N. Spain), covering a variety of environmental conditions (depth ranges and anthropogenic pressures). Underwater video transects of 5-20 m length were recorded by scuba divers and processed with specialized software to build continuous image mosaics of the assessment sites. Each mosaic was inserted into a Geographical Information System where all distinguishable macroalgal species were identified and their coverages were estimated. Replicated subsamples of different areas (0.25 m(2), 0.5 m(2), 1 m(2) and 2.5 m(2)) were tested from each mosaic for the estimation of both the single indicators and the CFR index itself. Main results showed that larger subsample areas produced higher and more accurate CFR values, mainly related to higher srichness values and to smaller variability within the replicates. Accordingly, the minimum sample size required to carry out this type of studies was estimated to be of 2.5 m(2), showing no significant differences with the total mosaics. At this spatial scale, the assessments of the CFR index using mosaics showed a significant correlation and an excellent agreement with the results obtained in situ. In summary, underwater video mosaicing techniques proved to be a useful tool for the application of the CFR index and could also be of great interest for the study of subtidal environments by allowing visualization of extensive seafloor areas.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the possibility of enriching the local population of wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) with introduced material capable to withstand rigorous environmental conditions. Progenies of wild cherry from nine European countries were tested in northern marginal site of species' distribution range. Persistence of progeny in relation to transfer to new environment refers here to the height loss due to frost damage and to the certain variability among morphological traits. The progenies were evaluated at two and three years of age in the provenance nursery trial in central Lithuania. F-ratios and significance of provenance and block fixed effects, Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, Tukey comparison lines for LS-means of provenances were estimated for set of traits: tree height at the end of the vegetation period and in the next spring, tree diameter, tree height to diameter ratio, the diameter of strongest branch or side stem, branch diameter to tree stem diameter ratio, and autumn over-coloration of shoot tips, leaf gland length in relation to petiole width, leaf gland colour.
   The analysis of variance of most traits revealed that the effects of provenance, block, and provenance by block interaction were statistically significant and indicates a presence of genetic differences in populations' general performance and in ecological reaction norms. Very weak correlation between tree height and tree branchiness ratio gives an indication of breeding possibility of fast growing trees while retaining relatively slim branches.
   Independent samples t-test and Levene's test for equality of variances approved the relationship between tree morphology parameters and leaf gland characters of survived saplings. Determination of changes in morphology of wild cherry survivors showed that induction of gland pigments is not subjected to stress.
   The autumn over-coloration of cherry shoot tips was considered as stress indicator in this study. The more damaged tree tips were in autumn, the less tree height was next spring.
   It was found strong and significant correlation between gland number and hardiness zone index at populations' origin locations (r = 0.60, P = 0.03). Positive correlations between the maximum number of glands and hardiness zone index, tree height in spring of 2011 and longitude were moderate but not sufficiently significant.
   In general, wild cherry reproductive material from Poland and Austria may be candidates for further testing for the potential introduction of the most fitted populations' to Lithuania.

AB  - Sagittaria lancifolia leaf morphology varies in the Everglades of southern Florida, USA, from plants with broadly ovate laminae to plants with linear laminae. To understand the morphological response of S. lancifolia to increased nutrients, we (1) grew S. lancifolia plants in solutions with either 1 mM or 10 muM P and measured morphological responses, as well as tissue N:P content and (2) grew field-collected plants that had a range of leaf morphologies in the greenhouse and measured morphological and tissue N:P responses. Plants in high P (HP), as compared to low P (LP), were larger (biomass 48.3 g (HP) versus 16.9 g (LP)), produced more leaves (16.9 (HP) versus 10.7 (LP)) and inflorescences (2.9 (HP) versus 0.3 (LP)), and branched more (shoots 3.8 (HP) versus 1.1 (LP)). Biomass allocation to leaves and inflorescences was greater in HP as compared to LP plants (leaves 61% (HP) versus 37% (LP); inflorescences 15% (HP) versus 2% (LP)) while plants in LP allocated relatively more biomass to roots and rhizomes than plants in HP (roots 8% (HP) versus 25% (LP); rhizomes 15% (HP) versus 35% (LP)). Leaf morphology changed with P-addition, so that plants in high P produced leaves with longer leaf bases (352 mm (HP) versus 219 mm (LP)), longer and wider blades (290 mm x 49 mm (HP) versus 176 mm x 9 mm (LP)), and a larger leaf area (99 cm 2 (HP) versus 13 cm 2 (LP)) than plants in LP, whereas plants in LP produced leaves with longer petioles (277 mm (HP) versus 346 mm (LP)). Leaf N:P ratios decreased in HP relative to initial ratios (43 (initial) to 17 (final)) and increased in LP (45 (initial) to 86 (final)). The direction of change in lamina width of field-collected plants grown under greenhouse conditions depended on the original leaf morphology-plants with narrow blades in the field produced wider laminae in the greenhouse, while plants with wide blades in the field produced narrower laminae. These plastic changes in leaf morphology mimic the differences in leaf morphology between S. lancifolia subsp. media and S. lancifolia subsp. lancifolia. Our results show that S. lancifolia responds rapidly to changes in environmental nutrient status, especially in lamina morphology. Blade shape thus provides a field indicator of soil/pore water nutrient status: narrow blades indicate nutrient limitation, whereas broader blades indicate nutrient enrichment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIWs) are essential ecological and ecosystem entities that are vulnerable to climate change. The water storage volume (WSV) of GIWs is an important indicator to monitor their health and ecosystem services. Therefore, the projection of changes in future WSV of GIWs is crucial for conservation policies that are typically set at the regional scale. A limiting factor for the extended spatial projection of WSV of GIWs is the lack of data on their geometry, bathymetry, and the complexity of hydrologic relation to the surrounding drainage basin and the climate at a regional scale. In this study, we developed a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) - hydrologic modelling approach, from which a number of indices and variables derived to assess WSV of GIWs. We projected future changes in WSV of about a hundred thousand GIWs across 17 large river basins in western Canada, using a nine-model ensemble climate simulations under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We estimated the baseline WSV by developing ML models using water depth measurements and geographical information features from 234 surveyed GIWs across the study area. Future WSV was quantified using a three-step procedure, where water balance simulations were facilitated through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the 2018-2034 period, and GIW specific mass-balance components were adapted using remote sensing data. The spatiotemporal analysis of the WSV offers new in-sights, and reveals (1) a baseline provincial WSV of 550 million m(3), with an average of 5,508 m(3) per GIW, (2) a decreasing future WSV at annual rates of -2.58 and -2.62 million m(3) for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively, and (3) the minimum and maximum WSV loss rates occurring during October and February, respectively, and (4) a diverse trend and magnitude of changes in WSV across 17 river basins. Finally, we state that while a group of hydrologic, climatic, and geographic processes and factors drives WSV of GIWs, the dominating driving force in WSV trends might be spatially and temporally different depending on the environmental conditions and characteristics of river basins and their associated GIWs. This study facilitates a better understanding of the connections between the WSV of GIWs and watershed-scale hydrology and climate change across multiple spatial scales.

AB  - High-nucleic-acid (HNA) and low-nucleic-acid (LNA) bacteria are two operational groups identified by flow cytometry (FCM) in aquatic systems. A number of reports have shown that HNA cell density correlates strongly with heterotrophic production, while LNA cell density does not. However, which taxa are specifically associated with these groups, and by extension, productivity has remained elusive. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by using a machine learning-based variable selection approach that integrated FCM and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from 14 freshwater lakes spanning a broad range in physicochemical conditions. There was a strong association between bacterial heterotrophic production and HNA absolute cell abundances (R-2 = 0.65), but not with the more abundant LNA cells. This solidifies findings, mainly from marine systems, that HNA and LNA bacteria could be considered separate functional groups, the former contributing a disproportionately large share of carbon cycling. Taxa selected by the models could predict HNA and LNA absolute cell abundances at all taxonomic levels. Selected operational taxonomic units (OTUs) ranged from low to high relative abundance and were mostly lake system specific (89.5% to 99.2%). A subset of selected OTUs was associated with both LNA and HNA groups (12.5% to 33.3%), suggesting either phenotypic plasticity or within-OTU genetic and physiological heterogeneity. These findings may lead to the identification of system-specific putative ecological indicators for heterotrophic productivity. Generally, our approach allows for the association of OTUs with specific functional groups in diverse ecosystems in order to improve our understanding of (microbial) biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.
   IMPORTANCE A major goal in microbial ecology is to understand how microbial community structure influences ecosystem functioning. Various methods to directly associate bacterial taxa to functional groups in the environment are being developed. In this study, we applied machine learning methods to relate taxonomic data obtained from marker gene surveys to functional groups identified by flow cytometry. This allowed us to identify the taxa that are associated with heterotrophic productivity in freshwater lakes and indicated that the key contributors were highly system specific, regularly rare members of the community, and that some could possibly switch between being low and high contributors. Our approach provides a promising framework to identify taxa that contribute to ecosystem functioning and can be further developed to explore microbial contributions beyond heterotrophic production.

AB  - Indicators of wildlife health are important elements of a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring trends of methyl mercury (MeHg) contamination in the environment. River otters (Lontra canadensis) have been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine or freshwater systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a 7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia, Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake). We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of population status and health including: activity levels, population estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals, determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly been documented. We encourage inclusion of river otters in environmental assessments pre-, during-, and post-industrial activities as a measure of pollutant exposure and bioavailability as well as a critical first step in addressing knowledge gaps associated with contaminants and its effects on populations.

AB  - 1. Dry matter digestibility is a critical component of herbage nutritive value, a major service delivered by grasslands. The aim of this study was to test whether the dominance hypothesis applies to assess the impacts of environmental gradients and management regimes on this component of herbage nutritive value in permanent grasslands.
   2. At the plant level, digestibility has been related to a number of functional traits, but whether this can be scaled up to the community level in species-rich grasslands and how such relationships are modulated by environmental conditions and management regimes remain unknown. Our primary objective was to test whether community-weighted means - species trait values weighted by the species abundance - of morphological, phenological and chemical traits could be used to explain variations in digestibility over a large range of climatic contexts, soil resource levels and management regimes. Our second objective was to explain variations in community digestibility within and among nine contrasting sites along large natural and man-induced environmental gradients.
   3. Over the whole data set, digestibility and most community-weighted means of traits responded to climatic factors and management regimes, but relations were not always significant when each site was considered separately. Community digestibility was significantly related to one or more plant traits within each site and to all of the measured traits when considering all the sites. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) had the most consistent effects on digestibility, with a strikingly similar negative effect within each site. Potential evapotranspiration was negatively related to digestibility and contributed to explain a large part of the among-site variance. In addition, a low return interval of disturbance and a high disturbance intensity (biomass removal) were both associated with a high digestibility.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regime, plant traits and local climate impacted dry matter digestibility roughly equally in grasslands. The effects of community composition on digestibility and its response to abiotic factors could be successfully captured by community-weighted means of leaf dry matter content. This functional marker can be used to develop indicators and grassland management rules to support farmers in the refinement of their practices towards specific needs, such as target production outputs.

AB  - Recently, there has been a resurgent interest in the exploration of deep-sea mineral deposits, particularly polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), central Pacific. Accurate environmental impact assessment is critical to the effective management of a new industry and depends on a sound understanding of species taxonomy, biogeography, and connectivity across a range of scales. Connectivity is a particularly important parameter in determining ecosystem resilience, as it helps to define the ability of a system to recover post-impact. Scavenging amphipods in the superfamilies Alicelloidea Lowry and De Broyer, 2008 and Lysianassoidea Dana, 1849 contribute to a unique and abundant scavenging community in abyssal ecosystems. They are relatively easy to sample and in recent years have become the target of several molecular and taxonomic studies, but are poorly studied in the CCZ. Here, a molecular approach is used to identify and delimit species, and to investigate evolutionary relationships of scavenging amphipods from both abyssal plain and deep (>3000 m) seamount habitats in three APEIs (Areas of Particular Environmental Interest, i.e., designated conservation areas) in the western CCZ. A total of 17 different morphospecies of scavenging amphipods were identified, which include at least 30 genetic species delimited by a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode gene. The scavenging communities sampled in the western CCZ included the most common species (Abyssorchomene gerulicorbis (Shulenberger and Barnard, 1976), A. chevreuxi (Stebbing, 1906), Paralicela caperesca Shulenberger and Barnard, 1976, and P. tenuipes Chevreux, 1908) reported for other ocean basins. Only four morphospecies, representing five genetic species, were shared between APEIs 1, 4, and 7. The two abyssal plain sites at APEIs 4 and 7 were dominated by two and three of the most common scavenging species, respectively, while the APEI 1 seamount site was dominated by two species potentially new to science that appeared to be endemic to the site. The presence of common species in all sites and high genetic diversity, yet little geographic structuring, indicate connectivity over evolutionary time scales between the areas, which span about 1500 km. Similar to recent studies, the differences in amphipod assemblages found between the seamount and abyssal sites suggest that ecological conditions on seamounts generate distinct community compositions.

AB  - The maintenance of soil health in agro-ecosystems is essential for sustaining agricultural productivity. Through its positive impacts on various soil physical and biological processes, cover cropping can be an important component of sustainable agricultural production systems. However, the practice of cover cropping can be complex, and possible trade-offs between the benefits and side effects of cover crops have not been examined. To evaluate these benefits and potential trade-offs, we quantitatively synthesized different ecosystem services provided by cover crops (e.g., erosion control, water quality regulation, soil moisture retention, accumulation of soil organic matter and microbial biomass, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, weed and pest control, as well as yield of the subsequent cash crop) using data from previous publications. We used a simple indicator (8), defined as the ratio of an observed variable (i.e., ecosystem service) under cover crop and under fallow condition, to evaluate the impacts of cover crops on a given ecosystem service. Our results showed that cover crops provided beneficial ecosystem services in most cases, except for an increase in GHG emission (delta(CO2) = 1.46 +/- 0.47 and delta(N2 O) = 1.49 +/- 1.22; (x) over bar +/- SD) and in pest (nematode) incidence (delta(nematode abundance) = 1.29 +/- 1.61). It is also important to highlight that, in some cases, tillage could offset the extent of ecosystem service benefits provided by cover crops. Based on this synthesis, we argue that cover crops should be incorporated into modern agricultural practices because of the many environmental benefits they offer, particularly the maintenance of soil and ecosystem health. More importantly, there was generally an increase in cash crop yield with cover cropping (delta(yied) = 1.15 +/- 0.75), likely due to improvement in various soil processes. Despite its benefits, the complexity of cover crop management should not be overlooked, and site-specific factors such as climate, soil type, cover crop species and tillage practices must be considered in order to optimize the benefits of cover cropping. In addition to crop yield, detailed economic analyses are needed to calculate the direct (e.g., reduction in the amount of chemical fertilizer) and indirect monetary benefits (e.g., the improvement of soil quality) of cover crops. Such a comprehensive analysis could serve as incentive for producers to integrate cover crops into their management practices.

AB  - The assessment and monitoring of soil disturbance and its effect on soil quality (i.e., ability to support a range of ecosystem services) has been hindered due to the shortcomings of many traditional analytical techniques, including high cost, long-term time investment and difficulties with data interpretation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop rapid and repeatable approaches for quantifying changes in soil quality that land managers may use to assess the condition and trend of natural and managed ecosystems. Here we report on a rapid, high throughput approach using fingerprint Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric modeling. Fingerprint FTIR incorporates all information embedded within the FTIR spectrum, thus producing a biogeochemical or ecological "fingerprint" of the soil. This methodology was applied in a highly disturbed forest ecosystem over a 19-year sampling period to detect, via spectral analysis, changes in dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic matter and reactive mineralogy) that can indicate changes in soil quality. Two chemometric statistical techniques (i.e., hierarchical clustering analysis [HCA] and discriminate analysis of principal components [DAPC]) were evaluated for interpreting and quantifying similarities/dissimilarities between samples utilizing the entire FTIR spectra from each sample. We found that both statistical approaches provided a means for clearly discriminating between degraded soils, soils in recovery, and reference soils. DAPC analysis provided additional information on the spectral wavenumbers most important in differentiating between soil samples across our disturbance time series. Wavenumbers relating to stretching of phenolic (C-O), aromatic (C=C, C-C), carboxylic acids (C=O), and to a lesser extent aliphatic (C-H) bonds were important in discriminating between soil samples. These results confirmed our visual interpretation of FTIR spectra, where an increase in aliphatic (fats and lipids) and decrease in phenolic/aromatic (lignin) absorption occurred following intensive site disturbance, followed by a return to predisturbance absorption values 17 years later. Results from this study illustrate the potential of fingerprint FTIR and chemometrics as an efficient technique for quantifying changes in soil quality that may be used in the monitoring and assessment of soil landscape change. Additional research across a range of soil ecosystems and under different types of ecosystem disturbance is needed to further validate this approach and to demonstrate its wide applicability as a land management tool.

AB  - The termination of the EU milk quota system on April 1, 2015 is leading to an increase in manure production in the Netherlands. Rather than focus on the quality of water and nature, of which at least the water quality has strongly improved during the last decades, discussions appear to center on strengthening proxy measures that are already being used and which are only remotely related to the quality issue. The quality of water and nature is determined for ground- and surface water by first measuring their N and P content and for nature areas the N deposition. When these values are higher than threshold values determined by ecologists, quality is inadequate and measures are needed. When values are lower, quality is adequate. Three basic problems need to be addressed: (i) threshold values are in practice considered to be permanent while they should be dynamic reflecting a learning process when comparing measurements of N and P values on the one hand and a simultaneous ecological characterization on the other. This requires more cooperation between soil scientists, hydrologists and ecologists. Dynamic characterization may well lead to locally different threshold values. (ii) many measurements of water quality are being made but hardly any measurements of N deposition on nature areas. Such measurements are needed to allow judgements as to the effect of agricultural practices on nature quality. (iii) The necessary further improvement in water and nature quality, as far as it is affected by agricultural practices, can only be achieved when farmers are fully committed and engaged. The current top-down regulations with a "command-and-control" character, while effective in the 1990s, cannot serve this purpose in the information age, the more so since farmers are increasingly well educated and ask too many questions that are not being answered. The suggestion is made to change the generic character of the legislation ("one size fits all") to a system where "tailor made" management systems are designed for individual farms,considering environmental conditions in the area where the farm occurs. Researchers and farmers can work together in a joint-learning mode to develop such designs that can be recognized by certificates with a legal status. In any case, the proportionality principle needs to be considered assuring that the severity of measures taken are in balance with societal effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Macrophytes represent one part of the biological quality elements defined by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as 'macrophytes and phytobenthos'. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of ecological status classification by the use of macrophytes for lowland rivers with different habitat conditions, corresponding to EWFD requirements. The classification of water quality is based on the Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs) which is proposed for the purpose of macrophyte-based classification for the WFD. To determine the ecological quality ratio, we calculated the following indices: River Macrophyte Nutrient Index (RMNI), River Macrophyte Hydraulic Index (RMHI), Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), Number of macrophyte taxa which are not helophytes (NTAXA). Water sources that supply Lepenci River are located in alpine and subalpine areas of the Sharri mountain, which are considered as ecologically clean. Our results show that the water in spring area is clean but as a result of the anthropogenic activities downstream, the river becomes polluted by different pollution substances. This fact is also confirmed by the presence or absence of macrophytes that we used in this work as a biological indicator of water pollution. River Macrophyte Hydraulic Index (RMHI), has shown the highest value at SP6-Gerlice, with a value of 8.74 that classifies this station downstream the river as the most polluted. The water flow velocity in this station is smooth and as such it is characterized with Macrophyte species associated with this type of water flow. According to the assessment of ecological status with RMNI index, the stations SP7-Kacanik and SP8-Hani i Elezit, have good water quality and high ecological status and belong to first class (I), whereas the station with poorest water quality (fourth class) and poorest ecological status is rated SP5-Nike. MIR index classify the quality of water as very good at S8-Hani i Elezit, whereas the values of this index at stations S5-Nike and S6- Gerlice indicate the bad water quality and poor ecological status. The largest number of macrophyte species that were not heliophytes was recorded in SP8-Hani i Elezit. We can conclude that the presence of macrophyte species in river varies from nutrient levels in water. Our results show that values of macrophyte based indices reflect the water quality in sampling stations therefore we can consider them as a reliable instrument for the assessment of the ecological status of the rivers.

AB  - Studies of habitat selection and use by wildlife, especially large herbivores, are foundational for understanding their ecology and management, especially if predictors of use represent habitat requirements that can be related to demography or fitness. Many ungulate species serve societal needs as game animals or subsistence foods, and also can affect native vegetation and agricultural crops because of their large body size, diet choices, and widespread distributions. Understanding nutritional resources and habitat use of large herbivores like elk (Cervus canadensis) can benefit their management across different land ownerships and management regimes. Distributions of elk in much of the western United States have shifted from public to private lands, leading to reduced hunting and viewing opportunities on the former and increased crop damage and other undesired effects on the latter. These shifts may be caused by increasing human disturbance (e.g., roads and traffic) and declines of early-seral vegetation, which provides abundant forage for elk and other wildlife on public lands. Managers can benefit from tools that predict how nutritional resources, other environmental characteristics, elk productivity and performance, and elk distributions respond to management actions. We present a large-scale effort to develop regional elk nutrition and habitat-use models for summer ranges spanning 11 million ha in western Oregon and Washington, USA (hereafter Westside). We chose summer because nutritional limitations on elk condition (e.g., body fat levels) and reproduction in this season are evident across much of the western United States. Our overarching hypothesis was that elk habitat use during summer is driven by a suite of interacting covariates related to energy balance: acquisition (e.g., nutritional resources, juxtaposition of cover and foraging areas), and loss (e.g., proximity to open roads, topography). We predicted that female elk consistently select areas of higher summer nutrition, resulting in better animal performance in more nutritionally rich landscapes. We also predicted that factors of human disturbance, vegetation, and topography would affect elk use of landscapes and available nutrition during summer, and specifically predicted that elk would avoid open roads and areas far from cover-forage edges because of their preference for foraging sites with secure patches of cover nearby. Our work had 2 primary objectives: 1) to develop and evaluate a nutrition model that estimates regional nutritional conditions for elk on summer ranges, using predictors that reflect elk nutritional ecology; and 2) to develop a summer habitat-use model that integrates the nutrition model predictions with other covariates to estimate relative probability of use by elk, accounting for ecological processes that drive use. To meet our objectives, we used 25 previously collected data sets on elk nutrition, performance, and distributions from 12 study areas. We demonstrated the management utility of our regional-scale models via application in 2 landscapes in Washington.
   The elk nutrition model predicts levels of digestible energy in elk diets (DDE; kcal DE/g of consumed forage) during summer. Model input data were from foraging experiments using captive female elk and field measurements of site characteristics at fine scales (similar to 0.5 ha). The nutrition model included a set of equations that predicted forage biomass as a function of site characteristics and a second set that predicted DDE primarily as a function of forage biomass. We used the nutrition model to develop a DDE map across the Westside. We then evaluated performance of the model by comparing predicted DDE to nutritional resource selection by elk and to population-level estimates of autumn body fat and pregnancy rates of lactating elk. To model elk habitat use, we compiled 13 unique telemetry data sets from female elk (n = 173) in 7 study areas (data collected June-August 1991-2009). We used a generalized linear model with 5 of the data sets, coupled with ecologically relevant covariates characterizing nutrition, human disturbance, vegetation, and physical conditions, to estimate intensity of use with the negative binomial model. We evaluated model performance by mapping predicted habitat use with the regional model and comparing predictions with counts of elk locations using 8 independent telemetry data sets.
   The nutrition model explained a reasonably high amount of variation in forage biomass (r(2) = 0.46-0.72) and included covariates of overstory canopy cover, proportion of hardwoods in the canopy, potential natural vegetation (PNV) zone, and study area. Dietary DE equations in the model explained about 50% of the variation in DDE(r(2) = 0.39-0.57) as a function of forage biomass by PNV zone and study area. Broad-scale application of the nutrition model in the Westside region illustrated the predominance of landscapes that failed to meet nutritional needs of lactating females(<= 2.58 kcal/g) and their calves, especially at moderate elevations in closed-canopy forests in both the Coast Range and the southern Cascades. Areas providing DDE at (>2.58-2.75 kcal/g) or in excess (>2.75 kcal/g) of the basic requirement of lactating females were uncommon (<15% of area) or rare (<5% of area), respectively, and primarily occurred in early-seral communities, particularly at higher elevations. Wild elk avoided areas with DDE below basic requirement and selected for areas with DDE >2.60 kcal/g. Percentage of elk ranges providing DDE levels near or above basic requirement was highly correlated with pregnancy rates of lactating females. Autumn body fat levels were highly correlated with percentage of elk ranges providing DDE levels above basic requirement.
   The regional model of elk habitat use with greatest support in the empirical data included 4 covariates: DDE, distance to nearest road open to motorized use by the public, distance to cover-forage edge, and slope. Elk preferred habitats that were relatively high in DDE, far from roads, close to cover-forage edges, and on gentle slopes. Based on standardized coefficients, changes in slope (-0.949) were most important in predicting habitat use, followed by DDE (0.656), distance to edge (-0.305), and distance to open road (0.300). Use ratios for the regional model indicated these changes in relative probability of use by elk: a 111.2% increase in use for each 0.1-unit increase in DDE; a 22.7% increase in use for each kilometer away from an open road; an 8.1% decrease in use for each 100-m increase in distance to edge; and a 5.3% decrease in use for each percent increase in slope. The regional model validated well overall, with high correlation between predicted use and observed values for the 4 Washington sites (r(s) >= 0.96) but lower correlation in southwestern Oregon sites (r(s) = 0.32-0.87).
   Our results demonstrated that nutrition data collected at fine scales with captive elk can be used to predict nutritional resources at large scales, and that these predictions directly relate to habitat use and performance of free-ranging elk across the Westside region. These results also highlight the importance of including summer nutrition in habitat evaluation and landscape planning for Westside elk. The models can inform management strategies to achieve objectives for elk across land ownerships. The regional model provides a useful tool to understand and document spatially explicit habitat requirements and distributions of elk in current or future landscapes. The 2 examples of management application demonstrated how effects of management on elk nutrition and habitat use can be evaluated at landscape scales, and in turn how animal performance and distribution are affected. Results further illustrated the importance of managing for nutrition in combination with other covariates (i.e., roads, slope, cover-forage edges) that affect elk use of nutritional resources to achieve desired distributions of elk. Our meta-analysis approach to habitat modeling provides a useful framework for research and management of wildlife species with coarse-scale habitat requirements by identifying commonalities in habitat-use patterns that are robust across multiple modeling areas and a large geographic range. Use of such methods in future modeling, including application in monitoring programs and adaptive management, will continue to advance ecological knowledge and management of wildlife species like elk.

AB  - Improving the energy efficiency of the drying industry is considered as one of the most efficient and promising ways for reducing carbon emissions from the industrial sector. In this context, the present work is aimed at investigating numerically the thermal performance and the environmental impact of a novel forced-air convection hybrid dryer for wood drying industry under realistic environmental conditions. The proposed dryer system consists mainly of a Photovoltaic/Thermal (PVT) solar air collector for thermal and electrical energy production, an insulated drying chamber, an air-to-air heat recovery system and fans. To simulate the functioning of the dryer system, a transient model based on energy and mass equations is developed and validated with experimental data. Annual dynamic simulations were carried out under weather conditions of the Ajaccio city and the effect of recovering waste heat from the dryer unit during both solar drying and hybrid drying processes was presented and analyzed. Results show that using the heat recovery system with an effectiveness of 0.8 leads to reduce the solar drying time by about 40% in summer and up to 32% in winter. For hybrid drying functioning, integrating of both heat recovery system and PVT air collector reduces the energy consumption of conventional dryer up to 86.5% during summer and up to 73.5% during winter. Finally, it was shown that the proposed hybrid wood dryer with PVT air collector and heat recovery system is suitable for wood drying industry and leads to improve the energy efficiency of conventional dryers and to reduce annually the amount of CO2 emissions up to 78.5%.

AB  - Questions: Does restoration management of a formerly afforested blanket bog lead to the vegetation, and the environmental conditions it indicates, becoming similar to intact bog?
   Location: A 147-ha blanket bog in Scotland's Flow Country, afforested in the 1980s but undergoing restoration since 1998.
   Methods: Vegetation in the restoration area was surveyed in nine, 1.6-6.4-ha plots, in 1998, 2003 and 2011. Each plot was matched to nearby plots that were either intact bog or remained afforested. Principal Response Curves were used to highlight the main axes of vegetation variation and test whether plant community trajectories in the restoration area differed from intact bog. The following restoration outcomes were assessed: floristic similarity to bog vegetation; and moisture, fertility and acidity, as inferred from vegetation using Ellenberg indicator values.
   Results: In the 6 years after restoration began, vegetation developed towards bog-like conditions. In the subsequent 8 years, overall vegetation change stalled, and spatial variability increased, reflecting diverging trajectories in wetter and drier parts of the site. Ellenberg's F-values implied significant re-wetting in the restoration area, reaching moisture levels similar to intact bog. Other restoration outcomes progressed in wetter microsites and areas (furrows and flat ground), but stalled in drier locations (plough-ridges and steeper slopes).
   Conclusions: Overall moisture conditions, as indicated by plants, have recovered. However, restoration progress has stalled in drier areas, where additional management may be needed. Long-term vegetation monitoring has helped clarify barriers to recovery and the management needed to overcome them. The value of such monitoring schemes in guiding restoration should be reflected in their wider implementation, within an adaptive management framework.

AB  - The regions of Durham and York in Ontario, Canada have partnered to construct an energy-from-waste thermal treatment facility as part of a long term strategy for the management of their municipal solid waste. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive human health risk assessment for this facility. This assessment was based on extensive sampling of baseline environmental conditions (e.g., collection and analysis of air, soil, water, and biota samples) as well as detailed site specific modeling to predict facility-related emissions of 87 identified contaminants of potential concern. Emissions were estimated for both the approved initial operating design capacity of the facility (140,000 tonnes per year) and for the maximum design capacity (400,000 tonnes per year). For the 140,000 tonnes per year scenario, this assessment indicated that facility-related emissions are unlikely to cause adverse health risks to local residents, farmers, or other receptors (e.g., recreational users). For the 400,000 tonnes per year scenarios, slightly elevated risks were noted with respect to inhalation (hydrogen chloride) and infant consumption of breast milk (dioxins and furans), but only during predicted 'upset conditions' (i.e. facility start-up, shutdown, and loss of air pollution control) that represent unusual and/or transient occurrences. However, current provincial regulations require that additional environmental screening would be mandatory prior to expansion of the facility beyond the initial approved capacity (140,000 tonnes per year). Therefore, the potential risks due to upset conditions for the 400,000 tonnes per year scenario should be more closely investigated if future expansion is pursued. (C) 2013 The Authors.

   LocationIberian Peninsula.
   MethodsWe used distribution data from 133 endemic water beetle species in the Iberian Peninsula. Climatic potential distributions were estimated by applying a multidimensional-envelope procedure based on climatic data (both current and future) and observed occurrences. Mahalanobis distances were calculated to obtain continuous climatic suitability values within the climatic potential distribution. Two protected area networks were assessed: National Parks (NPs) and Natura 2000 (N-2000). The average climatic suitability value for the cells overlapping with protected areas was calculated and compared with the average value of 10,000 random samples from the same number of cells within their entire potential distribution, which allowed to identify species whose climatic niches were optimally or marginally represented.
   ResultsFifty-seven and 104 of the 107 considered taxa were represented with at least one occurrence in NPs and N-2000, respectively, and the climatic potential distributions of 93 and all 107 taxa overlapped with NPs and N-2000. While the climatic niches of 48 and 38 taxa were marginally represented in NPs and N-2000, the climatic niches of only 11 and 29 were optimally represented by these two protected area networks. When predicted future climatic conditions were considered, both the climatic suitability values and the number of species whose potential distribution was represented by protected areas decreased.
   Main conclusionsAlthough the representation of endemic Iberian taxa could be considered adequate, these results show that for most of them the protected networks tend to include areas with climatic conditions close to the species tolerance limit, and the expected climate change only worsened this scenario. Thus, current protected areas cannot be considered to guarantee the long-term survival of the species considered in this study.

AB  - Inland watersheds in the southeastern United States are transitioning from agricultural and forested land uses to urban and exurban uses at a rate greater than the national average. This study sampled creeks representing a variety of land use factors in a rapidly urbanizing watershed that also serves as a drinking water supply. Samples were collected bimonthly under dry-weather conditions and four times during each of three storm events and assessed for microbial indicators of water quality. Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were measured using standard membrane filtration techniques. Results showed that FIB concentrations varied between 10(0) and 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that FIB were generally higher in more developed watersheds (p < 0.01). Concentrations were also significantly greater during storm events than during dry-weather conditions (p < 0.02), although concentrations demonstrated both intra and inter-storm variability. These results indicate that the magnitude of microbial contamination is influenced by intensity of watershed development, streamflow and antecedent precipitation. Dry-weather FIB loads showed considerable seasonal variation, but the average storm event delivered contaminant loads equivalent to months of dry-weather loading. Analysis of intra-storm loading patterns provided little evidence to support "first-flush" loading of either FIB, results that are consistent with environmental reservoirs of FIB. These findings demonstrate that single sampling monitoring efforts are inadequate to capture the variability of microbial contaminants in a watershed, particularly if sampling is conducted during dry weather. This study also helps to identify timing and conditions for public health vulnerabilities, and for effective management interventions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Local indicators are useful to identify environments. In the region of Vicosa, Gleysols with their typically gray color are not common, although waterlogged soils under the plant cover "taboa" (Thypha dominguensis) are found. Most of the soils with high water tables are covered by "taboa", while the gley characteristics are not pronounced, especially in soils with high iron contents. Since there was no clear relation among the height of the water table, O-2 deficiency, and color, it was hypothesized that other types of indicators for reducing conditions could be found in these environments. In pursuit of local indicators, soil, water and vegetation were characterized. Soils with different degrees of drainage limitation were studied in Cajuri (area 1); Vicosa (area 2), and Coimbra (area 3). For a field evaluation of soil redox conditions, pH and pE were measured by an electronic device, adapted to a steel probe. Despite its importance for the identification of environmental indicators, soil morphology was not a precise indicator for O-2 deficiency during long periods of time, the most common characteristic of waterlogged soils. Although color is a useful indicator for numerous drainage conditions of the soil, it was not efficient in this area as well. In general, the studied Gleysols presented a chroma > 2, which surpasses the criterion for gley horizons in the Brazilian Soil Classification System. Therefore, soil color was not a good indicator for drainage limitation in these areas. The presence of "taboa" was confirmed as a good indicator for drainage limitation. Pure clusters of this vegetation were found where pH and pE values are low, but vary within a wide range. A water table above 0.60 m was found to be a good indicator for the gley status of soils.

AB  - In palaeolimnology, microfossils play an important role as ecological indicators of lake history. A reliable interpretation of microfossil data requires a comprehensive understanding of transport processes as well as determining whether microfossil assemblages are representative of their living communities. The occurrence of transport in ostracod taphocoenoses can be identified from the population age structure of valves. In this study, 23 surface sediment samples from Dalongchi Lake, northwestern China, were analysed for species composition, and 16 were also analysed for the population age structure of Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis. Ostracod valves are dominated by F. gyirongensis, with frequently occurring Ilyocypris sp. in the surface sediments. The distribution and abundance of ostracods are significantly correlated with the sampling depth and grain size, implying that hydrological conditions are the major controlling factor. The dominant species F. gyirongensis seems to prefer relatively deep and stable lacustrine conditions, while Ilyocypris sp. seems to prefer shallow conditions with rich submerged macrophytes and relatively coarse substrate in Dalongchi Lake. The spatial changes in the population age structure of F. gyirongensis match the different hydrodynamic regimes within the lake, with abundant early and middle instars in deeper waters and abundant middle and late instars in shallower waters, denoting that downslope transport of valves may be responsible for the spatial changes in the population structure. Our findings, together with previous works, indicate that downslope transport of instars and subsequent depth differentiation of the population structure of ostracods can occur for different species in both marine and lacustrine settings, which potentially leads to some biases based on the "in situ" inference of microfossils in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Hence, careful transport process assessment of fossil assemblages based on population age structure and other characteristics, such as the ratios of adults to juveniles and carapaces to valves, is a valuable prerequisite for palaeoenvironmental analysis.

AB  - The Cretaceous Hue Shale is a condensed mudstone section of the Brookian sequence with type II and type III kerogen, and it is one of the major source rocks that fill the world-class conventional oil fields on the North Slope, Alaska. The bottom section of the Hue Shale is referred to as Gamma Ray Zone (GRZ) or Highly Radioactive Zone (HRZ) and believed to be the most organic-rich section. The thermal maturity increases from immature to over oil window towards the southwest. Although, the research on the Hue Shale as an unconventional shale reservoir is still at an early stage, where exploration activities are very limited. The Hue Shale thickens to the east in general. However, regional variations of thickness and more importantly total organic carbon (TOC) have been reported.
   In this research, a suite of nineteen core samples of the Hue Shale are selected. These cores are collected from six wells covering a wide spectrum of thermal maturity with four wells in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and two wells in the state land. A combined geochemical and petrographic methodology is utilized to address the regional redox conditions and the preservation of organic carbon. TOC, Tmax, hydrogen index, and oxygen index are acquired through pyrolysis to characterize the abundance, thermal maturity, the origin, and the evolution of organic matter. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is used to investigate the mineralogy and diagenesis of the Hue Shale. Pyrite crystal forms, and pyrite framboid size distributions are used as an indicator of the redox conditions during deposition. The results show substantial variance in oxygen levels in the water column. High abundance and small sizes of pyrite framboids, which indicates a depleted oxygen environment, show better preservation potential of organic matter.

AB  - Changes in terrigenous organic matter (OM) input, productivity and the associated bottom-water redox conditions, together with forcing mechanisms and global carbon cycle implications of such variations, on the western margin of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) during the Quaternary remain controversial. In this study, we reconstructed the hydrological dynamics, terrigenous OM input, productivity, and deep- sea redox conditions using one core from the continental slope of the Philippine Sea. The new data were integrated with published proxies from the same core and two additional cores from the abyssal Philippine Sea. The results exhibited noticeable variations in the abovementioned indicators, in correspondence to changes in the supply of terrigenous material. The continental slope deposition featured signals of strong physical erosion and chemical weathering of unconsolidated sediments on the exposed continental shelf during the Quaternary sea-level lowstands, which significantly contributed to increased terrigenous OM input and productivity and, in turn, decreased bottom-water oxygenation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In the abyssal Philippine Sea, increased Asian dust-driven OM input and productivity also acted as a sink of atmospheric CO2 during sea-level lowstands. Analysis of the data suggested that the enhanced terrigenous OM input and biological pump and thus the decreased dissolved oxygen level of the bottom water on the western margin of the WPWP played important roles in modifying the global carbon cycle during sea-level lowstands. In contrast, the influence of hydrological dynamics on terrigenous OM input, productivity, and redox conditions therein during the Quaternary was limited. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wastewater discharges affect the functioning of small temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs) through two main mechanisms: (1) they can significantly change the water balance by altering the quantity of water inflows, and (2) they can significantly change the nutrient balance and hence the water quality. This study investigated the bio-physical responses of a typical, small TOCE on the east coast of South Africa, the Mhlanga Estuary. This estuary receives significant inflows of treated effluent from upstream wastewater treatment works. Water and nutrient budgets were used together with biological sampling to investigate changes in the functioning of the system. The increase in inflows due to the effluent discharges has significantly increased the mouth breaching frequency. Furthermore, when the mouth closes, the accumulation of nutrients leads to eutrophication and algal blooms. A grey water index, namely the proportion of effluent in the estuary and an indicator of the additional nutrient inputs into the estuary, reached high values (greater than or similar to 50%) during low flow regimes and when the mouth was closed. In these hyper-eutrophic conditions (DIN and DIP concentrations up to 457 mu M and 100 mu M respectively), field measurements showed that algal blooms occurred within about 14 days following closure of the mouth (chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 375 mg chl-a m(-3)). Water and nutrient balance simulations for alternative scenarios suggest that further increases in wastewater discharges would result in more frequent breaching events and longer open mouth conditions, but the occurrence of hyper-eutrophic conditions would initially intensify despite more frequent openings. The study indicates how water and nutrient balance simulations can be used in the planning and impact assessment of wastewater treatment facilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenological shifts represent one of the most robust bioindicators of climate change. While considerable multidecadal records of plant and animal phenology exist for the northern hemisphere, few noteworthy records are available for the southern hemisphere. We present one of the first phenological records of fish migration for the southern hemisphere, and one of the only phenological records for the southwest Indian Ocean. The so-called 'sardine run' - an annual winter migration of sardines, northeast of their summer spawning grounds on the Agulhas Bank off the coast of Durban, South Africa - has been well documented in local newspapers given the importance placed on fishing and fishing-tourism in the region. An analysis of the first arrival dates of sardines reveals a 1.3 day per decade delay over the period 1946-2012. Although this phenological shift reveals a poor association with sea surface temperatures (SST), it coincides with a poleward shift in the position of the 21 degrees C mean annual SST isotherm - the threshold temperature for sardine populations. The timing of sardine arrivals near Durban corresponds closely with the number of mid-latitude cyclones passing over the Durban coastline during the months of April and May. The strength of the run is strongly associated with ENSO conditions. The complex suite of factors associated with this phenological shift poses challenges in accurately modelling the future trajectory for this migratory event.
   Significance:
   The sardine run, a significant event for tourism and fisheries, is occurring progressively later in the year.
   The incidence of failed sardine runs has increased in frequency over the period 1946-2012.
   These changes in fish migration phenology coincide with a poleward shift in the position of the 21 degrees C mean annual SST isotherm.
   The strength in the sardine run is strongly associated with ENSO conditions.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the production and efficiency of 24-month-old Red Angus primiparous cows of different weights at weaning and repetition of pregnancy. Before calving, the females were managed in natural prairies and fed sweet clover (Lotus corniculatus) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), with loads of 315 and 501 kg ha(-1), respectively. Females were divided into groups according to the average birth weight into light 346.15 +/- 3.39 kg; moderate 381.95 +/- 2.99 kg; and heavy 412.63 +/- 3.33 kg weights. The indicators evaluated were: primiparous weights and body conditions at calving and weaning, daily average and total gains, fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI), and accumulation. Calves at birth and weaning had their daily average and total weights evaluated. In terms of production, the daily average and total gains per pair and effective herd production (EHP) of the weight groups were measured. At weaning, morphometric measures, viz. croup height and thoracic perimeter had a linear relationship increasing with the weight at calving. In FTAI and cumulative pregnancy, the groups of light and moderate cows were more efficient than the heavy group cows, with values of 81.25%, 75.00%, and 55.56%, respectively. The EHP differed between the groups with values of 37.07 +/- 1.71, 28.13 +/- 1.50, and 19.99 +/- 1.68 kg, for light, moderate, and heavy, respectively. Light cows were 31.8% and 85.4% higher in effective production than moderate and heavy cows, respectively. Knowledge of the production system is important for enhancing breeding efficiency. The improvement in productive performance is related to the adequacy of metrices used in the production system.

AB  - Having an effective immune system can be very costly, sometimes at the expense of other important life history traits, including reproduction. This trade-off can be exaggerated in males of species that have costly sexual signalling, where condition-dependent components of the signalling system reflect the health status of the bearer. It is therefore vital for a male to be able to adequately balance the costs of activating the immune system successfully while also expressing high-quality sexual signals. We examined males of the brush-legged wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata to see whether static condition-dependent components of sexual signalling in adult males are indicative of health status (immune stress response, encapsulation) and whether female preference for these traits is influenced by infection. After experimental ingestion of a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), symmetry of male foreleg tuft (a secondary sexual trait) was found to predict the intensity of the subsequent infection, such that males with more asymmetrical tufts had higher levels of bacteria in the haemolymph. Females were equally likely to mate with infected and uninfected males in mating trials, but females that mated with infected males had bacteria in their haemolymph and on their body surface. Males that engaged in courtship had significantly lower encapsulation responses than males that did not engage in courtship, but among those males that courted, larger tuft size indicated a higher encapsulation response even after energetically costly courtship. These results indicate that females may be able to use static sexual signalling traits to examine a male's overall health, but females do not appear to discriminate against males who are actively infected, even though there is a direct cost to the female via the transfer of male infection.

AB  - Intracellular calcification by the coccolith-producing haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi (NIES 837) is regulated by various environmental factors. This study focused on the relationship between cold and phosphate-deficient stresses to elucidate how those factors control coccolith production. Ca-45 incorporation into coccoliths was more than 97% of the total Ca-45 incorporation by whole cells. In a batch culture, orthophosphate in the medium (final concentration, 28.7 mu M) was rapidly depleted within 3 days, and then extracellular alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, an indicator of phosphate deprivation, increased during the stationary growth phase. The increase in AP activity was slightly higher at 20A degrees C than at 12A degrees C. The calcification started to increase earlier than AP activity, and the increase was much higher at 12A degrees C than at 20A degrees C. Such enhancement of calcification was suppressed by the addition of phosphate, while AP activity was also suppressed after a transient increase. These results suggest that phosphate deprivation is a trigger for calcification and that a rather long induction period is needed for calcification compared to the increase in AP activity. While calcification was greatly stimulated by cold stress, other cellular activities such as growth, phosphate utilization, and the induction of AP activity were suppressed. The stimulation of coccolith production by cold stress was minimal under phosphate-sufficient conditions. The high calcification activity estimated by Ca-45 incorporation was confirmed by morphological observations of coccoliths on the cell surface under bright-field and polarization microscopy. These results indicate that phosphate deprivation is the primary factor for stimulating coccolith production, and cold stress is a secondary acceleration factor that stimulates calcification under conditions of phosphate deprivation.

AB  - Increase in motorization and densification of populations in cities have led to the use of more resources both for the construction of different objects and for the service and operation of automotive vehicles. As a result, volumes of freight transportation, which are related to the construction and servicing of these objects, increase. New scientifically applied tasks that are related to the safety of freight transportation have emerged. Special attention is being paid to those that are related to dangerous tasks. It is obvious that traffic safety and the quality of the transportation process significantly depend on the behaviors and actions of the driver. The driver, as it is known, is the main chain of the "driver - automobile - road - environment" (DARE) system. With improvements in the technical and operational parameters of vehicles and road characteristics, the study of the functional state (FS) of the driver and the reliability of his skills become more important every time. The specific importance of this becomes clear when drivers operate vehicles that transport dangerous goods.
   Therefore, research on the interaction of chains of the DARE system (using improved existing and developed methods by the authors) is carried out in this paper, taking into account the indicators of drivers' FS in different situations (stress index, which consists in evaluation of the heart and brain operations). The results obtained provide an opportunity to predict their behavior in different road situations and, as a consequence, to determine possible risks during the transportation of dangerous goods. The authors improved the methodology of determining the levels of possible risks of accidents and assessment of their consequences, taking into account the peculiarities of transportation routes, traffic conditions, and psychophysiological indicators of the driver's body during the transportation of dangerous goods within settlements and on the roads between them.

AB  - In a warming world an increasing number of people are being exposed to heat, making a comfortable thermal environment an important need. This study explores the potential of using Regional Internet Search Frequencies (RISF) for air conditioning devices as an indicator for thermal discomfort (i.e. dissatisfaction with the thermal environment) with the aim to quantify the adaptation potential of individuals living across different climate zones and at the high end of the temperature range, in India, where access to health data is limited. We related RISF for the years 2011-2015 to daily daytime outdoor temperature in 17 states and determined at which temperature RISF for air conditioning starts to peak, i.e. crosses a heat 'threshold', in each state. Using the spatial variation in heat thresholds, we explored whether people continuously exposed to higher temperatures show a lower response to heat extremes through adaptation (e.g. physiological, behavioural or psychological). State-level heat thresholds ranged from 25.9 degrees C in Madhya Pradesh to 31.0 degrees C in Orissa. Local adaptation was found to occur at state level: the higher the average temperature in a state, the higher the heat threshold; and the higher the intra-annual temperature range (warmest minus coldest month) the lower the heat threshold. These results indicate there is potential within India to adapt to warmer temperatures, but that a large intra-annual temperature variability attenuates this potential to adapt to extreme heat. This winter 'reset' mechanism should be taken into account when assessing the impact of global warming, with changes in minimum temperatures being an important factor in addition to the change in maximum temperatures itself. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of local heat thresholds and people's adaptive capacity, which can support the design of local thermal comfort standards and early heat warning systems.

AB  - Tree leaves and needles are commonly used in biomonitoring as reliable indicators of environmental pollution to monitor a wide range of mainly airborne contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The most severe challenges are the reproducibility and comparability of results. This is the only basis upon which correct assessment can be ensured. Standardizing the collection and preservation of leaf samples can overcome such problems and improve the quality of the results. On this account, efforts are being made to promote standardization on national (Association of German Engineers, VDI) and international (European Committee for Standardization, CEN) level. The objective of this review is to investigate the current state of quality assurance in passive biomonitoring by analyzing 86 peer-reviewed papers on tree leaf-sampling and use. We show that little attention has been given to standardizing how leaves are collected in the field and stored as well as to the documentation of selection criteria and sampling conditions. Important information is often absent, including crucial aspects of sample collection and preservation, for example, the selection of sampling sites, exposure, sampling period, age and condition of target compartments. Potential standards are suggested and discussed as a foundation for the development of quality assurance standards to conceptualize and perform sampling. For some aspects of sampling the current literature yields little information to derive and establish standards. In the first place, this concerns the selection of sample species. Besides of this, it is important to document and report data concerning sampling conditions in a publication. Overall, further research is urgently required to define scientifically valid standards, which will ensure a high level of quality and comparability of the samples collected in the field.

AB  - Experiments on buckwheat biomass application for green manure were conducted at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture's Voke Branch during 2004-2007. One of the objectives of the present research was to study the effects of buckwheat use as green manure on the condition of rye crop and disease incidence by comparing biologically-diverse buckwheat biomasses (green and desiccated) and different incorporation methods (shallow and deep ploughing). Shallow incorporation of buckwheat green biomass (Lip to 15 cm) and deep incorporation (up to 25 cm) as well as shallow incorporation of desiccated biomass stimulated winter rye germination. Ear productivity per ear, and number of productive sterns were most length, number of grain per ear. markedly affected by the weather conditions. Buckwheat biomass type or incorporation methods did not have any considerable effect on these indicators. Assessments of fungal diseases in rye were made upon resumption of vegetation, at heading (BBCH 55-59). flowering (BBCH 65-69) stages and before harvesting (BBCH 87-89). During the experimental period, rye crops were annually affected by snow mould (Monographella nivalis), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis), scald (Rhynchosporium secalis), and eyespot (Tapesia yallundae). In 2005 the sterns were infested with stern rust (Puccinia graminis), and in 2007 the leaves were infested with brown rust (Puccinia recondita). The incidence of these diseases was largely influenced by the weather conditions. The diseases spread more rapidly and were more severe in rye crops when rainy and warm weather prevailed. Percentage of plants killed by snow Mould (r = 0.26), severity of scald (r = 0.18), powdery mildew (r = -0.16), and eyespot (r = -0.07) did not depend on the amount of biomass incorporated. The use of green manure in rye crops did not promote the occurrence of fungal diseases.

AB  - Several alternative interpretations of the pollen records of lake sediments in the Amazonia may arise due to a lack of understanding of the modern environments, mainly related to pollen-vegetation relationship. Therefore, in this work, we studied the modern pollen rain in sediments of the Amendoim Lake, plateaus of the Serra Sul dos Carajas, southeastern Amazonia. This study indicates the predominance of pollen grains from forest formation (ombrophilous forests and capAo florestal) over montane savanna in the lake sediments, despite the fact that montane savanna occupies 90% of the drainage basin. Additionally, these sediments reflect stronger signal of pollen from ombrophilous forests that occur in the slopes of the plateau. Important components of montane savanna such as Vellozia and Cereus were not observed in the modern pollen rain, which may be related to their shorter flowering periods restricted to the beginning of wetter conditions. The absence of Sacoglottis, Trichilia, Clusia, Emmotum, Guapira and Simarouba in the pollen rain is likely associated with different pollination strategy. The occurrence of windblown pollen of Alchornea, Pseudolmedia, Ilex and Cecropia, which are found from low to highlands of the Carajas region, reinforces a regional vegetation signal in sediments. Several plants from the studied site have been improperly described, according to taxonomy and ecology. For example, the current occurrence of Ilex and Styrax in the study site clearly suggests that they cannot be used as indicators of colder palaeoclimate conditions, as previously described. In addition, Poaceae can be found in drier to wetter substrate conditions, and abundance of their pollen grains in lakes can significantly vary according to relief morphology and cannot indicate palaeovegetation openness. Therefore, this work is a good background for further palaeobotany studies for this region.

AB  - Seafloor sediment containing biogenic amino acids was heated with NaCl solutions at 50-200 degrees C for 240 h to investigate the dissolution process of amino acids and evaluate their stabilities under hydrothermal conditions. Dissolved amino acids in the combined phase (dissolved combined amino acids, DCAAs) and free phase (dissolved free amino acids, DFAAs) were rapidly released into the solution during heating. The amount of DCAAs in the solutions was 4-9 times higher than the amount of DFAAs at each temperature. When heated at <= 100 degrees C, most of the total dissolved hydrolyzable amino acids (TDHAAs) were in the combined form (DCAAs/TDHAAs ratios > 0.9). The compositions of the DCAAs in solutions heated at <= 100 degrees C were similar to that of the total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAAs) of the initial sediment, indicating that the DCAAs, which are derived from organisms and biodebris in the sediment, are barely altered during the hydrothermal reaction at these temperatures. On the other hand, the DCAAs/TDHAAs ratios were 0.72 and 0.57 at 150 and 200 degrees C, respectively, and the compositions of the DCAAs at 150 and 200 degrees C were significantly different from that of the initial THAAs. In addition, non-protein amino acids (beta-alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid), which are sensitive biochemical indicators of the diagenetic alteration of natural organic matter, drastically increased to 80.9% of the DCAAs after heating at 200 degrees C. These results suggests that DCAAs are thermally unstable in the hydrothermal solutions at >= 150 degrees C. These DCAA would be transformed into thermally stable geo-polymers such as humic-like substances and hydrolyzable kerogens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of early rearing conditions on physiological, haematological and immunological responses relevant to adaptation and long-term stress in white Leghorn hens with intact beaks housed in furnished cages (FC) or conventional cages (CC) during the laying period. Pullets were cage reared (CR) or litter floor reared (FR). From 16 to 76 weeks of age, hens were housed in FC (eight hens per cage) or in CC (three hens per cage). As measures of long-term stress at the end of the laying period, adrenal reactivity was quantified by assessing corticosterone responses to adrenocorticotropin challenge, and immune response was assessed by measuring antibody responses after immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio was employed as an indicator of stress. Rearing conditions significantly affected anti-SRBC titres (P < 0.0001) and tended to affect H/L ratios (P = 0.07), with the highest values found in FR hens. Layer housing affected H/L ratio (P < 0.01); the highest ratio was found in FR birds housed in FC during the laying period. This study shows that early rearing environment affects immunological indicators that are widely used to assess stress in laying hens. However, while results on H/L ratio indicated that FR birds experienced more stress particularly when they were housed in FC during the laying period, the immune responses to SRBC in FR hens was improved, indicating the opposite. This contradiction suggests that the effects on immune response may have been associated with pathogenic load due to environmental complexity in FR and FC hens rather than stress due to rearing system or housing system per se.

AB  - Poor housing conditions, harsh training sessions and uncontrollable or unpredictable social environments are examples of the situations that may lead to reduced welfare status in dogs. Individuals that suffer from poor welfare presumably experience stress and may consequently exhibit stress responses. In order to evaluate stress responses as potential indicators of poor welfare in dogs, we review studies dealing with dogs subjected to stressors. The reported stress responses are categorized as being behavioural, physiological or immunological, and demonstrate the various ways stress is manifested in the dog.
   Stressors such as noise, immobilization, training, novelty, transport or restricted housing conditions have been reported to elicit responses in behavioural, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, gastro-intestinal, and haematological parameters. These and other parameters that change during stress may thus be indicative of poor welfare. However, several sources of misinterpretation have to be considered before stress responses may be used as valid indicators of welfare.
   Although analogous to the human situation, especially chronic stress may impair welfare, most studies deal with acute stress and do not address chronic stress and related phenomena. Adaptation may counteract the initial stress response and render parameters of acute stress useless for assessing chronic stress. Adaptations to stress are thus in themselves indicative of reduced welfare. Such adaptations may be discovered by challenging a stress responsive system. Additional studies are recommended to investigate acute stress parameters as possible indicators of chronic stress.
   Differences in stressor properties and in individual characteristics of dogs introduce variability in stress responses. Such variability will complicate a valid interpretation of stress responses with regard to welfare. Obtaining and applying fundamental knowledge of stress responses in dogs and measuring more than one stress parameter are proposed to minimize the risk of misinterpreting measurements of stress.

AB  - 48 Holstein cows in their third or later lactation weighing 479 kg live weight and 13,5 litres of milk/cow/day were used to evaluate the productive performance with non-irrigated pastures and 560 g CP as:  1) active nitrogenous supplement with 23% protein as fish meal (ANS-77% NPN); 2) ANS-100% NPN without natural protein and 3) a control with a commercial concentrate in the dry period and without it in the rainy period.  Pasture (Digitaria decumbens) was fertilized only in the rainy season with 150 kg N/ha/year and no irrigation was supplied in the dry period.  In this latter, the cows received fresh forage during the first year and silage during the second.  Milk yield, fat, protein and live weight were analysed according to a multiplicative model and the effects of the lactation curve, treatment, parity, production bimesters and calving, treatment x bimester interaction were controlled.  The remaining measurements were analysed according to a linear model of fixed effects.  Milk yield during the first year was:  10,8; 10,2 and 11,8 litres/cow/day (P < 0,001) and during the second year it was 10,9; 10,5 and 11,4 (P < 0,001) litres/cow/day for ANS-77% NPN, ANS-100% NPN and a control, respectively.  More than 8 litres of milk/day under non-irrigation conditions and with ANS-100% NPN were attained, but 23% of the protein as fish meal stimulated this indicator from 0,4 to 0,6 litres/day improving the efficiency of utilization of the supplement.  The improved performance of the control treatment with the same protein supplementation level in non-irrigated conditions showed the superiority of the concentrate.

AB  - As an indoor environment, public transport is subject to special conditions with many passengers in a comparatively small space. Therefore, both an efficient control of the climatic parameters and a good air exchange are necessary to avoid transmission and spread of respiratory diseases. However, in such a dynamic system it is practically impossible to determine pathogenic substances with the necessary temporal and spatial resolution, but easy-to-measure parameters allow the air quality to be assessed in a passenger compartment. Carbon dioxide has already proven to be a useful indicator, especially in environments with a high occupancy of people. Airborne particulate matter can also be an important aspect for assessing the air quality in an indoor space. Consequently, the time courses of temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and particulate matter (PM10) were tracked and evaluated in local public transport buses, trams and trains in the Brunswick/Hanover region. In all measurements, the climatic conditions were comfortable for the passengers. Carbon dioxide was strongly correlated with occupancy and has proven to be the most informative parameter. The PM10 concentration, however, often correlated with the dynamics of people when getting on and off, but not with the occupancy. Sensors, equipped with integrated GPS, were installed in the passenger cabins and were found to be useful for recording location-related effects such as stops. The results of this study show that the online recording of simple parameters is a valuable tool for assessing air quality as a function of time, location and number of people. When the occupancy is high, a low carbon dioxide level indicates good ventilation, which automatically reduces the risk of infection. It is therefore recommended to take more advantage of low-cost sensors as a control for air conditioning systems in passenger cabins and for evaluations of the dynamics in public transport.

AB  - In 2015, at a UN Summit, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted; it contains 17 sustainable development goals crucially important for any country in the world. The scientific significance of solving the problem of sustainable development consists in the urgent task to adapt the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to national conditions of different countries and to form a mechanism for their achievement in various economic sectors. Since the central place in the Agenda is devoted to food security and sustainable development of agriculture, we identify the possibility of applying the system of SDGs to promote further sustainable development of Russian agricultural sector. The main scientific idea and goal of the present paper is to determine national priorities in the field of sustainable development on the basis of meaningful analysis of the current state of the agri-food complex; besides we search for possible directions to adapt the global Agenda 2030 to Russian conditions so as to improve existing agriculture development strategies and programs, taking into consideration the UN SDGs. We use system approach and statistical analysis to identify and specify relevant socio-economic and environmental issues in the Russian agri-food sector and to systematize them on the basis of the UN methodology. We believe that the proposed grouping of agri-food sector problems and their relationship with the UN SDGs can serve as a basis for constructing a concept for its sustainable development. We show that in order to adapt the 2030 Agenda it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of existing strategies and programs for development of the agri-food sector by comparing their goals, objectives and indicators with the global SDGs, identifying their inconsistencies and the possibilities to adjust them.

AB  - Herein, we report the response of indices based on phytoplankton and zooplankton and their combination to different nutrient concentrations in lakes. The study was carried out in ten lakes in northeastern Poland. Integrated samples were collected from the epilimnion during the summer of 2012-2013. Secchi disk visibility (SD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll a were used as proxies for eutrophication. We calculated 16 plankton indices: two phytoplankton indices, six crustacean indices, five rotiferan indices, two zooplankton diversity indices, and one combined phytoplankton and zooplankton index. Among them, nine indices with the strongest correlations with TP were selected: percentage share of Crustacean species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers (IHTCRU), percentage share of Rotifera species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers IHTROT, Crustacean ratio of biomass to numbers B/N-CRU, phytoplankton trophic index (TITP+TN), Margalef's index, percentage share of cyclopoid biomass in total biomass of Crustacea (CB), Rotifera numbers (N-ROT), biomass of Cyclopoida (B-CY), and ratio of the cyclopoid biomass to the biomass of Cladocera (CY/CL). The sensitivity of the normalized values of these indices to proxies of eutrophication was tested. IHTCRU, IHTROT, and B/N-CRU were the most sensitive and gave the strongest responses at lower TP concentrations (<35 mu g/L). The phytoplankton trophic index, TITP+TN, together with the zooplankton-based Margalef's index and CB were very sensitive in both low (<35 mu g/L) and high (>60 mu g/L) TP conditions. On the other hand, N-ROT, B-CY, and CY/CL were slightly sensitive at low TP concentrations while their reaction was notable at high TP concentrations. A similar pattern of response was observed for TN concentration and SD visibility.

AB  - Recent findings about the evolution of palaeogeographic conditions of the Black Sea during the Holocene have significantly improved our understanding of the profound environmental changes that took place around 9 ka ago, when the Neoeuxinian Lake reconnected to the global ocean. In contrast to the western and southeastern regions where numerous studies have been recently performed, the northeast region remains relatively under investigated. We carried out the first multi-proxy continuous study of a sediment core (Ak-2575) from the northeastern Black Sea shelf that includes benthic calcareous fossils (ostracods, molluscs and foraminifers), dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) and sedimentology, thus providing reconstructions of surface and bottom-water conditions. The age model of the core is based on 10 AMS-C-14 dates. Calibrated ages are used throughout the manuscript. The first appearance of Mediterranean elements is documented at 9.6 cal. ka BP. Our data provide evidence of sustained cohabitation of benthic species of Caspian and Mediterranean origins, represented by different ontogenetic stages, from at least similar to 7.8 (or even 8.8) to 6.7 cal. ka BP with the gradual disappearance of brackish species suggesting a gradual increase in salinity and most likely a change in the salt composition. Dinocyst assemblages show species succession that is coherent across the Black Sea basin, with brackish taxa dominating until similar to 8.5 cal. ka BP and being slowly replaced by euryhaline species. The occurrences of authigenic gypsum crystals, especially abundant at similar to 7.4 and 6.5 cal. ka BP, suggest the temporal appearance of hydrogen sulphide at the shelf edge which during certain periods appears to reduce the abundance of benthic fauna.

AB  - Declines in economic activity and associated changes in human livelihood strategies can increase threats of species overexploitation. This is exemplified by the effects of economic crises, which often drive intensification of subsistence poaching and greater reliance on natural resources. Whereas development theory links natural resource use to social-economic conditions, few empirical studies of the effect of economic downturns on wild animal species have been conducted. I assessed the relations between African elephant (Loxodonta africana) mortality and human-caused wounds in Samburu, Kenya and (1) livestock and maize prices (measures of local economic conditions), (2) change in national and regional gross domestic product (GDP) (measures of macroeconomic conditions), and (3) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (a correlate of primary productivity). In addition, I analyzed household survey data to determine the attitudes of local people toward protected areas and wild animals in the area. When cattle prices in the pastoralist study region were low, human-caused wounds to and adult mortality of elephants increased. The NDVI was negatively correlated with juvenile mortality, but not correlated with adult mortality. Changes in Kenyan and East Asian (primary market for ivory) GDP did not explain significant variation in mortality. Increased human wounding of elephants and elephant mortality during periods of low livestock prices (local economic downturns) likely reflect an economically driven increase in ivory poaching. Local but not macroeconomic indices explained significant variation in mortality, likely due to the dominance of the subsistence economy in the study area and its political and economic isolation. My results suggest economic metrics can serve as effective indicators of changes in human use of and resulting effects on natural resources. Such information can help focus management approaches (e. g., antipoaching effort or proffering of alternative occupational opportunities) that address variation in local activities that threaten plant and animal populations.

AB  - Variation with depth and time of organic matter (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus), inorganic pollutant (mercury), as well as bacterial abundance and activity, were investigated for the first time in sediment profiles of different parts of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) over the last decades. The highest organic contents (about 32%), mercury concentration (27 mg kg(-1)), bacterial abundance (in order of 9 x 10(9) cell g(-1) dry sediment), and bacterial activity (1299 Relative Light Units (RLU)) were found in the highly polluted sediments contaminated by the waste water treatment plant (WWTP) discharge, which deposited during the period of cultural eutrophication. Such data, which contrast with the other sampled sites from deeper and more remote parts of the lake, prove that the organic matter and nutrients released from the municipal WWTP have considerable effects on bacterial abundance and activities in freshwater sediments. In fact, the relatively unpolluted deepwater sites and the coastal polluted site show large synchronous increases in bacterial densities linked to the anoxic conditions in the 1970s (lake eutrophication caused by external nutrient input) that subsequently increased the nutrient loading fluxes. These results show that the microbial activities response to natural or human-induced changing limnological conditions (e.g., nutrient supply, oxygen availability, redox conditions) constitutes a threat to the security of water resources, which in turn poses concerns for the world's freshwater resources in the context of global warming and the degradation of water quality (oxygen depletion in the bottom water due to reduced deep waters mixing). Moreover, the accumulation of inorganic pollutants such as high mercury (methyl-mercury) concentration may represent a significant source of toxicity for sediment dwelling organisms.

AB  - The routine mixing of pigs causes aggression that cannot be greatly reduced by low-cost environmental changes. The variability and heritability of aggressiveness are discussed and both appear adequate to make selection against aggressiveness worthwhile in grower-stage pigs. Selection would require rapid phenotyping of many animals for which a validated indicator genetically correlated to aggressive behaviour is required. Three potential indicators are discussed (attack latency, number of skin lesions and relationship to non-social behavioural traits). Attack latency correlates with post-mixing aggressiveness under research conditions but attacks are delayed under commercial conditions reducing the practicability of the trait for selection. Correlations between aggressiveness and responses to non-social challenges, such as the back-test, are not always consistent. Lastly, the counting of skin lesions is rapid, and the number of lesions has a moderate heritability and is genetically correlated with involvement in aggressive behaviour. The wider effects of selection against post-mixing aggressiveness are discussed. Examining the behavioural strategies of unaggressive pigs, especially their response to defeat, would reveal how selection may alter aggressive tactics. Selection against lesions from mixing is also expected to reduce their number in more stable social conditions, but the implications for aggression between sows and that of sows towards their piglets and humans needs to be investigated. Aggressiveness is genetically correlated with response to handling involving components of social isolation, human presence and novelty. Identifying how unaggressive pigs respond to other challenging situations differing in these components may be worthwhile. Selection against aggression using skin lesions appears to be achievable although the full value of this would benefit from estimations of the genetic correlations with the traits outlined above.

AB  - Biomarker and n-alkane compound specific stable carbon isotope analyses (CSIA) were carried out on 58 crude oil samples from shallow water and deepwater flelds of the Niger Delta in order to predict the depositional environment and organic matter characteristics of their potential source rocks. Using a source organofacies prediction approach from oil geochemistry, the presence in the western deepwater oils relatively abundant C-27 steranes, C-30 24-n-propyl cholestane, low oleanane index, relatively low pr/ph ratios, gammacerane, and positive to nearly flat C-12-C-30 n-alkane compound specific stable carbon isotope profiles, suggests that the source facies that expelled these oils contain significant marine derived organic matter deposited under sub-oxic and stratified water column conditions. This contrasts with the terrigenous organic matter dominated source rocks accepted for shallow water Niger Delta oils. Oils in the shallow water accumulations can be separated into terrigenous and mixed marine-terrigenous families. The terrigenous family indicates expulsion from source rock(s) containing overwhelmingly higher plant source organic matter (average oleanane index = 0.48, high C-29 steranes) as well as having negative sloping n-alkane isotope profiles. Oxic source depositional conditions (pr/ph > 2.5) and non-stratified conditions (absence to low gammacerane content) are inferred for the terrigenous family. The mixed marine-terrigenous family has biomarker properties that are a combination of the deepwater and terrigenous shallow water oils, Bitumen extracts of the sub-delta Late Cretaceous Araromi Formation shale in the Dahomey Basin are comparable both molecularly and isotopically to the studied western deepwater oil set, but with an over all poor geochemical correlation. This poor geochemical match between Araromi shale and the western deepwater oils does not downgrade the potential of sub-delta Cretaceous source rock contribution to the regional oil charge in the deepwater Niger Delta.

AB  - The sensitivity and response of northern hemisphere altitudinal and polar treelines to environmental change are increasingly discussed in terms of climate change, often forgetting that climate is only one aspect of environmental variation. As treeline heterogeneity increases from global to regional and smaller scales, assessment of treeline sensitivity at the landscape and local scales requires a more complex approach than at the global scale. The time scale (short-, medium-, long-term) also plays an important role when considering treeline sensitivity. The sensitivity of the treeline to a changing environment varies among different types of treeline. Treelines controlled mainly by orographic influences are not very susceptible to the effects of warming climates. Greatest sensitivity can be expected in anthropogenic treelines after the cessation of human activity. However, tree invasion into former forested areas above the anthropogenic forest limit is controlled by site conditions, and in particular, by microclimates and soils. Apart from changes in tree physiognomy, the spontaneous advance of young growth of forest-forming tree species into present treeless areas within the treeline ecotone and beyond the tree limit is considered to be the best indicator of treeline sensitivity to environmental change. The sensitivity of climatic treelines to climate warming varies both in the local and regional topographical conditions. Furthermore, treeline history and its after-effects also play an important role. The sensitivity of treelines to changes in given factors (e.g. winter snow pack, soil moisture, temperature, evaporation, etc.) may vary among areas with differing climatic characteristics. In general, forest will not advance in a closed front but will follow sites that became more favourable to tree establishment under the changed climatic conditions.

AB  - Based on a negative correlation of magnetic susceptibility with organic matter content and the degree of gleying documented both in North American and southern Siberian eolian sequences, the authors propose that reducing conditions of incipient histosol development contributed to the alteration of magnetic minerals from strongly magnetic forms of oxidized iron to weakly magnetic forms. Therefore, the magnetic susceptibility is basically an indicator of redox cycles. Well-vegetated conditions generally dominated the later part of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to15,000- similar to8000 C-14 years BP) and poorly vegetated conditions the early part (similar to21,000- similar to15,000 C-14 years BP), with a rapid transition around 15,000 C-14 years BP chronologically corresponding to many well-documented rapid transitions around the world. The magnetic susceptibility signatures indicate approximately 1000-year-long cycles of environmental changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to21,000-10,000 C-14 years BP) in North America. The initial perturbation of these similar to1000-year-long cycles might have started in the Tropical Pacific and then been promptly transferred to the North Atlantic via the North American Icesheet. The southern Siberian eolian sequence recorded approximately 1400-year cycles. These similar to1400-year cycles might have been associated with the thermal variations in the Arctic Ocean that was directly linked with the thermal variations in the North Atlantic Ocean. To sum up, our research suggests that the North American eolian sequence recorded similar to1000-year cycles and the southern Siberian eolian sequence recorded similar to1400-year cycles, although it is not able to propose plausible mechanisms controlling the similar to1000- or/ and similar to1400-year cycles.

AB  - Measurements of the soil pH are often used to characterize the nutritional conditions for the vegetation at a particular site, for example in ecograms describing the ecological behaviour of a (tree) species. In spite of this use aid interpretation of pH measurements, certain prerequisites must be fulfilled when pH-values are to be used as an expression of the nutritional conditions for plants. Our study in deciduous forests of northern Germany shows that in strongly acid soils (pH < 4) the correlations between pH-values on the one hand and S-value, base saturation and C/N-ratios on the other hand are generally low, particularly for measurements in the upper rnineral horizon. By contrast, in moderately acid to neutral soils (pH 4-7), pH-values could be employed as a useful indicator of the nutritional conditions for the vegetation. The main reason for the observed discrepancy in the indicator quality of pH measurements is the presence of distinct differences in the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soils, which are often not taken into account when interpreting pH measurements. CEC-values close to zero may be associated with either low or comparatively high PH-values, depending on whether or not the few available cation exchange sites are occupied by protons or bases, respectively, In general, pH - S-value/base saturation/CN-ratio relationships are stronger in soil samples taken in the main (fine and coarse) root horizon than in those from the upper mineral horizon. Consequently, ecograms give a more precise description of vegetation-site relationships if the considered nutrient gradients refer to appropriate soil parameters (e.g. S-value, C/N-ratio) and to measurements in the main root horizon.

AB  - The influence of greenhouse humidity control on the transpiration rate (lambdaE(c)). sensible heat flux (H-c) and bulk stomatal conductance (g(c)) of a soilless rose canopy (Rosa hybrida. cv. First Red) was studied in a greenhouse located in the coastal area of eastern Greece. Measurements were carried out during several days in the summer (i) without air humidity control and (ii) with a mist system operating when the relative humidity of the greenhouse air was lower than 75%. The diurnal course of g(c) was determined from the relation linking lambdaE(c) to canopy-to-air vapour pressure deficit (D-c) or from inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation. The two ways of estimating g(c) were in good agreement, showing a significant increase of g(c) under mist conditions. Covariation of radiation and humidity during the day caused diurnal hysteresis in lambdaE(c) and g(c). The hysteresis phenomena were less marked when the mist system was operating. Normalising g(c) by radiation removed most of the hysteresis and indicated a curvilinear stomatal response to vapour pressure deficit. The analysis of the energy partition at the canopy showed high negative values of the Bowen ratio (beta approximate to -0.7) in both conditions, indicating that canopy transpiration played a major role in cooling the greenhouse atmosphere. The contribution of the mist system to total evaporative cooling was estimated to be about 20%, with only 40-50% of the mist water being effectively used in cooling. Calculation of the crop water stress index confirmed that the crop was less stressed under misting conditions. It was concluded that the prediction of short-term variations of lambdaE(c) and g(c) in greenhouse environments must account for the magnitude and diurnal variation of air VPD.

AB  - Toxic cyanobacterial mass occurrences have caused animal poisonings worldwide and may pose a health hazard for humans. Strains of the genus Anabaena are either non-toxic or produce hepatotoxins, microcystins (MCYST), or neurotoxins (such as anatoxin-a). In order to study which growth conditions favor hepatotoxic vs neurotoxic strains and how production of toxins varies, we compared the responses of two microcystin- and two anatoxin-a-producing Anabaena strains in continuous turbidostat cultures, at different temperatures, under growth-limiting light levels. Growth rates consistently remained <0.8 divisions per 24 h. Differences were strain-specific and not associated with hepatotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Thus, differential adaptation of strains to temperature and to growth-limiting light levels cannot explain why, in some cyanobacterial water blooms, hepatotoxic strains, and in others, neurotoxic ones become dominant. A statistical analysis of field data showed that the most significant discriminating factors between different types of blooms were the concentrations of dissolved PO4-phosphorus and NO3-nitrogen. Anabaena blooms with unknown neurotoxicity associated with low PO4-phosphorus and high NO3-nitrogen concentrations. Among other Anabaena blooms, the hepatotoxic ones associated with the lowest, and most of the non-toxic ones with higher concentrations of PO4-phosphorus. Anabaena blooms that contained anatoxin-a and hepatotoxic Microcystis blooms showed tendencies towards the highest concentrations of PO4-phosphorus. Non-toxic blooms dominated by genera other than Anabaena occurred over a wide range of growth conditions. In turbidostat cultures, maximal production of microcystins correlated with maximal growth rates. Light regulated the production of MCYST-LR variants, and temperature affected the production of MCYST-RR variants. Anatoxin-a seemed to be produced most under temperatures and light levels slightly suboptimal for growth. Under low light, considerable amounts of extracellular anatoxin-a were detected while microcystins consistently remained intracellular.

AB  - Biochar is considered as a promising additive with multi-benefits to compost production. However, how the biochar properties and composting conditions affect the composting process and quality and ecological risk of compost is still unclear. In the present study, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on 876 observations from 84 studies. Overall, regardless of biochar properties and composting conditions, biochar addition could significantly increase the pH (5.90%), germination index (26.6%), contents of nitrate nitrogen (56.6%), total nitrogen (9.50%), and total potassium (10.1%), and degree of polymerization (29.4%) while decrease the electrical conductivity (-5.70%), contents of ammonium nitrogen (-33.7%), bioavailable zinc (-22.9%), and bioavailable copper (-38.6%), and emissions of ammonia (-44.2%), nitrous oxide (-68.4%), and methane (-61.7%). Other compost indicators, including the carbon to nitrogen ratio and total phosphorus content, were found to be insignificantly affected by biochar addition. The responses of tested compost indicators affected by the biochar properties and composting conditions were further explored, based on which the addition of straw biochars at a rate of 10-15% was recommended due to its greater potential to improve quality of compost and reduce its ecological risk. Combining the results of linear regression analysis and structural equation model, the increase in compost pH caused by biochar addition was identified as the key mechanism for the increased nutrient content and decreased heavy metal bioavailability. These results could guide us to choose suitable kinds of biochar or develop engineered biochars with specific functionality to realize an optimal compost production mode. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in tree-rings is a widely applied tool which allows to retrieve information about past climatic conditions, as well as tree physiological responses to environmental changes. This is based on well-established mechanistic models and firm statistical relationships with climate variables. In contrast, the hydrogen isotopic signature (delta H-2) of tree-rings has been reported to be poorly correlated to climate or difficult to explain, and as a consequence, hydrogen isotopes are far less utilized. However, recent plant physiological experiments have highlighted the role of autotrophic versus heterotrophic processes affecting delta H-2 values, i.e. use of fresh assimilates versus stored carbohydrates, and have much improved our understanding of the role of post-photosynthetic H-2-fractionation. Using unpublished and literature delta H-2 data of tree-ring cellulose (delta(HC)-H-2) of 5 study sites in Europe and Asia, we systematically investigated the relationships between delta H-2(C) and tree-ring width (TRW), which, in contrast to previous research, could now be explained through post photosynthetic H-2-fractionation. In most cases, these relationships were found to be negative (r(2) = 0.23 to 0.51, all P < 0.05) when the main growth limiting factors are precipitation and light, while in temperature limited sites we observed a positive trend (r(2) = 0.14, P < 0.05). Our results suggest that, under stress conditions, trees use a surplus of carbon from reserves for wood formation. Therefore, in combination with TRW chronologies, delta H-2(C) may allow to infer about physiological information on stressful time periods independently of biotic and abiotic origin. Here, we discuss implications of these findings for tree-ring research, summarize them in a conceptual framework and suggest future research directions.

AB  - Urbanization is considered high priority in China. The present study focuses on a novel Geographical Information System-based approach to quantitatively assess the geo-environmental conditions for sustainable land-use development of an urban area. Fuzzy theories with analytic hierarchy processes are the most commonly used tools for land-use suitability evaluation. In fuzzy theories, a pattern recognition model is one of the tiny minority of models which can quantify the result. However, the key challenge is to provide each influencing factor with a quantitative value and selecting an approriate model to calculate the site's adaptability for different infrastructures. The present study first proposes an approach coupling geostatistical analysis with three-dimensional visualizing technology to establish a reliable geological structural and high-precision informative geotechnical model to comprehensively understand the subsurface conditions of the research area. Then, an approach which uses an improved fuzzy pattern recognition method combining reliable geotechnical parameters to evaluate the geological environment is conducted. The weighting of each influencing factor in the final result is determined by an analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a zoning map of site adaptability is formed in the Geographical Information System for guiding land-use development. The study area is one of the most promising areas for urban and economic as well as airport developments in China, which is located on the northeast of Capital Beijing. This area may face several geo-environmental problems that will limit its suitability for infrastructure projects. The resultant models demonstrate the appropriate application of the presented methodologies. The quantified evaluation of the geo-environment could be combined with other conditions to provide decision-makers with improved reasonable land-use suitability scenarios.

AB  - The present study evaluated the genotoxic effects of the atmospheric air on Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea in urban areas with different intensities of vehicular traffic and in riparian forest fragments in the Sinos River Basin (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), considering the influence of climatic conditions prevailing in these environments. Bimonthly, from May 2012 to March 2013, cuttings with flower buds were exposed for 8 h in urban and riparian forest environments in the municipalities of Caraa, Taquara and Campo Bom in the upper, middle and lower sections, respectively, of the Sinos River Basin. Simultaneously, negative controls were made and climatic data were recorded. Micronuclei (MCN) frequencies were determined in young tetrads of pollen mother cells and expressed as MCN/100 tetrads. Significantly higher MCN frequencies were observed in buds exposed in urban and riparian forest environments in Taquara (up to 7.23 and 4.80, respectively) and Campo Bom (up to 4.90 and 4.23, respectively) than in buds exposed in Caraa (up to 2.90 and 2.50, respectively), in the majority of samplings, and in relation to the negative control (up to 1.93) in all months. Over the course of the period monitored, there were significant variations in MCN frequencies at all sampling points, with the exception of the urban environment in Caraa. For the urban environments, relation between the MCN frequency, vehicular traffic and mean temperature was observed. For the riparian forest fragments, there was no association between MCN frequency and climatic factors. Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea can be considered a useful tool to point out areas with increased atmospheric pollution, since the exposure of plants under severe climatic conditions is avoided to minimize their negative influence on the formation of micronuclei.

AB  - The contribution of fine roots to forest ecosystem health (FEH) is still poorly understood, although fine roots are recognized to provide benefits to ecosystems. To address the relationship between fine roots and forest health, minirhizotrons was used to observe fine root (<2mm) dynamics during a 1-year period in nine Moso bamboo [Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel ex J. Houz.] plots having three levels of forest health (health, general health, and sub-health) 6 months after minirhizotron installation in the Dagang mountains (China). Forest health status was assessed by an improved Costanza model in 2011, 3 years after the great 2008 Chinese ice storm. Fine root number, length, and turnover in health plots were significantly higher than those in general health and sub-health plots, indicating that fine root number, length, and turnover rate were positively correlated with forest health condition. On the contrary, fine root diameter increased from 0.39 +/- 0.03 to 0.52 +/- 0.04mm as forest health decreased, suggesting a strong negative correlation between fine root diameter and forest health condition. Fine root turnover rate ranged from 0.68 +/- 0.19 to 1.37 +/- 0.32year(-1) as forest health condition increased. All trees in the nine plots showed a unimodal peak of fine root production with distinct seasonality. The fine root number growth rate peaked in mid-summer and declined over the remainder of the growing season. Thus, fine root of Moso bamboo appear highly sensitive to forest health status, and this study concluded that fine root turnover rate of the minirhizotron tube surface can be used as an indicator to assess FEH in Dagang mountain.

AB  - The research presented here aims to plot density diagrams per road crash risk type to identify all possible scenarios where driving is less than safe. The starting point was the prediction of injury crash rate on horizontal homogeneous segments of two-lane rural roads for three main injurious crash types (head-on/side collisions, rear-end crashes, and single-vehicle run-off-road crashes) as observed on the network. A careful analysis of the database shows that a wide variety of factors appear to be influenced or associated with the crash dynamic, as follows: the road scenario (combination of infrastructure and environmental conditions found at the site at the time of the crash), mean lane width, the horizontal curvature indicator (measurement of the curvature change rate), and mean speed. Crashes recorded from 2003 to 2010, of which 1597 were injurious, and 645 resulted only in damage to property, were analyzed on more than 3700km of road network in Southern Italy. Generalized estimating equations with a negative binomial distribution were implemented. Risk-type density charts were plotted to thoroughly identify all possible combinations of existing explicative variables producing hazardous conditions on the road. The different shades in the diagrams represent different ranges of injurious crash rates: the white band shows low levels, while a black band shows high values. It is not possible to consider working on an explanatory variable to reduce hazardous conditions on the road network without also considering how this variation might affect the influence of the remaining explanatory variables on crash phenomena and, consequently, on the predictive model. The risk maps make it possible to keep under control in a simple and immediate approach the way each variable as a result of variations of a part or of all.

AB  - The use of landfills as foraging areas by white storks (Ciconia ciconia) is a recent well-known behaviour. While several studies have highlighted positive effects at a populational level others suggest that the presence of pollutants, pathogens and the lower presence of antioxidants in the food could pose a health risk for individuals. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential effects of the use of landfills as a food resource on the physiology and health of white stork nestlings, by a multidisciplinary approach based on the analysis of nutritional status, body condition, blood parameters, oxidative stress balance and the presence of pathogens. Results showed better body condition in individuals associated with landfills compared to the ones feeding on natural resources, as well as better nutritional status, as indicated by higher levels of albumin, cholesterol, and triglycerides in plasma. As many pollutants have a pro-oxidant effect, we evaluated oxidative stress balance, with no differences in the indicators of damage except for methaemoglobin (metHb), significantly higher in nestlings associated with landfill-origin food. Regarding antioxidants, GSH was higher in nestlings associated with landfills, which may suggest a hormetic response induced potentially by the presence of pollutants in waste. Nestlings fed food from landfills also had a higher presence of Escherichia coli with a multiresistant phenotype to antibiotics. In conclusion, our results show that nestlings fed with a higher proportion of food from landfills present a better nutritional status and body condition than those fed with a higher proportion of natural diet, being the only indicators of negative effects of the use of this food resource the higher percentage of metHb in the peripheral blood and the presence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli.

AB  - High-resolution analyses of pollen and diatoms in core LV 53-29 from the northwestern Japan Sea trace climate, vegetation and oceanographic changes during the past 120 ka. The age model for the core was based on tephrochronology, colour lightness and magnetic susceptibility and was used to aid correlation with Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles (warm Greenland interstadials (GIs) and cold Greenland stadials (GSs)). The palynological and diatom data from this core record the changing influences of the East Asian monsoon, eustatic fluctuations in sea level, and the impact of variations in the direction and intensity of marine currents. Increases in Quercus and Cryptomeria pollen reflect GIs. The highest values of Cryptomeria were recorded during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and were associated with an increase in the intensity of the summer monsoon. The increase in Larix pollen is an indicator of GSs, and it occurs in all marine isotopic stages. Changes in diatom records indicate that oceanographic conditions in the northwestern Japan Sea differed from its southern and eastern regions. An increase in the cold-water and polyhalobous Rhizosolenia hebetata indicates GIs, although the surface water temperatures were colder than today with normal salinity. Species of the genus Chaetoceros, which is characteristic of GSs, were abundant during MIS 2. The predominance of Chaetoceros taxa and the high total abundance of diatoms may reflect regional upwelling conditions. The absence of brackish-water species at this time indicates a slight freshening of the surface water. The study of pollen, spores and diatoms in sediments from the northwestern Japan Sea illustrates the great potential of these proxies for identifying abrupt climate oscillations preserved in high-temporal resolution marine records, particularly those related to interstadial and stadial conditions.

AB  - Climate change can lead to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, which may induce a decline in tree vitality, rendering the forest more vulnerable to other stress factors. In this study we used the ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS to compare the NPP of boreal conifers on till soil and sandy soil, simulating the growth of Norway spruce during the 21st century using climate model projections corresponding to RCP 8.5. Model runs with and without nitrogen cycling enabled, in combination with two different approaches to implement the dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) were compared. The simulations showed that the forest productivity in Sweden is influenced by an interplay between site-specific temperature conditions and precipitation. Local differences in soil conditions can have an impact on the productivity, mediated by soil water and nutrient content. A warmer climate will lead to a longer growing season, but the productivity increase will partly be offset by a higher frequency of drought stress in summer and higher autotrophic respiration in winter. The ecosystem model runs indicated that periods with drought stress can cause low NSC levels, leading to time periods with decreased defence capacity against attacks by secondary agents such as bark beetles. The risks may however not become apparent until the forest stands are middle-aged. The model results are discussed in relation to current forestry practice, with Norway spruce (Picea abies) commonly being planted on dry soils better suited for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in order to reduce moose browsing damage of seedlings, which in the longer term may create a forest landscape more sensitive to spruce bark beetle attacks.

AB  - Urbanization strongly influences headwater stream chemistry and hydrology, but little is known about how these conditions impact bacterial community composition. We predicted that urbanization would impact bacterial community composition, but that stream water column bacterial communities would be most strongly linked to urbanization at a watershed-scale, as measured by impervious cover, while sediment bacterial communities would correlate with environmental conditions at the scale of streamreaches. To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat-water column vs. sediment-with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column vs. sediment environments are distinct.

AB  - Roads, bridges, and dikes constructed across salt marshes can restrict tidal flow, degrade habitat quality for nekton, and facilitate invasion by non-native plants including Phragmites australis. Introduced P. australis contributes to marsh accretion and eliminates marsh surface pools thereby adversely affecting fish by reducing access to intertidal habitats essential for feeding, reproduction, and refuge. Our study assessed the condition of resident fish populations (Fundulus heteroclitus) at four tidally restricted and four tidally restored marshes in New England invaded by P. australis relative to adjacent reference salt marshes. We used physiological and morphological indicators of fish condition, including proximate body composition (% lipid, % lean dry, % water), recent daily growth rate, age class distributions, parasite prevalence, female gravidity status, length-weight regressions, and a common morphological indicator (Fulton's K) to assess impacts to fish health. We detected a significant increase in the quantity of parasites infecting fish in tidally restricted marshes but not in those where tidal flow was restored to reduce P. australis cover. Using fish length as a covariate, we found that unparasitized, non-gravid F. heteroclitus in tidally restricted marshes had significantly reduced lipid reserves and increased lean dry (structural) mass relative to fish residing in reference marshes. Fish in tidally restored marshes were equivalent across all metrics relative to those in reference marshes indicating that habitat quality was restored via increased tidal flushing. Reference marshes adjacent to tidally restored sites contained the highest abundance of young fish (ages 0-1) while tidally restricted marshes contained the lowest. Results indicate that F. heteroclitus residing in physically and hydrologically altered marshes are at a disadvantage relative to fish in reference marshes but the effects can be reversed through ecological restoration.

AB  - Body composition and fish health indices of bonefish Albula vulpes were investigated to elucidate the energy dynamics in poorly studied tropical tidal flat environments. In general, bonefish were composed of 72% water, 21% protein, 4% ash, and 3% lipids, which is consistent with the wet weight values of the majority of freshwater and marine fish studied to date. Significant inverse relationships between the water and lipid contents of whole-body, gonad, and liver tissues revealed that the percentage of water is a good indicator of the relative amount of stored energy in bonefish and may be used as a surrogate for lipid content in future studies. The liver was the main storage site for lipids, containing more than twice the fat in the whole body. While both abiotic (e.g., season and location) and biotic (e.g., sex and size) factors contributed to the predictive power of the general linear models generated for all constituent analyses, there were no significant differences in whole-body or liver lipid content between seasons, which may be explained by there being a consistent food supply year-round. There was, however, a significant relationship between lipid content and body size with respect to season. Lipid content decreased in the winter and increased in the summer with increasing body size, a trend that can be explained by the timing of the reproductive season in bonefish. Seasonal changes in the condition factor and gonadosomatic indices were also linked to the winter spawning season, with decreasing body condition and increasing gonad development in the winter. Observed site-specific differences in the lipid content and liver somatic indices of bonefish may be accounted for by local trophodynamics as well as subtle differences in life history strategies. The energy reserve and fish health index data collected in this study may provide a useful baseline for future comparative work and help elucidate fish energetics in dynamic tropical tidal flat systems.

AB  - Geochemical and sedimentological data in a continuous 60,000-year sediment core record from the Kalya horst region of central Lake Tanganyika provide a detailed history of paleoclimate-mediated weathering and overflow events from upstream Lake Kivu. Univariate (elemental profiles), bivariate (elemental ratios) and multivariate analyses of chemical trends show variations between the dry Late Pleistocene (32-18 ka cal yr BP) and the wetter conditions that both preceded and post-date that interval. This record places important new constraints on the timing of aridity in East Africa during the high-latitude Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on significant decreases in magnetic susceptibility and soluble cation concentrations coinciding with biogenic silica. Elemental indicators in the oldest portion of the sedimentary record (60-50 ka cal yr BP) characterize this interval as a comparatively wet period, similar to modem conditions. Our record demonstrates that the ensuing transition toward and conditions in tropical Africa during high-latitude glaciation was a two staged event with intermediate levels of aridity occurring from 50-32 ka cal yr BP followed by intense aridity from 32-18 ka cal yr BP.
   The initiation of inflow from upstream Lake Kivu into Lake Tanganyika is evidenced at 10.6 ka cal yr BP through its influence on both elemental profiles (Mg, Ca) and through its effect on Sr-97/Sr-86. Increases in elemental (Mg, Ca, Sr) concentrations coincide with the timing of the Lake Kivu overflow. Metal geochemistry suggests that the overflow from Lake Kivu into Lake Tanganyika may have ceased between 8 and 6 ka cal yr BP, suggesting a period of Middle Holocene aridity in East Africa, (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose - This study seeks to introduce the role of resource and capability characteristics as drivers of a resource orientation (RO) and to examine empirically these relationships in different market conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study was conducted using a nation-wide survey distributed to key informants of multiple business units. Multiple regression was used to assess the relationships. RO is used as a proxy for the implementation of the resource-based view (RBV). The RO is also tested against performance outcomes to examine the robustness of the model that has been examined.
   Findings - Findings showed significant relationships between resource and capability characteristics and RO. These relationships were shown to be robust across various market conditions. RO also depicted significant, positive relationships with all four performance indicators that were assessed. Industry conditions were found to strengthen some of these relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - The results are limited to cross-sectional data that prevent the determination of causality. In addition, it is a nation-specific study that may not be generalisable to alternative settings. This presents an opportunity for further research to replicate this study in other nations and/or industries. The research presents implications for further theory development and suggests that management can focus on developing unique resource bundles to improve company performance; however, they will need to be attentive to the competitive environment in which they compete.
   Originality/value - This is the first study that empirically evaluates drivers of an RO and further tests the scale that was applied by Paladino. Additionally, this study illustrates that the RBV can be empirically tested through the use of an RO to have a demonstrable impact on financial and non-financial elements of performance.

AB  - Recent beachrocks on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea coasts of Egypt have been studied. In the Mediterranean beachrock skeletal particles (mainly molluscan fragments) are the most abundant grain type comprising approximately 60% of the framework grains: intraclasts make up the remaining 40%. In contrast, the Red Sea beachrocks are dominantly composed of igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock fragments that range in dimension from large boulders in proximal parts of the fan to gravels, sands and silts in the distal parts.
   High energy conditions as well as the presence of relatively coarse, high porous and permeable sediments ensure that adequate volumes of supersaturated water are able to Move through the pore system to accomplish the cementation process. Textural study (light and SEM microscope) on samples from both localities reveals that high-Mg calcite cements occur as thick to thin bladed isopachous crusts, which sometimes occlude all pore spaces. Aragonite cements are also present as thin circumgranular acicular crusts. However, some samples along the Red Sea coast contain high-Mg calcite displaying scalenohedral crystal forms.
   The isotopic composition of these beachrock cements generally show high values of delta-O-18 and delta-C-13.  In the Mediterranean beachrock cements the delta-O-18 and delta-C-13 values range from - 0.4 to + 1.2 and from + 1.0 to + 2.1 parts per thousand PDB, respectively, whereas the delta-O-18 and delta-C-13 values of Red Sea beachrock cements range from - 0.1 to + 1.2 and from + 2.1 to + 4.5 parts per thousand PDB, respectively.
   The oxygen and carbon isotopes, together with the texture and mineralogical composition of these cements, are good indicators of the conditions of primary condition and reflect the gross of stable isotopic and chemical composition of marine water.

AB  - Many drought indicators with different difficulties have been applied in numerous climatic zones. The reconnaissance drought index, which is based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, is considered a powerful weather drought index in arid and semi-arid zones. The effective reconnaissance drought index, which is a modification of the reconnaissance drought index, is suggested to enhance ability of the reconnaissance drought index to evaluate agricultural drought. The estimation of this index is based on two climatic variables which are the potential evapotranspiration (PET) and effective precipitation. The FAO Penman-Monteith method is considered the reference equation to evaluate the potential evapotranspiration; however, it is difficult to apply in regions with shortage weather data due to the requirement for a large number of climatic variables. Consequently, this research is applied Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, and Thornthwaite methods to assess the impact of the effective precipitation and potential evapotranspiration estimation methods, elevation, and climatic conditions on the effective reconnaissance drought index as well as investigating the correlation between the reconnaissance drought index and the effective reconnaissance drought index. Data from 13 weather stations, over the time interval between 1979 and 2014, cover different elevations, and weather environments within the Greater Zab River Basin, North Iraq, has been selected. The obtained results indicated that there is no important effect on drought severity assessment (at 100% of weather stations) were detected by using the considered potential evapotranspiration methods at different elevations for different climate conditions. However, there is a clear effect for different the effective precipitation and potential evapotranspiration techniques at diverse altitudes and climatic conditions on the aridity evaluation that is assessed by effective reconnaissance drought index (at about 50% of the considered stations). Consequently, concern has to be paid to the effective precipitation and potential evapotranspiration evaluation methods, particularly at high elevations; this is because applying a range of approaches may cause errors in the water resources availability predictions.

AB  - Integrated water resource planning is vital to develop the groundwater resources in a sustainable manner. The main focus of the present research work is to assess the healthy condition of aquifers for sustainable groundwater planning in Uppar Odai sub-basin in western part of Tamil Nadu. The sustainable groundwater aquifer zone should be sustainable in terms of potential, quality and water table conditions. Initially, the geology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, soil thickness, electrical resistivity, lineament density and rainfall pattern were integrated to create sustainable groundwater potential theme. In the next stage, the layers of eight major ions were integrated for groundwater quality for drinking. The irrigation parameters like salinity, SAR, Na %, RSC, specific ion toxicity and miscellaneous effects due to Cl- and NO3- were integrated for derive irrigation water quality index. Finally, the groundwater table conditions in the basin were assessed in terms of shallow, moderate and deep aquifer zones. All the four thematic maps were integrated to assess the sustainability state of aquifers. In this spatial integration, the themes were ranked as per importance in terms of sustainable contributions. The final integrated outputs have revealed that only 11% of the basin area is in the sustainable zone and remaining 89% of area is in slightly unsustainable-highly unsustainable zone which requires immediate restriction of the current rate of groundwater exploitation and protects the aquifer through artificial recharge to maintain the aquifer in sustainable environment. Based on the sustainable category, further groundwater developmental planning is suggested. The current state of groundwater development is recommended for sustainable zone. However, the groundwater development reduced for 10-50% for marginally unsustainable-unsustainable category. In the highly unsustainable zone, further groundwater development should be restricted and the quality-tolerant cropping pattern can be adopted.

AB  - The major factor in the induction of physiological stress during road transportation of livestock is the complex fluctuations of the thermal transport microenvironment, encountered when animals are transported across different ecological zones. Recommended guidelines on optimum "on-board" conditions in which goats should be transported are lacking, and there are no acceptable ranges and limits for the thermal loads to which goats may be subjected during long-distance road transportation in hot-dry conditions. Panting score (PS), rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) were employed as reliable stress indices to assess the effects of different thermal loads, measured as temperature humidity index (THI), encountered in the vehicle during 12 h of road transportation of 40 goats, and to suggest the administration of 100 mg/kg body weight of ascorbic acid (AA) as an ameliorating agent. The results obtained showed that the PS, RT, HR and RR rose above normal reference values with increase in the THI and journey duration. The rise in PS value, which is a visual indicator of the severity of thermal load, was the most pronounced. The results suggest that values of THI in the vehicle up to 94.6 constitute no risk, while at of 100 it presents a moderate risk and above 100 may result in severe stress. The relationships between the thermal load and the physiological variables were positive and significant (P < 0.05). They reflect the degree of stress imposed by each THI value during the transportation, and may be used as recommended ranges and limit thermal load values in transported goats. The results demonstrated that administration of 100 mg/kg body weight of AA before road transportation mitigated the risk of adverse effects of high THI values and other stress factors due to road transportation in goats.

AB  - The dwarf bulrush (Typha minima Funck ex Hoppe) is a characteristic alpine pioneer herb that occurs primarily along wild rivers. However, since the 1970s this indicator species has become locally extinct in Germany, and nearly so in Austria. Ongoing population declines are expected to be the result of wide spread river regulation and resulting alteration to key demographic processes. Thanks to the effort of reintroduction programs, T. minima can be found again along the Upper Drava River, Austria. In this paper we report on seed germination, growth, reproduction and the environmental preferences of T minima.
   Germination experiments revealed a very low mean germination rate of 15.6% with a range of 0-90%. Germination rates increased with higher temperatures, increased seed maturity and shorter seed bank periods. After seed storage for 480 hours no germination was observed. In monitored field populations at the Upper Drava, seedlings (height < 5 cm) were rarely found. Individuals at the young stage (height > 15 cm, only sterile shoots) accounted for the majority of basal area at about 62%. Individuals up to three years old developed only sterile shoots. Reproductive shoots developed after 9 years and the number of inflorescences increased with increasing age.
   An analysis of environmental conditions showed that T. minima was especially dependent on high soil moisture content, with an average of 39 Vol-% humidity. In 'addition, light conditions were also important for growth- declines in shoot density were found at > 50% canopy coverage by Salix shrubs.
   We conclude that 7'. minima populations are demographically sensitive during seed germination, and that modern range retractions are predominantly the result of river regulation and reduced morphodynamics that would normally create appropriate open patches for germinating seedlings.

AB  - Concern exists as to the status of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) in the Great Smoky Mountains, with evidence both for and against an unprecedented decline in radial growth during the past century. On the basis of a dendrological record from 1850 to 1998, our analyses support a decline in radial growth starting as early as the 1940s through to the 1970s; in the 1970s there was a reversal of this decline. In comparing trees near ridges ( 2000 m) with those in draws ( 1500 m), we found differences in the ( a) timing of the decline, (b) rate of decline, and ( c) homogeneity of the decline, with trees near ridges showing earlier, faster, and more homogeneous declines than trees in draws. We hypothesized that changes in climatic conditions and/or atmospheric pollutants, both of which changed beyond ranges of natural variability, were related to the observed decline in radial growth. In trees near ridges, up to 67.1% of changes in radial growth could be explained by a combination of climatic conditions (7.6%) and annual emissions of nitric oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) (an additional 59.5%). In trees from draws, up to 38.3% of the changes in radial growth could be explained by climatic conditions only. A conceptual model is presented, where trees in naturally acidic soils with low base saturation provide a sensitive signal for the changing nature of acidic pollutants, but trees in anthropogenically acidifying soils with an initially higher baser saturation provide a signal that is confounded by a transient increase of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the soil that results in a transient increase in radial growth.

AB  - In the last few years, it has been shown that multi-proxy data are recorded in speleothems and that these secondary deposits can be used to retrieve records of environmental evolution in extra-glacial continental conditions. The goal of many current research is to obtain a better understanding of the processes leading to the growth of these chemical sediments and to relate them to changes in environmental conditions. In the present research, the multi-proxy study of a well-laminated speleothem sample points out the interest of reflectance trend measurement as a water excess indicator. Results from stratigraphy, laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy, EPR spectrometry and reflectance imaging have been combined in order to get a better understanding of the environmental conditions pertaining during speleothem growth. Several parameters have been measured: (i) Mn2+ concentration evolution (shown to be linked to soil processes); (ii) linewidth Delta H+/- of the low field Mn2+ EPR line (linked to crystalline properties of the speleothem); (iii) intensities of the laser excited fluorescence (linked to organic matter content of calcite) and reflectance (linked to calcite porosity); (iv) wavelength lambda(peak) of the intensity maximum of laser excited fluorescence bands (linked to the size of trapped organic molecules), Other data resulting from statistical treatment of the annual fluorescence cycles have also been used. Significant correlations demonstrate the covariation of lambda(peak) and calcite reflectance with the hydrological regime of the cave. In the well drained soils of a karstic area, Mn2+ and lambda(peak) appear to be accurate proxies for soil moisture evolution, directly linked to the water excess. These results are confirmed by the comparison with historical knowledge of environmental changes of the surrounding plateau. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale Topiramate is an anticonvulsant currently under study for treating substance use disorders. Topiramate is thought to reduce substance use by attenuating craving and the rewarding effects of acute substance use through its concurrent GABAergic agonism and glutamatergic antagonism. Importantly, topiramate also impacts mood states central to many models of substance use. Despite this, little previous research has examined whether topiramate attenuates the respective associations of affect and craving with substance use. Objectives We conducted a secondary analysis of 63 youths that exhibited heavy cannabis use, aged 15-24 years, who were randomized in a double-blinded 6-week clinical trial comparing the effects of topiramate (up to 200 mg/day) and placebo on cannabis use. Ecological momentary assessment data were leveraged to model the role positive affect, negative affect, and craving on use over the 6-week period and whether topiramate attenuated associations between these feeling states and cannabis use. Results Findings showed that craving was positively associated with use at the within-person level, while positive affect was negatively associated with use at the between-person level. Topiramate appears to attenuate the negative association of between-person positive affect (i.e., average) and cannabis use. Specifically, those in the placebo condition exhibited this inverse association between average positive affect and use while those in topiramate condition did not. No other significant affect or affect x medication condition interactions were observed. Conclusions These findings implicate craving and low positive affect as important risk factors for cannabis use in youth in treatment. Topiramate may attenuate this association for positive affect.

AB  - Most water supply and hydropower generation is obtained from the river-reservoir system, and wastewater pollutants are also dumped into the system. Increasing water demand and consumption have caused the water supply, wastewater pollutant management and hydropower generation sectors to be interlinked and to reinforce each other in the system. A physical nexus across water supply, wastewater management and hydropower generation sectors for a river-reservoir system was developed based on the analytical water quality and hydropower generation equations. Considering the Jinghong hydropower reservoir, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Lancangjiang River Basin, as a case study, both the wastewater pollutant management target and water inflow from the upstream as the external and boundary conditions, were employed to establish the effects of the external and boundary conditions on the nexus. It was demonstrated that the nexus of water supply and hydropower generation sectors does not vary with the water quality indicators and its protection target, without the separation of environmental flow in hydropower generation flow. In addition, the amount of hydropower generation decreases with increasing water supply. However, the lapse rates of allowable wastewater pollutants-water supply differ based on the water inflow and the wastewater pollutant management sectors, while the efficiency of hydropower generation and the sensitivity of allowable wastewater pollutants per amount of water supply are considered to be unrelated to the water inflow and wastewater pollutant management target conditions. The quantitative nexus developed through the proposed equation not only contributes to a more complete understanding of the mechanism of cross-connections, but also in creation of specific water protection and utilization measures, which is also the focus of the water-energy nexus.

AB  - The use of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) has facilitated the development of non-invasive methods to study physiological conditions of endangered wildlife populations. One limitation is that fGCM concentrations are known to change over time and to vary according to different environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to perform a controlled dung decay experiment to understand the impact of time (since defecation) and two common environmental variables (exposure to water and direct sunlight) on fGCM concentrations of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Eighty dung piles from 10 Malaysian elephants were randomly exposed to a 2 x 2 combination of treatments (wet-shade, dry-shade, wet-sun and dry-sun) and repeatedly subsampled from the time of defecation through to 2 days post-defecation (n = 685 faecal subsamples). Overall, the mean concentration of fGCMs was stable in samples of up to 8 h old from defecation time, regardless of environmental treatment (water or direct sunlight); thereafter, the overall mean fGCM concentrations increased, peaking 1 day after defecation (31.8% higher than at defecation time), and subsequently decreased (reaching values 9.2% below defecation time on the second day). Overall, the treatment of sun exposure resulted in higher fGCM concentration compared with shade, whereas water exposure (compared with no water exposure) had no impact on fGCM concentrations. Hence, in field studies we recommend collecting dung samples < 8 h old and recording shade conditions (e.g. sun vs. shade) as a covariate for the subsequent interpretation of fGCM measurements. This study has helped to identify the optimal window for sampling in which we can have a higher confidence in interpreting the results as being a genuine reflection of glucocorticoid status in the elephant.

AB  - This study measured the movement of contaminants in the unsaturated zone of the subsurface from a low-flush on-site sanitation system (also known as an aqua-privy) at three sites in Ivory Park, which at the time that the fieldwork was done was a newly-established informal settlement in Johannesburg. The aim of the study was to provide field data on the movement of contaminants from this sanitation system in a low-income area, in these climatic and subsurface conditions, and to counter a perception that on-site sanitation will inevitably cause pollution. Subsurface conditions consisted nominally of a 1 m thick layer of silty sand with denser gravel at the bottom of it, underlain by a stiff sandy clay (residual granite), with the natural water table more than 15 m below ground surface. In summary, it can be deduced that movement in the unsaturated zone of bacterial indicators, nitrogen and phosphorus from low-flush on-site sanitation systems in low-income areas is very limited, as long as the effluent remains in the subsurface. More specifically, the impact in terms of COD appears to be negligible, with substantial treatment apparently taking place within the soakaway or within the immediate vicinity thereof. With respect to (i) bacteriological indicators, (ii) nitrogen (in the form of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate) and (iii) phosphorus (in the form of Total Phosphorus), using the distilled water washout technique, there is a very rapid drop-off of contamination with distance from the soakaway. At horizontal distances of 3 m from the soakaway, levels of the measured contaminants had dropped to values consistent with the background levels. The results of this study are not confined to this particular sanitation system. By virtue of the higher hydraulic loading, these results provide an upper bound for contaminant movement from dry on-site systems under similar conditions.

AB  - Global climate changes attract the attention of researchers working with paleoceanographic proxies for reconstructing past ocean circulation changes and the physico-chemical parameters that control environmental conditions Moreover recent studies highlight the importance of climate change on deep sea benthic biodiversity
   Deep sea benthic fauna are not isolated from atmospheric processes and climate changes controlling surface ocean biota for benthic assemblages respond to changing climatic conditions as well Substrate and physicochemical characteristics of bottom waters have particularly strong influence on ostracod species distribution in all marine settings making them excellent environmental indicators
   This paper focuses on changes in ostracod assemblages at MD99-2348 site located on the continental slope of the Gulf of Lions to determine the relationship between climatic driven oceanographic changes and ostracod diversity and abundance High abundances of Henryhowella asperrima and Echinocythereis echinata during Heinrich events (HE1 and HE2) may result from increased oxygenation of the bottom water and a more pulsed supply of nutrients (organic matter) Formation of surface cold water that increases the oxygen content in deep layers in the water column is linked to the intensification of northerly wind (Tramontane and Mistral) in northwestern Mediterranean during the acme of HEs when high latitudes bodies of cold air (Mobile Polar Highs) reach the Mediterranean area Moreover the concomitant high abundance of Krithe pernoides which proved to be very sensitive to variable oxygen levels probably records even shorter (millennial to centennial scale) climate oscillations

AB  - The relationship between artificial tidal restrictions and shellfish-water quality was studied within otherwise sparsely developed estuaries on Cape Cod (Massachusetts, USA). The primary study site, the 600-ha diked Herring River (Wellfleet, MA) estuary, has had a long history of shellfish-water closures because of water-column fecal-coliform (FC) contamination despite the lack of human fecal sources. Ongoing efforts to restore tidal flow to the system have raised questions about the effects on microbiological water-quality on extensive beds of wild oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and cultured hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) in the river mouth. This study combines observations of cur-rent spatial and temporal (tidal) patterns of water-column contamination with recent hydrodynamic modeling to predict the effects of proposed tidal restoration on shellfish-water quality. Under presently tide-restricted conditions, high FC is restricted to about 1000 in on either side of the dike structure and only during low tide, preventing the harvest of extensive natural oyster beds; farther downstream, hard-clam aquaculture is marginally protected by relatively coliform-free, high-salinity Cape Cod Bay waters. Modeling of Herring River under tide-restored conditions showed that a predicted 13-fold increase in river interfidal volume, over existing tide-restricted conditions, would dilute measured FC to concentrations that are acceptable for shellfish-growing waters. Restored tidal flow would also reduce coliform survival time by increasing salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH, all presently depressed throughout the system because of the biogeochemical disturbance of diking and drainage. Results from Herring River, plus a preliminary survey of other diked Cape Cod estuaries, suggest a direct relationship between the degree of tidal restriction and surface-water FC, which should be studied further.

AB  - Sediment cores collected in a coastal lagoon a few kilometres cast of Wairoa, northern Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, were examined using sedimentological, geochemical, palynological and micropaleontological analyses. A distinct short-lived catastrophic saltwater inundation (CSI) about 6300 years BP and possibly other minor marine incursions are preserved in the coastal estuarine to lagoonal freshwater sedimentary sequences, which have been deposited in the last 6500 years. The CSI is characterised by a gravel unit that thins landward and decreases in particle size to sand, within a sequence consisting mainly of brackish estuarine muds. Diatom assemblages indicate a marked change from the shallow brackish estuarine muds to marine gravels and sands to brackish estuarine muds. The marine influence in the gravel and sand is also shown by the presence of marine dinoftagellates and a peak in Na/Rb. Sedimentological, chemical and paleontological (in particular diatoms) evidence indicates it is a CSI. We conclude that this was a tsunami and propose the most likely propagating mechanisms. Marine influence decreases upcore and totally freshwater conditions are evident in the upper section of the cores. The geochemistry of the sediments mainly reflects the change in stratigraphy, with distinct signatures for tephra (Na, Fe, Cr), organic-rich and peat units (As, Br) and the coarse gravel-sand CSI unit (Na/Rb, Cr, Fe), but it is also indicative of changes in depositional environment, The change in chemistry (Na/Rb) in the CSI event is indicative of a saltwater influence, whereas a marked change in S content suggests a sudden change from brackish to freshwater conditions shortly after 4800 years BP. Another peak in S and Br content about 3200 years BP may indicate another temporary change to brackish conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-year study was done to determine herbaceous biomass production and its utilization by herbivores in an arid zone inhabited by a largely nomadic population in northern Kenya. The indicator selected for study was aboveground live standing biomass of grasses, forbs, dwarf shrubs and the total sum biomass of these vegetation categories (total herbaceous layer). Sampling was done along grazing gradients in order to estimate the utilization levels in the arid zone 7 and the semi-arid zone 6. Mean peak standing biomass for grasses, forbs, dwarf shrubs and total herbaceous layer under non-grazed conditions was 184.4, 374.2, 1094.4 and 1504.0 kg/ha in eco-zone 7, respectively. in the zone 6, mean peak standing biomass was 55.3, 98.8, 4259.1 and 4320.1 kg/ha under non-grazed conditions, respectively. Results indicated graminoid removal to be respectively 57.1-99.8% and 24.2-87.2% of mean peak standing aboveground live biomass in the zone 7 and 6. Forb utilization in zone 7 was estimated to be 51.5-99.3%. Mean peak forb standing biomass however, showed a general increase on grazed sites compared to the non-grazed plot in zone 6. The corresponding utilization of the dwarf shrub layer was estimated to be in the range 40.5-80.0% and 76.6-92.3% in zone 7 and 6 respectively. Total herbaceous layer consumption of 39.3-85.3% and 74.0-90% was estimated for zone 7 and 6 respectively. These findings suggest that herbivores exert considerable control over biomass dynamics of the herbaceous layer in this zone and contribute to degradation in heavily utilised areas. Efforts to understand and tackle the desertification problem in this area must therefore take this fact into account. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, one of the urgent issues for the Russian economy is to create conditions for the expansion of "smart" companies in the regions on which depend on the society transition to a new type of technological structure, innovative development and the country's competitiveness. The hypothesis of the study is that some regions are more predisposed to the appearance of "smart" companies on their territories, while others do not have the appropriate conditions for developing innovative and digital technologies. To prove this hypothesis, the article reveals the concept of a regional 3D model of a "smart" company and offers a methodology for assessing regions' predisposition to the emergence of such organizations. A special feature of the author's methodology is an integrated indicator which is the result of the synthesis of graphical and analytical evaluation methods. The methodology allows identifying territories with favorable conditions for expansion of organizational ambidextrity, innovative development and companies' digitalization. It was tested in Russia's regions in 2010-2017. As a result, the paper has identified the typology of regions according to five criteria reflecting the predisposition to the emergence of "smart" companies, and has built their rating. The approbation of the author's methodological developments allowed establishing that industrially developed regions can be considered digitalization poles. The work shows that the Ural Federal District acts as a stable basis for the emergence and successful functioning of "smart" companies, as all its entities, except the Kurgan Oblast, fall into the top twenty territories favorable for their development. This pattern is not typical for other federal districts. In conclusion, the authors have determined principal development trajectories of the main elements of the 3D model of a "smart" company at the meso-economic research level in the following areas: "smart" personnel, "smart" environment, "smart" innovations and solutions.

AB  - The Altman model is still one of the most widely used predictive models in the 21st century, and it aims to highlight the differences between bankrupt and healthy enterprises. This model has been modified several times; its most well-known forms are from 1968, 1983 and 1995. However, the use of the Altman Z-score for Slovak enterprises is more than questionable. The unsuitability of the model for the conditions of Slovak companies has been confirmed by several empirical surveys. The objective of this study was to verify the validation of these three variants of the Altman model, depending on how an unprosperous company is identified, using a sample of 996 agricultural enterprises operating in the Slovak Republic. Four indicators were selected for the identification of an unprosperous enterprise - economic results, total liquidity, equity, and economic value added - and they were monitored over the last year or, as the case may be, over the last three years from 2014 to 2016. Using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Coefficient of variation (CV) methods as an objective method for weight determination, a combination of the Altman model from 1968 and the negative total liquidity in the last reference year was determined to be the best. One of our main findings is that the way in which an unprosperous enterprise is identified is a significant factor affecting the overall reliability of the Altman model. The Altman model from 1968 and 1983 confirmed the differences resulting from the natural conditions in which the enterprises operate. The economic results and economic value added (EVA) proved to be inappropriate as indicators for defining an unprosperous enterprise in the conditions of the Slovak Republic.

AB  - Characteristics of soil erosion under extreme rainfall conditions are indicators of the ecological restoration measures as well as the rationality of land use patterns in the region. To this end, 12 dam-controlled catchments were selected for investigation after an extreme rainstorm event in the northern Shaanxi Province on 25-26 July 2017 (known as the "7.26" rainstorm). Soil erosion intensities in the 12 catchments were obtained by excavations of sedimentation profiles and sedimentation area measurements. Digital orthophoto maps and digital terrain models by unmanned aerial vehicle were generated to characterise land use types and areas, slope gradients, and the distance from the land to the boundary of dam-land along the flow accumulation path. Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the main factors affecting catchment erosion intensity. Results showed that the average sedimentation thickness and overall soil erosion intensity across the 12 catchments ranged from 0.16 to 1.67 m and 10295-49227 t km(-2), respectively. Soil erosion caused by the extreme rainstorm was 10-50 times of the soil loss tolerance on the Loess Plateau (1000 t km(-2) year(-1)). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the more similar the shape of a catchment to a circle, the closer the distance between the slope-cropland and dam-land, the larger the erosion modulus within the catchment. Furthermore, the presence of a cement road along the valley shoulder greatly reduced the modulus of soil erosion. These findings indicate that the existing ecological conditions in the dam-controlled catchments were not able to effectively resist erosion under the extreme rainfall conditions of this event. Thus, optimising the distribution of land use types within catchments should be a focus for soil erosion control.

AB  - The Middle Jurassic rocks of the Kaladongar Formation well exposed in the Kaladongar Hill range of the Patcham Island and Kuar Bet of the Northern Kachchh comprises of similar to 450 m thick sequence of mixed siliciclasticcarbonate sediments intercalated with shales. These Mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sediments show wide variation in textural and mineralogical composition and represent genetically related six rock types: micritic sandstone, allochemic sandstone, sandy allochemic limestone, micrtic mudrock, sandy micrite and muddy micrite; which are highly bioturbated and show behaviourally diverse groups of trace fossils. Total 34 ichnogenera are identified, which includes, Arenicolites, Asterosoma, Beaconites, Bergaueria, Chondrites, Cochlichnus, Dactylophycus, Daedalus, Didymaulichnus, Diplocraterion, Gordia, Gyrochorte, Gyrolithes, Ichnocumulus, Laevicyclus, Lockeia, Margaritichnus, Monocraterion, Nereites, Ophiomorpha, Palaeophycus, Phoebichnus, Phycodes, Pilichnus, Planolites, Plug Shaped Form, Protovirgularia, Rhizocorallium, Scolicia, Skolithos, Taenidium, Teichichnus, Thalassinoides and Walcottia. These trace fossils are classified into six morphological groups namely, circular and elliptical structures; simple structures; branched structures; rosette structures; spreiten structures; and winding and meandering structures. These trace fossils are further group into eight assemblages which occurred together into mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sediments, include, Asterosoma assemblage, Gyrochorte assemblage, Rhizocorallium assemblage, Thalassinoides assemblage, Planolites-Palaeophycus assemblage, Phycodes assemblage, Ophiomorpha assemblage and Skolithos assemblage. The recurring pattern of these assemblages through the sequence displays the development of Skolithos and Cruziana ichnofacies and at places the mixed Skolithos-Cruziana ichnofacies which suggest a low wave and current energy conditions with intervening period of high wave and current energy conditions and an intermediate period of stressful environments, respectively. Sedimentological and ichnological data suggest that the deposition of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sediments of the Kaladongar Formation took place in the foreshore to offshore environment under fluctuating wave and current energy condition.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Aquaculture is about farming aquatic animals in certain facilities, in order to meet the global demand for aquatic animal products. However, reproduction and raising of all commercially important aquatic animals under farming conditions are not always feasible or cost-effective. Thus, for some fish and shellfish species, a system that relies on the collection of wild individuals, at various life stages and rearing in controlled facilities, has been employed. These animals, however, are not products of a lengthy domestication process and thus are not used to the artificial environment of the fish farms. The way they respond to the various stressful conditions might be different, compared to the domesticated fish. Therefore, we have to make sure that we use the appropriate rearing methods, for the entire time, so that their impact on the fish welfare is minimized. Apart from the moral obligations, this will also increase the profitability of the activity.
   Capture-based aquaculture (CBA) represents a type of intensive aquaculture production system for some economically valuable fish species, such as bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), eel (Anguilla spp.) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). In CBA, fish are captured from the wild in certain periods of the year, and following a recovery phase, they are kept in rearing facilities for a period of time, until they reach the market size. In this case, the fish are wild and have not gone through domestication like other fish species that are reproduced and farmed under the established farming systems. Therefore, these fish are not genetically adapted to live under the intensive farming conditions, and thus their welfare may be compromised in different manners compared to their domesticated counterparts. This review presents an overview of the current situation of CBA, while focusing on the assessment of fish welfare in CBA. The most commonly used fish welfare indicators will be discussed in relation to the different stages of CBA.

AB  - In tropical landscapes, forest remnants have been reduced to narrow strips of vegetation along rivers and streams surrounded by agricultural land that affects biodiversity, depending on the habitat and landscape characteristics. To assess the effect of riparian forest loss on the diversity of Staphylininae predatory rove beetles, we considered two habitat conditions (river sites with riparian vegetation and sites with heterogeneous pastures) within two micro-basin types (with 70% and <40% forest cover) in a tropical montane cloud forest landscape, Mexico. Beetles were collected using baited pitfall traps during the rainy season of 2014. No differences were found between micro-basin types and, although species richness (D-0) was similar between habitat conditions, when the diversity of common (D-1) and dominant (D-2) species was considered, sites with heterogeneous pastures were almost twice as diverse as those with riparian vegetation. All diversity measurements were greater in sites with heterogeneous pastures of either micro-basin type. Air temperature and canopy cover were the environmental variables that best explained the variation in beetle species composition. The greatest environmental differences related to species composition were detected between habitat conditions and were more evident in sites with heterogeneous pastures and low forest cover in the surroundings. The results suggest that replacing riparian vegetation with heterogeneous pastures, within micro-basins that lost between 30% and 60% of their forest cover, does not significantly reduce the diversity of predatory rove beetle but rather modifies the beetle composition. Effective formulation of management strategies to mitigate the impact of land use modification therefore requires an understanding of the interaction between vegetation remnants and landscape characteristics.

AB  - Lagoons provide critical habitats for many fishes, including coregonine whitefishes, which are a mainstay in many subsistence fisheries of rural communities in Arctic Alaska. Despite their importance, little is known about the overwintering habits of whitefishes in Arctic Alaska due to the challenges associated with sampling during winter. We developed a habitat suitability (HS) model to understand the potential range of physical conditions that whitefishes experience during the Arctic winter, using three indicator lagoons that represent a range of environmental characteristics. The HS model was built using a three-step approach. First, remote sensing that uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) identified areas of floating and bottomfast ice. Second, through in-field ground-truthing, we confirmed the presence and quality of liquid water (water depth, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) beneath the ice cover. Third, we assessed the suitability of that liquid water as habitat for whitefishes based on published literature and expert interpretation of water quality parameters. InSAR determined that 0, 65.4, and 88.2% of the three lagoons were composed of floating ice corresponding with areas of liquid water beneath a layer of ice. The HS model indicated that all three lagoons had reduced suitability as whitefish habitat in winter than in summer due to the loss of habitat because of the presence of bottomfast ice and a reduction in the quality of liquid water due to cold temperatures, high salinities, and low dissolved oxygen levels. However, only the shallowest lagoon had lethal conditions and zero suitability as whitefish habitat. The methods outlined here provide a simple, cost-effective method to identify habitats that consistently provide critical winter habitat and integrate remote sensing in a HS model framework.

AB  - The reliance on reservoirs to meet global water demands is increasing, as is the need to develop an understanding of factors influencing water quality in these understudied water bodies. This study assessed how the interaction between light and nutrients influences phytoplanlcton dynamics in a large, heterogeneous prairie reservoir; Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan. A multiple indicator assessment of factors (light, phosphorus [P], and nitrogen [N]) influencing phytoplanlcton biomass, physiology, and gross primary productivity (GPP) was conducted. Light deficiency was assessed through the application of an indicator threshold for the mean daily mixed layer irradiance as well as the ratio of this irradiance to the light saturation parameter derived from photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Short-term physiological assays and long-term compositional nutrient status indicators were applied to assess the in situ nutrient deficiency of the epilimnetic phytoplankton communities. We observed regional differences in light conditions and nutrient chemistry related to incoming flow and nutrient load from the South Saskatchewan River. Light deficiency was detected 59% of the times measured during the open-water season of 2013. Both GPP and quantum efficiency of photosystem II (phi(PSII)) were relatively high (108 +/- 101 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) and 0.57 +/- 0.07, respectively) across all regions and months. During conditions of light sufficiency, there was no evidence of N deficiency, and P was the limiting nutrient to phytoplankton communities 90% of the times measured. Nutrient use efficiency and GPP rates were significantly higher under light sufficient conditions. The asynchrony of light and nutrient supply influences production and biomass accrual in this reservoir.

AB  - This paper deals with optimization of coal combustion conditions to support selection a sustainable combustion technology and an optimal furnace and boiler design. A methodology for optimization of coal combustion conditions is proposed and demonstrated on the example of Bosnian coals. The properties of Bosnian coals vary widely from one coal basin to the next, even between coal mines within the same basin. Very high percentage of ash (particularly in Bosnian brown coal) makes clear certain differences between Bosnian coal types and other world coal types, providing a strong argument for investigating specific problems related to the combustion of Bosnian coals, as well as ways to improve their combustion behaviour.
   In this work, options of the referent energy system (boiler) with different process temperatures, corresponding to the different combustion technologies; pulverised fuel combustion (slag tap or dry bottom furnace) and fluidized bed combustion, are under consideration for the coals tested. Sustainability assessment, based on calculation economic and environment indicators, in combination with common low cost planning method, is used for the optimization. The total costs in the lifetime are presented by General index of total costs, calculated on the base of agglomeration of basic economic indicators and the economic indicators derived from environmental indicators. So, proposed methodology is based on identification of those combustion technologies and combustion conditions for coals tested for which the total costs in lifetime of the system under consideration are lowest, provided that all environmental issues of the energy system is fulfilled during the lifetime. Inputs for calculation of the sustainability indicators are provided by the measurements on an experimental furnace with possibility of infinite variation of process temperature, supported by good praxis from the power plants which use the fuels tested and by thermal calculations of the different options (different temperature in the boiler furnace) of the referent energy system.

AB  - Early detection is critical to successfully eradicating a variety of cancers, so the development of a new cancer primary screening system is essential. Herein, we report an animal nose sensor system for the potential primary screening of lung cancer. To establish this, we developed an odor discrimination training device based on operant conditioning paradigms for detection of toluene, an odor indicator component of lung cancer. The rats (N = 15) were trained to jump onto a floating ledge in response to toluene-spiked breath samples. Twelve rats among 15 trained rats reached performance criterion in 12 consecutive successful tests within a given set, or over 12 sets, with a success rate of over 90%. Through a total of 1934 tests, the trained rats (N = 3) showed excellent performance for toluene detection with 82% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 80% positive predictive value (PPV) and 83% negative predictive value (NPV). The animals also acquired considerable performance for odor discrimination even in rigorous tests, validating odor specificity. Since environmental and long-term stability are important factors that can influence the sensing results, the performance of the trained rats was studied under specified temperature (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and humidity (30%, 45%, and 60% RH) conditions, and monitored over a period of 45 days. At given conditions of temperature and humidity, the animal sensors showed an average accuracy within a deviation range of +/- 10%, indicating the excellent environmental stability of the detection rats. Surprisingly, the trained rats did not differ in retention of last odor discrimination when tested 45 days after training, denoting that the rats' memory for trained odor is still available over a long period of time. When taken together, these results indicate that our odor discrimination training system can be useful for non-invasive breath testing and potential primary screening of lung cancer.

AB  - Heat stress studies are often conducted using controlled laboratory exposures or field exposures. Each approach has limitations and provides a partial understanding of complex interactions between simultaneous environmental stressors. The question is how similar the responses are in each situation. Several physiological measures of thermal status were used to compare heat stress responses of cattle in controlled chamber stress tests and fluctuating field conditions. Angus steers (N=23; 318 +/- 8 kg BW) were first placed on either endophyte-infected or -uninfected tall fescue pastures for the field exposure, followed by a controlled heat challenge, which exacerbates the condition known as fescue toxicosis. During the controlled heat challenge, steers were assigned to diets of either 0 or 40 mu g ergovaline/kg/d to maintain the treatment states. Respiration rate (RR) was measured via flank counting and telemetric temperature transmitters in the rumen of each animal monitored core temperature (T-rum). Linear regression fit models for RR, T-rum, and air temperature (T-a) were utilized to compare relationships between field and chamber exposure. Correlation coefficients for RR were similar during both chamber (R = 0.69) and field exposures (R = 0.72). Respiration rate showed greater responsiveness to change in T-a under field conditions having twice the slope (4.40 versus 1.75 bpm/degrees C) and a lower Y-intercept (-42.14 versus +30.97 bpm) compared to the chamber run. Ruminal temperature was consistent between exposures showing a similar slope (0.04 versus 0.03 degrees C T-rum/degrees C T-a) and Y-intercept (38.40 versus 39.30 degrees C) for its relationship with T-a. Despite respiration rate being the more sensitive indicator of heat stress, ruminal temperature proved to be the most consistent between environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The spread of viral and microbial agents is active in Pig-breeding units. Due to illness, animals lose their productivity, which can affect the economy of the enterprise. The purpose of our experiment was to conduct an experimental study of the use of the Triazavirin antiviral medication on piglets in conditions of group administration at the pig-breeding unit and to assess the long-term effects of administering the medication.
   Methods: The experiment involved 30 heads of piglets. Upon admission, groups were formed taking into account the condition and age of the animals. Piglets with lesions of the respiratory system and with obvious clinical signs were selected for the experiment. In the first experimental group, experimental piglets received the Triazavirin antiviral medication. In the 2nd (control) group, the experimental animals were not subject to any treatment. In the 3rd experimental group, Tylosin-50 antibacterial medication was used for the treatment of animals. During the experiment, clinical studies and blood tests (biochemical, immunological, hormonal tests) were carried out.
   Result: When piglets were given the Triazavirin medication, they demonstrated a stable average daily weight gain and the highest percentage of meat yield. When analyzing the biochemical parameters of animals in the first experimental group, stabilization of several indicators was noted (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation coefficient). In the case of Triazavirin administration, there was an increase in the level of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine, a decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone, and cortisol.
   Conclusion: Based on the results of clinical studies, the authors recommend using the Triazavirin medication as part of complex and etiological therapy in the treatment of the respiratory system of pigs affected with diseases of a viral nature.

AB  - Molecular techniques have been increasingly used in a conservation physiology framework to provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying responses of wild organisms to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In the present study, we developed a reference gill transcriptome for walleye (Sander vitreus), allowing us to pair a gene-suite approach (i.e. multiple genes across multiple cellular processes) with multivariate statistics to examine the physiological status of wild-caught walleye. For molecular analyses of wild fish, the gill is a useful target for conservation studies, not only because of its importance as an indicator of the physiological status of fish but also because it can be biopsied non-lethally. Walleye were non-lethally sampled following short- (similar to 1.5 months) and long-term (similar to 3.5 months) confinement in the Delta Marsh, which is located south of Lake Manitoba in Manitoba, Canada. Large-bodied walleye are confined in the Delta Marsh from late April to early August by exclusion screens used to protect the marsh from invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio), exposing fish to potentially stressful water quality conditions. Principal components analysis revealed patterns of transcript abundance consistent with exposure of fish to increasingly high temperature and low oxygen conditions with longer holding in the marsh. For example, longer-term confinement in the marsh was associated with increases in the mRNA levels of heat shock proteins and a shift in the mRNA abundance of aerobic to anaerobic metabolic genes. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that walleye confined in the Delta Marsh may be exhibiting sub-lethal responses to high temperature and low oxygen conditions. These results provide valuable information for managers invested in mediating impacts to a local species of conservation concern. More broadly, we highlight the usefulness of pairing transcriptomic techniques with multivariate statistics to address potential confounding factors that can affect measured physiological responses of wild-caught fish.

AB  - The application of partial denitrification coupling with anammox (PD/A) in municipal sewage treatment is one of the most promising research field, and it has just begun. In 548 days of experiment treating real domestic sewage, the continuous flow reactor was started up by adding biocarriers containing anammox bacteria and operated stably after acclimatization. The PD/A was successfully achieved in the step-feed AO system. Furthermore, mass balance of ammonium revealed that anammox could contribute 32-47% to nitrogen loss. Compared with no biocarriers addition phase, the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) increased to 77.8 +/- 4.3% and the effluent total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) decreased to 11.0 +/- 2.1 mg/L at the COD/TIN ratio of 2.9 from day 428 to day 548 under the condition of anammox biocarriers addition and without external carbon source. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that anammox bacteria on the biological carrier accounted for 3.06% of the total bacteria in the stable phase, which was much higher than the reported <0.003% in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). After 247 days of operation with anammox biocarriers addition, the abundance of anammox bacteria on the carriers tended to be stable at 3.36 x 10(10) gene copies g(-1) dry sludge. The activity of anammox decreased and maintained at 13.14 g NH4+-N m(3) d(-1) under the biocarriers-only condition, while increased from 11.71 g NH4+-N m(3) d(-1) to 25.65 g NH4+-N m(3) d(-1) in the hybrid condition of biocarriers and flocs. This study indicated that PD/A is effective to strengthen nitrogen removal with low COD/TIN ratio.

AB  - The paper reveals the study results on soft winter wheat varieties of the V.M. Remeslo Myronivka Institute of Wheat of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the Institute of Plant Physiology and Genetics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The findings demonstrate the dependence of grain formation in the first generation of interspecific hybrids of soft winter wheat on the environmental factors and on wheat-rye translocations 1AL.1RS and 1BL.1RS in the parental forms. The results of the analysis of variance show that in the field, the efficiency of crossing and the percentage of grain formation significantly depended on the interaction of factors (47.9%, p <= 0.05), weather conditions (32.2%), and the variety genotype (19. 6%) and did not depend significantly (0.3%) on unaccounted factors (the coincidence of flowering dates of the components involved in hybridization). In the crosses 1BL.1RS / 1BL.1RS, the average percentage of grain formation was the highest for three years (2016-2018) and did not differ significantly -50.1%; 55.5%, and 49.8%. In unfavorable 2019, it was ranked second. The maximum average indicators for the research years (48.3%) and under favorable weather conditions of 2017 (68.3%) were obtained using the crosses of the variety of Svitanok myronivskyi 1BL.1RS as a parent form, and the minimum (37.1 % and 45.2%, respectively) - using the variety of Kalynova 1BL.1RS. The results of the study show that hybrid combinations of Svitanok myronivskyi / Kalynova (56.1%), Lehenda myronivska / Kalynova (54.6%), Zolotokolosa / Svitanok myronivskyi (53.3%), Lehenda myronivska / Ekspromt (52.4%), Kolumbia / Zolotokolosa (48.1%), Svitanok myronivskyi / Lehenda myronivska (47.6%) and Svitanok myronivskyi / Zolotokolosa (46.4%) were the best in terms of the average percentage of grains formation for the research years.

AB  - Nearly half of all cases of foodborne illness are associated with plant-based foods such as leafy greens and raw flour. An important potential source of pathogen contamination along the food-production continuum is irrigation water, which has led to the implementation of increasingly stringent agricultural irrigation water quality requirements. To better understand factors impacting irrigation water quality, we investigated sources of generic Escherichia coli and how they varied temporally among different sampling sites. Precipitation, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality parameters were also investigated to substantiate microbial source tracking findings. Biweekly sampling was conducted at a reservoir outlet and two downstream canals in southern Alberta, Canada, throughout two irrigation seasons, the latter of which was notable for drought conditions. Overall, 50% of canal samples exceeded Alberta's irrigation guideline for E. coli (100 E. coli per 100 ml), whereas all reservoir samples were below guideline limits. Collectively, E. coli source apportionment, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality data suggest runoff from surrounding agricultural land was a contributing factor to E. coli guideline exceedances in Year 1 only. In Year 2, the majority of exceedances occurred later in the season when there was little precipitation and were largely attributed to cosmopolitan E. coli from wild birds and cattle. Similarities in E. coli host-source and Campylobacter species distributions between the reservoir and canals when the guideline was exceeded suggest the reservoir could be a primary source of E. coil during drought. Increased bacterial concentrations in canals were likely due to environmental conditions that promoted bacterial survival and in-situ proliferation. Our findings support previous accounts that many E. coli isolates possess enhanced survival capabilities, which has implications to bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation, particularly under drought conditions.

AB  - Brines can have a profound influence on the relative abundance of calcareous and agglutinated foraminiferal faunas. Here we investigated the distribution of benthic foraminiferal species in four cores from a brine-enriched environment in Storfjorden, Svalbard. Stratigraphically, the cores comprise the last 15000 years. The purpose of the study was to reconstruct changes in the palaeoecology and palaeoceanography of Storfjorden in relation to past climate changes, and to identify potential indicator species for brine-affected environments. The benthic foraminifera in Storfjorden all have widespread occurrences in the Arctic realm. Calcareous species dominated Storfjorden during the deglaciation and early Holocene until c.8200a BP. However, agglutinated species increased in abundance whenever conditions became colder with more sea ice and stronger brine formation, such as during the Older Dryas, the Intra-AllerOd Cold Period and the Younger Dryas. Following a moderately cold period with numerous agglutinated foraminifera from c.8200-4000a BP, conditions became more changeable from c.4000a BP with repeated shifts between warmer periods dominated by calcareous species and colder periods dominated by agglutinated species. The warmer periods show a stronger influence of Atlantic Water, with reduced brine formation and less corrosive conditions at the sea bottom. Conversely, the colder periods show a stronger influence of Arctic water, with higher brine production and more corrosive bottom water. The distribution patterns of the calcareous species are basically the same whether calculated relative to the total fauna (including agglutinated specimens) or relative to calcareous specimens alone. Moreover, the patterns are similar to the patterns found elsewhere along western Svalbard in areas without the influence of brines. No particular species appear to be specifically linked to brine formation. However, the most persistent agglutinated species R.scorpiurus and A.glomerata are also the species most tolerant of the acidic bottom water that normally is associated with brine formation.

AB  - The balance between applied and harvested nitrogen (yield removed nitrogen, YRN %) is a recognized indicator of the risk of N leaching. In this study we monitored the genetic improvements and environmental variability as well as differences among crop species (spring cereals and rapeseed) in YRN in order to characterize changes that have occurred and environmental constraints associated with reducing N leaching into the environment. MTT long-term multi-location field experiments for spring cereals (Hordeum vulgare L., Avena sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L.), turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.), and oilseed rape (B. napus L.) were conducted in 1988-2008, covering each crop's main production regions. Yield (kg ha(-1)) was recorded and grain/seed nitrogen content (N(grain), g kg(-1)) analyzed. Total yield N (N(yield), kg ha(-1)) was determined and YRN (%) was calculated as a ratio between applied and harvested N. A mixed model was used to separate genetic and environmental effects. Year and location had marked effects on YRN and N(yield). Average early and/or late season precipitation was often most advantageous for N(yield) in cereals, while in dry seasons N uptake is likely restricted and in rainy seasons N leaching is often severe. Elevated temperatures during early and/or late growth phases had more consistent, negative impacts on YRN and/or N(yield) for all crops, except oilseed rape. In addition to substantial variability caused by the environment, it was evident that genetic improvements in YRN have taken place. Hence, YRN can be improved by cultivar selection and through favouring crops with high YRN such as oat in crop rotations.

AB  - The effectiveness of periodic turning as a method of aerating a pulp and paper mill sludge (PMS) produced by Australian Newsprint Mills during windrow composting was determined by monitoring spatial and temporal changes in O-2 consumption and CO2 accumulation in situ. Gas exchange during the static phase was found to be limited to the outer periphery of the windrow with interstitial O-2 being reduced to 0 to 2% in the pile centre between 2 and 6 hours after turning, indicating that the piles were oxygen starved for most of the trial, however, at no time was methane detected. The effectiveness of periodic turning in replenishing interstitial O-2 and eliminating CO2 decreased as composting progressed, due to an increase in bulk density which reduced the volume of voids participating in gas exchange. This was particularly evident when the bulk density of PMS increased to more than 550 kg m(-3). The volumetric quotient of CO2 produced to O-2 consumed in a given interstitial gas sample was found to be a better indicator of whether aerobic or anaerobic conditions were present, than simply considering the level of interstitial Or. An upward convective flow of gas existing in the PMS windrow during the static phase was not sufficient to maintain aerobic conditions within the pile. Periodic turning of PMS in static windrows was found to be ineffective in maintaining aerobic conditions, suggesting that a reduction in pile height, addition of a bulking agent to improve porosity and/or the installation of open-ended perforated plastic pipes could improve aeration during the static phase. Such measures are relatively inexpensive and would significantly reduce the time required to produce a stable compost.

AB  - Assessing impacts of climate change on ancient human societies requires accurate reconstructions of regional climate variations. However, due to the scarcity of in situ climate indicators in archaeological sites, climate interpretation often relies on indirect, geographically distant data from geological archives such as lake or ocean sediments, ice cores and speleothems. Because many cultural changes occurred abruptly over periods of years to decades, and are regional or even local in scale, correlating societal changes with climate reconstructions from geological archives induces significant uncertainties: factors such as chronological dating inconsistencies and geographic heterogeneity of climate can severely undermine interpretation. Here we show, for the first time, that it is possible to determine past climate change by analyzing bacteria-derived 'branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers' (br-GDGTs) in ancient bones from archaeological sites. To the best of our knowledge this proxy has never been applied before to bones, nor with the intention of developing the method for application in archaeological research. We demonstrate that these compounds are likely derived from bacterial growth within bones following deposition in the ground, and the potential for their distributions to reflect climate and environmental conditions during the years immediately following deposition when bacteria consume internal substrates. Our preliminary results show that bone samples from different climate zones display distinct br-GDGT distributions. Well-dated late Pleistocene and Holocene bones from Alaska yield reconstructed temperatures consistent with existing climate reconstructions. While further work is necessary to determine how quickly the signal stabilizes in the bones, and to continue ongoing refinement of calibrations for temperature, precipitation, and other influences on br-GDGTs, we propose that br-GDGTs from ancient bones in archaeological sites may be taken as a new, in situ archive for reconstructing past climate conditions. This opens new perspectives for assessing connections between climate variations and social transformations in the past.

AB  - Stichtite is a magnesium-chromium hydroxycarbonate mineral found in association with early Phanerozoic chromite-rich serpentinite rocks of Tasmania, Australia and Tehuitzingo, Mexico. Elemental analysis of stichtite shows a range of compositions within the Cr-Fe-Al hydrotalcite group, with compositional trends associated with each discrete serpentinite host body. Elemental and textural analysis of stichtite-associated chromite indicates that stichtite forms in fore-arc setting rocks through interaction of chromite and methane-rich serpentinizing fluids. The degree to which chromite is replaced by stichtite is inferred to correlate with the length of time that the host rocks spent within the "stichtite window." Carbon stable-isotope analyses of stichtite suggest carbon sourcing from marine kerogen with a minor marine carbonate component in some samples. The carbon and hydrogen stable isotope profile of stichtite ranges from the field of methane from active serpentinizing zones, to organic thermogenic methane. The association of the stichtite 2H polytype (nee barbertonite) with aragonite +/- antigorite suggests this is a higher pressure/temperature polytype of stichtite. Reaction completion textures, isotopic values, and qualitative mineral thermobarometric indicators indicate that stichtite forms during serpentinization of fore-arc setting rocks in a methane/H-2-rich environment within fluid conduits, ranging from low temperatures and pressures near the surface, to depths where pressure is up to 0.8-1.2 GPa and temperature is up to similar to 300 degrees C. These unique chemical, isotopic, and textural properties of stichtite from distinct serpentinite bodies likely record the duration of serpentinization at specific thermobarometric conditions, and provide a window into the conditions associated with a potentially habitable environment on early Earth and other bodies of the solar system.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the variation of several biomarkers in wild populations of Corbicula fluminea in relation to abiotic condition changes to identify environmental factors associated with increased stress in this species potentially leading to massive mortality events. The study was carried out from July to October in the freshwater tidal areas of the estuaries of Minho and Lima Rivers (NW Iberian Peninsula). Monthly, 7 biomarkers (biotransformation, energy production, anti-oxidant defenses and lipid peroxidation damages) were determined in C. fluminea and 17 abiotic parameters were determined in water or sediments in 4 sampling sites: M1, M2 and M3 in Minho (up = > downstream); and L in Lima estuaries. The results of biomarlcers were integrated using the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR), Index and also analysed in relation to environmental parameters by Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that July and August are particularly stressful months for the studied C. fluminea populations, especially at downstream sites; the increase of nutrients and ammonium water concentrations, water temperature and conductivity are major contributors for this increased stress; the biomarkers indicated that in July/August C. fluminea is exposed to oxidative stress inducers, environmental chemical contaminants biotransformed by esterases and glutathione S-transferase enzymes, and that organisms need additional energy to cope with the chemical and/or thermally-induced stress. The findings of the present study stress the importance of biomonitoring the health condition of C. fluminea because it may allow determining the likelihood of summer/post summer mortality syndrome in this species.

AB  - Intermediate product of biobutanol production, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) as an alternative fuel has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its potential to eliminate various production costs. In this work, neat acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) with a component volumetric ratio of 3:6:1, n-butanol, and neat diesel were studied in a preburn type constant volume chamber with optical access. The ambient temperature and oxygen ranged from 800 to 1200 K and 21% to 11%, respectively, covering both conventional and low temperature combustion (LTC) regimes. Time resolved images of the spray and natural flame luminosity (indicator of soot) were captured by a high speed camera coupled with a copper vapor laser beam. The images show that the flame lift-off length and liquid penetration of n-butanol and ABE are much longer and shorter, respectively, than that of diesel under all tested conditions. This results in a longer gap between the liquid spray and the flame in ABE and n-butanol combustion that provides more space and time for the droplets to evaporate and mix with the ambient air, which is expected to decrease the local equivalence ratio at the combustion region. Indeed, the natural flame luminosity of ABE and n-butanol is reduced significantly under all tested conditions compared to that of diesel. For all the tested fuels, especially ABE, the combustion duration decreases with the reduction of ambient temperature due to a stronger premixed combustion, while it increases with the reduction of oxygen concentration due to the dilution effect. Therefore, ABE has a high potential to reduce soot emissions when used in diesel engines, but it would also suffer from combustion phasing retardation like butanol under LTC conditions with high EGR.

AB  - Cortisol is an indicator of an animal's endocrine response to environmental changes. This study was designed to examine changes in hair cortisol levels produced in response to a change from indoor winter to summer grazing conditions in dairy cows. The study population comprised 83 dairy cows from three farms. Hair samples were obtained using clippers from the animal's forehead at the time points: 7 (P1), 40 (P2) and 70 days (P3) after the start of summer grazing. At these same time points, milk yield, milk fat and somatic cell count (SCC) and body condition score (BCS) were determined in each animal. No effects of farm were detected on these factors. However, hair cortisol levels increased from P1 to P2 (P<0.01) and then remained constant from P2 to P3 (P>0.05). Transfer from the valley farm to summer pastures and the change in environment and nutrition modified hair cortisol concentrations (estimated marginal means +/- standard error), which were 2.1 +/- 0.10, 2.9 +/- 0.17 and 2.6 +/- 0.13 pg/mg for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. In addition, during summer grazing we observed a reduction in milk yield, an increase in SCC and general worsening of BCS. No significant correlation was detected between hair cortisol level and the other factors considered except for fat-corrected milk (r=-0.144, P=0.025). The rise in hair cortisol levels observed during the first month of summer grazing may reflect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses related to the change from winter indoor to high mountain conditions, though the low cortisol levels detected suggest minimal involvement of this axis along with the well-being of the animals.

AB  - Introduction The aged population is increasing rapidly across the world and this is expected to continue. People living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) represent amongst the sickest and frailest cohort of the aged population, with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and complex comorbidities. Given the vulnerability of RACF residents and the demands on the system, there is a need to determine the extent that care is delivered in line with best practice ('appropriate care') in RACFs. There is also a recognition that systems should provide care that optimises quality of life (QoL), which includes support for physical and psychological well-being, independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and a caring external environment. The aims of Care Track Aged are to develop sets of indicators for appropriate care and processes of care for commonly managed conditions, and then assess the appropriateness of care delivered and QoL of residents in RACFs in Australia.
   Methods and analysis We will extract recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and, using expert review, convert these into sets of indicators for 15 common conditions and processes of care for people living in RACFs. We will recruit RACFs in three Australian states, and residents within these RACFs, using a stratified multistage sampling method. Experienced nurses, trained in the CateTtack Aged methods ('surveyors'), will review care records of recruited residents within a 1-month period in 2019 and 2020, and assess the care documented against the indicators of appropriate care. Surveyors will concurrently assess residents' QoL using validated questionnaires.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Macquarie University (5201800386). The research findings will be published in international and national journals and disseminated through conferences and presentations to interested stakeholder groups, including consumers, national agencies, healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers.

AB  - Oasis effect may have significant impacts on the crop water use in irrigated fields of extremely arid conditions. Studies on crop coefficients and its relevant influence factors are essential to accurately determine the irrigation scheduling under such conditions. A two-year experiment was conducted in an irrigated vineyard to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and its two components: evaporation (E) and crop transpiration (T), and to develop appropriate region-specific crop coefficients (K-c, K-cb) in arid Northwest China. The contributions of "oasis effect" to the relationships of both K-c and K-cb to canopy conductance (G(c)) and leaf area index (LAI) were investigated. Local values of K-c for evapotranspiration and crop transpiration (K-cb) were calculated using the field data and the dual-K-c approach. The daily ET ranged from 0.80 to 9.87 mm d(-1) and from 0.99 to 8.73 mm d(-1) in 2014 and 2015, respectively, with corresponding T/ET values amounting to approximately 58.4% and 55.1%. The locally averaged K-c values were 0.79, 1.31, and 1.08 during the initial, middle, and late growth stages, respectively, versus corresponding K-cb values of 0.17, 0.97, and 0.64. Arid advection accounted for 16.9 to 57.4% and from 1.4 to 49.0% of daily K-c during the two study periods. Both K-c and K-cb to LAI is a linear regression but to G(c) is an exponential one. LAI is a better indicator than G(c) when it is used to predict K-c and K-cb. These results will help growers to improve irrigation efficiency and quantify the contributions of individual factors to K-c and K-cb in such conditions.

AB  - Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanism to oxidize the reaction center chlorophyll, P700, in PSI, we researched the effects of partial pressure of O-2 (pO(2)) on photosynthetic characteristic parameters in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) leaves. Under low CO2 conditions, the oxidation of P700 was stimulated; however the decrease in pO(2) suppressed its oxidation. Electron fluxes in PSII [Y(II)] and PSI [Y(I)] showed pO(2)-dependence at low CO2 conditions. H+-consumption rate, estimated from Y(II) and CO2-fixation/photorespiration rates (JgH(+)), showed the positive curvature relationship with the dissipation rate of electrochromic shift signal (V (H) (+) ), which indicates H+-efflux rate from lumen to stroma in chloroplasts. Therefore, these electron fluxes contained, besides CO2-fixation/photorespiration-dependent electron fluxes, non-H+-consumption electron fluxes including Mehler-ascorbate peroxidase (MAP)-pathway. Y(I) that was larger than Y(II) surely implies the functioning of cyclic electron flow (CEF). Both MAP-pathway and CEF were suppressed at lower pO(2), with plastoquinone-pool reduced. That is, photorespiration prepares the redox-poise of photosynthetic electron transport system for CEF activity as an electron sink. Excess Y(II), [Delta Y(II)] giving the curvature relationship with V (H) (+) , and excess Y(I) [Delta CEF] giving the difference between Y(I) and Y(II) were used as an indicator of MAP-pathway and CEF activity, respectively. Although Delta Y(II) was negligible and did not show positive relationship to the oxidation-state of P700, Delta CEF showed positive linear relationship to the oxidation-state of P700. These facts indicate that CEF cooperatively with photorespiration regulates the redox-state of P700 to suppress the over-reduction in PSI under environmental stress conditions.

AB  - Changes in environmental conditions such as temperature, aeration, nutrient type and availability, and metabolite concentrations can significantly affect yeast performance during fermentation. Alterations in such factors serve to either exert or alleviate stress, thus affecting the overall stress response of the cells. This stress response causes significant changes in the cellular composition that may either directly or indirectly impact on fermentative performance. The effects of various environmental stresses on the cellular composition of the brewing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. uvarum (ATL 2036), in growing and nongrowing states were evaluated. Trehalose was observed to be a very sensitive and responsive compound to stress conditions. All of the stresses applied to the cells evoked a notable response in cellular trehalose content. This response altered depending on the cell growth phase and was related to the sensitivity of the cells to stress. Trehalose was found to be either hydrolyzed and presumably acting as a carbon source or synthesized and accumulated likely to function as a membrane stabilizer and protectant. The cellular trehalose content could be used as a stress indicator compound in this brewing yeast strain. Carbonation was evaluated to induce a stress response in non-growing yeast, indicating that the alleviation of dissolved CO2 in yeast handling is beneficial to cell vitality. The cellular protein content was also observed to possibly have a role in the stress response and tolerance of brewing yeast, particularly in the case of actively growing yeast where stress application led to large changes in the protein content of the cells. The glycogen content decreased in stressed yeast, presumably as it was used for metabolic energy to fuel the stress response.

AB  - The relevance of the research. The article is devoted to the problem of improving the technology of developing thin ore bodies as a reserve for increasing the production of metals. Its relevance is due to the growing deficit of rare and valuable metals, most of which are localized in deposits of the type under consideration.
   The aim of the experiment is to establish the relationship between the geomechanical conditions of the development of ore deposits and the parameters of the treatment works.
   Methodology. The research is based on a long-term industrial experiment at the Ishim field, carried out using geophysical monitoring methods.
   Results. The prospects of developing low-power deposits with relatively limited reserves are estimated. The article presents the result of the analysis of methods for controlling rock stresses depending on their properties and describes the mechanism of rock transition from an unbroken state to a broken state. A mathematical model for the phenomenon of self-jamming of structural blocks is formulated and a reference is given to the theory of rock destruction as a consequence of the internal deformation of elementary mineral particles in an anisotropic medium. The article explains the condition of the array preservation from destruction. The advantages of studying the stress of rocks by the values of elastic and residual deformations are described. The typification of methods for managing arrays by the criterion of the preservation of the earth's surface from destruction was made. The results of the use of monitoring methods during the full-scale development of the field are presented. The economic effect of the repayment of voids based on the regulation of stresses is determined.
   Conclusions. Rock deposits of metal ores have properties the use of which in underground mining can improve technical and economic indicators due to the rational management of natural and induced stresses during monitoring of mining operations using the methods of mining geophysics.

AB  - Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) could be transformed to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) under phosphorus (P) deficient conditions by various enzymes, among which alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) is regarded as the most important one. To better understand the different response of phytoplankton to DOP and the role of alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in phytoplankton growth in natural waters, the distribution of P, APA, and phytoplankton density were measured at 12 sites in Lake Taihu, China, in summer, autumn, and winter of 2016. In this study, 34.12% of DOP could be hydrolyzed, indicative of the high bioavailability of DOP in Lake Taihu, especially in Meiliang Bay. More than 70% of enzymatically hydrolyzed DOP came from alkaline phosphatase-hydrolyzed DOP, verifying that APA had a major role in hydrolyzing DOP to fulfill the DIP requirements of phytoplankton, and that phosphomonoesters were the main form of bioavailable DOP in Lake Taihu. Redundancy analysis implied a high capacity of DOP use may be important for species dominance under P-deficient conditions, but high APA expression is not equal to the high capacities of DOP utilization. In this study, phytoplankton density was significantly positive with bulk APA, algal APA and bacteria APA. APA, despite of its complex contributors, is able to increase the amount of bioavailable P for phytoplankton growth. Moreover, algal APA reflects the actual response of phytoplankton to available P under P-deficient conditions. Low algal APA means that other factors limit phytoplankton growth. Increased algal APA means that other limitations get alleviated and algae are in anxious demand for P. Therefore, this paper suggests that monitoring APA can be used as a supplementary indicator to reflect the actual demand for P of algal, thus to optimize the prediction of algal blooms.

AB  - Tricholoma matsutake (T. matsutake) growing in Tibet is very popular for its high economic and medicinal value, but fresh T. matsutake has an extremely short shelf life. The shelf life of T. matsutake is complex, influenced by product characteristics, surrounding environmental conditions, and spoilage development. The objective of this work was to study the quality characteristics of fresh T. matsutake during its shelf life period in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) conditions and establish its remaining shelf life prediction models in a cold chain. In this study, we measured and analyzed quality indicators of fresh T. matsutake, including hardness (cap, stipe), color, odor of sensory characteristics, pH, soluble solids content (SSC), and moisture content (MC) of physical and chemical characteristics under the temperature condition of 4 degrees C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The sensory evaluation results showed that the odor indicator in sensory characteristics was more sensitive to the freshness of T. matsutake. The changes of pH, SSC, and MC were divided into three periods to analyze the physiological changes of T. matsutake. The cap spread process could affect the changes of pH, SSC, and MC in period S-1, and they changed gradually in period S-2. In the period S-3, they changed complicatedly because of deterioration. The remaining shelf life prediction model of T. matsutake was established by the back propagation (BP) neural network method to quantify the relationship between the quality indicators and the remaining shelf life. The shelf life characteristics are complex, which were optimized by correlation analysis. Significant benefits of this work are anticipated on the transportation and preservation of fresh T. matsutake to the market and the reduction of its losses in the postharvest chain.

AB  - Cells maintain an osmotic pressure essential for growth and division, using organic compatible solutes and inorganic ions. Mg2+, which is the most abundant divalent cation in living cells, has not been considered an osmotically important solute. Here we show that under carbon limitation or dormancy native marine bacterial communities have a high cellular concentration of Mg2+ (370-940mM) and a low cellular concentration of Na+ (50-170mM). With input of organic carbon, the average cellular concentration of Mg2+ decreased 6-12-fold, whereas that of Na+ increased ca 3-4-fold. The concentration of chlorine, which was in the range of 330-1200mM, and was the only inorganic counterion of quantitative significance, balanced and followed changes in the concentration of Mg2+ + Na+. In an osmotically stable environment, like seawater, any major shift in bacterial osmolyte composition should be related to shifts in growth conditions, and replacing organic compatible solutes with inorganic solutes is presumably a favorable strategy when growing in carbon-limited condition. A high concentration of Mg2+ in cells may also serve to protect and stabilize macromolecules during periods of non-growth and dormancy. Our results suggest that Mg2+ has a major role as osmolyte in marine bacteria, and that the [Mg2+]/[Na+] ratio is related to its physiological condition and nutritional status. Bacterial degradation is a main sink for dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, and understanding the mechanisms limiting bacterial activity is therefore essential for understanding the oceanic C-cycle. The [Mg2+]/[Na+]-ratio in cells may provide a physiological proxy for the transitions between C-limited and mineral nutrient-limited bacterial growth in the ocean's surface layer.

AB  - The early Miocene Pedregoso Formation is one of the numerous formations rich in organic matter within the stratigraphic record of the Urumaco Trough, in the central area of the Falcon Basin. Due to its lithological characteristics and stratigraphic position, this formation is of great interest regarding the basin's petroliferous systems. The evaluation of various inorganic and organic geochemical parameters indicates that the organic matter is primarily of marine origin, deposited in a marine carbonate environment typical of reefal systems, under oxic-to-dysoxic conditions. The low variability in the TOC concentrations and in the distributions of the biomarkers extracted from the samples suggests that the paleoenvironmental conditions and the organic-matter supply remained approximately constant throughout the sedimentation of this unit. The Pedregoso type-II organic matter (marine origin) and initial organic richness value (similar to 1.8%) suggest that this unit has probably generated hydrocarbons within the Urumaco Trough. However, present-day thermal maturity parameters reveal that the Pedregoso organic matter is overmature (dry gas window), indicating that this unit is only capable to generate gas. In addition, the geothermal gradient, maturity parameters, and the maximum paleotemperature estimated in this study suggest that the Pedregoso Formation reached a maximum burial depth the similar to 6.5 km, consistent with the value obtained from data of stratigraphic thickness in the Urumaco Trough. This implies that the thermal anomaly that affected the basin during the Late Eocene-Early Miocene did not reach the central part of the basin, and therefore, the organic matter maturation in this unit is due to the sedimentary burial.

AB  - The turbo-expander system is utilized instead of the pressure regulator to avoid exergy destruction occurring in gas pressure reduction systems. However, due to the variation of natural gas input conditions such as mass flow rate, the sustainable performance of this technology is challenging. In this study, at first, the optimal system design of gas pressure reducing station equipped with radial expansion turbine is performed. It is based on economic and exergy analyses as well as considering geometric, fluid, thermodynamic constraints of components and the systematic constraints. To do so, detailed design models of main components including mean-line design model of radial turbine, mathematical model of heat exchanger and design model of fired heater are developed. Then, the annual proficiency of the optimal system in dynamic conditions was evaluated according to the strategies considered for having stable production. One of the solutions is to improve the turbine efficiency by adjusting the angle of nozzle blades regarding the changes in mass flow rate. Therefore, our developed mean-line off design model of the turbine is applied to adjust inlet guide vane angle in the off-design situation to improve continuous electricity generation. The results of the design section show that the exergy efficiency on this occasion can achieve up to a maximum of 40%. Compared with fix inlet guide vane (IGV), applying variable IGV improves efficiency of turbine up to 60% at off-design condition. The Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and payback period of selected optimal design are about 0.0236 $/kWh, and 4 years, respectively. It indicates that this technology could be the economic option compared to other power generation systems.

AB  - Sensitization to mites is a considerable factor in the development of allergic diseases. Because of its abundance, Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Tp) is the predominant storage mite found in home storage rooms, kitchens, and bakeries. Patients allergic to mites might exhibit a severely hypersensitive reaction upon ingesting Tp-contaminated food. The objective of this study was to investigate the rates of Tp contamination in commercial storage products from various areas, storage conditions, and environments in Taiwan. A specific antibody against Tyr p 3, the allergen on Tp, could be used as an indicator to monitor the contamination condition in storage foods. The microscopic mite examination, allergen detection by ELISA and cultured mite chemotaxis were used to evaluate the prevalence of T. putrescentiae contamination. Moreover, the IgE responses of patients allergic to mites were examined. We found that pet food and mushrooms were commonly contaminated with Tp, and this was validated through Tyr p 3 concentration and chemotaxis experiments. Tp contamination rates decreased significantly when samples were sealed and stored at a low temperature (< 4 degrees C), low relative humidity (RH < 60%), or for longer periods at a low temperature. The results of the clinical study indicated that the mites that elicited major positive IgE responses in allergic subjects were Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae. Thus, people who are sensitized to D. pteronyssinus or D. farinae might be at risk of a second anaphylactic reaction due to cross-reactivity upon ingestion of Tp-contaminated food. Accordingly, Tp contamination can be prevented by keeping food packages sealed and stored at a low temperature. This prevents the severe allergic reaction caused by the inadvertent ingestion of contaminated food-borne Tp.

AB  - Influences of environmental factors on transpiration are interactive. Sensitivities of transpiration responses to both evaporative demand and rainfall under contrasting soil water conditions constitute the physiological basis of the drought tolerance of trees. Such knowledge is practically significant for plantation management, especially for irrigation management. We therefore conducted a 6-year study on the transpiration of a poplar plantation in temperate China to elucidate the existence and pattern of the influence of the soil water over stand transpiration responses to (1) vapor pressure deficit (VPD), the major indicator of air dryness and (2) the rainfall, in terms of total amount and event size. The results showed that the response of plantation transpiration (E (c) ) to VPD was conditioned by soil moisture. There was a significant difference in the frequency distribution of maximum sap flux under contrasting soil relative extractable water. E (c) after rainfall of different sizes varied under similar VPD. The increasing occurrences of only large rainfall events led to enhanced total E (c) during the growing season, but prolonged rainless intervals did not lead to a continuous decrease of E (c) , suggesting appreciable supplements from the soil water were present to sustain transpiration. In addition, the balance of soil water between replenishment and extraction also conditioned the influence of rainfall over subsequent E (c) during the respective rainless intervals. Based on the E (c) responses to VPD and rainfall under different soil moisture levels, irrigation that directly replenishes the deep soil layers in order to alleviate water stress on transpiration during the small-rain event-dominated growing season is an effective and water-saving approach to guarantee trees survival during drought period.

AB  - Previous studies have analyzed the number and location of bird infections with human incidence of West Nile virus (WNV) as well as the effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors on WNV propagation. However, such associations require more quantitative analyses. This study is intended to quantitatively analyze the relationship in eight counties/independent cities in the northern Virginia, based on an integrated analysis of spatially explicit information on precipitation, land cover, infrastructure, and demographic data using Geographical Information Systems, remote sensing, and statistics. Results show that bird infections in years 2002-2003 were closely associated with low to medium level of impervious surface with certain percentage of canopy and precipitation. Environmental and socioeconomic factors such as percentages of impervious surface, canopy, senior population (65 and older), old houses, bird risk areas, and low-income population were important indicators of human WNV risk in 2002. Limited impervious surface with some canopy provides suitable habitats for WNV transmission, where bird-feeding mosquitoes can forage for blood meals from nesting/roosting birds. Certain socioeconomic conditions such as old houses were linked with human infections by providing favorable environmental conditions, i.e., mature trees with abundant canopy and settled storm sewer systems. It should be noted that the current results may be biased toward urban environments, where dead birds were more likely found, and because the sampling efforts for the bird mortality were rather based on local residents' reports than a designed random sampling method. This geospatial study contributes toward better targeting of WNV prevention within the study area. It also provides an example of how geospatial methods and variables may be used in understanding the ecology of human WNV risk for other areas. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Macroalgae are modular organisms that can express different morphologies depending on the environment to which they are exposed. Their growth under varying light, temperature, and nutrient regimes, interacting with disturbance factors such as herbivory and hydrodynamics, leads to particular morphological types. The present study illustrates the potential of using morphological variations of benthic modular and/or clonal organisms as indicators of the factors and processes influencing them in their particular location. The morphogenetic agent-based model SPREAD (spatially explicit reef algae dynamics) was used to determine the range of potential morphological types in 3 dominant macroalgal species (Halimeda tuna, H. opuntia, and a species of Dictyota) in the Florida Reef Tract. Simulations of growth under a range of light, nutrient, and disturbance conditions similarly found at inshore patch and offshore bank reefs led to 6 potential morphological types for H. tuna, 2 for H. opuntia, and 3 for a species of Dictyota. From these potential sets derived from the model, we observed that particular morphological types corresponded to the morphologies found in the 2 reef habitat types. The simulated conditions that led to the formation of these morphologies in the model were similar to the environmental conditions at these sites. In addition to relating combinations of environmental and disturbance factors to macroalgal growth morphologies, the present study provides insights into the differing life-history strategies among the species, and the adaptive value of plasticity expressed by these macroalgae. The morphologies of the successful fragmenters H. opuntia and a generalized species of Dictyota were more influenced by disturbance. On the other hand, the morphology of the less successful fragmenter H. tuna was strongly influenced by the growth factors of light and nutrients.

AB  - Chironomid and stratigraphic analyses of a lake sediment core recovered from a high-elevation lake in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, was undertaken to assess chironomid community development during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and to quantitatively reconstruct the thermal regime that existed during this interval. Between 14 800 cal yr BP and 13 700 cal yr BP the chironomid community consisted almost exclusively of Heterotrissocladius, suggesting this period was characterized by extremely cold climatic conditions. Evidence of post-glacial climatic amelioration, as manifested by increases in thermophilous chironomid taxa, head capsule concentrations, and taxon richness and diversity, commenced at approximately 13 300 cal yr BP. In order to quantify the magnitude of the water temperature changes associated with post-glacial climatic amelioration, a recently developed chironomid-based inference model for surface water temperature was applied to the subfossil chironomid assemblages. The one-component, weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) model has an r(jack)(2) =0.72 RMSEPjack = 1.1degreesC and a maximum bias of 1.24degreesC. The reconstructed surface water temperatures suggest a minimum warming of approximately 4.7degreesC occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. However, warming during this interval may not have been monotonic. Evidence of the Younger Dryas has been previously discovered in the study area and adjacent regions; Our research indicates that changes in chironomid community composition and an inferred short-term cooling event occurred between 12 000 cal yr BP and 11500 cal yr BP, which may represent a local manifestation of the Younger Dryas. Chironomid community development during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition appears to primarily reflect the influence of changing climate conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An evaluation of a surviving stretch of the Abbot's Way, in the Somerset Levels and Moors, was undertaken to assess the consequences of the previous management regime and inform future management of the site. The scheduled site appeared to have been dewatered and desiccated as a consequence of tree planting and the effects of a deep, adjacent drainage ditch during the previous decade. The evaluation considered the condition of the Neolithic timbers and associated palaeoenvironmental record from three trenches and, where possible, compared the results with those obtained form the 1974 excavation (Girling, 1976). The results of this analysis suggest that the hydrological consequences of tree planting and colonization had a detrimental effect on both the condition of the timbers and insect remains. However, pollen and plant macro-fossils survived well although there was modern contamination. A trench opened outside the scheduled area. where the ground was waterlogged and supported a wet acid grassland flora, revealed similar problems of survival and condition. This almost certainly reflects a period of peat extraction and an associated seasonally fluctuating water table in the 1950s and 1960s; in fact pollen survived better in the scheduled dewatered area. These results are compared with those recovered from the Sweet Track which was evaluated in 1996. Both sites have been subject to recent tree growth but the Sweet Track has been positively managed in terms of hydrology. The most notable difference between the two sites is that insects and wood survived better at the Sweet Track sites than at the Abbot's Way. Insects seem to be a more sensitive indicator of site desiccation than plant remains. It is recommended that any programme of management of wetland for archaeology should avoid deliberate tree planting and natural scrub and woodland generation. It should also take into account past as well as present land use.

LA  - Czech
AB  - Scientific studies dealing with purposeful usage of nutrient inputs and their highest as possible utilization in the process of photosynthesis cannot manage without experimental base of long-term trials performed under different soil and climatic conditions.
   Such trials exist also in our country at five sites (Pohorelice u Brna, Ivanovice na Hane, Caslav near Kutna Hora and Lukavec near Pacov in the Czech Republic; Viglas-Pstrusa near Zvolen in the Slovak Republic). These long-term stationary fertilizer trials (marked as VOP) were established after unified methodology and till now they are uniformly methodologically conducted at the Research Institute for Crop Production in Praha-Ruzyne (Doc. Ing. J. Baier, DrSc).
   20 trials were carried out in total, four trials at each site with different crops uniformly rotating. Basic site and climatic conditions of the trials VOP are presented in Tabs I and II. An outline of crops uniformly classified into mentioned trials in the past ten years (identical crops at each site) gives Tab. M.
   Each trial consists of uniform scheme of 12 various treatments four times replicated (a, b, c, d). Their distribution within the trial is schematically given in Fig. 1. The size of fertilized plot was 8 m x 8 m = 64 m2, or 9 m x 9 m = 81 m2, harvested part is of 25 m2. Fertilizing treatments are uniform and permanently fixed in all 20 trials and are marked and schematically presented in Tab. IV.
   Inorganic analyses of plants were used to study the nutritive conditions of all crops and agrochemical soil analyses studied the dynamics of nutrients in soil.
   Special analyses in certain intervals or in certain crops investigate the contents of microelements (of heavy metals too), nitrates, quality indicators of harvested products and others. Presented analytical data enable reveal the yield reaction of crops to fertilizing by the dynamics of nutrient uptake studied and their utilization for the yield and quality formations, along with impact on soil fertility and environment.

AB  - The lacustrine Dameigou organic-rich shale of the northern Qaidam Basin is a particularly promising play for recent unconventional oil and gas exploration in China. Deposition was associated with arid intervals during the otherwise humid Middle Jurassic, but the depositional mechanism and organic matter enrichment processes are poorly understood. This study integrates high-resolution organic and inorganic geochemical proxies with detailed sedimentary observations for samples from the Chaiye (CY1) borehole, located in the Yuqia Depression, to investigate the depositional environment and development of the Dameigou shales. Four major lithofacies, including sandy mudstones, oil shale, organic-rich mudstone, and argillaceous mudstone, were identified through detailed microscopic observation and mineralogical analyses. Geochemical paleoclimate proxies (CIA, Fe/Mn and Mg/Ca) indicate that humidity fluctuations primarily drove the lithofacies variation. Other geochemical proxies, including terrigenous supply (Al2O3, Ti2O and regular sterane), lake salinity (Sr/Ba, S/TOC and Ga), redox conditions (V/Cr, U/Th and Pr/Ph), and primary productivity (Ba-xs, P-xs) indicate that climatic variability exerted a first-order control on the chemical evolution of the lake and the development of organic-rich shale in the Yuqia area. During arid intervals, fresh water supply through precipitation and river runoff weakened, leading to an increase in salinity and water column stratification. As a result, surface water became brackish and oxygen-rich, promoting growth of algae, but density stratification drove the bottom waters to anoxia, providing favorable conditions for organic matter preservation. Recycling of nutrients such as phosphorus under anoxic conditions further promoted eutrophication and high productivity in the surface water, which ultimately promoted the precipitation of carbonate minerals.

In two experimental periods, carried out during two contrasting seasons of the year (winter and summer), 240 Cobb 500 male chickens were randomly assigned in groups of 60 to 1 of 4 treatments, with 6 replicates in each, low stocking density with outdoor access (LO, 5 birds/m(2)); high stocking density with outdoor access (HO, 10 birds/m(2)); low stocking density indoors (LI, 5 birds/m(2)); high stocking density indoors (HI, 10 birds/m(2)). From 21 to 42 d old, body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) were weekly recorded. Mortality was measured daily and carcase weight at slaughter. Indoor and outdoor temperature and relative humidity were measured daily. 3. There was a tendency for chickens raised in the outdoor access to be heavier than those raised in the indoor treatments. Chickens raised in the low-density treatments in the first experimental period were significantly heavier, gained more weight and had lower value for feed conversion ratio (FCR) than those reared at high density. In the second experimental period mortality significantly increased on week 4 due to heat stress. Birds raised with outdoor access had an increased carcase yield compared to those raised exclusively indoors. 4. In conclusion, low stocking density in combination with low environmental temperatures had enhancing effects on BW, BWG, FI and FCR, and the effects of housing system depended on stocking density. Low stocking density and outdoor access had positive effects on carcase yield.

AB  - The late Ordovician was a critical interval in Earth's history, during which changes in the biosphere, climate and environment occurred. In this study, we analyse the nitrogen isotope composition and multiple geochemical indices of Ordovician-Silurian (O-S) shales in the Yangtze Sea (South China) to elucidate the evolution of nitrogen cycling and sedimentary environments. The nitrogen isotope values of Wufeng shale samples (Upper Ordovician) range from -0.4 parts per thousand to +1.6 parts per thousand, and those of Longmaxi shale samples (Lower Silurian) range from +0.6 parts per thousand to +3.1 parts per thousand. According to the longitudinal distribution of nitrogen isotope, there was a positive shift from the Wufeng Formation to Longmaxi Formation. Moreover, the redox-sensitive element ratios and nitrogen isotopes were strongly related. These relationships imply that the pre- and post-Hirnantian intervals of nitrogen cycle perturbation were directly related to changes in the oceanic redox conditions in the Yangtze Sea region. During the depositional stage of the Wufeng Formation (pre-Hirnantian) the water column was deep, causing anaerobic reduction in the sedimentary environment. The nitrogen cycle was dominated by anaerobic nitrogen fixation with little isotopic fractionation; thus, the delta N-15 values are light. In contrast, during the depositional stage of the Longmaxi Formation (post-Hirnantian), global cooling and tectonic uplift led to sea-level change, and sedimentation was increasingly affected by the supply of terrigenous clastic materials. The oxygen content of the water column increased, and redox stratification was maintained dynamically. Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) played important roles in the Longmaxi Formation nitrogen cycle, leading to strong isotopic fractionation. Nitrogen isotopes are a reliable indicator of palaeo-environmental changes and have great value for the restoration of palaeo-depositional conditions and the comparative analysis of global Ordovician-Silurian geological events.

AB  - In this paper, a novel simple CO2 Rankine cycle to recover LNG cold energy is proposed. The system is driven by ambient air, which is regarded as one of the most convenient and economic heat source. For the reason that the ambient temperature changes with days and seasons, it is necessary to take into account the system behavior with the variations of ambient temperature and mass flow rate. In this study, a detailed off-design performance analysis based on the preliminary design of the system is carried out. A sliding pressure control method is applied to keep the system stably and safely operate at off-design conditions. And the system behavior at design condition are compared with that under off-design conditions using a statistical tool. It is noted that the design value of temperature and mass flow rate of ambient air is 313.15 K and 26.86 kg.s(-1). The results indicate that the design cycle thermal efficiency, cold energy recovered from LNG and net power output is 6.75%, 1500.7 kW and 108.7 kW, respectively. With the decrease of ambient air temperature and mass flow rate, almost all the performance indicators decrease. But pump power consumption and efficiency changes slightly. Compared with the design values, cycle thermal efficiency and net power output decreases up to 47% and 60% when the ambient temperature decreases to 293.15 K, and 64% and 75% when the mass flow rate of ambient air decreases to 16 kg.s(-1), respectively. Moreover, the smaller mass flow rate of ambient air has greater impact on the system performance than the bigger one.

AB  - In this paper, a thermoeconomic model of a dual loop organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system has been developed to analyze both the thermodynamic and economic performance of several working fluid groups for the purpose of compressed natural gas (CNG) engine waste heat recovery. The effects of six key parameters on the thermoeconomic indicators of the dual loop ORC system are investigated. Furthermore, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Pareto optimal solutions from the viewpoints of maximizing net power output and minimizing total investment post over the whole operating range of the CNG engine. The most suitable working fluid group is screened out, then the optimal parameter regions are determined. The results show that a higher evaporation pressure and a lower condensation temperature exhibit a positive effect on the thermoeconomic performances of the dual loop ORC system while the effects of variation in superheat degree and exhaust outlet temperature on the thermoeconomic performances are not obvious. The optimal evaporation pressure of the high temperature loop ORC (HT cycle) is always above 2.5 MPa. The optimal condensation temperature of the HT cycle, optimal evaporation temperature and condensation temperature of the low temperature loop ORC (LT cycle) are all kept almost constants. In addition, the optimal exhaust outlet temperature is mainly influenced by the engine speed. At the rated condition, the dual loop ORC system has the maximum net power output of 23.62 kW and the minimum electricity production cost (EPC) of 0.41 $/kW h. The thermal efficiency of the dual loop ORC system is in the range of 8.97-10.19% over the whole operating range.

AB  - Minerals and elements are important proxies that can provide information about variations in the delivery and deposition of coastal ocean sediments associated with past climate changes. In this study, postglacial changes in the accumulation of sediments on the upper shelf of southeastern Brazil are linked to the evolution of regional paleoceanographic and continental paleoclimatic conditions during the last 14.4 kyr CAL BP. Mineralogical and major and trace element analyses of a C-14-dated sediment core identify three main lithostratigraphic units of this core that reveal a succession of changes in sediment delivery and accumulation as postglacial sea level rose and Holocene climate on land evolved. The depositional setting has transitioned in response to the large sea level rise prior to 9.9 kyr CAL BP from being a shallow water high energy environment to a deeper water one. This location has since then been a lower energy environment that has persisted into modem times. Due to the high marine productivity associated with the Cabo Frio upwelling system in an oxygenated water column, the sediments have shown a complex and dynamic redox condition, making variations in redox-sensitive trace elements indicative of changes in primary production and organic matter diagenesis at this location. After sea level stabilized similar to 9 kyr CAL BP, variations in fluxes of Al, Fe, Ca, and minerals were small, indicating that climate driven changes had only secondary controls on delivery of detrital sediment components to the Cabo Frio shelf. Modern coastal upwelling conditions and the onset of mid-shelf organic-rich sediment deposition were established after 9.9 CAL kyr BP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The barrier islands of the southern North Sea were formed during the Holocene sea-level rise. These islands form part of a highly dynamic environment whose evolution continues today. Subjected to sea-level changes, tides and storm events, the sedimentary record reflects processes occurring under varying energy conditions. This article presents geochemical, mineralogical and diatom investigations carried out in the salt marsh of the East Frisian barrier island of Langeoog, which is re-exposed to a rising sea-level due to de-embankment. The major aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the sedimentological and geochemical development of these deposits under the influence of sea-level rise, with a special focus on the geochemistry and distribution of heavy mineral-associated elements. Correlation diagrams between FeO, TiO2 and MnO, as well as ternary plots (Al2O3SiO2Zr or TiO2), clearly indicate the variable appearance of heavy minerals in different lithological facies, comprising marsh soil, mixed and sand flat, and relocated beach sands. A dominating abundance of ilmenite followed by zircon, garnets and some other heavy minerals is evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray measurements. The data presented here suggests that these geochemical proxies are useful tools for characterizing depositional energy conditions. Increasing depositional energy is evident for the lithological units in the following order: marsh soil, mixed flat, sand flat and relocated beach sand. The energetic conditions during sediment deposition, as well as the sedimentary history, are confirmed by diatom analyses as an additional independent indicator. Depending on source rock composition, the geochemical parameters used in this study may also help to investigate depositional energy regimes of other siliciclastic sedimentary systems.

AB  - In calcareous parent material, pedogenic carbonate formation mostly involves dissolution and recrystallization of lithogenic carbonates with CO(2) of soil air, leading to a complete exchange of lithogenic carbon with soil-derived carbon. Interest in pedogenic carbonates has increased in recent decades because they are a useful tool for reconstructing paleoclimatic conditions (delta(13)C and delta(18)O) and past atmospheric CO(2) concentrations as well as for radiocarbon dating of soils. For such investigations, the recrystallization rate of primary CaCO(3) by pedogenic carbonate formation and the dependence of the recrystallization rate on environmental factors are essential, but still unquantified factors.
   The recrystallization rate of primary CaCO(3) of loess at three CO(2) concentrations was estimated by isotopic exchange between primary CaCO(3) and the (14)C of artificially labeled CO(2). Loess was used for the study as a parent substrate for soil formation to simulate initial rates of CaCO(3) recrystallization. CO(2) concentrations of 380 ppm, 5000 ppm and 50,000 ppm lead to recrystallization rates of 4.1.10(-7) day(-1), 8.1.10(-7) day(-1) and 16.9.10(-7) day(-1), respectively. The relation between CO(2) concentrations and recrystallization rates was described by a saturation Curve. Under the tested experimental conditions, complete (95%) recrystallization of loess carbonate and formation of pedogenic carbonate would take 4.9-20.0.10(3) years, strongly depending on CO(2) concentration. We expect faster recrystallization rates under field conditions because of permanent CO(2) supply by root and rhizomicrobial respiration. This impedes the equilibrium between the inorganic C pools in solid, liquid and gaseous phases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Village is an important implementation unit of national poverty alleviation and development strategies of rural China, and identifying the poverty degree, poverty type and poverty contributing factors of each poverty-stricken village is the precondition and guarantee of taking targeted measures in poverty alleviation strategies of China. To respond it, we construct a village-level multidimensional poverty measuring model, and use indicator contribution degree indices and linear regression method to explore poverty factors, while adopting Least Square Error (LSE) model and spatial econometric analysis model to identify the villages' poverty types and poverty difference. The case study shows that: (1) Spatially, there is obvious territoriality in the distribution of poverty-stricken villages, and the poverty-stricken villages are concentrated in contiguous poverty-stricken areas. The areas with the highest VPI, in a descending order, are Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Xinjiang. (2) The main factors contributing to the poverty of poverty-stricken villages in rural China include road construction, terrain type, frequency of natural disasters, per capita net income, labor force ratio, and cultural quality of labor force. The main causes of poverty include underdeveloped road construction conditions, frequent natural disasters, low level of income, and labor conditions. (3) Chinese poverty-stricken villages include six main subtypes, and most poverty-stricken villages are affected by multiple poverty-forming factors, reflected by a relatively high proportion of the three-factor dominant type, four-factor coordinative type, and five-factor combinative type. (4) There exist significant poverty differences in terms of geographical location and policy support, and the governments still need to carry out targeted poverty alleviation measures according to local conditions. The research can not only draw a macro overall poverty-reduction outline of impoverished villages in China, but also depict the specific poverty characteristics of each village, helping the government departments of poverty alleviation at all levels to mobilize all kinds of anti-poverty resources.

AB  - MiRNAs play crucial roles in many aspects of plant development and the response to the environment. The miR172 family has been shown to participate in the control of flowering time and the response to abiotic stress. This family regulates the expression of APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription factors in Arabidopsis. In the present study, soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) miR172c, a member of the miR172 family, and its target gene were investigated for abiotic stress responses in transgenic Arabidopsis. gma-miR172c was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) treatments and abiotic stresses, including salt and water deficit. 5'-RACE (5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends) assays indicated that miR172c directed Glyma01g39520 mRNA cleavage in soybeans. Overexpression of gma-miR172c in Arabidopsis resulted in reduced leaf water loss and increased survival rate under stress conditions. Meanwhile, the root length, germination rate, and cotyledon greening of transgenic plants were improved during both high salt and water deficit conditions. In addition, transgenic plants exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA during both the seed germination and post-germination seedling growth stages. Stress-related physiological indicators and the expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes were affected by abiotic treatments. The overexpression of gma-miR172c in Arabidopsis promoted earlier flowering compared with the wild type through modulation of the expression of flowering genes, such as FT and LFY during long days, especially under drought conditions. Glyma01g39520 weakened ABA sensitivity and reduced the tolerance to drought stress in the snz mutant of Arabidopsis by reducing the expression of ABI3 and ABI5. Overall, the present results demonstrate that gma-miR172c confers tolerance to water deficit and salt stress but increased ABA sensitivity by regulating Glyma01g39520, which also accelerates flowering under abiotic stresses.

TI  - Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus), Pig-Tailed Macaque (Macaca nemestrina) and Tiger (Panthera tigris) Populations at Tourism Venues in Thailand and Aspects of Their Welfare
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - This study focused on determining the size and welfare aspects of Asian elephant, pig-tailed macaque and tiger populations at facilities open to tourists in Thailand. Data were gathered from 118 venues through direct observations and interviews with staff. A score sheet-based welfare assessment was used to calculate scores between 1 and 10, indicating each venue's welfare situation. Factors such as freedom of movement for the animals, access to veterinary care, environmental noise quality, hygiene standards and work intensity were included in the score sheet. 1688 elephants, 371 macaques and 621 tigers were found at the venues. 89 venues exclusively kept elephants, 9 designated 'Monkey schools' offered macaque shows, 4 venues kept primarily tigers, mostly for petting and photo opportunities, and the remaining venues kept a mix of these animals. A strong imbalance in female to male gender ratios was recorded with about 4: 1 for adult elephants and 1: 4 for adult macaques. Severely inadequate welfare conditions were common, with 75% of macaques and 99% of tigers being kept at venues with scores less than 5. 86% of elephants were kept in inadequate conditions at venues with scores between 3 and 5, but a significant number of venues with scores above 5 were found. 4.6% of elephants were provided commendable conditions, reaching assessment scores of 8 and above. 71% of venues did not offer any sort of education about animals to visitors. This study is the first to assess welfare aspects of captive wild animals at tourism venues across Thailand. It concludes that significant concerns exist about the welfare of wild animals in the tourism sector of Thailand. Urgent attention needs to be given to address these concerns and prevent further suffering. But also to ensure the demand for wild animals doesn't have a negative impact on wild populations.

AB  - Recently, a demand regarding the assessment of release of dangerous substances from construction products was raised by European Commission which has issued the Mandate M/366 addressed to CEN. This action is in relation with the Essential Requirement No. 3 "Hygiene, Health and Environment" of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EC). The potential hazard for environment and health may arise in different life cycle stages of a construction product. During the service life stage, the release of substances due to contact with the rain water is the main potential hazard source, as a consequence of the leaching phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to present the development of a coupled chemical-transport model for the case of a concrete based construction product, i.e. concrete paving slabs, exposed to rain water under outdoor exposure conditions. The development of the model is based on an iterative process of comparing the experimental results with the simulated results up to an acceptable fit. The experiments were conducted at laboratory scale (equilibrium and dynamic leaching tests) and field scale. The product was exposed for one year in two types of leaching scenarios under outdoor conditions, "runoff" and "stagnation", and the element release was monitored. The model was calibrated using the experimental data obtained at laboratory scale and validated against measured field data, by taking into account the specific rain water balance and the atmospheric CO(2) uptake as input parameters. The numerical tool used in order to model and simulate the leaching behaviour was PHREEQC, coupled with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) thermodynamic data base. The simulation results are satisfying and the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the modelling approach for the leaching behaviour assessment of concrete type construction materials.

AB  - Over the next few decades, a central goal of agricultural research and policy will be to increase average regional crop yields in the face of diminished gains in genetic yield potential, likely climatic changes, decreased resource availability, and stricter environmental standards. Fundamental to the pursuit of effective investment strategies is an ability to quantify tradeoffs associated with potential policy and management changes. However, the data needed to predict regional yield responses to change, namely observations of yields and climatic, soil, and management conditions in farmers' fields, are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we investigate the value of data on the spatial distribution of yields for understanding causes of landscape yield variability. Stochastic simulation models, which employ the CERES model to simulate crop yields across a landscape, are used to translate assumed spatial patterns of soil and management conditions into spatial pattern of yields. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to repeat this process for many different realizations of conditions, resulting in a modeled relationship between yield patterns and the relative importance of soil and management yield constraints, both of which can be computed in the controlled simulation environment. The derived relationship then allows one to infer from observed yield patterns the true proportion of yield variability explained by soil and management.
   This procedure was tested for wheat in the Yaqui Valley, an intensive agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico, where yield patterns have been previously estimated with remote sensing. Comparison of simulated and observed yield patterns indicated that roughly 80% of spatial yield variance in 2001-2002 was attributable to management variations. The ability of simulation models to aid interpretation of landscape patterns is potentially invaluable for understanding yield constraints in many agricultural regions, where direct observations of soil and management variables are infeasible.

AB  - According to the recent literature, litter size (LS) produces a large number of negative direct and collateral effects on individual female lifetime productivity or flock economy. If all these influences were considered together, the improvement of LS would be far from the expected economical advantage. However, the LS can be used as an indicator of fitness or adaptability of the animals to their environment, which is very important under tropical conditions. Using a simple example, the expected genetic components of LS estimated by two procedures was compared. In the first and classical approach (CP), the LS is considered as a single trait belonging to the female who gave birth to the litter. The results of CP were compared to the new alternative procedure (AP), which considered the number of young animals born in the litter as equivalent to LS, their individual birth weight and their status (dead or alive) as a function of the synergistic action of the animals born in the litter and their mother. This exercise showed that the genetic parameters for LS estimated by the CP were biased, since a large number of genetic (co)variances were hidden. For the same type of related animals, the AP can estimate eight times more genetic components than CP. The use of AP is highly recommended, allowing the best and most efficient way of using the collected data and also estimating the breeding values of all animals born in the litter at a very young age, irrespective of their sex. Shorter generation interval and higher selection intensity can be obtained by this new procedure. All these possibilities are very important to breeding programs under tropical conditions.

AB  - The dependence of the excreted fraction of lithium (FELi) on that of water (FEW) in the kidney of tailed (the triton) and tailless amphibians, reptiles (lizards) and birds (the pigeon) was investigated. Under hydrated conditions, a linear (close to proportional) correlation can be seen between these parameters, which is similar to that for mammals but within a different range of the FELi and FEW values. The principal difference of these data from results for mammals is a transition from the lithium net reabsorption (FELi < 1) under a moderate hydration to its net secretion in the case of a high-level hydration (in the triton, the reabsorption was ceased without any conversion into the secretion: FELi = 1) When considered in terms of the hypothesis that the renal lithium transport characterizes transport of water and sodium in the proximal tubule, the data obtained indicate the tubular fluid net secretion to be an additional (to the glomerular filtration) mechanism of water delivery to the nephron in hydrated tailless amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Based on the data on renal lithium transport, the comparative assessments were made as to a possible role of the proximal fluid net secretion in representatives of different vertebrate classes (from Cyclostomata to birds). In marine teleosts, the proximal fluid net secretion rate (PSR) exceeds several times the glomerular filtration rate (GFR); in lizards, the maximal PSR/GFR ratios are about 1.5 and, in amphibians and pigeon, they are not higher than 0.4. In marine teleosts and tailless amphibians under water conditions, the fluid net secretion occurs continuously, while in reptiles and birds living constantly in air environment, it is a potential mechanism operating under water-load conditions. In all animals in which, according to the data on renal lithium transport, the existence of the proximal fluid net secretion can be suggested, the specific feature is the presence of the renoportal venous system.

AB  - The present study investigated the evolution of the contamination of the estuary of the Caete River by thermotolerant coliforms over the past decade. The hypothesis tested was that the conditions of the Caete estuary have worsened over this period due to a combination of population growth and the lack of investment in public sanitation by the local authorities. Samples for hydrological and microbiological analysis were collected at eight sample points in 2013, 2014, 2018, and 2019. The upper sector of the estuary was represented by the samples from P1-P4. This sector is the most urbanized, and the most affected by human activities, with 100% of the samples collected presenting thermotolerant coliform concentrations of over 1,100 MPN 100 mL(-1). Conditions were also considered to be "inappropriate" for human use in other areas at certain times of year. Despite being located within a protected area, the implementation of a public sanitation system, proposed in the master plan of the municipality of Braganca almost two decades ago, has yet to be initiated. Compared with the results of previous studies of the Caete estuary, more than a decade ago, the contamination of the water has increased considerably. Based on the criteria of the current Brazilian legislation, all types of human use of the water are compromised, although socioeconomic activities continue as normal. This situation may eventually impact the health of the local population and affect economic activities. The conditions found in the Caete estuary appear to be typical of other coastal Amazonian municipalities. (C) 2021 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Rapid urbanization, global warming and enhanced quality of life have significantly increased the demand of indoor thermal comfort and air conditioning systems are not a luxury anymore, but a necessity. In order to fulfil this need, it is imperative to develop affordable and environmentally friendly cooling solutions for buildings. In this work, the 3E performance (energetic, economic and environmental) of electrically driven water-cooled vapour compression systems and thermally (solar) driven vapour absorption cooling systems are evaluated and the parameters affecting the performance of solar-driven vapour absorption systems are investigated. The energy simulation software TRNSYS is used to simulate the performance of both systems in order to fulfil the cooling needs of an industrial manufacturing building for the typical climate conditions for Lahore, Pakistan. Primary energy saving, initial investment, operational cost, and carbon footprint indices are used to analyse the performance of both systems. In addition, a parametric code is written in Python and linked with TRNSYS to perform a parametric study to investigate the effects of various parameters such as solar field size, storage tank volume, optimum annual and monthly collector angles, and flow rate in the solar field on the solar-driven vapour absorption chiller performance. The results reveal that around 5% more energy can be absorbed per collector surface area by changing the solar tilt angle on a monthly basis compared to one fixed angle. The analysis shows that electrically driven vapour compression-based cooling systems have much higher running cost and are potentially hazardous for the environment but have lower capital costs. On the other hand, solar thermal systems have lower running costs and emissions but require further reductions in the capital costs or government subsidies to make them viable.

AB  - Connectivity has emerged as a useful concept for exploring the movement of water and sediments between landscape locations and across spatial scales. In this study, we examine the structural and functional controls of surface-patch to hillslope runoff and sediment connectivity in three Mediterranean dry reclaimed mining slope systems that have different long-term development levels of vegetation and rill networks. Structural connectivity was assessed using flow path analysis of coupled vegetation distribution and surface topography, providing field indicators of the extent to which surface patches that facilitate runoff and sediment production are physically linked to one another in the studied hillslopes. Functional connectivity was calculated using the ratio of patch-scale to hillslope-scale observations of runoff and sediment yield for 21 monitored hydrologically active rainfall events. The impact of the dynamic interactions between rainfall conditions and structural connectivity on functional connectivity were further analysed using general linear models with a backward model structure selection approach. Functional runoff connectivity during precipitation events was found to be dynamically controlled by antecedent precipitation conditions and rainfall intensity and strongly modulated by the structural connectivity of the slopes. On slopes without rills, both runoff and sediments for all events were largely redistributed within the analysed hillslopes, resulting in low functional connectivity. Sediment connectivity increased with rainfall intensity, particularly in the presence of rill networks where active incision under high-intensity storm conditions led to large non-linear increases in sediment yield from the surface-patch to the hillslope scales. Overall, our results demonstrate the usefulness of applying structural-and functional-connectivity metrics for practical applications and for assessing the complex links and controlling factors that regulate the transference of both surface water and sediments across different landscape scales.

AB  - The temperature humidity index (THI) has been extensively used in the Australian dairy industry as an indicator of heat load conditions. However, there are limitations to the THI, where it does not account for solar radiation or wind speed. In addition, the THI has not been formulated in conjunction with physiological data. Thus, it is not apparent whether the THI provides the best prediction for impact of heat load on lactating dairy cattle. The aim of the present study was to develop a dairy heat load index (DHLI), based on the physiological responses of lactating dairy cows to environmental conditions. The study was undertaken at The University of Queensland, Gatton Campus, Australia, over three summers and two winters. Observations were conducted four times daily at 0800 hours, 1200 hours, 1400 hours and 1700 hours. Weather data were obtained every 10 min from an onsite, automated weather station. Panting score data were used to calculate a mean panting score of the herd. Developing the DHLI encompassed three different modelling techniques, including (1) linear regression, (2) broken stick regression and (3) non-linear logistic regression. Comparisons between the models indicated there was an increase in accuracy when using non-linear logistic regression (R-2 = 0.542). The DHLI model developed was based on mean panting score, black globe temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity. By utilising the black globe temperature, the DHLI is able to incorporate the combined effects of ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed in a single unit measure. By combining climatic conditions and a physiological response, i.e. panting score, the DHLI model may become a more accurate prediction of heat load for lactating dairy cows. The DHLI produces a unit value between 0 and 100. When DHLI is 0, there would be no panting and, when DHLI is 100, all cows within the herd would be panting.

AB  - Glucocorticoid steroids modulate immunocompetence in complex ways with both immunoenhancing and immunosuppressive effects in vertebrates exposed to different stressors. Such bimodal effects have been associated with variation in duration and intensity of the stress response. Given that natural populations have been exposed to a multitude of stressors, a better understanding of the functional association between duration and intensity of the stress response, the resulting changes in glucocorticoid plasma levels and their impact on different aspects of immunocompetence emerges as a cornerstone for vertebrate conservation strategies. We investigated the effects of a restraint challenge (with and without movement restriction), long-term captivity, and transdermal corticosterone application on plasma levels of corticosterone (hereinafter referred to as CORT) and different parameters of innate immunocompetence in the male cururu toads (Rhinella icterica). We show that for Rhinella icterica restraint for 24h proved to be a stressful condition, increasing CORT by 3-fold without consistent immunological changes. However, the application of a more intense stressor (restraint with movement restriction), for the same period, potentiated this response resulting in a 9-fold increase in CORT, associated with increase Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (N:L) and a lower bacterial killing ability (BKA). Transdermal application of corticosterone efficiently mimics repeated acute stress response events, without changing the immune parameters even after 13 days of treatment. Interestingly, long-term captivity did not mitigate the stress response, since the toads maintained 3-fold increased CORT even after 3 months under these conditions. Moreover, long-term captivity in the same condition increased total leukocyte count (TLC) and generated an even greater decrease in BKA, suggesting that consequences of the stress response can be aggravated by time in captivity.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether serum concentrations of growth hormone (GH), IGF-I, IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), and glucose at wk 2 and 10 postpartum were associated with the ability of postpartum beef cows to resume cycling when maintained on a limited nutrient environment. Cows (n = 29) were individually fed either 130 or 170 kcal ME x BW-.75 x d(-1) during nonlactation and 170 or 210 kcal ME x BW-.75 x d(-1) during lactation for an average of 4.1 yr before sample collection. The proportion of cows that resumed estrus within 20 wk after parturition was less (P < .05) at the lower feeding rate (5 of 14) than at the higher feeding rate (11 of 15). Concentrations of IGF-I increased from wk 2 to 10 in cows that resumed cycling but not in cows that remained anestrous and were less (P < .05) at wk 2 and 10 in cows that remained anestrous compared to cows that resumed cycling. Circulating amounts of IGFBP-8 at wk 2 were greater (P < .05) and IGFBP-3 concentrations were lower (P < .05) in cows that remained anestrous compared to cows that resumed cycling. Cows on the lower feeding rate that did not cycle had lower body condition scores and greater concentrations of GH compared (P < .05) to other cows. At the higher feeding rate, body condition score and concentrations of GH did not differ between cows that did or did not resume cycling. Circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-8 and -3 at wk 2 postpartum were indicators of the capacity of energy-restricted cattle to resume cycling after parturition.

AB  - Sex differences in functional hemispheric asymmetries (FHA) have been hypothesized as a fundamental mechanism behind sex differences in global-local processing. So far, it has not been assessed how interactive effects of sex and hemifield presentation influence common indicators of global precedence. The current study is the first to investigate the involvement of FHAs by using a divided visual field Navon paradigm and controlling for sex hormone status. Moreover, various factors that have previously shown a reliable influence on global-local processing performance are verified within the context of unilateral presentation. 39 men and 39 naturally cycling women in their luteal cycle phase completed a divided visual field Navon task with the instruction to detect targets either at any level (divided attention) or only at the global or local level (selective attention) in three different spacing conditions. The obtained evidence reveals significant sex differences in the global advantage effect (faster reaction to global vs. local level targets) for densely spaced letter stimuli, as well as significant sex differences in global-local level interference, with findings on both measures being mediated by testosterone. Also, estradiol showed different relationships to the global advantage effect in men and women together with a positive relationship to global advantage for the selective attention condition. Behavioural reaction time results were mirrored by accuracy measures but presented significantly higher global- over local-level accuracy in women compared to men for the divided attention condition. Our results did not show significant sex differences in FHAs but indicate differential relationships between progesterone and FHAs in men and women. In conclusion, sex hormones emerged as central mediators of sex differences in global precedence and possible moderators of hemispheric asymmetries.

TI  - Stormwater infiltration capacity of street tree pits: Quantifying the influence of different design and management strategies in New York City
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Street trees are abundant in the urban landscape and provide many ecosystem services including stormwater management. For trees housed within tree pits, the ability to mitigate stormwater runoff can be modulated by the permeability of the soil within the tree pit itself. Thus, developing a better understanding of how tree pit design and management impact soil permeability can be important to quantifying, and potentially improving, the stormwater benefits of street trees. To this end, water infiltration rate was measured at forty tree pits representing the variety of physical conditions commonly seen in New York City, including the presence or absence of a tree pit guard, the size of the tree pit, the size of the tree, the presence or absence of ground cover planting, the presence or absence of mulch, and the elevation of the pit's soil surface relative to the sidewalk. An initial analysis of results first tested the impact of each physical condition on infiltration rate individually. Genetic programming was then used to investigate interactive effects between the physical conditions, and to develop a statistical model that captured 66% of the variability in the observed infiltration rate using simple physical features of a tree pit. Results showed that the most significant factor influencing the infiltration rate was the presence of a guard around a tree pit, with guarded tree pits having higher infiltration rates. Additionally, higher infiltration rates in guarded pits were associated with larger pit areas, built-up surface elevations (binary) and the combined presence of ground cover planting (binary) and mulch (binary). Tree size, as measured by circumference at breast height, was found to be a less significant indicator of the infiltration rate. The statistical model, together with the study measurements, can be used to estimate the stormwater benefits of different tree pit management strategies, inform designs for improved stormwater management, and help identify useful observations or measurements for a street tree census.

AB  - Aquatic photosynthetic organisms, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, induce a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) to maintain photosynthetic activity in CO2-limiting conditions by sensing environmental CO2 and light availability. Previously, a novel high-CO2-requiring mutant, H82, defective in the induction of the CCM, was isolated. A homolog of calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein CAS, originally found in Arabidopsis thaliana, was disrupted in H82 cells. Although Arabidopsis CAS is reported to be associated with stomatal closure or immune responses via a chloroplast-mediated retrograde signal, the relationship between a Ca2+ signal and the CCM associated with the function of CAS in an aquatic environment is still unclear. In this study, the introduction of an intact CAS gene into H82 cells restored photosynthetic affinity for inorganic carbon, and RNA-seq analyses revealed that CAS could function in maintaining the expression levels of nuclear-encoded CO2-limiting-inducible genes, including the HCO(3)(-)transporters high-light activated 3 (HLA3) and low-CO2-inducible gene A (LCIA). CAS changed its localization from dispersed across the thylakoid membrane in high-CO2 conditions or in the dark to being associated with tubule-like structures in the pyrenoid in CO2-limiting conditions, along with a significant increase of the fluorescent signals of the Ca2+ indicator in the pyrenoid. Chlamydomonas CAS had Ca2+-binding activity, and the perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by a Ca2+-chelator or calmodulin antagonist impaired the accumulation of HLA3 and LCIA. These results suggest that Chlamydomonas CAS is a Ca2+-mediated regulator of CCM-related genes via a retrograde signal from the pyrenoid in the chloroplast to the nucleus.

AB  - The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area of research, but little attention has been given to how social and ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an agent-based model is used to explore potential 'learning dilemmas', or barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents manage water according to different management strategies and use various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however, agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies. When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they relate to water management.

AB  - The condition of the forest ecosystem in the vicinity of the largest Slovene power plant [the otanj Thermal Power Plant (TPP)] was monitored during the period 1991-2008 by determining the total concentration of sulphur, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll in Norway spruce needles. After 1995, the introduction of cleaning devices at the TPP dramatically reduced the former extremely high SO2 and dust emissions. The most significant findings of this comprehensive, long-duration survey are as follows: (1) the chosen parameters are suitable bioindicators of stress caused by air pollution in Norway spruce needles; they reflect both spatial and temporal variations in air pollution as well as the degree of efficiency of the cleaning devices; (2) observations show that the physiological condition of Norway spruce in northern Slovenia has significantly improved since 1995, when the first desulphurization device at TPP was built, together with a reduction in the area influenced by pollution from TPP; (3) metabolic processes in spruce needles react to air pollution according to the severity of the pollution and the length of exposure; exposure to high SO2 ambient levels and/or spread over a long duration can damage the antioxidant defence mechanisms of spruce trees as well as diminishing the concentration of ascorbic acid; (4) a reduction in the exposure to air pollution improves the vitality of the trees (e.g. higher concentrations of total (a + b) chlorophyll), as well as restoring their defence capabilities as shown by higher concentrations of ascorbic acid; and (5) forest monitoring should be continued and focused on integrating the effects of multiple stressors, which can additionally affect a forest ecosystem.

AB  - 1. We analysed submerged macrophyte communities from 300 Danish lakes to determine the efficacy of different species, maximum colonisation depth (C-max) of plants as well as coverage and plant volume inhabited (PVI) as indicators of eutrophication.
   2. Most species occurred at a wide range of phosphorus and chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations, but some species of isoetids (Lobelia, Isoetes) and Potamogeton (Potamogeton gramineus, Potamogeton alpinus and Potamogeton filiformis) were mainly found at low nutrient concentrations and hence may be considered as indicators of nutrient poor conditions. However, species typically found in nutrient-rich conditions, such as Elodea canadensis and Potamogeton pectinatus, were also found at total phosphorus (TP) <0.02 mg P L-1 and Chla <5 mu g L-1 and therefore cannot be considered as reliable indicators of eutrophic conditions.
   3. Submerged macrophyte coverage, PVI and the C-max were negatively correlated with TP and Chla. However, variability among lakes was high and no clear thresholds were observed. At TP between 0.03 and 0.07 mg P L-1 plant coverage in shallow lakes ranged from nearly 0 to 100%, whilst at concentrations between 0.10 and 0.20 mg P L-1 only 29% of the lakes had coverage >10%. C-max was found to be a useful indicator only in deep lakes with unvegetated areas in the deeper part, whereas the use of coverage was restricted to shallow lakes or shallow areas of deep lakes.
   4. Overall, submerged macrophytes responded clearly to eutrophication, but the metrics investigated here showed no well-defined thresholds. We developed a simple index based on species richness, presence of indicator species, coverage and C-max, which might be used to track major changes in macrophyte communities and for lake classification.

AB  - An earlier onset of spring has been recorded for many parts of Eurasia in recent decades. This has consequences for migratory species, both in changing the conditions encountered by individuals on reaching migratory sites and in affecting cues regulating the timing of migration where decisions to migrate are influenced by local environmental variables. Here we examine the timing of spring migration for two arctic goose populations, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus (during 1990-2003) and barnacle goose Branta leucopsis (during 1982-2003), which both breed on Svalbard. The satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to express the onset of spring at their wintering and spring staging sites. Pink-footed geese use several sites during spring migration, ranging from the southernmost wintering areas in Belgium to two spring staging areas in Norway, and distances between sites used along the flyway are relatively short. There was a positive correlation in the onset of spring between neighbouring sites, and the geese migrated earlier in early springs. Barnacle geese, on the other hand, have a long overseas crossing from their wintering grounds in Britain to spring staging areas in Norway. Although spring advanced in both regions, there was no corresponding correlation in the timing of onset of spring between their wintering and spring staging sites, and little evidence for barnacle geese migrating earlier over the whole study period. Hence, where geese can use spring conditions at one site as an indicator of the conditions they might encounter at the next, they have responded quickly to the advancement of spring, whereas in a situation where they cannot predict, they have not yet responded, despite the advancement of spring in the spring staging area.

AB  - Plain English Summary This paper extends the university entrepreneurship research by theorizing the influence of institutional conditions (environments where students are mostly exposed at university and country-level) on students' entrepreneurship dynamics (e.g., nascent and active), as well as the moderation effect of the type of economy (e.g., post-socialist and marked-oriented). This study shows the crucial role of informal institutions in the country (societal perceptions) and university (students' perception) on students' entrepreneurial dynamics. Several implications emerge from this study. First, policymakers should realize that students' entrepreneurship is a multi-level phenomenon affected by individual- university- and country-level factors in implementing policy frameworks that cultivate pro-entrepreneurial values in post-socialist economies. Second, for university managers, results open a window for the re-consideration of university budgets and performance indicators in the configuration of entrepreneurial education programs with more action-oriented approaches to stimulate students' interest and perceived self-efficacy to pursue this career path.
   This paper theorizes how institutional conditions influence students' entrepreneurship dynamics (e.g., nascent and active), especially these institutional conditions related to environments where students are mostly exposed (e.g., university and country), as well as the moderation effect of the type of economy (e.g., post-socialist and marked-oriented). We tested our proposed theoretical model in a sample of 91,105 students from 557 European universities located in nine post-socialist economies and nine market-oriented economies. The results show the important role of informal institutions in the country (societal perceptions) and university (students' perception) on students' entrepreneurial dynamics, especially the moderation of post-socialist and market-oriented economies on the informal institutions that influence nascent entrepreneurs. Several implications for policymakers and university managers emerge from this study.

AB  - Deforestation is widely studied throughout the world. However, a less evident issue is the effect of climate change and drought on remnants of native forests. The objective of this work was to understand the geographic variations in resistance to drought of the Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests of central Chile. These forests have been historically reduced and fragmented and in recent years were subjected to the most prolonged drought occurred between 2010 and 2017. Using data from the MODIS satellite sensor, temporal trends in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were quantified. We related these trends with different environmental variables to understand the effects of geographical variation and forest type as indicators of resistance to drought. We observed a significant direct effect of drought, attributable to the reduced precipitation in central Chile, and a significantly reduced NDVI in near one-third of the region forests (browning). However, NDVI and therefore forest productivity were more stable in some mesic sites such as ravine bottoms, but not on south-facing slopes. This suggests that under a regime of reduced precipitations, a greater available soil humidity would be a more important factor than the fact of receiving less solar radiation. Finally, the highest degree of browning was observed in semi-arid sclerophyllous forest dominated by species tolerant to drought. Our findings emphasize the need to consider topographic site conditions to adequately assess forest productivity and vulnerability where local wet conditions could provide drought refuges. This recent drought may be analogous to forecasted warmer and drier climate conditions with more frequent and severe droughts, so our results may serve as a general framework for climate-smart decisions in highly threatened forest restoration and conservation.

AB  - Introduction. The use of solar energy in construction is widespread due to a rapid growth in energy tariffs.
   Problem Statement. The share of building roof in the heat consumption during a heating season accounts for 10-25%. In summertime, intensive heating of a large roof area leads to a high room temperature and, therefore, active use of air conditioning systems.
   Purpose. The purpose is to develop an experimental sample of thermosetting roof panel containing a material with phase transformation and to study the operational parameters of the sample in summertime. Further, the roof panel is planned to be used as additional source of heating or air conditioning to improve the temperature balance of microclimate inside the building.
   Materials and Methods. The field study was conducted in July 2018 on a pilot sample of thermosetting roof panel containing a material with phase transformation in a metal casing protected by a copper roofing sheet and an effective heater.
   Results. When performing experimental study of the thermosetting roof panel, a temperature difference (between the inlet and the outlet) that varies from 1.2 to 4 degrees C for 10 h 45 min has been observed. The presence of material with phase transformation can reduce the roof sheet temperature about two times: the M01 detector has recorded a maximum tempera(sic)ture of 87.8 degrees C, in the case of material with phase transformation, and 43.7 degrees C, in the case without the use of the men(sic)tioned material.
   Conclusions. The experiment has shown that in summertime the use of the material with phase transformation reduces twice the temperature of the copper sheet of the roof panel inner surface. The use of such technology is advisable to reduce the cost of energy for air conditioning indoor, enables construction of energy-saving environment friendly residential and industrial buildings.

AB  - Purpose The Danish Work Life Course Cohort (DaWCo) was initiated to study relations between working conditions, health and labour market affiliation using repeated measures of these factors throughout the working life, while accounting for health-differences preexisting labour market entry.
   Participants The cohort encompasses all 15-30-year-old individuals residing in Denmark who entered the labour market during the years 1995-2009 (960 562 individuals and 7136 188 observations). Data include information on working conditions measured by job exposure matrices linked with registers on health, labour market affiliation and sociodemographics for both the cohort members and their parents. The median age at cohort entry was 20 years and men and women were equally represented.
   Findings to date Currently, one study has been published, which found that low job control was associated with increased risk of depressive disorder, independently from indicators of socioeconomic position measured throughout the life-course. The present cohort profile presents data regarding the transitions of cohort members between states of labour market affiliation and data on health services use. All cohort members were employed in their year of entry, but this proportion decreased across the years to 82.4% in the 10th year since cohort entry. The proportion of students peaked at 5 years since cohort entry with 13.9%.
   Future plans This large prospective cohort offers the possibility to study associations between psychosocial working conditions and rare outcomes and to examine the potential accumulation of effects while accounting for health-differences pre-existing labour market entry. Currently, we are working on analyses on risk of hospital-diagnosed incident depression and disability pensioning. The study is ongoing, and we are planning to extend the study to include the years 2010-2018 and expand the cohort with individuals entering the Danish workforce during these years.

AB  - Trees are considered good candidates for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with trace elements (TE), e.g. mine tailings. Using two year-old Tilia cordata plants, we demonstrated the nature and the scale of root architecture, especially root apices, as an indicator of mining sludge toxicity and plant capability to cope with these stress conditions. The novelty of our research is the analysis of the root response to substrate with extremely high concentrations of numerous toxic TE, and the 3D illustration of the disorders in root apex architecture using a clarity technique for confocal microscopy.
   The analysis demonstrates (1) a marked reduction in the size of the root apex zones (2) the occurrence of vascular tissues abnormally close to the root apex (3) collapse of the internal tissues in many root apices. Simultaneously, at the cellular level we observed some signs of a defensive response- such as a common increase of cell wall (CW) thickness and the formation of local CW thickenings- that enlarge the CW capacity for TE sequestration. However, we also detected harmful effects. Among others, a massive deposition of TE in the middle lamella which caused major damage - probably one of the reasons why the inner tissues of the root apex often collapsed - and the formation of incomplete CWs resulting in the occurrence of extremely large cells. Moreover, many cells of the root apex exhibited degenerated protoplasts.
   All these alterations indicate the harsh conditions for lime growth and survival and simultaneously, the manifestation of a defensive response.
   The obtained results allowed us to conclude that analysis of the nature and scale of structural alterations in roots can be useful indicators of plant ability to cope with stress conditions, e.g. in prospect of using the examined plants for reclamation of soils contaminated with TE.

TI  - STROMATOLITES FROM BASHKIRIAN DEPOSITS OF DONETS BASIN

AB  - The paper is dedicated to the research of unique siliceous stromatolites from limestone G2 (Mospins'ka suite, Upper Bashkirian) of Donets Basin. These biogenic structures exhibit four (lamellar, hemispheroidal, not branching columnar and stratified columnar) morphotypes. In addition, supposedly, small oncolites were identified. According to principles of botanical nomenclature classification, stromatolites must be classified as stiriolites. Stromatolites of primarily siliceous composition form a distinctive group.
   Stromatolites, as a rule, are indicators of the shallow basin conditions, as the normal development of cyanobacteria is only possible in shallow bodies of water. Numerous lithofacies indicate shallow water formation conditions of limestone G2. Thus, the examined stromatolites were formed on the upper part of the subtidal zone - with good aeration of waters, at depths up to 20m or less. The extensive development of stromatolites in limestone stands in stark contrast to the almost complete absence of corals in it. This fact indicates an unstable salinity. Part of paleo water area, where siliceous stromatolites are found, had great but local desalination due to the penetration of large amounts of fresh water in the saltwater sea basin. It must have taken place because of significant evaporation. As a result of these processes, concentration of dissolved silica in water sharply increased. Later, when the factor of desalination of water ceased to operate and/or the concentration of silica in the water fell by its binding in the stromatolite structures, cyanobacteria were not able to precipitate SiO2 and stromatolites growth stopped.
   The origin of the lamellar microstructure of stromatolites is due to seasonal factor: light layers stromatolites were formed under the conditions of sufficiently large amount of precipitation during the rainy season, and the dark ones - in relatively dry seasons.
   Taking into account large scientific and educational value and uniqueness of examined stromatolites, we think, that some of the outcrops of limestone G2 must acquire status of environmentally protected sites.

AB  - As an important indicator of air quality negative air ions (NAI) is good for human psychological and physiological condition. Under natural conditions, plants generate low amounts of NAI and frequently it cannot meet the requirement for improving physical health. However, the capacity of NAI generation by plants was significantly enhanced with stimulation of pulsed electric fields (PEF). To study the effects of PEF and light stimulation on NAI generation by plants, we choose the Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum (poison bulb), Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis (narcissus) and Zephyranthes carinata (zephyranthes) which generate more NAI than other plants under natural conditions. The results showed that different parameters of PEF have different influences on NAI generation by plants. Thus each plant had the optimal parameters of PEF to generate NAI efficiently. When the optimal parameters of PEF were applied the higher voltage the plant had the more NAI it generated. Furthermore and the capacity to generate NAI dramatically improved with the strengthened light intensity. In the absence of electrostimulation the NAI concentration increased slightly as the light intensity strengthened, but there was no considerable effect of the light intensity on the plant's capacity to generate NAI. Additionally, there was a close correlation between the capacity of the plant to generate NAI and the characteristics of leaf stomas. Under the stimulation of the optimal parameters of PEF, with its wider opening, the stomata had a greater density, thus the plant generated more NAI. The capacity of plants to release NAI was influenced by such elements as PEF, light intensity and characteristics of plants. Among these factors the PEF had a more considerable effect than other factors on the plant. Hence, to make plants generate NAI efficiently, the best way is to use the optimal parameters of PEF and at the same time made leaf stomata open to a certain degree.

AB  - In this paper, the ORC (Organic Rankine cycle) technology is adopted to recover the exhaust waste heat of diesel engine. The thermodynamic, economic and optimization models of the ORC system are established, respectively. Firstly, the effects of four key parameters, including evaporation pressure, superheat degree, condensation temperature and exhaust temperature at the outlet of the evaporator on the thermodynamic performances and economic indicators of the ORC system are investigated. Subsequently, based on the established optimization model, GA (genetic algorithm) is employed to solve the Pareto solution of the thermodynamic performances and economic indicators for maximizing net power output and minimizing total investment cost under diesel engine various operating conditions using R600, R600a, R601a, R245fa, R1234yf and R1234ze as working fluids. The most suitable working fluid used in the ORC system for diesel engine waste heat recovery is screened out, and then the corresponding optimal parameter regions are analyzed. The results show that thermodynamic performance of the ORC system is improved at the expense of economic performance. Among these working fluids, R245fa is considered as the most suitable working fluid for the ORC waste heat application of the diesel engine with comprehensive consideration of thermoeconomic performances, environmental impacts and safety levels. Under the various operating conditions of the diesel engine, the optimal evaporation pressure is in the range of 1.1 MPa-2.1 MPa. In addition, the optimal superheat degree and the exhaust temperature at the outlet of the evaporator are mainly influenced by the operating conditions of the diesel engine. The optimal condensation temperature keeps a nearly constant value of 298.15 K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale Acute cocaine administration produces an initial rewarding state followed by a dysphoric/anxiogenic "crash."
   Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether individual differences in the relative value of cocaine's positive and negative effects would account for variations in subsequent drug self-administration.
   Methods The dual actions of cocaine were assessed using a conditioned place test (where animals formed preferences for environments paired with the immediate rewarding effects of 1.0 mg/kg i.v. cocaine or aversions of environments associated with the anxiogenic effects present 15-min postinjection) and a runway test (where animals developed approach-avoidance "retreat" behaviors about entering a goal box associated with cocaine delivery). Ranked scores from these two tests were then correlated with each other and with the escalation in the operant responding of the same subjects observed over 10 days of 1-or 6-h/day access to i.v. (0.4mg/inj) cocaine self-administration.
   Results Larger place preferences were associated with faster runway start latencies (r(s)=-0.64), but not with retreat frequency or run times; larger place aversions predicted slower runway start times (r(s)=0.62), increased run times (r(s)=0.65), and increased retreats (r(s)=0.62); response escalation was observed in both the 1- and 6-h self-administration groups and was associated with increased CPPs (r(s)=0.58) but not CPAs, as well as with faster run times (r(s)=-0.60).
   Conclusions Together, these data suggest that animals exhibiting a greater positive than negative response to acute (single daily injections of) cocaine are at the greatest risk for subsequent escalated cocaine self-administration, a presumed indicator of cocaine addiction.

AB  - The intensive monitoring plots (Level II) of ICP Forests serve to examine the effects of air pollution and other stress factors on forest condition, including tree vitality. However, tree vitality cannot be measured directly. Indicators, such as tree growth or crown transparency, may instead be used. Tree growth processes can be ranked by order of importance in foliage growth, root growth, bud growth, storage tissue growth, stem growth, growth of defence compounds and reproductive growth. Under stress photosynthesis is reduced and carbon allocation is altered. Stem growth may be reduced early on as it is not directly vital to the tree. Actual growth must be compared against a reference growth, such as the growth of trees without the presumed stress, the growth of presumed healthy trees, the growth in a presumed stress-free period or the expected growth derived from models. Several examples from intensive monitoring plots in Switzerland illustrate how tree-growth reactions to environmental stresses may serve as vitality indicator. Crown transparency and growth can complement each other. For example, defoliation by insects becomes first visible in crown transparency while stem growth reaction occurs with delay. On the other hand, extreme summer drought as observed in large parts of Europe in 2003 affects stem growth almost immediately, while foliage reduction becomes only visible months later. Residuals of tree growth models may also serve as indicators of changed environmental conditions. Certain stresses, such as drought or insect defoliation cause immediate reactions and are not detectable in five-year growth intervals. Therefore, annual or inter-annual stem growth should be assessed in long-term monitoring plots.

AB  - Thermal modification is an effective method that induces significant expansion of the antimicrobial properties and other valuable properties of chicken egg white lysozyme. In our latest research, a new innovative method of enzyme modification was developed, in which microwave radiation was used as an energy source to process liquid lysozyme concentrate (LLC). After modification, high-quality preparations were obtained. However, long-term storage in a concentrated form initiated various processes that caused darkening over time and could also lead to other significant changes to their structure and, consequently, to their functional properties. This necessitated multidirectional research to explain this phenomenon. This paper presents the results of research aimed at assessing the physicochemical changes in the properties of microwave-modified lysozyme in the form of a liquid concentrate after long-term storage under refrigeration conditions. The assessment also considered the conditions under the acidity of the modifying medium and the duration of the microwave modification. The analysis showed that the values of the basic parameters determining the quality and usefulness of the modified enzyme significantly improved during long-term storage of the preparations. The greatest changes were observed in the preparations modified for the longest time and in the most acidic environment (process time 260 s, pH 2.0), the number of oligomers under these conditions increased by 18% after 12 months of holding, and the surface hydrophobicity increased by as much as 31%. In addition, microbiological tests showed that the preparations of microwave-modified lysozyme had an effect on gram-positive bacteria as well as on gram-negative, and this effect was significantly enhanced after 12 months. The results confirm that LLC modification with microwave radiation is a highly efficient method to prepare high-quality and high utility potential lysozyme. Notably, an interesting and important phenomenon was the observation of the unconventional behaviour of the preparations during their long-term storage, which increased their utility potential significantly.

AB  - The South Atlantic coast in Argentine Patagonia is an area where semi-arid to arid conditions predominate and coastal populations present serious water supply problems. The aim of the work was to evaluate the factors that condition the salinization processes of coastal aquifers from a hydrochemical and isotopic analysis of the groundwater located in Pleistocene and Holocene littoral ridges in the northern sector of Patagonia in Bahia San Blas. A geomorphological characterization of the area was carried out using digital elevation models, satellite image interpretation and field surveys. Groundwater chemistry was analyzed in 40 shallow wells and 2 tidal water samples. At each point, electrical conductivity, temperature and pH of water were measured and samples were taken for analysis of major ions and stable isotopes. The salinization processes were analyzed by means of ionic and isotopic relationship graphs and were subsequently modeled using free software. The results obtained allowed the identification of the factors that determine the salinization of coastal aquifers. Particularly in the Pleistocene coastal ridges, the cementation of the most superficial sediments reduces permeability conditioning rainwater infiltration. This, together with the presence of soluble salts on the surface and the mixing with sea water, determines the salinization of the groundwater. In contrast to these, in the Holocene coastal ridges without cementation, rainwater infiltrates forming freshwater lenses where salinization processes occur only at the edges of the lenses where the saltwater wedge is located. The data provided in this paper are useful in prospecting freshwater sources along the arid coast of Patagonia where freshwater availability is scarce. They can also be extrapolated to other sectors worldwide with similar geological and climatic environments.

AB  - The potential for introgression of genetically engineered (GE) Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz alleles into conventional crop or closely-related population under field conditions has raised the ecological concerns. Knowledge about the effect of factors associated with pollen-mediated gene flow is necessary for developing strategies for biocontainment and mitigating transgene flow from GE C. sativa to non-GE crops. In this study, in the center of C. sativa source, pollen first observed was between 8:00 and 9:00 o'clock (about 4 pollen m(3) h(-1)) and peaked between 11:00 and 13:00 (ranges: 116-240 pollen m(3) h(-1)) followed by a decrease to lower levels by 17:00 during the flowering period that lasted 33-37 days. Camelina sativa pollen concentration out of the pollen source was affected by sampling date and time, sampling distance, weather condition, but not sampling direction and sizes of pollen source (empty set = 10 or 20 m). Mean pollen concentrations over 10 h consistently decreased with distance at four cardinal directions from the center of pollen source. Directional wind did not significantly affect C. sativa pollen dispersal. The predicted pollen concentration at 10 m (< 2 pollen m(-3)h(-1)) using the developed model supports a minimum isolation distance of 10 m between C. sativa crops to maintain the gene flow rate < 0.01 %. Furthermore, a maize (Zea mays L.) barrier rows was tested to be an effective tool for reducing C. sativa pollen flow in research scale planting. The results demonstrated that long-distance C. sativa pollen dispersal is unlike. The new information in this study will be useful for predicting pollen-mediated transgene flow in GE C. sativa, providing coexistence strategies between GE and non-GE C. sativa, and thus contribute to ecological risk assessments of GE C. sativa and other crops.

AB  - It is quite difficult to investigate thermal comfort in hot-humid regions, and there have not been many real case studies or research related to this issue. In this article, four running events held in nearby popular travel spots in Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan, were selected to analyze the influence of thermal environment and air quality on thermal comfort. Mostly real time environmental monitoring data were applied for estimating thermal indicators, along with Sky View Factor (SVF) data taken at the sites of the running scheduled routes, to analyze the thermal performance of participants at running events. Compared with runners, walkers (local residents, fans, and staff of the events) would be exposed to a greater risk of thermal discomfort with increasing time spent on the routes. With the integrated analysis, mPET (modified physiologically equivalent temperature) can be viewed as a relatively comprehensive indicator in considering both environmental thermal conditions and the biometrical differences of activities and clothing types. From the results, a good correlation between mPET and solar radiation/SVF was obtained, which indicated that mPET could be sufficiently sensible in revealing the thermal condition variation from one site to another during the route with time. Based on the discomfort risk assessment, for runners, the event held in autumn with lower SVF at the route sites would be less risky of thermal discomfort, while the event held in spring with lower solar radiation would be more comfortable for walkers. As for air quality condition, the inappropriateness of holding winter outdoor activities in Kaohsiung was obviously shown in both real time monitoring data and long term analysis.

AB  - We studied distribution and growth of Serripes groenlandicus and Macoma calcarea in the southeastern part of the Pechora Sea. The hypothesis was tested that trends in the site-to-site variability of population characteristics of these two bivalve species were driven by their feeding types (suspension-feeder and deposit-feeder, respectively). However, such a trend was found only in the abundance distribution of these species and site-to-site variability in growth rates of S. groenlandicus. M. calcarea density on silty sediments was almost twice as high as on sandy sediments, while Serripes biomass was almost 1.5 times higher on sandy sediments than on silty sediments. The slowest-growing Serripes were found at the deepest stations and in habitats with the largest content of fine fractions (silt) in sediments. Differences in the growth of S. groenlandicus could reflect variability of feeding conditions of this suspension-feeder (e.g., hydrodynamic conditions). Thus, the growth rate of S. groenlandicus was sensitive to environmental conditions, which means it can be used as an indicator of their changes. In general, S. groenlandicus in the Pechora Sea is very slow-growing compared to other areas (maximum life span and shell length are 28 years and 70 mm, respectively). Their growth rate was closest to that in Arctic-influenced locations. On the contrary, the maximum life span and shell length of M. calcarea in the Pechora Sea (15 years and 30 mm, respectively) were similar to those in other parts of the distribution area. No significant differences were found in the group growth of M. calcarea from different studied localities.

AB  - This paper presents a data-driven approach to damage detection and prognosis in the context of structural health monitoring. One of the main issues in dealing with structural damage and degradation is its hidden stochastic nature, which could be gradual or accompanied by sudden changes resulting from shock events. Although gradual degradation could be related to age and operating conditions, shocks could arise from loss of stiffness/connectivity or from impact, resulting in a subsequent change in degradation path. In this paper, a unified degradation modeling approach is presented based on a gamma process, where both gradual degradation and change points caused by shock events are identified in a unified formulation. Because the exact degradation path depends upon both operating and loading conditions, the model parameters are estimated directly from the sensory data using Bayesian inference. In the first step, a degradation indicator is calculated based on time-series modeling, which is then used together with a multivariate Hotelling's p control chart for damage detection. In the next step, the degradation indicator forms an input to a gamma process degradation model (single- or two-phase gamma process), which enables damage prognosis using time-series model parameters as surrogates. The advantage of this approach is the ability to detect change points and changes to the degradation path using a purely data-driven approach without the need for experimental failure data. The model parameters and prognosis estimates can be updated with the availability of monitoring data, which makes it a powerful tool for damage detection and prognosis in long-term condition-monitoring settings. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the overall process using simulated vibration data and highlight the potential advantages of using this methodology.

AB  - Thermal stress is the result of a misbalance between heat produced or gained from the environment and the amount of heat lost to the environment. The level of thermal stress can range from minor or no effect to death of vulnerable animals. Under summertime conditions, thermal stress results in hyperthermia or heat stress. Heat stress in feedlot cattle is a common summertime occurrence in cattle-producing parts of the world (USA, Australia, Brazil, etc.). Effects on animals experiencing heat stress include decreases in feed intake, animal growth, and production efficiency. During these extreme events, animal losses can exceed 5% of all cattle on feed in a single feedlot. Luckily, these extreme events are generally very localized and last only a day or two. However, these losses can be devastating to individual producers within the affected area. The level of heat stress an individual animal will experience is a result of a combination of three distinct components: environmental conditions, individual animal susceptibility, and management of the herd. Environmental components include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Several indices have been developed to summarize the different components into a single value. Individual animal susceptibility is influenced by many different factors including coat color, sex, temperament, previous health history, acclimation, and condition score. Finally, management greatly influences the effects of thermal stress. Management factors can be broken into four distinct categories: feed, water, environmental influences, and handling. Understanding these risk factors and how each one influences animal stress will aid in the development of management strategies and how to implement them. Management strategies that can be employed at the right time and to the correct groups of animals will increase benefits to the animals and limit costs for the producers.

AB  - In this report, we show that biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19 gives rise to variants (the small mucoid variant [SMV] and the acapsular small-colony variant [SCV]) differing in capsule production, attachment, and biofilm formation compared to wild-type strains. All biofilm-derived variants harbored SNPs in cps19F. SCVs reverted to SMV, but no reversion to the wild-type phenotype was noted, indicating that these variants were distinct from opaque-and transparent-phase variants. The SCV-SMV reversion frequency was dependent on growth conditions and treatment with tetracycline. Increased reversion rates were coincident with antibiotic treatment, implicating oxidative stress as a trigger for the SCV-SMV switch. We, therefore, evaluated the role played by hydrogen peroxide, the oxidizing chemical, in the reversion and emergence of variants. Biofilms of S. pneumoniae TIGR4-Delta spxB, defective in hydrogen peroxide production, showed a significant reduction in variant formation. Similarly, supplementing the medium with catalase or sodium thiosulfate yielded a significant reduction in variants formed by wild-type biofilms. Resistance to rifampin, an indicator for mutation frequency, was found to increase approximately 55-fold in biofilms compared to planktonic cells for each of the three wild-type strains examined. In contrast, TIGR4-Delta spxB grown as a biofilm showed no increase in rifampin resistance compared to the same cells grown planktonically. Furthermore, addition of 2.5 and 10 mM hydrogen peroxide to planktonic cells resulted in a 12- and 160-fold increase in mutation frequency, respectively, and gave rise to variants similar in appearance, biofilm-related phenotypes, and distribution of biofilm-derived variants. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide and environmental conditions specific to biofilms are responsible for the development of non-phase-variable colony variants.

AB  - The mechanisms involved in the modulation of photosynthesis by drought in non-CAM desert plants have received little attention and were investigated in this study through measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence (OJIP) transients. We focused on two species, Augea capensis Thunb. and Zygophyllum prismatocarpum E. Meyer ex Sond., from the Namib desert. Measuring sites were selected near Skorpion Zinc Mine, Namibia for field studies. Controlled experiments, where the relationship between changes in fluorescence rise kinetics and inhibition Of CO2 assimilation were determined, were also conducted. Analysis of OJIP transients revealed that drought induced a quicker fluorescence rise in both species under all experimental conditions. The appearance of a K and I peak in the fluorescence transient suggested inhibition of the oxygen evolving complex and limitations in electron transport respectively. Down-regulation of photochemical activity occurred predominantly through photosystem II (PSII) reaction center deactivation. The performance index (PIABS), a parameter derived from the OJIP transient by means of the JIP-test (translation of original fluorescence measurements into biophysical expressions quantifying the stepwise flow of energy through PSII), was a very sensitive indicator of the physiological status of plants under both field and laboratory conditions. A very good correlation existed between decline in CO2 assimilation capacity and decline in PIABS values, which provides evidence linking changes in OJIP fluorescence rise kinetics during drought under both field and laboratory conditions with changes in overall photosynthetic capacity. Moreover, an integrated down-regulation of the whole photosynthetic process occurred in such a fashion that the intrinsic balance between electron transfer reactions and reductive carbon metabolism was maintained. The OJIP transient appears to hold considerable promise as a tool for dissecting the drought response of photosynthesis in desert ecosystems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines periodontal disease as well as other oral health indicators of the Jomon population in order to understand variations in their lifestyle and their response to dietary diversity. The oral conditions of three Jomon populations in Late Jomon period are evaluated using two periodontal indicators, namely the distance measured between the cement-enamel junction to the alveolar crest (CEJ-AC distance), and the degree of inflammation of the alveolar septum. The incidence of affected individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease ranges from 31.8% to 38.6% based on the evaluation of the CEJ-AC distance, and from 38.4% to 66.0 % based on the interdental septum morphology, respectively. Comparisons of the inter-site difference (which includes that between coastal and inland populations) and sex differences were conducted with a combined dataset of the periodontal and oral health indicators (caries, antemortem tooth loss, wear, and chipping). The results indicated that inter-site and inter-sex differences are smaller in the cases with periodontal disease than in those with caries and antemortem tooth loss. In particular, almost no difference was found in the periodontal conditions between the coastal and inland sites. Although previous studies have indicated the effect of occlusal wear on the CEJ-AC distance, the results of the multivariate analysis show that the inflammation of the inter dental septum is more relevant than the occlusal wear. In addition, the sex difference was significant compared to the inter-site difference, and each sex difference within a site showed a common trend. Detected inter-site and sex differences are discussed and assumed to be associated with bioarchaeological background.

AB  - For soils to be considered hydric, they must demonstrate both saturation and anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil. Although several technologies are available for monitoring of soil water tables, documentation of reducing conditions is more problematic. This has led to recent interest in the use of IRIS (indicator of reduction in soils) tubes. IRIS tubes are lengths of PVC pipe coated with ferrihydrite paint, which are inserted into the soil to document reducing conditions. Observations from preliminary studies led us to postulate soil temperature will affect the degree and rate of reduction and removal of ferrihydrite from the IRIS tubes. To quantify the impact of soil temperature on ferrihydrite reduction and removal from IRIS tubes, a time series experiment was designed such that IRIS tubes were placed into a hydric soil for time periods ranging from 7 to 28 days, between February and June, 2004. Water tables were monitored daily, Eh was measured at depths of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50, cm on a weekly basis, and soil temperature was recorded every 4 hours. Removal of ferribydrite from IRIS tubes was not constant during periods of anaerobiosis and was related to soil temperature. At temperatures below 2 degrees C, there was essentially no measurable ferrihydrite reduction, even though soil redox potentials fell within the Fe(II) stability field. As soil temperatures increased between 2 and 8 degrees C, the quantity of ferrihydrite reduction increased with time. At soil temperatures between 8 and 20 degrees C, substantial (35% to 45%) ferrihydrite paint was reduced and removed from IRIS tubes within 7 days. For a given temperature, there was greater reduction of ferrihydrite in zones closer to the soil surface, presumably due to higher amounts of oxidizable organic matter in near surface horizons.

AB  - To study the side slip and rollover threshold of large bus in slope-curve section under adverse weather, factors that affect the safety of large buses that run in slope-curve section, such as rain, snow, cross-wind environmental factors, and road geometry, were analyzed to obtain the friction coefficient of the road surface under different rainfall and snowfall intensities through field measurements and to determine the six-component force coefficient of wind that acts on large buses through wind tunnel tests. The force analysis of large bus in slope-curve section was carried out, and the mechanical equations of large bus under the limit conditions of sideslip and rollover in slope-curve section were established. TruckSim simulation test platform was used to establish a three-dimensional road model and large bus mechanical model at a design speed of 100 km/h. Input parameters, such as cross-wind speed and road friction coefficient, simulate the impact of wind-rain/snow coupling. Under the combined action of wind-rain/snow, the operation test of large bus in slope-curve section was carried out, and the key parameters and indicators of the sideslip and rollover of large bus in slope-curve section were outputted and analyzed. The sudden change point of lateral acceleration is the judging condition for sideslip of large bus in slope-curve section under different road friction coefficient (0.2-0.7), changing from 0.15m/s(2) and stabilizing to 0.52 m/s(2), and a 0N vertical reaction force of the inner tire is the critical judging condition for rollover under road friction coefficient0.8, and the operating speed thresholds were proposed under different road friction coefficient. This study is expected to provide theoretical support for the speed limit of large bus in slope-curve section under adverse weather.

AB  - In order to establish genotypic plasticity and stability of the yield components in triticale, data from three years field trial have been used. The main structural yield components (number of spikes per m(2); plant height, cm; spike length, cm, number of grain per spike; mass of grain per spike, g) of five triticale varieties are determined. The modified model of Eberhart and Russel was applied. The coefficients of the linear regressions b(k) characterize the average variety reaction to changes in the climatic conditions, show his plasticity and give opportunity to prognosticate the researched parameter in the range of the investigated conditions. The main parameter, which estimates the variety stability, is the dispersion S-k. The more the dispersion of the stability Sk to zero tends, the less the empirical values of the signs distinguish from the theoretical values, located on the regression line. The plasticity of the indicator Nr. of spikes/m(2) is with the highest values by the varieties AD-7291, Sadovec and Rakita. According to the varieties Rojen and Zaryad this indicator is with lower values. By the both linear parameters-Plant height and Spike length the triticale varieties react on the same way. The triticale varieties react to the environmental conditions and to the components Nr. of grain/spike and Mass of grain/spike almost equally. The stability values are contrariwise proportional to the varieties plasticity regarding the components Nr. of spikes/m(2) Plant height and Spike length. According to the both signs, related to the grain ( Nr. of grain/spike and Mass of grain/spike) no similar tendencies are have been observed. The yield plasticity coefficient correlates positive with all yield components. By the yield stability coefficient there is a positive correlation by the Nr. of spikes/m2 and the Mass of grain/spike, and negative by the component Plant height.

AB  - Declines in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in aquatic environments can lead to conditions of hypoxia (DO 2mg/L), which can directly and indirectly affect aquatic organisms. Direct effects include changes in growth and mortality; indirect effects include changes in distribution, movement, and interactions with other species. For mobile species, such as the pelagic filter-feeding Gulf Menhaden Brevoortia patronus, indirect effects are more prevalent than direct effects. The northern Gulf of Mexico experiences one of the largest areas of seasonal hypoxia in the world; this area overlaps spatially and temporally with the Gulf Menhaden commercial purse-seine fishery, which is among the largest fisheries by weight in the United States. Harvest records from the Gulf Menhaden fishery in 2006-2009 and fine-scale spatial and temporal predictions from a physical-biogeochemical model were used with spatially varying regression models to examine the effects of bottom DO concentration, spatial location, depth, week, and year on four response variables: probability of fishing, total Gulf Menhaden catch, total fishery effort, and CPUE. We found nearshore shifts in the probability of fishing as DO concentration declined, and we detected a general westward shift in all response variables. We also found increases in CPUE as DO concentration declined in the Louisiana Bight, an area that experiences chronic, severe hypoxia. The overall effects of environmental conditions on fishing response variables appeared to be moderate. Nevertheless, movement of either Gulf Menhaden or the purse-seine fishery in response to environmental conditions could potentially affect the susceptibility of Gulf Menhaden to harvest and could therefore influence assessment of the stock and associated stock status indicators.Received March 4, 2014; accepted June 26, 2014

AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), commonly used to regulate sanitary water quality, cannot discriminate among sources of contamination. The use of alternative quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods for monitoring fecal contamination or microbial source tracking requires an understanding of relationships with cultivated FIB, as contamination ages under various conditions in the environment. In this study, the decay rates of three Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene markers (AllBac for general contamination and qHF183 and BacHum for human-associated contamination) were compared with the decay rate of cultivated Escherichia coli in river water microcosms spiked with human wastewater. The following five sets of microcosms were monitored over 11 days: control, artificial sunlight, sediment exposure, reduced temperature, and no autochthonous predation. Decay was characterized by estimation of the time needed to produce a 2-log reduction (t(99)). No treatment-associated differences in the decay of the 4 targets were evident except with reduced predation, where E. coli, qHF183, and BacHum markers had lower levels of decay by day 3. However, there were substantial target-associated differences. Decay curves for the AllBac marker indicated a larger persistent population than those of the other targets. Exposure to sunlight, sediment, and reduced predation resulted in more rapid decay of the human-associated markers relative to cultivable E. coli, but there were no differences in t(99) values among the 4 targets under control conditions or at reduced temperatures. Further evaluation of epidemiological relationships will be needed in order to relate the markers directly to health risk. These findings suggest that the tested human-associated markers can complement E. coli as indicators of the human impact on sanitary water quality under the constrained conditions described in this paper.

AB  - Petrographic and geochemical results of a study carried out on a suite of samples from the Silurian Qusaiba Member of the Qalibah Formation in Saudi Arabia were evaluated in order to determine how the vitrinite-like reflectance of graptolites and chitinozoans (zooclasts) relates to other organic geochemical data. The sample set includes a range of maturities from immature (less than or equal to 0.5% VRe) to post-oil-expulsion mature (0.9-1.0% VRe) as determined from pyrolytic data (T-max from Rock-Eval pyrolysis), thermal alteration index (TAI), and liptinite fluorescence. Data compiled in this study indicate that the reflectance values measured on graptolite and chitinozoan fragments were higher than equivalent vitrinite reflectance based on other geochemical maturity indicators. For example, pyrolysis T-max and biomarker maturity indicators that indicated immaturity for the Silurian source rock had a graptolite and chitinozoan reflectance of more than 0.6%. A well that had a maturity equivalent of about 0.9% vitrinite reflectance at the source rock horizon had a graptolite and chitinozoan reflectance of 1.2%. Because of this discrepancy between the reflectance of graptolites and chitinozoans and other maturity indicators, an attempt was made to determine what factors may control the reflectance of graptolites. If it is assumed that the graptolites and chitinozoans act like vitrinite during maturation, then one reason for the discrepancy between the measured graptolite and chitinozoan reflectance and the vitrinite reflectance equivalents from conventional maturity indicators may be due to the environmental conditions during deposition or preservation of the organic matter. At the immature to early mature sites, the source rocks that were deposited under dysoxic conditions had higher random reflectance values than the site deposited under anoxic conditions.

AB  - Sustainable forestry plays an important role in applying forest management measures. In many forests, management is oriented towards closer natural forest processes. Silvicultural systems that retain some part of the trees in the stand, such as shelter wood cuttings have been introduced. The aim of the study was to evaluate the early changes of ground vegetation after shelter wood cuttings in sites of different soil fertility gradient in pine dominated stands on sandy soils in the European hemiboreal zone. The Scots pine stands in which first step of shelter wood cuttings was applied were investigated. The stands were selected in fresh (normal humidity) sites according to soil fertility gradient: very poor, poor and medium fertility soils. All mosses, lichens, herbaceous vegetation and dwarf shrubs were recorded, and projection cover was estimated in June-August. Ellenberg's indicator figures were used to evaluate site conditions. In shelter wood cuttings (5-6-year-old) the number of species was higher in medium fertile sites than in very poor sites. After shelter wood cuttings the abundance of herbaceous species increased in all sites, while the abundance of mosses and lichens decreased. Within the first year after shelter wood cuttings, the abundance of Ericaceae species decreased, and abundance of Rosaceae and Poaceae species increased. Average Ellenberg's indicator values showed that site conditions changed after shelter wood cuttings. The changes were more intensive in medium fertile sites than in poor sites. After shelter wood cuttings the richness and abundance of ground vegetation changed. The intensity of change differed in sites of certain soil fertility and was caused by alteration of site conditions, which were more homogenous in sites of the certain fertility in uncut stands than in cuttings.

AB  - The biotransformation study of difficult-to-degrade opioid analgesic methadone (MTHD) was performed by activated sludge culture adapted to high concentration of methadone (10 mg/L). The study included determination of elimination kinetics of the parent compound, taxonomic characterization of microbial culture, identification of biotransformation products (TPs) and assessment of ecotoxicological effects of biotransformation processes. The chemical analyses were performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas the ecotoxicological assessment was made based on determinations of toxicity to freshwater algae. Changes of the adapted sludge culture during the experiment were followed using the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Depending on the experimental conditions, the elimination efficiency of methadone (10 mg/L) varied from 9% to 93% with the corresponding half-lives from 11.4 days to 1.5 days. A significantly faster elimination (t(1/2) from 1.5 days to 5.8 days) was achieved at cometabolic conditions, using glucose-containing media, as compared to the experiments with MTHD as a single organic carbon source (t(1/2) = 11.4 days). Moreover, increased biotransformation rate following the additional supplementation of ammonia, revealed a possible importance of nitrogen availability for the transformation at cometabolic conditions. The elimination of parent compound was associated with the formation of 3 different TPs, two of which were identical to main human metabolites of MTHD, 2-Ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) and 2ethy1-5-methy1-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EMDP). EDDP represented over 90% of the total TP concentration at the end of experiment. The biodegradation of MTHD was associated with a pronounced drop in algal toxicity, confirming a rather positive ecotoxicological outcome of the achieved biotransformation processes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the temporal transferability of species distribution models (SDMs) and their potential implications for bird conservation. We quantified the loss and fragmentation of Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus and Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus habitats over 13 years (2001-2014) in a highly dynamic landscape in north-western Spain. For this purpose, priority habitats for the target species were modelled at four different spatial scales using an ensemble forecasting framework. To explore the temporal transferability of our ensemble predictions, the models were back-projected to the land cover conditions in 2001 and evaluated using historical occurrence data. In addition, models calibrated with historical data were projected to the land cover conditions in 2014 and evaluated using updated occurrence data. Changes in availability and connectivity of suitable habitats between both years were estimated at four spatial scales from a set of widely-used indicators. SDMs showed a good predictive accuracy but with limited temporal transferability due to changes in the species-habitat relationships between 2001 and 2014. The results showed a decrease in the avaliability of suitable habitats of 33.4% and 47.7% for Montagu's Harrier and Common Kestrel, respectively; with the subsequent increase in their fragmentation. However, our estimates were found to be strongly dependent on the scale of analysis and model transferability. Changes in habitat availability and connectivity ranged from -48% to +54% for Montagu's Harrier, and from +116% to +5.6% for Common Kestrel. We call for caution when using SDMs beyond the model calibration time period to guide bird conservation. This is especially important for raptors, often characterised by low population sizes and large home ranges, and particularly sensitive to unstable, highly dynamic environmental conditions. In light of these results, specific, long-standing monitoring protocols remain essential to ensure accurate modelling performance and reliable future projections.

AB  - This study compared the impact of three indirect heating systems to direct gas flame heaters on a selection of flock performance and environmental indicators in commercial broiler units. No statistically significant differences (P >= 0.05) were found in flock mortality rates, bird weight, water consumption, stress response, carbon dioxide, ammonia, temperature, relative humidity, litter quality, within-flock Campylobacter levels or mean Campylobacter counts when flock data from any of the three indirect heating systems were compared to flocks reared in houses with direct heating systems. Differences in litter quality were observed between upper and lower litter layers in all houses, regardless of heating type, which may have implications for bird health and welfare. Carbon dioxide concentrations in houses with direct heating systems were significantly higher than those in houses with indirect heating systems during the first 10 days of bird life (P <= 0.05). This was due to the increased use of heating systems during this period of the flock cycle. Differences in CO2 concentrations had no effect on flock performance, possibly due to the fact that concentrations did not exceed known safe levels. A statistically significant increase in stress response was observed in birds as a result of partial depopulation (thinning) within houses, irrespective of heating system type used (P <= 0.05). Stress associated with thinning may have consequences for bird welfare and food safety. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that indirect heating systems do not appear to negatively impact on flock performance, stress response, within-flock Campylobacter levels or mean Campylobacter counts and do not appear to significantly alter environmental conditions within broiler houses when compared to houses equipped with direct heating systems. Indirect systems are a viable alternative for heating broiler houses in terms of flock performance, bird welfare and food safety.

AB  - Conservation efforts to better understand how wildlife populations respond to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance has led to a proliferation of research examining physiological indicators of stress response in wildlife. Glucocorticoid stress hormones (GCs), typically cortisol and corticosterone, are among the most frequently measured indicators of the vertebrate stress response. To review the current state of research on stress physiology of free-ranging animals and its application to conservation, we canvassed more than 1000 articles on GC measures in wildlife published since 1969. For 454 studies published since 1990, we assessed the most commonly analysed correlates and disturbances and conducted a meta-analysis on commonly studied species. We noted a prominent divide in the legacies of fish-related analyses and those of higher order vertebrates and the need and opportunity to transfer knowledge between fields. Fish studies most frequently measured physiological indicators, condition, and the relationship between stress and mortality, whereas other vertebrate studies most frequently measured reproduction, condition, and environmental correlates. Correlates that significantly influenced GC levels across all vertebrate groups and are thus important to control for in study design and analyses include density and dispersal of conspecifics, season, reproductive status, and social status. Consistent trends across commonly studied species included positive GC response to capture and handling, reduced GC response related to acclimation, and a lack of correlation between condition and baseline GC levels. Our synthesis within and across diverse taxonomic orders reveals substantial research coverage but a lack of depth in multivariate analyses and a disparity in how correlates are controlled. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of correlates and disturbances that influence GC measures and, as such, has useful applications to assist conservation physiologists in study design, analysis, and interpretation.

AB  - Noise pollution can be considered as the most important problem of urban environmental management in mega metropolises and urban transportation is the main source of the mentioned problem. This study aims to investigate the amount of traffic noise dose received by traffic policemen in Tehran; District I Municipality. The investigation was conducted during three consecutive months in 2007 in 282 locations of the main streets of studied district which are known for its heavy traffic, as well as population flow. In order to measure the noise volume, pre-calibrated Cell -450 and Quest - 2900 sound level meters were used. Regarding to noise dosimeter, 158 cases were measured using a dosimeter Cell -320. For this purpose, L-eq, L-10, L-max and L-min indicators were used. The results showed that the L-eq average during peak traffic load hours and in the least traffic conditions was 77.2 +/- 2.1 and 64.5 +/- 2.2 dB, respectively which were higher than the acceptable levels (550). Moreover, the statistical results showed the significant differences between light and heavy traffic conditions and also the direct effect of heavy traffic on noise pollution, also it was shown that vehicles traffic is the main source of the produced noise pollution. The study created a related questionnaire which evaluated the traffic policemen behavior from them and their relative's point of views. The results showed that noise pollution has damaging effects on their behavioral conditions and also, on their personal assessment. The policemen believed their psychological disorders and their relative had also the same opinion. This study attempted to show that noise pollution in metropolises such as Tehran is a serious problem and it is should be treated as a top priority in the urban environmental management in order to reduce noise pollution.

AB  - We evaluate the potential of the geographic and within-sediment distribution patterns of rust-coloured shell encrustations on an abundant subtidal bivalve, Axinopsida serricata (Carpenter, 1864) as geochemical indicators of organic enrichment from marine municipal outfalls. The progressive development of shell encrustation over the life of the animals is suggested by heavier encrustations on large shells compared to smaller shells regardless of the geochemical conditions of the habitat. Heavy encrustations decline in an exponential manner at sediment acid volatile sulphide (AVS) levels >7 mu mol/g. Analyses show that the reddish shell encrustations are from an amorphous iron oxide or hydroxy-oxide likely micro-biologically mediated: the oxides appear to be embedded within the inner matrix of an organic layer, with a chemically distinct outer layer. A schematic model is proposed which shows how enrichment of labile organic carbon around outfalls affects the availability of dissolved iron in sediments and leads to less extensive encrustations on bivalve shells. Predominantly sandy sediments with low organic loading have much less potential for iron oxide deposition than silty sediments due to greater oxygen penetration into the Surface sediment.
   Shell encrustation appears to be relatively persistent and indicative of long-term conditions, regardless of spatial and temporal fluctuations in sediment geochemistry. With more research on development over the life-cycle of the animal, the pattern of A. serricato shell encrustation has the potential to rapidly provide a map Of Cumulative labile organic loading and oxygen penetration of sediments around municipal outfalls on the west coast of North America where this species is common. However, caution must be used in interpreting results, since background sediment characteristics (substrate type, bottom currents and sediment transport) can affect encrustation patterns.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - The study is introducing an overview of main trends in the approach to the questions of intellectual migration in framework of UNESCO project ''Problems of brain drain in Europe''.
   One of the most important problems, affecting the development of countries of Middle and Eastern Europe, which are going through process of transformation to the market economy, is problem of intellectual migration. The first meeting of working group of BD was realized on the base of invitation of Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation during November 26 - 28, 1990 in Lisbon and led directly to the creation of UNESCO project ''Brain Drain Issues in Europe'' and its coordinating group (Task Force).
   From 1990 the problem of mass intellectual migration is dealt with in post-communist countries on actual level, but very rarely on level of expert articles and scientific studies. Basically, it is necessary to distinguish ethnic migration from work migration, when intellectual migration can have ethnic dimension (ethnic discrimination of scientist), or labor dimension (an opportunity to work in better conditions).
   Brain Drain has two main aspects - positive and negative. Because science of today is without boundaries (Hryniewicz 1992), scientific discoveries because sooner or later property of all humankind. In this sense the phenomenon of BD is highly positive. Negative consequences are noticeable in countries, from which scientists are departing and are very serious, namely from long term perspective. BD for one country (or for science in general) means profit - Brain Gain, but for other country it a long term loss - Brain Drain. Polish study is analyzing Brain Flight or simply migration, not Brain Drain, which is enabling to accept so called push - pull factors. It is a set of inverse factors, which can have social nature (social status of scientist), economic (financial evaluation of scientist), psychological (conditions for scientific work) or others. These factors in home country imply a noticeable ''mechanism of pressure'' (push), but in receiving country abroad function as positive ''attracting mechanism'' (pull). Brain Drain is not only movement of intellectual capital (Teplan 1991), that is personal BD, but also ''draining of results''- escape of knowledge and information.
   From the aspect of mobility we can summarily discern: 1. internal mobility of scientists - physical movement among sectors of one country, so called internal BD, 2. internal mobility of ideas - communication network among sectors and regions of one country, 3. external mobility of scientists - movement with the intention to visit other countries in context of scientific exchange, scholarships, conferences, and so on, 4. external mobility of ideas - international communication network, 5. external migration of scientists - reasonably stable flow of scientists into other countries - authentic, so called external BD (Murris 1993). We talk about BD only in the case, when an emigrant is working in his (her) field, or proceeding in enhancement of qualification in new (better) conditions. In case when an emigrant is working in other field and gradually is loosing qualification, some authors are talking about Brain Waste.
   Generally valid factors of BD: insecurity and instability of socio-economic development of countries of Middle and Eastern Europe during the transition to market economy, decrease in long term capital investments into the sphere of research and development, low ability of research centers and individual scientists to withstood competition, lack of qualified management in science in environment of free market.
   Influence of mentioned push - pull factors imply following transfer of intellectual potential (personal and informational) from less developed countries into the more developed and is enabling real function of so called conception of ''center - periphery'', oriented on identification of direction of transfer of intellectual resources. Stated concept is not universally applicable, but it is expression of dominant direction of BD. Solving of methodological questions of BD research is an important step in aim for coordination, comparability precision and representativity of research activities. In the actual stage of BD research, the approaches and methods are applied on level of national studies and are offering only an overview of realized and potentially possible processes. In reason to solve problem of intellectual migration not only on level of facts and quantitative analysis, but create also suitable theoretical and conceptual hinterground, Trestieni (1991) is suggesting several possible initial approaches. Phenomenon of BD is possible research from the aspects of theory of justice; where basic direction is research of degree of satisfaction (or dissatisfaction). This approach is giving the possibility to answer if that what scientist is receiving from the society for his (her) work (and life), is justful or not. Second approach is coming out of theory of social comparison and its findings are answering the question of scientists' satisfaction when compared with the other people.
   For the research of BD is interesting also so called competition model (K. Willis, N. Ritchey), which accentuate significance of differences of average salaries of various groups of population. More complex, in the aspect of compared indicators, is so called gravitational model, which is enabling to observe and compare differences among territorial units (zones). Theory of quality of life (D. Sandu) is leading researched phenomena towards such factors as availability of certain products (goods) necessities and luxuries, existence of adequate network of services, interpersonal relations, differences in the hierarchy of life needs - primary (food, place to stay) and operative (selfrealization).
   In many national studies a potential BD is observed, which is - according to stated data - percentually extraordinarily high. Numerous suggestions exist to create a typology of scientists in general and emigrant scientists with the minimum of proven difference in at least several levels.
   Phenomenon of BD is interesting also from the aspect of activities of emigrants in receiving country. Occasionally, in frame of elaborated national analyses, there are studies focused on one concrete area of scientific research (Trestieni 1993 BD in physics). With the exception of stated possibilities and suggestions of methodological procedures, part of research of BD phenomena is also an analysis of main directions (flows) of BD. In reason to secure the real possibilities to coordinate the work on UNESCO project, the concrete procedures were suggested (Vyrost 1991), which, unfortunately, were not kept by participating countries. These procedures, in line with the planned analyses, divided the research space into three main phases: The first phase of analysis of socio-economic, political and cultural conditions of country; the second phase of global quantitative analysis of scientific and development base; and the third phase of research of latent BD in concrete conditions of basic research (sociologic probe) with the aim to state a diagnosis of objective and subjective factors of BD. Dynamics of development of BD was intended to be observed during the years of 1988 - 1993 with the specific focus on selected scientific fields - physics, biology, computer sciences and economy.

AB  - Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are widespread, tightly regulated, protein delivery apparatuses used by Gram-negative bacteria to outcompete their neighbours. The pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, encodes two T6SSs. These T6SSs are differentially regulated by external conditions. T6SS1, an antibacterial system predominantly found in pathogenic isolates, requires warm marine-like conditions and surface sensing for activation. The regulatory network that governs this activation is not well understood. In this work, we devised a screening methodology that allows us to easily monitor the outcome of bacterial competitions and thus to identify mutants that are defective in T6SS1-mediated bacterial killing. The methodology, termed Bacterial Competition Fluorescence (BaCoF), relies on detection of a fluorescent signal as an indicator of the survival and growth of a T6SS-sensitive, GFP-expressing prey that has been co-cultured with mutants derived from a T6SS(+) attacker of interest. Using BaCoF, we screened a random transposon insertion mutant library and identified genes required for V. parahaemolyticus T6SS1 activation, among them TfoY and Tmk. We used epistasis experiments to determine the relationships between the newly identified components and other regulators that were previously described. Thus, we present here a detailed biological understanding of the T6SS1 regulatory network.

AB  - Although there is not a sole satisfactory methodology that applies universally up to now, aggregate stability has been proposed as an indicator of soil physical quality (SPQ). Difficulties persist when comparison of aggregate stability from different procedures are performed. The objective of this study is to evaluate appropriate aggregate stability methods that enable to distinguish the SPQ condition of both temperate and tropical medium-textured soils. Among different methods tested, results show that wet sieving using the well known fast wetting methods of Kemper & Rosenau and of Le Bissonnais rendered similar results in both environments. The mean weight diameter value of both methods for assessing aggregate stability can be considered as a dependable indicator of soil structure status for comparing soils. These aggregate stability methods are in correspondence with only one out of the eight SPQ indicators when entirely soils were used. It was concluded that the aggregate stability should be used judiciously and in concert with other indicators for an overall assessing of the SPQ condition. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the activity of several biomarkers in carp, Cyprinus carpi L., to determine their response to xenobiotics, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), in the Meric Delta. Fish were collected from contaminated sites and from areas regarded as relatively less contaminated in four sampling periods. Hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST), carboxylesterase (CaE), lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and acid phosphatase activities were measured as biomarkers in the fish. For all fish, the condition factor and hepatosomatic index, were calculated to determine the condition of the fish. The results of this study indicated that the mean GST activity showed an increase in fish from the Meric-Ergene junction site and a decrease in Enez site with respect to fish from Meric site. Furthermore, the study shows that spatial and temporal changes of biomarkers such as GST and CaE might be useful for the assessment of environmental contamination in the Meric Delta.

AB  - Diatom and water samples were collected from 145 river sampling stations in Finland. The relationship between benthic diatom taxa and measured environmental variables was explored using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A weighted averaging (WA) regression model was developed to infer phosphorus concentrations of river water. The optima and tolerances of the diatom species were obtained from the WA regression. The performance of the WA model was assessed using correlation coefficients and the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) between the observed and inferred phosphorus concentrations. The model was cross-validated using an independent test set. The predictive power of the WA model was good (r = 0.91; RMSEP 13.9 mug P/l) in the training set. The weighted averaging also performed well in the independent test set (r = 0.87; RMSEP 15.6 mug P/l). The correlations were only slightly lower and predictive errors larger than in the training set. The weighted averaging gives a tool to evaluate tropic conditions in different ecoregions with the species optima list suitable for prevailing conditions and water quality.

AB  - Shelled almonds of two Italian varieties, Romana and Pizzuta, peeled and unpeeled, were roasted and packed under different conditions: air (control), vacuum, and Maillard reaction volatile compounds (MRVc) derived from the roasting process. Samples were stored for similar to8 months at room temperature, without light, and, at regular intervals, were collected and analyzed to evaluate the progress of lipid oxidation. Peroxide values, triglyceride oligopolymers, and oxidized triglycerides were evaluated during the storage time. Results showed that, although the MRVc atmosphere did not protect the lipid fraction of almonds as well as the vacuum condition; nevertheless, it was more protective than the control atmosphere, showing an antioxidant effect. The effect of the natural coating was a strong protection against lipid oxidation; in fact, only the unpeeled samples showed peroxide values lower than the threshold of acceptability (25 milliequiv of O-2/kg of oil). Moreover, at the end of the storage period, Pizzuta almonds showed a greater deterioration than those of the Romana variety.

AB  - Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to undergo stable development of a phenotype under given environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability arise from the disruptive effects of a wide range of environmental and genetic stresses, and such deviations are usually measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry and phenodeviants. In this review, evidence is presented for a general relationship between health and developmental stability since the prevalence and the intensity of infections with parasites generally are associated with elevated developmental instability. The only exception is developmental stability in secondary sexual characters sometimes being positively associated with an increased frequency of venereal disease. Four studies have reported an elevated susceptibility to parasites among individuals with high levels of developmental instability. The cause of the positive relationships between parasitism and developmental instability may be either the generally poor condition of developmentally unstable individuals, or such individuals having genetically determined poor resistance to parasites as also reflected in an elevated level of developmental instability. The general relationship between parasitism and developmental instability has important implications for studies of parasite-host relationships in general and for conservation biology in particular.

AB  - The morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), curly birch (B. pendula Roth var. carelica), and downy birch (B. pubescens Ehrh.) at early stages of ontogenesis in natural conditions were investigated. Some intra-and interspecific peculiarities of the morphophysiological properties were determined. Priority development of the underground mass for the seedlings of curly birch and that of the aboveground mass for the seedlings of silver birch and downy birch were found. The leaf of curly birch is developed more actively as compared with those in the other two species under equal potential possibility of the growth of their leaves by elongation. A high similarity of the mineral composition (C, N, P, K) of different forms and species of birches was demonstrated. For silver birch the maximum values of the stomatal conductance, rate of photosynthesis, and transpiration under similar atmospheric and soil conditions were obtained. In downy birch we found a higher efficiency of water use. The highest values of the maximum rate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase carboxylation were found in curly birch. This may serve as an indicator of its shade tolerance, as compared with silver birch and downy birch.

AB  - Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) are promising approaches for generating power from medium or low temperature heat sources. In this regard, ORCs can be used to indirectly produce power from solar energy. Due to intermittent nature of solar energy, storage unit should be coupled with solar ORCs to improve the output power and operating hours. In this article, studies on solar ORCs integrated with various types of storage units were reviewed; the main findings of such studies were extracted and provided. Based on the findings, several factors such as the temperature and pressure at the inlet of the turbine, as well as the operating condition affect the performance of solar ORCs with thermal storage unit just like the conventional ORCs. In addition, the optimum size of the storage unit in the solar ORCs was found to depend on the operating condition. From the financial perspective, it can be noted that the storage unit affects the corresponding indicators. Moreover, the improvement rate in the ORCs by applying storage units could be affected by the configuration of the system.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of local anthropogenic activity on the marine environment around the remote harbor of Qeqertarsuaq, West Greenland. Blue mussels (Mytilus sp.) were used as a bioindicator, and their physiological condition was found to decrease with increasing proximity to the harbor. Subsequently, the distribution of 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 9 groups of alkylated PAHs were measured in mussel and sediment samples. The highest values were found in a rocky collection area 15 m from a wooden pier frequented by small boats. A PAH source investigation, indicated a mixed source from light fuel oils and creosote used as boat coating. Finally, correlations between the mussels morphological condition and the PAH pollution were found to be significant for 4-, 5-, and 6-ring PAHs. In conclusion, the results indicate that pollution sources in harbors have significant effects on the local environment and should be considered in arctic conservation research.

AB  - A three steps methodological approach is developed in order to assess the effectiveness of wastewater asset management under critical conditions. Rare data and poor investments are two main causes of weakness to reach an effective asset management. They put managers under severe conditions. In the first step of the proposed methodology, results of a survey conducted amongst services of the National Sanitation Office in several Algerian cities, on wastewater assets, are presented and discussed. In total, network-related information, such as pipe materials, age, hydraulic characteristics, manholes number and types, damage nature and frequency, was acquired. Depending on the data collected and their importance for urban sanitation, statistical analyses were performed. The second step treats the efficiency of maintenance activities by analysing data collected from different technical reports of offices. In the end, an explanation of the main characteristics of the Algerian wastewater asset management system is described, as well as the efforts required to achieve the ISO-55000 standard recommendations are identified. As results, two performance indicators are proposed allowing a comparative study between the wastewater networks of two Algerian cities.

AB  - The morphology of Carbonate platforms may be influenced by tectonic activity and eustatic variations. 3D seismic data and satellite imagery are used in order to investigate the morphological similarities between present-day carbonates platforms, East of Borneo Island and Miocene carbonate platforms of the South China Sea. The morphological similarities exhibit platform fragmentation, that could be caused by subtle faulting, sufficient to drown reef rims; platform contraction, which is a result of back-stepping of the reef margin during a relative sea level rise and polygonal patterns in internal lagoons, described as mesh reefs in modern platforms and possibly interpreted as karst in Miocene platforms.
   Vertical movements may trigger the formation of new geomorphological conditions that modify the distribution of coral growth with respect to the new hydrodynamic conditions in space and time. These movements (uplift and tilting) reduce and localize the space necessary for the coral ecosystem, explaining the contraction leading to drowning of parts of and, ultimately, the whole platform.

AB  - Multimedia mass balance models differ in their treatment of spatial resolution from single boxes representing an entire region to multiple interconnected boxes with varying landscape properties and emission intensities. Here, model experiments were conducted to determine the relative importance of these two main factors that cause spatial variation in environmental chemical concentrations: spatial patterns in emission intensities and spatial differences in environmental conditions. In the model, experiments emissions were always to the air compartment. It was concluded that variation in emissions is in most cases the dominant source of variation in environmental concentrations. It was found, however, that variability in environmental conditions can strongly influence predicted concentrations in some cases, if the receptor compartments of interest are soil or water-for water concentrations particularly if a chemical has a high octanol-air partition coefficient (K-oa). This information will help to determine the required level of spatial detail that suffices for a specific regulatory purpose.

AB  - We designed and built a microfluidic mixer based on the principle of hydrodynamic focusing governed by Navier-Stokes equation for single-molecule kinetics experiments. The mixer is a cast of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sealed with transparent fused-silica coverglass, which results in low fluorescence background and broad biological compatibility and this enables single-molecule fluorescence detection under nonequilibrium conditions. The pressure regulated sample delivery system is convenient for loading a sample and allows for precise and stable flow velocity control. The combination of microfluidic mixer and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) allows us to measure the time course of the distribution of the smFRET efficiency in protein folding. We used the fact that denatured protein collapses much faster than the mixing process to characterize the mixing time using donor and acceptor dyes labeled staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) as an smFRET efficiency indicator. By monitoring the smFRET efficiency of denatured SNase during the course of mixing, we determined that the mixing time was 150 ms under conditions suitable for single-molecule detection.

AB  - Vehicle exhaust emissions are a dominant feature of urban environments and are widely believed to have detrimental effects on plants. The effects of diesel exhaust emissions on 12 herbaceous species were studied with respect to growth, flower development leaf senescence and leaf surface wax characteristics. A diesel generator was used to produce concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) representative of urban conditions, in solardome chambers. Annual mean NOx concentrations ranged from 77 nl l(-1) to 98 nil l(-1), with NO:NO2 ratios of 1.4-2.2, providing a good experimental simulation of polluted roadside environments. Pollutant exposure resulted in species-specific changes in growth and phenology, with a consistent trend for accelerated senescence and delayed flowering. Leaf surface characteristics were also affected; contact angle measurements indicated changes in surface wax structure following pollutant exposure. The study demonstrated clearly the potential for realistic levels of vehicle exhaust pollution to have direct adverse effects on urban vegetation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Time temperature integrators or indicators (TTIs) are effective tools making the continuous monitoring of the time temperature history of chilled products possible throughout the cold chain. Their correct setting is of critical importance to ensure food quality.
   The objective of this study was to develop a model to facilitate accurate settings of the CRYOLO(R) biological TTI, TRACEO(R). Experimental designs were used to investigate and model the effects of the temperature, the TTI inoculum size, pH, and water activity on its response time.
   The modelling process went through several steps addressing growth, acidification and inhibition phenomena in dynamic conditions. The model showed satisfactory results and validations in industrial conditions gave clear evidence that such a model is a valuable tool, not only to predict accurate response times of TRACEO(R), but also to propose precise settings to manufacture the appropriate TTI to trace a particular food according to a given time temperature scenario.

KW  - ORIGIN
AB  - Clay mineral crystallinity and crystallite (domain) size data determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) are methods extensively used in the characterization of very low-grade metamorphic conditions. However, the lack of sufficient interlaboratory standardization has made comparisons between different research groups unreliable due to significant variations in numerical results obtained, a consequence of the different machine conditions, measurement methods and sample preparations used during analysis. A calibration approach to the standardization of data using rock chip standards is presented, which allows data sets produced by different research groups to be directly and quantitatively compared. A standardized scale, the crystallinity index standard (CIS), is proposed, with illite crystallinity anchizonal boundary limits of 0.25-degrees DELTA2theta and 0.42-degrees DELTA2theta, and equivalent illite crystallite sizes of 52 and 23 nm, respectively, determined by the Warren-Averbach method. Calibrating both old and new data will enable more reliable comparisons between similar and contrasting geological environments, and should improve the accuracy and reliability of correlations made between XRD data and other indicators of very low-grade metamorphism, hence increasing the value of such clay mineral studies.

AB  - From the perspective of sustainable development and based on literature review, this paper introduces modified Delphi and Decision Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to explore the critical factors of sustainable development in rural areas and their correlation. Through literature review and modified Delphi analysis, nine key factors of rural sustainable development are first identified, namely industrial activation, working environment, living conditions, infrastructure, public involvement, rural culture, government-related departments, educational resources, and health and welfare. DEMATEL is then adopted to determine the classification of the aforementioned factors, in which four (government-related departments, public involvement, infrastructure, and educational resources) are classified in the cause group and five (health and welfare, living conditions, rural culture, working environment, and industrial activation) are classified in the effect group. According to the centrality and relation of these factors, the causal network diagram is finally drawn before making practical suggestions based on the overall results, with a view to providing a reference for decision-makers in their follow-up rural sustainable development planning.

AB  - Microalgae have been shown as a potential bioresource for food, biofuel, and pharmaceutical products. During the growth phases with corresponding environmental conditions, microalgae accumulate different amounts of various metabolites. We quantified the neutral lipids accumulation and analyzed the swimming signatures (speed and trajectories) of the motile green alga, Dunaliella primolecta, during the lag-exponential-stationary growth cycle at different nutrient concentrations. We discovered significant changes in the neutral lipid content and swimming signatures of microalgae across growth phases. The timing of the maximum swimming speed coincided with the maximum neutral lipid content and both maxima occurred under nutrient stress at the stationary growth phase. Furthermore, the swimming trajectories suggested statistically significant changes in swimming modes at the stationary growth phase when the maximum intracellular neutral lipid content was observed. Our results provide the potential exploitation of microalgal swimming signatures as possible indicators of the cultivation conditions and the timing of microalgal harvest to maximize the lipid yield for biofuel production. The findings can also be implemented to explore the production of food and antibiotics from other microalgal metabolites with low energy costs.

AB  - When evaluating the atmospheric environment in regional strategic environment assessment (R-SEA), the variation and choice of the spatial scale have a substantial influence on the conclusions of the assessment. In this study, we used numerical simulation to investigate the spatial-scale effect. Two varying spatial extents and two varying spatial details of pollutant emission data (emission inventories in this case) were provided for numerical modeling, and output distributions of atmospheric pollutants at different air pollution levels were compared. The results show that the resolution and spatial range of data collection do indeed influence the atmospheric prediction and assessment results in R-SEA. The spatial-scale effect is more significant under the air pollution condition than under excellent and good air quality conditions. A comparison of varying spatial extents of emission inventory shows that narrowing the prediction area to a local scale is more conducive to identifying the impact of local pollution sources. A comparison of varying spatial details of emission inventory indicates that a higher resolution is favorable for identifying local high concentrations of pollutants and their locations.

AB  - In this work, bio-based platform molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was synthesised under mild conditions (90 degrees C) from D-fructose using as media a mixture of dimethyl carbonate:tetraethyl ammonium bromide (DMC:TEAB). This solvent system resulted in a efficient production of HMF in the presence of both Amberlyst-15 (heterogeneous catalyst) and BF3O(Et)(2) (homogeneous catalyst). HMF was recovered from the reaction mixture with or without minimal work-up. It is noteworthy that this synthetic approach provided high yielding product also when performed in a large-scale. Quick reduction of HMF to the related 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan was also conducted to further confirm the proposed procedure. Besides, the materials efficiency metrics of the optimized DMC-based synthetic approach have been compared to alternative syntheses for HMF reported in the literature. This latter study takes into consideration synthetic routes that employ D-fructose as substrate, easy accessible catalysts and report detailed procedures and evidence of the isolation of HMF.

AB  - Supermarket chains require benchmarking and analysing refrigeration performance in order to manage their energy efficiency investments. This paper contributes in robustly assessing refrigeration system energy and carbon performance in which commonly believed drivers are used to conduct correlations. Based on this, refrigeration connected load, store opening hours and external temperature were found to construct a more representative energy performance indicator (EPI) than other metrics. By using such an indicator, it is possible to identify poor performing systems from an estate portfolio and thus select sites suitable for energy saving measures. Furthermore, energy impact from introducing natural refrigerants is examined using empirical data from a UK supermarket chain. It was found that CO2 systems have different seasonal performance than HFC systems, nonetheless on an annual basis no system has a clear edge over another. Lastly, other initiatives such as cabinet night blinds and suction pressure optimisation achieved 10% and 7% energy reduction respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ipomoea nil (L.) Roth. cv. 'Scarlett O'Hara' was evaluated as a tropical bioindicator species sensitive to ozone (O-3). A total of nine field experiments were performed, with 28 days of exposure each. Visible leaf injuries, carbon assimilation (Asat) and stomatal conductance (gs) were quantified and correlated to oscillations in environmental conditions and accumulated ozone exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb h (AOT40). The values of gas exchange and leaf injury continuously varied throughout the study period. Asat and leaf injury (chlorosis) were higher in spring than in others seasons. The gs was higher in autumn. The analyses of the abiotic and biotic variables revealed an opposing trend between the Asat and both leaf injury and AOT40. Ozone levels were moderate and its relationship with gs was inverse. This may be the cause of the moderate injury. 'Scarlett O'Hara' is sensitive to O-3 and has potential as an O-3 bioindicator in sub-tropical regions.

AB  - During the service life of a pavement, it is oft en required to conduct Non-destructive tests (NDTs) to evaluate its structural condition and bearing capacity and to detect damage resulting from the repeated traffic and environmental loading. Among several currently used NDT methods, the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is the most commonly used pavement NDT method applied by many transportation agencies all over the world. Non-destructive testing of pavements using FWD is typically accompanied by the prediction of the Young's modulus of each layer of the pavement structure through an inverse analysis of the acquired FWD deflection data. The predicted pavement layer modulus is both an indicator of the structural condition of the layer as well as a required input for conducting mechanistic-based pavement structural analysis and design. Numerous methodologies have been proposed for back-calculating the mechanical properties of pavement structures from NDT data. This paper discusses the development of an Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combined with Finite Element Modeling (FEM) for the inverse analysis of the multi-layered flexible pavement structures subjected to dynamic loading.

AB  - Predators' feeding strategies lie on a continuum between energy maximizers, who maximize the energy obtained from a patch of food, and time minimizers, who minimize the time required to get a fixed ration of food from a patch. Carnivores that feed on large prey should adopt a time-minimizing strategy by maximizing their active-consumption rate (ACR) if they evolved under conditions of high competition from group members, and conversely adopt an energy-maximizing strategy if they evolved under conditions of low competition from group members and were thus able to monopolize their prey. By provisioning animals with large pieces of ungulate carcasses, we measured ACR for captive gray wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). In accordance with a con specific-competition hypothesis, ACR increased with sociality. Other factors influencing ACR included subject body mass and food type, ACR being significantly faster on muscle and organs than on bone and hide. Measuring ACR is crucial to empirical and theoretical studies assessing foraging decisions and may be used as an indicator of an animal's competitive environment.

AB  - A finite element formulation is developed to predict the vibration of cylindrical shells conveying fluid. The method is based on the three-dimensional theory of elasticity and the 'linearised Eulerian equations. The hydrodynamic pressure is derived from the condition for dynamic coupling of the fluid-structure and the Eulerian equation. The influence of initial stresses within the shell due to fluid pressure is taken into account. Predicted natural frequencies for fluid-shell systems in the radius-to-thickness ratio range of R/h = 38.96-1624 are compared with published experimental results to validate the model, and are also compared with results obtained using other finite element models (based on the classical shell theory and potential flow theory) to demonstrate advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy. The effect of variation in flow velocities and hydrostatic pressures on the dynamic behaviour of fluid-conveying shells is examined, and the influence of supported conditions on the free vibration is also discussed.

AB  - The sensorial relationships of predators to plant and prey are seldom taken into account in biological control programmes. However, methods of conditioning, attracting and/or settling predator populations may result from a knowledge of their visual and/or olfactive sensorial capacities. The study of the visual capacities of Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Col., Coccinellidae), a species used in France for aphid control, was undertaken to this aim with artificial targets and dummies. Larvae and adults of this coccinellid seemed to present 'a long distance' vision (perception of geometric shapes) and 'a short distance' vision (perception of aphid-like dummies). This vision, which is more accurate in adults, allows this coccinellid to change the orientation of its movement in order either to contact the targets (or the dummies), or to walk close to them. Under field conditions, these visual capacities may participate in the localisation of tall objects such as plants. After plant exploration, which is controlled by internal factors (tropism) and external ones either physical (leaf vein and edge) or chemical (plant secretion due to aphid infestation, olfactive trails, honeydew or pheromones), visual capacities may also participate in prey perception.

AB  - The intrinsic processing quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars is modified significantly by cultural conditions and climate. In an attempt to understand the biochemical basis of such variation, environmental modification of flour protein content and composition was measured. Thirty hard red winter wheat cultivars and experimental lines were gown at 17 Nebraska environments during 1990 and 1991. Environmental conditions, including grain filling duration, temperature and relative humidity during grain filling, were monitored. Grain yield and test weight also were determined as environmental indicators. Significant linear correlations between flour protein content, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, were observed only with the duration of grain filling. Protein quality, as measured by SDS sedimentation volumes and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, was highly influenced by the frequency of high temperatures during grain filling and by the relative humidity. Observed ranges in genotypic responses (variance) at locations also were altered by environmental factors. Optimal protein quality, as determined by SDS sedimentation volumes, was observed with exposure to less than 90 h of temperature greater than 32 degrees C during grain filling. Protein quality declined with exposure to a greater number of hours of elevated temperature. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Life-history theory predicts that organisms inhabiting harsh environments such as high altitudes should invest less in reproduction and more in survival. Testis size is associated with the intensity of male-male competition for mating and thus may be treated as an indicator of male reproductive investment. Hence, it may be expected that organisms will reduce their testis size with increasingly harsh environments. Here we test this prediction in a toad species, Scutiger boulengeri, endemic to the Tibetan plateau using data from three populations located at altitudes of 4078, 4276, and 4387 m. Consistent with the prediction, male toads exhibited smaller testes at higher altitudes, despite the relatively narrow altitudinal span. It is likely that cold climates and strong seasonality constrain the ability of high-altitude male toads to allocate more energy into reproduction, thereby leading to small testis size. In addition, the left testis was significantly heavier than the right one and the degree of size asymmetry was unrelated to either altitude or body condition.

AB  - Because of unknown faults and fractures in the overlying rock, CO2 stored deep underground may move upward, and the intrusion may impact shallow groundwater quality. After leakage of CO2 has ceased, the affected aquifer may show remediation capacity under natural conditions and injections and extractions. In this study, the reactive transport modeling software TOUGHREACT was used to simulate the remediation capacity of a study aquifer. The simulation results show that the intrusion of leaked CO2 would decrease the pH of the target aquifer and trigger the dissolution of calcite minerals. After CO2 leakage has ceased, the pH would increase as would the concentration of Ca because of the dissolution of calcite along the flow path. Scenario simulation results of amelioration of groundwater quality by water injection and extraction show that single injection is the best option and a combination approach of injection and extraction could control the range of the affected area. The pH value should not be regarded as the single indicator for remediation capacity assessment. Parameter sensitive analysis results show that the rates of injection and extraction affect the repair results significantly.

AB  - Lipid-free polyethylene membrane tubing (LFT) has been further developed in response to a growing need for an inexpensive and simple time-integrative sampling device for dissolved hydrophobic contaminants in water. The LFT sampler is based on the diffusion of dissolved hydrophobic target compounds through the aqueous boundary layer and into the polyethylene membrane, mimicking uptake by organisms. We demonstrate through laboratory and field validation studies that LFT provided the same benefits as many other passive sampling devices, without the potential of analytical interference from lipid impurities. A total of 370 LFTs and semipermeable membrane devices were deployed for 21 days in paired studies at highly urbanized, undeveloped, and two Superfund sites, representing several river conditions. A simple internal surrogate spiking method served as an in situ calibration indicator of the effects of environmental conditions on the uptake rates. A modified extraction method for the LFT increased recoveries while decreasing solvent use and labor compared to other organic extraction procedures. LFT sampling rates were estimated using ratios, in situ calibration and modeling for over 45 target analytes, including PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides.

AB  - Mount Papuk is a geologically valuable area of the Republic of Croatia, with numerous natural springs hidden in its forests. In order to determine the quality of selected spring water, we carried out an investigation where we were determining the presence of coliform bacteria as the main indicators of water pollution. Additionally, we examined the survival possibility of deliberately added coliforms into the microcosms with quartz sand in laboratory conditions. After collecting and analysing samples from four selected springs (Jankovac, Kokocak (Vucenovic), Muska voda and Zervanjska), the results showed that water from the spring Kokocak (Vucenovic) was unsuitable for drinking due to increased total number of microorganisms and coliform bacteria, whereas the other tested springs were shown as suitable for human use. Furthermore, the spring Muska voda proved to be the spring with the highest quality of water, both with respect to tested parameters and survival inability of inoculated coliforms that persisted in the microcosms of the other springs. In order to verify the results, we repeated the investigation of the spring Muska voda. This time, the persistence of inoculated coliforms, including a larger increase in aerobic mesophilic bacteria in microcosmic condition, proved possible.

AB  - Salt deposits are commonly used as indicators of different paleoclimates and sedimentary environments, as well as being geological resources of great economic interest. Ordinarily, the presence of salt deposits is related to warm and arid environmental conditions, but there are salts, like mirabilite, that form by cooling and a concentration mechanism based on cooling and/or freezing. The diagenetic transformation of mirabilite into thenardite in the upper part of the lower Miocene unit of the Tajo basin (Spain) resulted in the largest reserves of this important industrial mineral in Europe. This unit was formed in a time period (similar to 18.4 Ma) that, in other basins of the Iberian Peninsula, is characterized by the existence of particular mammal assemblages appropriate to a relatively cool and arid climate. Determining the origin of the thenardite deposits as related to the diagenetic alteration of a pre-existing mirabilite permits the establishment and characterization of the sedimentary environment where it was formed and also suggests use as a possible analog with comparable deposits from extreme conditions such as Antarctica or Mars.

AB  - It is increasingly being recognized that different types of entrepreneurs exist with different performance levels and different contributions to the economy. Two common classifications of entrepreneurship types are based on professional status and start-up motive, where independent own-account workers are assumed to perform better than dependent self-employed and opportunity entrepreneurs are assumed to perform better than necessity entrepreneurs. However, these supposed performance differentials are seldomly tested or quantified. Using recent data drawn from the European Working Conditions Survey for the EU-28, we explore self-employment earnings (as an indicator of performance) across these different entrepreneurship types. Our results from OLS and multilevel linear regressions show that dependent self-employed workers are indeed observed to have significantly lower earnings than independent own-account workers, but the difference is only 10%, suggesting that the precarious nature of the dependent self-employed may be overstated in certain policy circles. Regarding start-up motive, our paper highlights the importance of distinguishing the group of entrepreneurs who simultaneously have both opportunity and necessity motives to start a business.

AB  - Predictions of the diffuse dispersion of metals from outdoor constructions such as roofs and facades are necessary for environmental risk assessment and management. An existing predictive model has been compared with measured data of copper runoff from copper sheets exposed at four different inclinations facing four orientations at two different urban sites (Stockholm, Sweden, and Milan, Italy) during a 4-year period. Its applicability has also been investigated for copper sheet exposed at two marine sites (Cadiz, Spain, for 5 years, and Brest, France, for 9 years). Generally the model can be used for all given conditions. However, vertical surfaces should be considered as surfaces inclined 60-80 degrees due to wind-driven effects. The most important parameters that influence copper runoff, and not already included in the model, are the wind and rain characteristics that influence the actual rainfall volume impinging the surface of interest.

AB  - Inactivation of indigenous indicator micro-organisms such as faecal coliforms, coliphages, and faecal streptococci was investigated in a full-scale biogas plant that mainly digested cow manure. The biogas plant consisted principally of a feed reservoir, fermentation tank (37 degrees C), heat-inactivation process (70 degrees C), and five reservoirs for the heat-inactivated, digested manure that was used by a local livestock farmer as liquid fertilizer. Although all the indicators tended to exhibit stepwise decreases with each stage of treatment, coliphages were found to be more capable of surviving than faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci under mesophilic anaerobic conditions as well as high temperature conditions (heat-inactivation at 70 degrees C). Liquid fertilizer produced at the biogas plant had faecal coliform densities less than the stipulations of the US EPA 40 CFR 503 Class A limits. Heat-inactivation tests indicated that although coliphages exhibited more tolerance than other bacterial indicators between 37 and 70 degrees C, they were more sensitive to continuous temperature increase than faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated modelling approach to simulate and assess ecological effects of physical habitat changes in rivers. An ecohydraulic simulation tool was created by combining a 1D hydraulic model based on HEC-RAS software and the fish habitat module of CASiMiR, a fuzzy logic-based ecohydraulic modelling system. This tool was applied on a river stretch commonly occurring in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. in particular the effect of weir removal on habitat suitability for bullhead (Cottus gobio L.) was simulated. Physical conditions of the studied stretch after weir removal were simulated with a hydraulic model. CASiMiR linked these conditions to ecological expert knowledge to calculate habitat suitability for three life stages of bullhead at four different flow rates based on fuzzy logic. Results indicated that after weir removal, habitat suitability increased significantly for all life stages and all flow rates. The presented approach is promising regarding fish community assessment and ecological river engineering. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salinity is amongst the leading abiotic stresses which adversely affects the crop productivity. It brings multiple disorders in normal plant functionality and suppresses yield up to drastic level. Under subjection to salinity, maize crop interacts differently with different environmental conditions and shows different responses. Plants interact positively, negatively and sometimes no interaction with environment for various plant traits. Genotype x Environment Interaction ( GEI) of maize genotypes with three salinity levels was studied for some selected morpho-physiological traits i.e. root shoot ratio, cholorphyll a, cholorphyll b, beta-carotenoids, ascorbic acid, root density and leaf temperature using AMMI biplot analysis. OH41, OH28, OH8, USSR40 and WM13RA for root shoot ratio ( RSR) and A556 for beta-carotenoids ( BCart) were proved stable genotypes whereas; all other genotype interacted with stressed conditions either positively or negatively. Ascorbic acid and beta-carotenoid contents were proved good indicators of salt tolerance in maize plant. AMMI biplot analysis proved to be an effective technique for study of GEI. Stable genotypes can be regarded for further breeding program.

AB  - Late Cretaceous foraminiferal and calcareous nannoplankton assemblages from the northern part of the Tarcau Nappe, Hangu Formation in the northern Eastern Carpathians are documented in order to reconstruct paleoenvironmental settings and biostratigraphy. The foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by flysch-type agglutinated taxa suggesting bathyal environments, close to the calcite compensation depth (CCD), and mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions. The morphogroup analyses display variations in tubular and infaunal morphotypes suggesting different levels of oxygenation and seafloor disturbance caused by currents. Reddish hemipelagites containing only agglutinated foraminifera (dominant infaunal forms) occurring in the middle part of the section suggest an increase of water depth and changes in redox conditions. Based on foraminifera, the deposits were assigned to planktonic Globotruncana ventricosa and agglutinated Caudammina gigantea Zones. The first occurrence of Uniplanarius trifidus and last occurrence of Reinhardtites anthophorus demonstrate the presence of Late Campanian UC15(c)(TP)-UC16/CC21-CC23 calcareous nannoplankton Zones. Foraminiferal and nannofossil assemblages in the red beds have a high potential for stratigraphic correlation on a regional scale.

AB  - Environmental vector-borne diseases are plaguing much of the world and are a serious concern on a global scale. Many of these diseases are clearly associated with specific environmental conditions and landscape variables. The science and technology associated with remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are suitable for identifying these environmental targets. Since vector-borne diseases are most often found in tropical environments and during rainy seasons with persistent cloud cover conditions, radar is an important sensor for monitoring and mapping the environmental indicators of disease. Preliminary investigations using RADARSAT-1 C-band horizontal transmit, horizontal receive (C-HH) imagery have proven especially useful for identifying wetland habitats and flooded areas. It is anticipated that the advancements associated with upcoming RADARSAT-2 sensors will improve the science of mapping vector-borne disease risk in tropical areas, particularly with access to increased spatial and temporal resolution and fully polarimetric data. This paper discusses the concept of using radar remote sensing for epidemiology applications, results using RADARSAT-1 for malaria risk mapping in coastal Kenya, and expected results with the advanced capabilities of RADARSAT-2.

AB  - Yeast cells encounter a variety of environmental stresses during brewing and must respond to ensure cell survival. Cells can respond to stress by inducing a Heat Shock Response in which heat shock proteins (Hsps) are synthesized. In laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the heat shock protein, Hsp104, plays a major role in the acquisition of tolerance to a variety of stresses such as heat, ethanol and sodium arsenite, and as such acts as an excellent stress indicator. The induction of Hsp104 in bottom-and top-fermenting brewery strains was examined when grown under laboratory and industrial fermentation conditions, and it was found that each brewing strain exhibits its own unique pattern of Hsp 104 expression. During industrial fermentations, brewery strains are capable of mounting a stress response at the early stages of fermentation. However, as the fermentation proceeds, the response is repressed. The results suggest that conditions experienced in industrial brewing prevent the activation of the stress response. This study increases our understanding of alterations in gene expression patterns during the brewing process, and yields information that will aid in the definition of best practice in least management.

AB  - Symphytum officinale L., as a hyperaccumulator, was pyrolyzed into biochar at 350, 550, and 750 degrees C, respectively. PTEs could be enriched in biochars except Cd volatilized greatly at 750 degrees C. In order to evaluate the environmental acceptability of biochars, a series of sequential and single extractions and biochar oxidation procedures were performed for simulating different environmental conditions. There was a sharp decline in PTEs release under various conditions when the temperature above 550 degrees C, indicating PTEs might transform into more stable forms at higher temperature. Thus, increasing the pyrolysis temperature is helpful for reducing biochar phytotoxicity, suppressing biochar leaching and improving biochar environmental safety. Moreover, the economic feasibility analysis of the biochar confirmed the practicability of it. Findings from this work illustrated that biochars pyrolyzed from Symphytum officinale L. at the temperature higher than 550 degrees C might be environmental acceptable, which is beneficial for biochar application.

AB  - The development of suburban residential areas influences the increasingly growing disparities between residential areas of a local municipal network. Real positive indicator values of settlements are usually used by planners to characterise the residential quality of a suburban settlement and to decide on its future development. These values frequently differ from choices made by urban residents on living under conditions of such interpretive suburban residential quality. It is the essence of spontaneous development in suburbs. This article aims to devise an integrated evaluation instrument that combines the objective and subjective evaluation of the quality indices of suburban residential environment. It introduces the following topics: (1) the identification of subjective and objective indices of the suburban residential environment; (2) development of the previous conceptual model of subjectively and objectively integrated quality indices used for the assessment of the suburban residential environment, and (3) comparison of suburban settlements by the existing conditions of the residential quality and the quality of the residential environment expected by potential residents. This piece of work is a part of a wider research.

TI  - Defining indicators to assess socially responsible enterprises
T2  - FUTURES
LA  - English
KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - Concern for the social responsibility of business by both the public and enterprises themselves has been growing since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The private sector's relative unconcern with Apartheid in South Africa, poor and dangerous products, and environmental disasters have all led concerned people to question the relative social autonomy of business. As Government's tire of social expenditures and the public become weary of paying taxes, the future corporation will have to take its share of responsibility for social concerns more than ever before. Globally, the worlds' production cannot eventually end up going to the lowest common denominator, ie the country with the lowest social costs, the most paltry wages, poorest working conditions, and those with meager pensions for the old. In practice this means that beggar-thy-neighbor rent-seeking by enterprises whereby production is allocated to the poorest but cheapest working conditions must come to an end. Consumers, too, will insist that the enterprises of the future must be more socially responsible both within and outside their workplaces. What sorts of indicators to measure what will be a 'socially responsible enterprise' of the future is the subject of this paper. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that tropical storms and hurricanes are among the leading causes of shipwrecks in the Caribbean Sea since 1492. This paper will explore the relationship between shipwrecks and hurricanes in the Western Caribbean, particularly Roncador Cay, a place with complex environmental conditions that have made this area a trap for ships, but has up until now, been without rigorous shipwreck analysis. This study covers the period 1492 to 1920 with search results of 23 shipwrecks and 37 tropical cyclones compiled in databases, reviewing seven wrecks already documented and revealing new information on 16, previously not recorded. The sources provide detailed shipwrecks, demonstrating that most accidents occurred by unspecific causes and no direct relationship with hurricanes but were influenced by environmental conditions, such as geomorphology, cold fronts, or currents. There is also a reflection on the sociocultural changes and the influence of power in the region. The study includes a suggested tool for future research, protecting the wreck site and emphasizing the importance of the underwater cultural heritage as an indicator of the active maritime past.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural nanoparticles that play important roles in intercellular communication and are increasingly studied for biosignalling, pathogenesis and therapy. Nevertheless, little is known about optimal conditions for their transfer and storage, and the potential impact on preserving EV-loaded cargoes. We present the first comprehensive stability assessment of different widely available types of EVs during various storage conditions including -80 degrees C, 4 degrees C, room temperature, and freeze-drying (lyophilisation). Lyophilisation of EVs would allow easy handling at room temperature and thus significantly enhance their expanded investigation. A model enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, was loaded into different types of EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells and cancer cells. Using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation we proved that the model enzyme is indeed stably encapsulated into EVs. When assessing enzyme activity as indicator for EV stability, and in comparison to liposomes, we show that EVs are intrinsically stable during lyophilisation, an effect further enhanced by cryoprotectants. Our findings provide new insight for exploring lyophilisation as a novel storage modality and we create an important basis for standardised and advanced EV applications in biomedical research.

AB  - This study applies two different complementary statistical techniques to examine the structure and determinants of homeownership and consumption of household goods among immigrants in Israel. Findings from partial-order analysis (POSAC) reveal significant differences between immigrant groups by type, rather than level, of household characteristics. Suppliers of entertainment (television) and of information-communication (computer) are the items that most strongly distinguish between immigrants. The joint direction of the partially ordered space corresponds with home and car ownership. Immigrant groups are dispersed in different parts of the household typology; with increased duration of residence in Israel immigrants move, albeit in varied rhythms, toward improved housing conditions. A complementary logistic regression analysis, which controls for socio-demographic variation and detailed tenure in Israel, show a likelihood of convergence of immigrants from all origin countries with the core native-born group in owning a home. For other household goods, the findings largely coincide with the typology derived from POSAC. The findings are discussed in reference to three conceptual expectations of "cultural norms", "adjustment", and "structural-environmental considerations".

AB  - The influence of light exposure, bottle color and storage temperature on the quality parameters of Malvasia delle Lipari (MdL) sweet wine were investigated. Wine samples bottled in clear-colored (colorless, green and amber) glass were stored under different artificial lighting conditions, in order to simulate the retail environment (one cool-white, fluorescent lamp) and to perform an accelerated test (four and six cool-white, fluorescent lamps). The storage temperature was kept constant (25 degrees C) for the first 90 days of the experiment and then samples were monitored for up to 180 days at higher temperatures (30, 35 and 40 degrees C). The principal enological parameters, total phenols, color, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2-furaldehyde (2F) contents were studied. The shelf-life test pointed out minimum variations of the basic chemical parameters, while the quality attributes most affected by lighting were color, together with HMF and 2F levels which, hence, can be considered as indicators of the severity of storage conditions.

AB  - The present study was undertaken with the aim to examine the relationship between temperature and humidity and milk production traits in Guanzhong dairy goats reared in China, and to assess the possibility of future genetic selection in dairy goats for increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, thereby improving goat farm management in China. Production data included 149 Guanzhong dairy goats with the first-lactation collected throughout 2019. The traits investigated were milk yield, and indicators of milk composition of Guanzhong dairy goats. For high temperature, significant and marked daily milk yield drops, up to 16% (about 0.23 kg/d per head) were observed in July and August when compared with the other months. The fat content, protein content, and dry matter were significantly lower in July and August. Importantly, milk production traits present significant correlations with high temperature, while high humidity had little effect on milk composition of Guanzhong dairy goats. Therefore, the adverse environmental conditions on farm profit is not negligible, and the strategies could be improving the goat farm management as well as obtaining thermotolerant animals through genetic selection.

AB  - The microbial quality of drinking and environmental water is usually determined by culture-based detection of fecal indicator bacteria according to ISO reference methods 16649-1 and 7899-2, respectively. Because of an increasing demand for rapid, culture-independent methods, we tested three quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approaches for the simultaneous detection of both, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., using either 16S rRNA or 16S rDNA as a target molecule. Filter sterilized drinking water was artificially contaminated with bacteria from either high or low nutrient culture conditions and directly analyzed after membrane filtration without any other enrichment. Depending on the culture condition used, qPCR analyses revealed a lower limit of detection of 1-10 E. coli/100 ml and 10-100 E. faecalis/100 ml, respectively. In addition, the microbial quality of different surface water samples was monitored. The analyses revealed a clear correlation between viable cell counts and qPCR data. However, the safe and reliable detection of 1 CFU/100 ml failed.

AB  - Monitoring chronic impacts of nearshore pollution on fish in Atlantic marine systems is challenging due to the mobility and seasonal nature of most habitat use. We evaluated Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) as a potential indicator of pollution across a gradient of contaminated sites in the Saint John River Estuary, New Brunswick, Canada. Fish returning from offshore in the spring showed no differences in length, weight, or condition factor between sites, but a graded response in condition factor appeared gradually, consistent with levels of contamination. Gonad size peaked in early June, however no differences in GSI were found among sites. By September, most fish collected were young of the year, with a significant bias towards female juveniles at the exposed site. These results indicate that Atlantic silverside are locally resident during their onshore period, and demonstrates their potential as a sentinel species. Sampling should focus on early June prior to the full moon to ensure maximal exposure periods before spawning, or in late October to evaluate growth as fish grow rapidly prior to offshore movement.

AB  - Major environmental problems in metallic mining areas come from the hazard of metal pollution of surrounding areas. Therefore, an appropriated management of these soils is necessary for minimizing the associated risks. Some properties of mining soils, such as elevated metal concentrations, pH and shortage of essential nutrients make them a poor medium for organism growth. Therefore, in order to make a stabilization of these mining areas, it is necessary to solve previously some adverse physical and chemical soil factors mainly associated to toxic heavy metals and soil structure. Thus, some wastes such as carbonate, demolition wastes and sewage sludge, were added to soils to provide the needed conditions for improving soil conditions. The aim of this research was to assess the soil evolution after amendments addition in a research area placed in the Cartagena-La Union Mining District, SE Spain. This assessment was carried out by means of microbial community evolution and variation as an indicator of soil changes. Mining soils showed, in general, low numbers of microorganisms, and significant increases in microbial populations were observed after soil treatment.

AB  - Aroma compounds in packaged extra virgin olive oil can be present naturally or be derived through oxidative degradation under favorable conditions of temperature, light, and oxygen availability. In this study, the identity and quantity of flavor compounds were determined for extra virgin olive oil packaged in 0.5-L glass, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(vinyl chloride) bottles and stored at 15, 30, and 40degreesC under fluorescent light or in the dark for 1 yr. A set of mathematical equations concerning the rates of the most fundamental oxidation reactions in the oil was prepared and numerically solved, and the reaction constants were estimated for specific temperature values. Mainly, the presence of fluorescent light, followed by elevated temperature, stimulated oxidative alterations in the olive oil. Separated and identified flavor compounds were recorded for all the olive oil samples. Based on their abundance and evolution in the oil samples, those most clearly describing oxidation were hexanal, nonanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-heptenal, and 2-pentyl furan. These compounds could be used as markers of the oxidation process to monitor and describe the quality of packaged olive oil quantitatively.

AB  - Many lungfish of the tooth plated lineage, both fossil and living, are affected by dental and skeletal pathologies including dental caries, abscesses and cysts within the bone or tooth plate, osteopenia, bone hypertrophy, and malocclusion. These conditions, while influenced in part by structural relationships of soft and hard tissues in the tooth plates, jaw bones and surrounding oral tissues, can also be used as indicators of the kind of environment inhabited by the fish. The disease processes have specific structural consequences, related either to the pathology or to attempts to heal the damage, and usually alter the form and function of the tooth plate or bone. Consequently they can be distinguished from postmortem diagenetic or taphonomic effects, which alter the structure in less specific ways and show no sign of healing. Dental caries, the most common pathological condition in dipnoan dentitions, is recognisable in lungfish from the Devonian of Western Australia, the Tertiary of South Australia and the Northern Territory and from living lungfish in south east Queensland. Other pathologies have a more sporadic occurrence.

TI  - The effects of human intervention in the water regime
T2  - GROUND WATER
LA  - English
AB  - Water tables in the Netherlands have fallen due to human interventions in the water regime, causing hydrological degradation, particularly over the last 50 Sears, Factors responsible for this hydrological degradation are increased agricultural crop production, changes in land use, increased drainage, lowering of the drainage base, and increased ground water abstractions. Additionally, variations in the water regime have been caused by differences in meteorological conditions over a number of Sears. The physically based ground water and surface water model SIRIGRO was used to predict the effect of these human interventions. The analysis was carried out in three regions in the Netherlands and various scenarios were defined to represent the man-induced changes over the last 50 Sears, Changes in natural recharge of ground water and mater tables were used as indicators for the hydrological degradation, The calculations show that the natural recharge increases when water tables are deep. Variations in meteorological conditions over the last 50 years have a pronounced effect on the natural recharge, and the effect is greater than the changes caused by any of the human influences. The lowering of the drainage base causes the greatest change in ground mater tables.

AB  - The performance of LiDAR sensors deteriorates under adverse weather conditions such as rainfall. However, few studies have empirically analyzed this phenomenon. Hence, we investigated differences in sensor data due to environmental changes (distance from objects (road signs), object material, vehicle (sensor) speed, and amount of rainfall) during LiDAR sensing of road facilities. The indicators used to verify the performance of LiDAR were numbers of point cloud (NPC) and intensity. Differences in the indicators were tested through a two-way ANOVA. First, both NPC and intensity increased with decreasing distance. Second, despite some exceptions, changes in speed did not affect the indicators. Third, the values of NPC do not differ depending on the materials and the intensity of each material followed the order aluminum > steel > plastic > wood, although exceptions were found. Fourth, with an increase in rainfall, both indicators decreased for all materials; specifically, under rainfall of 40 mm/h or more, a substantial reduction was observed. These results demonstrate that LiDAR must overcome the challenges posed by inclement weather to be applicable in the production of road facilities that improve the effectiveness of autonomous driving sensors.

AB  - Fingermarks have long been recognized as one of the most reliable and valuable evidence for personal identification. In practice, fingerprint analysis primarily concentrates on latent fingerprint visualization. However, fingerprint visualization techniques do not always enable individualization when fingermarks collected in crime scenes are fragmentary, ambiguous, or deformed. Age determination techniques based on physical and chemical composition changes in fingerprints over time have attracted researchers' attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the components of fingerprints are liable to factors including donor features, deposition conditions, substrate properties, environmental conditions and revealing methods. All the influences mainly contribute to unreliable outcomes of age estimation. Recent developments in fingermark age determination have moved forward to more precise approaches. The advanced methods can be classified into two categories including techniques based on the modifications of physical characteristics and chemical composition characteristics. Herein, the review includes the five types of variables that influence the aging process. The methodologies are subsequently highlighted along with their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, photography, optical, microscopy and electrochemical methods, and vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are summarized in detail, with an emphasis on their utilization.

AB  - Globorotalia truncatulinoides oscillations have been recorded from different marine sediment cores collected in the central and western Mediterranean Sea. The abundances of this species over the last 500 yrs. demonstrates its potential value as bio-indicator of particular oceanographic condition during the Maunder Minimum (MM) event of the Little Ice Age (LIA). The comparison between the G. truncatulinoides abundance patterns of the Balearic Basin, central and south Tyrrhenian Sea and central and eastern Sicily Channel allows to highlight a similar response of this species during the MM event in the central-western Mediterranean Sea. The ecological meanings of this species and its peculiar high abundance percentages in the total assemblages suggest the development of enhanced vertical mixing conditions during MM winter season with a strong advection of nutrients from the nutrient-rich deeper layers and enhances the productivity levels in the mixed layer. The intensified vertical mixing could be linked to persistence of an atmospheric blocking event recorded by several authors during the MM.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed 45 surface sediment samples collected in the marginal seas of the Western North Pacific, including the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Philippine Sea, to investigate the radiolarian assemblages and their relationship with upper layer environmental conditions. Based on the results of Q-mode cluster analysis, the radiolarian assemblages can be divided into four clusters, corresponding to the North Equatorial Current assemblage, North Equatorial Current Bifurcation assemblage, Kuroshio-South China Sea assemblage, and Kuroshio-East China Sea assemblage. Winter sea surface temperature (SSTw), winter sea surface salinity (SSSw), and annual silicate concentration were the most significant environmental variables associated with the radiolarian assemblages, among which SSTw showed the highest correlation with the radiolarian fauna. The significant influences of SSTw and SSSw suggested that the seasonal change of the North Equatorial Current-Kuroshio Current system exerted a crucial effect on the abundance and distribution pattern of the radiolarian fauna.

AB  - A modern air separation plant control system must solve a host of problems, including variation in conditions of plant operation with full guarantee of its automatic flow. The procedure of gearing the plant from one operation mode to another is based on gradual change of control action and collection of desired products without impairment of their quality below the allowable level. To accomplish this task, it is essential to determine the values of the key process parameters for various air separation plant operation conditions and the maximally allowable control action variation rate. Based on the investigation results and comparative analysis of the values of the key process parameters of optimized static-state regimes in UniSim Design environment and actual indicators with a real plant, we found insignificant deviation of the calculated parameters from the actual values during the plant operation. It was concluded that the results of air separation process modeling in UniSim Design environment or the magnitudes of control actions derived by equations of material and heat balances of the plant can be used, in a first approximation, in plant operation mode change algorithm.

AB  - The sediment archives in lakes and mires formed by salt solution within the floodplain of the Middle Werra river were used to detect effects of climate and landuse changes on the sedimentation regime of the river by means of high-resolution sedimentological and palynological methods. All archives of the Middle Werra valley show similar sedimentation sequences which are mainly influenced by climate until the Middle Ages and mostly affected by human activity between the Middle Ages and Modem Times. The likelihood of climatic influences in terms of wetter conditions is especially given by a clear increase of indicators for floodplain forest, reed communities and aquatics in combination with decreasing human landuse indicators in the investigation area.
   In addition, the palynological results show that the sediment input in these depressions is higher both during periods with wetter conditions and with increased human impact in the catchment. According to the fact, that during flood events the river is hydrological connected with these depressions, the minerogenic layers are suspected to be delivered during floods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bovine manure, with or without added Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (three strains), was incorporated into silty clay loam (SCL) and loamy sand (LS) soil beds (53- by 114-cm surface area, 17.5 cm deep) and maintained in two controlled-environment chambers. The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium inoculum was 4 to 5 log CFU/g in manure-fertilized soil. The conditions in the two environmental chambers, each containing inoculated and uninoculated beds of manure-fertilized soil, simulated daily average Madison, Wis., weather conditions (hourly temperatures, rainfall, daylight, and humidity) for a I March or a 1 June manure application and subsequent vegetable growing seasons ending 9 August or 28 September, respectively. Core soil samples were taken biweekly from both inoculated and uninoculated soil beds in each chamber. Radishes, arugula, and carrots were planted in soil beds, thinned, and harvested. Soils, thinned vegetables, and harvested vegetables were analyzed for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli (indigenous in manure). After the 1 March manure application, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was detected at low levels in both soils on 31 May, but not on vegetables planted 1 May and harvested 12 July from either soil. After the 1 June manure application, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was detected in SCL soil on 7 September and on radishes and arugula planted in SCL soil on 15 August and harvested on 27 September. In LS soil, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium died at a similar rate (P greater than or equal to 0.05) after the 1 June manure application and was less often detected on arugula and radishes harvested from this soil compared to the SCL soil. Pathogen levels on vegetables were decreased by washing. Manure application in cool (daily average maximum temperature of <10degreesC) spring conditions is recommended to ensure that harvested vegetables are not contaminated with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Manure application under warmer (daily average maximum temperature >20degreesC) summer conditions is not recommended when vegetable planting is done between the time of manure application and late summer. A late fall manure application will not increase the risk of contaminating vegetables planted the next spring, since further experiments showed that repeated freeze-thaw cycles were detrimental to the survival of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli in manure-fertilized soil. The number of indigenous E. coli in soil was never significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, suggesting its usefulness as an indicator organism for evaluating the risk of vegetable contamination with manure-borne S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.

AB  - The investigation of lipid biomarkers in sediments deposited during the Holocene in the Lagoon of Tunis, located at the southern edge of the Mediterranean Sea, revealed two important hopanoid biomarkers: 2-methylhopaneand 22,29,30 trisnorhop-17(21)-ene. These compounds are considered of special interest because they reveal information about climate conditions during the Late Holocene sediment deposition. These hopanoids, or bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs), indicate a considerable bacterial contribution to the organic matter preserved in these sediments.
   The occurrence of 2-methylhopanein substantial amounts indicates that cyanobacteria, Rhodopseudomonas palustris bacteria, and genus Desulfovibriobaeteria communities made large contributions to the sediment's organic content. In addition, the presence of these bacteria communities have been interpreted as reliable indicators of hydrologic modifications associated with the development of wetland systems during the Late Holocene.
   The occurrence of 22,29,30trisnorhop17(21)-ene also suggests a considerable bacterial contribution to the organic matter and indicates an immature diagenesis stage. It also reflects the development of favourable conditions to the preservation and accumulation of organic matter within an anoxic depositional environment.

AB  - The article considers the current state of the agricultural sector of the Republic of Kazakhstan and its capabilities. The role of state support for the agro-industrial complex, characterized by high capital intensity, long payback period, low profitability, and dependence on natural and climatic conditions, which makes it less competitive in comparison with other sectors of the economy, and leads to the fact that the activities of agribusiness entities is more exposed to financial risk, is shown. A comparative assessment of the financial stability indicators of agricultural formations of the dairy sector of the Grodno region of the Republic of Belarus and two agricultural producers of the Republic of Kazakhstan with similar production specialization was carried out in order to determine the likelihood of the onset of the financial crisis using statistical multi-choice models. The scientific novelty of the study is to identify promising areas for assessing the financial stability of domestic agricultural enterprises, including on the basis of studying foreign experience in diagnosing the financial crisis, which will allow predicting and developing the right managerial decision aimed at improving the financial condition of agricultural enterprises.

AB  - Despite the importance of the ecological and agricultural aspects of severe droughts, no drought monitoring and prediction framework based on a land data assimilation system (LDAS) has been developed to monitor and predict vegetation dynamics in the middle of droughts. In this study, we applied a LDAS that can simulate surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics to the Horn of Africa drought in 2010-2011 caused by the precipitation deficit in two consecutive rainy seasons. We successfully simulated the ecohydrological drought quantified by the model-estimated soil moistures and leaf area index (LAI). The root-zone soil moisture and LAI are good indicators of prolonged droughts because they reflect the long-term effects of past precipitation deficit. The precipitation deficit in 2010 significantly affected the land surface condition of the next rainy season in 2011, which indicated the importance of obtaining accurate initial soil moisture and LAI values for prediction of multiseasonal droughts. In addition, the general circulation model-based seasonal meteorological prediction showed good performance in predicting land surface conditions of the Horn of Africa drought.

AB  - In the southeastern United States, drought can pose a significant threat to forests by reducing the amount of available water, thereby stressing trees. Destructive changes in crown conditions provide the first visible indication of a problem in a forested area, making it a useful indicator for problems within an ecosystem. Forest Health and Monitoring (FHM) and Palmer's Drought Severity Index (PDSI) data from 11 states in the southeastern United States were obtained in an effort to determine the role that drought, forest type, and ecoregion have in indicating differences in crown dieback. Analyses were conducted by species groups using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. The greatest amount of total relative crown dieback occurred in red oak (18%), followed by other hardwoods (14%), and white oak (11%). Relative crown dieback varied by forest type and ecoregion with a relationship to drought in both red oak and white oak. This information will be useful for focusing future research and modeling efforts to predict forest health conditions affected by changing climate variables.

AB  - The impact of ozonation on the reduction of chlorinated disinfection by-products formation was investigated in 15 full-scale and lab-scale drinking water facilities of Quebec (Canada). Total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and the sum of six haloacetic acids (HAA6) were measured after chlorination under uniform formation conditions (UFC). Results showed that before ozonation TTHM and HAA6 average concentrations were 89.4 and 45.3 mu g/L, respectively. In full-scale ozonation conditions TTHM-UFC and HAA6-UFC reductions averaged respectively 27 and 32%. After lab-scale ozonation at a O-3/C of 1:1, a decrease of only 9% of TTHM was calculated, while for HAA6, reduction was not significantly impacted (30%). For BDOC, average concentrations of 0.13, 0.46, and 0.69 mg C/L were measured before and after and lab-scale ozonation, respectively. Chlorine demand (Cl2D) and immediate ozone demand (IOD) were found to be the most appropriate indicators to evaluate NOM reactivity after ozonation.

AB  - The at-risk-of-poverty rate is one of the three indicators used for monitoring progress towards the Europe 2020 poverty and social exclusion reduction target. Timeliness of this indicator is critical for monitoring the effectiveness of policies. However, due to complicated nature of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) poverty risk estimates are published with a 2-3 years delay. This paper presents a method that can be used to estimate ("nowcast") the current at-risk-of-poverty rate for the European Union (EU) countries based on EU-SILC microdata from a previous period. The EU tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD is used for this purpose in combination with up to date macro-level statistics. The method is validated by using EU-SILC data for 2007 incomes to estimate at-risk-of-poverty rates for 2008-2012 and to compare the predictions with actual EU-SILC and other external statistics. The method is tested on eight EU countries which are among those experiencing the most volatile economic conditions within the period: Estonia, Greece, Spain, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and Romania.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative managements in restoring a physically degraded soil after eight years. For this, an experiment managed with direct sowing (no tillage) is being conducted since 2002, in Eldorado do Sul, RS, in an Ultisol that initially was degraded naturally with a high degree of compaction. Treatments consisted of three soil cover crops in winter (fallow, oat + vetch and forage radish), two depths (0.12 and 0.21 m) of operation of the shank of fertilizer and seed drill and three traffic conditions (tractor movements, harvester and no traffic). In summer corn and soybeans are sown in annual rotation. There was an increase in the levels of soil organic matter and of its fractions, which resulted in reduced values of density and increased macroporosity and total porosity of soil. Soil bulk density was lower in soil condition not without agricultural machinery traffic. The conversion of naturally degraded field into a system of grain production using integrated management alternatives with no tillage system restores the physical quality of soil to carry out appropriately its functions.

AB  - Waste stabilization ponds are an appropriate technology for domestic onsite wastewater treatment. It is a low-cost technology, requires low maintenance, is highly efficient, mostly natural and remarkablably sustainable. In facultative ponds, the existence of an algal population is very important for the stability of the symbiotic relation with aerobic bacteria. The aim of this work is to determine the pattern of microalgae in the facultative and maturation ponds to obtain information for the operation and maintenance work. The important parameters for phytoplankton measured in this study are the organic load, temperature, light penetration, dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Methodology consists in: analysis of main water quality parameters, plankton taxonomic determination and abundance calculation related with the maintenance operations. Results show that cyanobacteria are present in under-loaded conditions and chlorophyceae are present when the pond is overloaded. Using this methodology over time we can obtain a year round pattern to use the phytoplankton as a bioindicator of the pond's conditions. Our conclusion is that the phytoplankton determination and density can be used to know the pond's performance and help the operation and maintenance tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating the Fate of Metals in Air Pollution Control Residues from Coal-Fired Power Plants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Changes in emissions control at U.S. coal-fired power plants will shift metals content from the flue gas to the air pollution control (APC) residues. To determine the potential fate of metals that are captured through use of enhanced APC practices, the leaching behavior of 73 APC residues was characterized following the approach of the Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework. Materials were tested over pH conditions and liquid solid ratios expected during management via land disposal or beneficial use. Leachate concentrations for most metals were highly variable over a range of coal rank, facility configurations, and APC residue types. Liquid solid partitioning (equilibrium) as a function of pH showed significantly different leaching behavior for similar residue types and facility configurations. Within a facility, the leaching behavior of blended residues was shown to follow one of four characteristic patterns. Variability in metals leaching was greater than the variability in totals concentrations by several orders of magnitude, inferring that total content is not predictive of leaching behavior. The complex leaching behavior and lack of correlation to total contents indicates that release evaluation under likely field conditions is a better descriptor of environmental performance than totals content or linear partitioning approaches.

AB  - In the present study, we describe a field survey regarding the effect of ambient water conditions in the accumulation of tributyltin (TBT) and its metabolites in green mussels (Perna viridis) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). The results showed that following the changes in TBT pollution levels, the accumulation of butyltins exhibited clear differences between oysters and mussels. The ratio of TBT to total butyltin (TBT:Sigma BT) decreased from 0.87 to 0.31 with increasing TBT burdens in the oysters. This status suggests that following the increases of TBT burdens, the metabolic rates of TBT were clearly enhanced in oysters; however, this phenomenon was not shown in mussels. The TBT:Sigma BT remained relatively constant at approximately 0.7 in the mussels despite the TBT burdens. Because of this phenomenon, the opposite status of different TBT burdens between oysters and mussels were present at different TBT pollution levels. These observations may provide valuable insight when evaluating or comparing TBT pollution in the environment using oysters and/or mussels as bioindicators.

AB  - The article deals with changes in the concentration of ethanol in the blood in the structure of mortality in the Stavropol region. The interval of delivery of objects to the forensic chemical Department from the regional forensic medical departments of the region is from 5 to 14 days. In this connection, it is important to determine the content of ethanol in the storage of cadaverous blood in various conditions. While stored in a common refrigerator chamber during the experiment, after 4 weeks, the level of ethanol increases, the values of which reach a level that can serve as a basis for an erroneous conclusion about the fact of alcohol consumption by the deceased before death. In samples that initially do not contain alcohol, while stored in the laboratory, a new formation of ethyl alcohol occurs; in samples that contain alcohol, the indicator is increased. When freezing cadaveric blood in which initially alcohol was not detected for up to 4 weeks the formation of ethyl alcohol was not noted. Copyright (c) 2013 - All Rights Reserved - Pharmacophore

AB  - Natural aging of commercial triaxial low-g MEMS accelerometers, manufactured by surface micromachining, was evaluated in terms of changes of their offset voltages and scale factors, assigned to each sensitive axis. Two pieces of two models of triaxial accelerometers (ADXL 330 and ADXL 327 by Analog Devices Inc.) with analog outputs were tested within a period of ca. 4.5 years. Two different computer-controlled test rigs were used for performing relevant experimental studies, employing tilt angles as the reference source. Methodology of determining the proposed indicators of aging was based on cyclic repetition of the calibration procedure for each accelerometer. Changes of the output signals of the tested accelerometers were observed, resulting in respective indication errors of ca. 0.8% or even 2.2% while related to determining tilt. Since the accelerometers were operated under mild conditions while tested, much bigger errors are to be expected in the case of harsh conditions. Both pieces of ADXL 330 accelerometers ceased to operate properly within the testing period, approximately at the same time, for no apparent reason; thus, it is recommended to introduce redundancy in relevant reliable measuring circuits by doubling the number of the applied accelerometers.

AB  - There were studied the anatomic parameters of leaves of 10-day-old seedlings of 7 different species of wheat after 72 hours of drought or salt stress and identified key areas of adaptation juvenile leaf tissue to adverse environmental factors. To detect differences between species and between groups of species differing in ploidy level there were identified anatomical features of the structure of each of the leaves of the studied species, grown under normal conditions and under the action of osmotic and salt stress. There were studied anatomical parameters of inner and external surface of the leaf. It was revealed that osmotic stress has an impact on the studied parameters of leaves of all the studied species. Analyzing the data, we can speak of a high adaptive capacity of tetraploid wheat species T dicoccum Shuebl., T polonicum L. and T aethiopicum Jakubz. virtually all considered the anatomical parameters of the leaves. The results of this study show that indicators such as the increase in stress dimensions of protective and mechanical tissue and the mesophyll appear to be good criteria for selection of stress resistant forms of wheat.

AB  - The interaction of the cationic dye methylene blue (MB) with titanate nanowires (TiONWs) was investigated in different pH environments using visible spectroscopy and electrophoresis on thin films as well as in aqueous suspension. The surface charge of the TiONWs depends on the pH and ionic strength leading to positive charge under acidic and negative under alkaline conditions. The TiONWs have the same adsorption capacity on films and in suspensions at neutral pH while under alkaline conditions they are able to adsorb significantly more MB in suspension due to their higher surface area. Detailed adsorption studies in water revealed that dye cations form monomers, dimers and larger aggregates of H-type (face-to-face) on the TiONW films. The results indicate that below pH = 4.0 the TiONWs' external surface consists of Brontsted acid sites capable of protonating MB. It was suggested that reversible indicator role of MB molecule dimers probes the TiONW surface acidity (Brontsted sites). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective was to quantify the relative impact of current management types on plant species-richness and composition of mesic grasslands with regard to other important determinants such as topography, soil chemical parameters and grassland age. The grasslands were (i) differentiated into management types and vegetation types, (ii) these types were tested for differences in site conditions and species-richness, and (iii) the relative impact of management, site conditions, grassland age and regional scale geomorphology on floristic composition was quantified. TWINSPAN classification of the vegetation separated nutrient-poor from nutrient-rich sites. Results of ANCOVA revealed that vegetation types indicating high nutrient levels showed significantly higher contents of plant available phosphorous and younger grassland age. In partial CCA analyses, the geomorphology accounted for almost one third of explained variance. The current management had a relatively low explanatory value. Soil chemical variables and topography, in contrast, explained together almost twice as much variation in floristic composition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wettability of polymeric insulators is a prime indicator of the insulator surface condition. New polymeric insulator surfaces are hydrophobic in nature, where discrete water droplets are formed on the insulator surface. But as the insulation becomes aged, the surface loses its hydrophobicity, leading to the formation of continuous water channels, which subsequently leads to dry band arcing and even flashover, thereby affecting the long-term performance of the insulators. Therefore, accurate sensing of wettability of polymeric insulators is important for reliable insulator diagnostics. Considering the above fact, in this letter, we propose a deep learning framework for accurate sensing of wettability class (WC) of insulators. We captured the images of water droplets with varying WCs on the surface of an 11 kV silicone rubber suspension insulator. After suitable preprocessing, the captured images were fed to a pretrained deep convolutional neural network model AlexNet for the purpose of wettability classification. We also observed that our proposed method is capable of sensing different WC with a high degree of accuracy, which can be practically implemented for real-life monitoring of insulators.

AB  - The aim of this study is to make post-fire management implications for P halepensis forests in Greece, using a classification into different vegetation units and a gradient-analysis. 464 releves from 31 different sites throughout the area of natural distribution of P halepensis in Greece have been classified by means of a two-way indicator species analysis (twinspan). Similar groups have been merged and a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) has identified important gradients. 5 units have been distinguished and 2 main gradients have been found. The 1st gradient is related to disturbance, while the 2nd is related to pedologic conditions. The natural vegetation of P halepensis forests in north Greece is characterised by Arbutus unedo, Erica arborea and Erica manipuliflora (units 1 and 2). The most common type (degraded, unit 3) is characterised by Lonicera etrusca, Myrtus communis, Pistacia lentiscus and Ruscus aculeatus. Phryganic species were only found in places with unfavourable soil conditions (unit 5) and with approximately the same disturbance pressure as in unit 3. A higher disturbance pressure is characterised by Arbutus andrachne, Cercis siliquastrum, Colutea arborescens, Cotinus coggygria, Juniperus oxycedrus, Quercus frainetto, Rubia tenuifolia and Rubus canescens (unit 4).

AB  - N-Acetyl-oxazolidin-2-one has been found to be a convenient indicator in the removal of nitroimidazole-type antibiotic contaminants in wastewaters by ozone since it is the unique product generated in the treatment of waters containing metronidazole, and it is stable against further ozonation in the experimental conditions used. The oxidative conditions imposed by the reaction do not allow isolation of any by-products, nor other stable subproducts. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF(MS)) revealed the presence of simple derivatives of both metronidazole and N-acetyl-oxazolidin-2-one, thus indicating that both products are unambiguously connected and that, possibly, a unique reaction pathway would take place in this case. A feasible mechanism for this transformation has then been postulated, which is supported by several experimental findings such as TOC analysis and nitrate titration, both correlating well with the proposed transformation. Furthermore, this mechanism has been evaluated by DFT/B3LYP calculations, showing that the observed product is readily obtained thanks to the high exothermicity displayed by the metronidazole ozonation process.

AB  - The Miocene beds of Kutch in India are well known for their mammalian assemblages including an extinct ape Sivapithecus. We here report new amphibian and snake fossils, which have been recovered from two stratigraphic levels: the older Palasava locality which is dated to the middle Miocene (similar to 14 Ma), whereas the sediments of younger sites at Tappar and Pasuda representing the late Miocene (similar to 11-10 Ma). The amphibian material consists only of Rana sp., Ranidae indet. and Anura indet. The snake material is much more diverse and can be allocated to several taxa: Python sp., Acrochordus dehmi, Acrochordus sp., Ahaetuliinae indet. and Alethinophidia indet. Among all these finds, the fossils of Rana sp., Ahaetuliinae indet. and Python sp. described here form the first evidence of these taxa from the Neogene of India. The ectothermic faunas are good indicators of palaeoenvironmental conditions. The ectothermic vertebrate assemblages of these Indian localities indicate a very warm, humid/wet, tropical to sub-tropical environmental conditions during the middle and late Miocene.

AB  - In this article, the effect of material ageing of an elastomeric main spring (MS) inside a hydraulic engine mount (HEM) on its dynamic performance is investigated. A set of HEMs aged under realistic operational conditions are used to create an empirical material ageing model of the elastomer at two different temperatures (35 degrees C and 95 degrees C) using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). These ageing models are then coupled to a multibody system (MBS) model of the HEM such that the output simulates variations of the dynamic stiffness, damping, and transmissibility against age (defined as vehicle distance travelled) and the operating engine frequency at these temperatures. The simulation results represent how the dynamic performance of the HEM deviates from its original design with age and how the transmitted force from the engine to the chassis (which is considered as a key indicator for vehicle ride comfort) varies with age, engine frequency, and temperature. This provides new information and knowledge on the dynamic performance of the vehicle as the HEM ages under realistic operating conditions.

AB  - Laboratory study and practical application of biological-aerated filter were investigated for soybean protein advanced wastewater treatment. The influences of media height, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and air-liquid ratio (A/L) on chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonium (NH4+-N), suspended solid (SS), and chromaticity of effluent were investigated in laboratory study and practical application. The results indicated that media height of 80 cm, HRT of 4 h, and A/L of 15:1 were the optimum conditions in laboratory study, and the mean effluent concentration of CODCr, BOD5, NH4+-N, SS, and chromaticity was 39, 5.8, 2.5, 13.6 mgL(-1), and 16, respectively. When the optimum conditions of laboratory study were applied in practical project, the mean effluent concentration of CODCr, BOD5, NH4+-N, SS, and chromaticity was 50, 7.9, 3.2, 18.8 mgL(-1), and 24, respectively. All the indicators was lower than the limits of the discharge standards of Shandong Province (CODCr <= 60 mg L-1, BOD5 <= 20 mg L-1, NH4+-N <= 5 mg L-1, SS <= 20 mg L-1, chromaticity < 30).

AB  - Sixteen species of native detector plants for ambient ozone have been identified for use in Central and Eastern Europe. They include the forbs Alchemilla sp., Astrantia major, Centuarea nigra, Centauria scabiosa, Impatiens parviflora, Lapsana communis, Rumex acetosa and Senecio subalpinus; the shrubs Corylus avellana, Cornus sanguinea and Sambucus racemosa; the trees Alnus incana, Pinus cembra and Sorbus aucuparia; and the vines Humulus lupulus and Parthenocissus quinquefolia. Sensitivity to ozone and symptoms have been verified under controlled exposure conditions. Under these conditions, symptom incidence, intensity and appearance often changed with time after removal from exposure chambers. Ozone sensitivity for four species: Astrantia major, Centuarea nigra, C. scabiosa and Humulus lupulus are reported here for the first time. The other 12 species have also been confirmed by others in Western Europe. It is recommended that these detector bioindicator species be used in conjunction with ozone monitors and passive samplers so that injury symptoms incidence can be used to give biological significance to monitored ambient ozone data.

AB  - Local population abundance often declines with increasing distance from the center of the species' geographic range. This pattern has been hypothesized to parallel the decline in the probability of encountering favorable niche requirements, implying that local abundance is primarily a reflection of local environmental conditions. In this study we evaluate a potential corollary of this hypothesis. We postulate that local conditions that depress abundance are also likely to perturb development. Accordingly, we predicted that spatial patterns in abundance should be mirrored by spatial patterns of developmental instability. To test this prediction we compared 38 contemporary and Pleistocene populations, belonging to 30 mollusc species. Samples were collected at a single site along the Gulf of California, differentially located in relation to the center of each species' geographic range. We identified, as boundaries to triangular bivariate distributions, a negative relationship between developmental instability and relative abundance, and a positive relationship between instability and relative distance from the center of the range. Overall, however, the observed pattern deviated from the expected in that the majority of low-abundance peripheral populations exhibit relatively low levels of developmental instability.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors (product composition and storage conditions) on the selection, growth rate and metabolic activity of the bacterial flora is presented for meat (pork and beef) and cooked, cured meat products.
   The predominant bacteria associated with spoilage of refrigerated beef and pork, are Brochothrix thermosphacta, Carnobacterium spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella putrefaciens. The main defects in meat are off-odours and off-flavours, but discolouration and gas production also occur. Bacteria associated with the spoilage of refrigerated meat products, causing defects such as sour off-flavours, discolouration, gas production, slime production and decrease in pH, consist of B. thermosphacta, Carnobacterium spp, Lactobacillus spp, Leuconostoc spp. and Weissella spp.
   Analysis of spoilage as measured by bacterial and chemical indicators is discussed. It is concluded that a multivariate approach based on spectra of chemical compounds, may be helpful in order to analyse spoilage, at least for spoilage caused by lactic acid bacteria. The consequences of bacteria-bacteria interactions should be evaluated more.

AB  - Ongoing monitoring programs and historical data are not sufficient to establish anthropogenic effects on the ecology of Chesapeake Bay. However, stratigraphic records preserved in the sediments can be used to reconstruct both prehistoric and historic sedimentation and water conditions of the bay, including anoxia and eutrophication. Pollen, diatoms, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, total sulfur, and an estimate of the degree of pyritization of iron (DOP) are being used as paleoecological indicators in dated sediment cores for the purpose of reconstructing a long-term environmental history of the bay. Analysis of the data indicates that sedimentation rates, anoxic conditions, and eutrophication have increased in the Chesapeake Bay since the time of European settlement. For example, since initial land clearance around 1760, sedimentation rates have increased from as low as 0.02 cm yr-1 to an average 0.22 cm yr-1, and TOC from 0.14 mg cm-2 yr-1 to a high 4.96 Mg CM-2  yr-1. Diatom community structure shows a steady decrease in overall diversity since 1760 and the centric:pennate ratio has increased significantly since 1940.

TI  - Self-rated health in individuals with and without disease is associated with multiple biomarkers representing multiple biological domains
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Self-rated health (SRH) is one of the most frequently used indicators in health and social research. Its robust association with mortality in very different populations implies that it is a comprehensive measure of health status and may even reflect the condition of the human organism beyond clinical diagnoses. Yet the biological basis of SRH is poorly understood. We used data from three independent European population samples (N approx. 15,000) to investigate the associations of SRH with 150 biomolecules in blood or urine (biomarkers). Altogether 57 biomarkers representing different organ systems were associated with SRH. In almost half of the cases the association was independent of disease and physical functioning. Biomarkers weakened but did not remove the association between SRH and mortality. We propose three potential pathways through which biomarkers may be incorporated into an individual's subjective health assessment, including (1) their role in clinical diseases; (2) their association with health-related lifestyles; and (3) their potential to stimulate physical sensations through interoceptive mechanisms. Our findings indicate that SRH has a solid biological basis and it is a valid but non-specific indicator of the biological condition of the human organism.

AB  - Stress, as a temporary defense mechanism against specific stimuli, can place a bird in a state in which growth rates and resistance to diseases are diminished. The Cape Sugarbird Promerops cafer is an endemic specialist of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa that may be threatened by urbanization and climate change. Ecological stress due to urbanization and climate may result in disease and morphological abnormalities. We investigated the correlation between urbanization and climate and four ecological stress indicators (tarsal disease, fluctuating asymmetry, body condition and feather fault bars) in 1375 Cape Sugarbirds from 14 sites across the CFR. Sugarbirds at sites with warmer climates had a higher incidence of tarsal disease and fault bars. Birds closer to urban settlements had higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry and fault bars in feathers. There were no clear correlations among stress indicators. Cape Sugarbirds are subject to multiple stressors, and adequate monitoring of population health will require assessment of multiple rather than single stress responses.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the utility of physiological compliance (PC) to understand shared experience in a multiuser technological environment involving active and passive users. Common ground is critical for effective collaboration and important for multiuser technological systems that include passive users since this kind of user typically does not have control over the technology being used. An experiment was conducted with 48 participants who worked in two-person groups in a multitask environment under varied task and technology conditions. Indicators of PC were measured from participants' cardiovascular and electrodermal activities. The relationship between these PC indicators and collaboration outcomes, such as performance and subjective perception of the system, was explored. Results indicate that PC is related to group performance after controlling for task/technology conditions. PC is also correlated with shared perceptions of trust in technology among group members. PC is a useful tool for monitoring group processes and, thus, can be valuable for the design of collaborative systems. This study has implications for understanding effective collaboration.

AB  - For species living in seasonal environments the understanding of demographic processes requires identifying the environmental factors during spring and summer that shape phenotypic variation. We assessed the effects of plant phenology and population abundance during spring-summer on variation in autumn body mass among cohorts (1995-2006) of juvenile alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). We computed several metrics based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to assess interannual variation in plant phenology and productivity. Body mass of both sexes decreased similarly during years with late springs (-20%) and with increasing population abundance (-15%), with no interactive effect. Our results also suggested that forage quality more than forage quantity influenced body mass of juveniles. Variation in body mass of juveniles thus can be used as an indicator of the relationship between chamois populations and their environment. This study also demonstrates the utility of satellite-based data in increasing our understanding of the consequences of spring-summer conditions on life-history traits.

AB  - There are several factors influencing the water quality based on its usage. The quality of drinking water is of the vital concern for human health and life. An essential attempt has to be done to develop a water quality index (WQI) corresponding with different conditions and characteristics of the relevant river or water body such as geographical, hydrological, discharge rate and pollution sources.-The index is not specifically focused on human health or aquatic life regulations. However, a water index based on some very important parameters can determine a simple indicator of water quality. In the present study, the Gorganrood water quality has been evaluated by available NSF water quality index. Subsequently, the nine present NSF parameters' weights have been changed and modified using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method as well as experts' opinions in the field in a way to satisfy local conditions. In the newly developed WQI, more weights are given to relation with these parameters it can be said that the factors like dissolved oxygen (Do), fecal coliform (F.c) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) when compared with NSF-WQI.

AB  - The atmosphere and land surface can alter the structure of a landfalling tropical cyclone (TC), resulting in complex spatial patterns of rainfall. Rather than average observations from many TCs, this study utilizes a Geographic Information System (GIS) to spatially analyse radar reflectivity data that define the rain shield of TC Dennis (1999). The effects of the atmosphere and land surface upon the rain shield are quantified through the calculation of six shape metrics: areal coverage, elongation, compactness, fragmentation, orientation, and distance and bearing of the polygon centroid from the storm circulation centre. Analysis of the data in hourly intervals reveals the extent to which the landfall process, vertical wind shear, dry air intrusion, interaction with mountains, and extratropical transition (ET) affect the location, size, and shape of the rain shield. Results illustrate the influences that multiple forcings can have upon TC structure and demonstrate that the calculation of the shape metrics can provide a method to evaluate the effects of environmental conditions upon multiple TCs.

AB  - Oxygen isotope compositions of Porites sp. were measured in order to examine the effect of the 1998 bleaching event on the skeletal record of 6 neighboring colonies from Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. A delta O-18(c)-SST dependency of 0.18 parts per thousand/degrees C was calculated using a 10 yr record, well within accepted calibrations. The skeleton portion accreted during 1998 exhibited 0.3 parts per thousand enrichment in delta O-18, which differs from the depleted values expected during abnormally high SST conditions. Growth rate changed significantly during the bleaching event, and its manifestation in skeletal delta O-18 masked the temperature signal. The delta O-18 variance among the 6 colonies was noticeably higher during 1998 in comparison with 1997 and 1999. A residual analysis revealed that 75% of the interannual variation of the delta O-18 record is explained by variation in annual extension rate. The increase in delta O-18 variance is proposed as a novel indicator for stressful environmental conditions.

AB  - Comorbidity of tic disorder (TD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children is common but not fully understood Thus we investigated the effect of TD and ADHD on the amplitude of the postimperative negative variation (PINV) in children with combined tic + hyperactivity symptoms (TD + HA), PINV was chosen as an indicator of frontal lobe functioning that is closely related to self-regulation of behavior, PINVs of four groups of children (healthy controls, pure TD, pure ADHD, and combined TD + HA; total number 43) were elicited in an auditory warned reaction task in three conditions (control = CC, loss-of-control = LoCC, and lack-of-control = LaCC) at midfrontal (Fz) and midcentral (Cz) leads of the scalp, Effects of TD and ADHD were revealed only in the noncontrol conditions, being independent in the LaCC, but interactive in the LoCC, Thus, the additive model of psychopathological classification concerning the comorbidity of TD and ADHD was only partially supported by the observed pattern of psychophysiological results.

AB  - Iron monosulfides and pyrite (total Cr-reducible S-TRS) in the bottom sediments of the exceptionally sulfide-rich euxinic fjord, Framvaren, south Norway, are unusually enriched in S-34. Most of these TRSs probably form in bottom waters, where reactive detrital iron phases encounter isotopically heavy dissolved sulfide. Enrichment in S-34 in Framvaren is a result of intense bacterial reduction of a sulfate reservoir whose exchange with the open sea is limited by shallow sills and a low-salinity surface-water layer. S-34-enriChed TRS in the deposits of ancient euxinic environments is commonly interpreted as evidence for early diagenetic sulfide formation where residual, less reactive iron phases were in contact with isotopically heavy dissolved sulfide (sulfate-depleted pore waters) for prolonged periods during burial. However, the Framvaren data indicate that isotopically heavy pyrite may form in relatively shallow (80-180 m), super-anoxic bottom-water pools. In contrast, the presence of isotopically light pyrite does not indicate an absence of restricted conditions, but only that most iron sulfide formation was completed before S-34-enriched sulfide could be encountered in the water column.

AB  - National bodies in Great Britain (GB) have expressed concern over young stock health and welfare and identified calf survival as a priority; however, no national data have been available to quantify mortality rates. The aim of this study was to quantify the temporal incidence rate, distributional features, and factors affecting variation in mortality rates in calves in GB since 2011. The purpose was to provide information to national stakeholder groups to inform resource allocation both for knowledge exchange and future research. Cattle birth and death registrations from the national British Cattle Movement Service were analyzed to determine rates of both slaughter and on-farm mortality. The number of births and deaths registered between 2011 and 2018 within GB were 21.2 and 21.6 million, respectively. Of the 3.3 million on-farm deaths, 1.8 million occurred before 24 mo of age (54%) and 818,845 (25%) happened within the first 3 mo of age. The on-farm mortality rate was 3.87% by 3 mo of age, rernained relatively stable over time, and was higher for male calves (4.32%) than female calves (3.45%). Dairy calves experience higher on farm mortality rates than nondairy (beef) calves in the first 3 mo of life, with 6.00 and 2.86% mortality rates, respectively. The 0- to 3-mo death rate at slaughterhouse for male dairy calves has increased from 17.40% in 2011 to 26.16% in 2018, and has remained low (<0.5%) for female dairy calves and beef calves of both sexes. Multivariate adaptive regression spline models were able to explain a large degree of the variation in mortality rates (coefficient of determination = 96%). Mean monthly environmental temperature and month of birth appeared to play an important role in neonatal on-farm mortality rates, with increased temperatures significantly reducing mortality rates. Taking the optimal month of birth and environmental temperature as indicators of the best passible environmental conditions, maintaining these conditions throughout the year would be expected to result in a reduction in annual 0- to 3-mo mortality of 37,571 deaths per year, with an estimated economic saving of around 11.6 pound million (USD $15.3 million) per annum. National cattle registers have great potential for monitoring trends in calf mortality and can provide valuable insights to the cattle industry. Environmental conditions play a significant role in calf mortality rates and further research is needed to explore how to optimize conditions to reduce calf mortality rates in GB.

AB  - The purpose of the work was to assess the occupational health risk for workers exposed to harmful conditions at the auxiliary workshop.
   Materials and methods. The hygienic assessment of working environment at 48 workplaces of mechanical shop turners was conducted. 611 researches of chemical and physical factors of the working environment and 448 analyses of workplace air for fine dust concentrations of PM(4 )and PM10 fractions were performed. Rates and patterns of the temporary work incapacity for 3 years were determined and indices of professional risk were calculated: the rate of disease (R), the relative risk (RR), the attributive risk (AR) and population attributable risk (PAR).
   Results. According to the results of the obtained data, it was determined that working conditions of the mechanical shop workers corresponded to the grade 3 of the first degree of harmful exposure and were characterized by a moderate degree of anticipated occupational risk.
   Morbidity rate with a temporary disability was 102.28 +/- 8.09 cases and 1226.72 +/- 100.3 days of disability per 100 workers, that was characterized as above the average and high according to the E. L. Notkin scale of temporary work disability rates. Respiratory, digestive, musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases accounted the largest share in the morbidity pattern.
   Based on indices of occupational risk, it was found that the very high degree of work related pathology characterized respiratory diseases (RR = 8.89 at CI 95 %, 3.93-20.12). diseases of the ear and mastoid process (RR = 7.9 at CI 95 %, 1.45-43.16); high degree was typical for diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (RR = 3.16 at CI 95 %, 1.21-8.26), diseases of the eye and adnexa (RR = 2.43 at CI 95 %, 0.55-10.78); medium degree - infectious and parasitic diseases (RR = 1.98 at CI 95%, 0.25-15.80), diseases of the genitourinary system (RR = 1.94 at CI 95 %, 0.89-4.26), diseases of the digestive system (RR =1.68 at CI 95 %, 0.88-3.23), musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases (RR = 1.57 at CI 95 %, 0.82-3.00).
   Conclusions. According to calculated occupational risk, the fist of work related morbidity was identified for mechanical shop workers, in particular for tumers. The proportion of diseases among the workers of mechanical shop (AR 54.66-89.92 %) exceeded the indicators in the control group (PAR 26.58-56.02 %), which confirms the influence of occupational hazards on the health of workers. The preventive measures aimed at reducing the risks of occupational diseases development in workers have been proposed

AB  - Laboratory investigations of sulfide oxidation may help to understand data from Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) field sites. Although numerous oxygen and sulfur isotope studies of sulfide oxidation have been performed with single sulfides, isotopic data from oxidation experiments with sulfide mixtures are lacking. Due to the common occurrence of sulfide parageneses in nature, aerobic abiotic experiments were performed with mixtures of pyrite, galena, and sphalerite at initial pH 2 and 6 for different lengths of time (5 to 100 days). The oxygen and sulfur isotopes as well as surface and geochemical features were studied in order to obtain similarities and/or differences compared to data from single sulfide experiments.
   The oxidation of sulfide mixtures cannot be simply derived from previously performed single sulfide oxidation experiments. The experiments showed that pyrite was galvanically protected whereas galena and sphalerite were preferentially dissolved during the whole time period of 100 days. Geochemical and isotopic data indicated that the dissolution mechanisms of the acid-soluble sulfides galena and sphalerite are controlled by the concurrent attack of protons and molecular oxygen (or ferric iron, if available) on sulfide surfaces. The non-oxidative dissolution of galena and sphalerite followed by hydrogen sulfide oxidation dominated under acid pH conditions. When the concentration of DO or ferric iron exceeded the proton concentration, galena and sphalerite were dissolved oxidatively by molecular oxygen or ferric iron. The relatively large Delta S-34(SO4-sulfide) values gave evidence that pyrite was not measurably oxidized during sulfide mixture experiments. Sulfide mixture experiments indicated that oxidation rates of waste rock of polymetallic sulfide ore deposits depend on pH conditions, the minerals present and their iron content, the abundance of the minerals, and their grain size (i.e., specific surface area). The delta O-18(SO4) values indicated that an oxygen isotope exchange between dissolved intermediate sulfur species (e.g., sulfite, thiosulfate) can occur during the oxidation of galena and sphalerite. The observed delta O-18(SO4-H2O) value was 16.1-18.9 parts per thousand at a pH of about 5. The results from these experiments indicate that pyrite oxidation may be substantially reduced under AMD conditions as long as galena and/or sphalerite are not completely decomposed. Large delta O-18(SO4) and Delta S-34(SO4-sulfide) values in combination with only slightly acid pH conditions are indicators of the preferential oxidation of galena and/or sphalerite.

AB  - The present study assesses life cycle CO2 (LCCO2) reduction costs of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems with combined use of deep sea water by area considering the natural and social conditions in different areas of Japan. This study considers sea surface temperature, climate, region scale, type of grid power and location as regional conditions. The assessment reveals that the LCCO2 reduction cost greatly varies from 860 to 323,000 [ JPY/t- CO2] depending on the areas. Areas where LCCO2 reduction costs are less than 30,000 [JPY/t-CO2] are the medium and large scale remote islands of Okinawa, the Okinawa main island, the largescale remote islands of Kyushu, and the large-scale remote islands of Shikoku, where the installation of OTEC systems are promising. There are the two main reasons for the small LCCO2 reduction costs in these areas; first, the amount of power generation is large because of the low latitude. Second, the effect of combined use of deep sea water is large because these areas have large cooling demand due to the low latitude or the large regional scale.

AB  - High nutrient loading discharge into the oceans is an evolving threat to the marine biota at large, including the Bay of Bengal (BoB) which receives one of the highest inflows of nutrient fluxes from rivers like the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. Further, the complex riverine and deltaic formations are difficult to be quantified, hence satellite-based observation of chlorophyll and phytoplankton species can add more insight in the nutrient aggregation process. We evaluated the spatial sensitive zones in the BoB in terms of anthropogenic nutrients. Our study shows that coccolithophore population and chlorophyll a concentration can be an active indicator of flood mediated nutrient inflow into the oceans. SST illustrated weaker correlation with phytoplankton species during the monsoon owing to prevalence of cyclonic conditions and high nutrient concentration, however, the relationship is relatively stronger during the pre-monsoon when more stable oligotrophic conditions exist. Higher concentration of diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes in BOB compared to the Pacific Ocean indicates the ecological sensitivity and the resilience of the Bay of Bengal in terms of nutrient cycling.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the diversity of rotifers in various freshwater habitats in Da Nang City, Vietnam, and to investigate the relationship between community structure and environmental conditions. A total of 75 rotifer species belonging to 25 genera and 17 families were recorded, out of which seven species are new to Vietnam. Species from the families Brachionidae and Lecanidae are abundant (containing about 50% and 69.44%, respectively) in the total rotifer species in both lacustrine and riverine habitats. The number of rotifers recorded in the lakes (64 taxa) was much higher than those in rivers (36 taxa), and this is possibly due to the conditions in lakes being more favorable for the development of small zooplanktons. The significant influences of environmental factors (temperature, pH, turbidity, and trophic state) on the rotifer community were well-reflected in the distribution of commonly found species in lakes (p-value < 0.05). Our study results enrich the data on the diversity and the ecology of rotifers in Vietnam.

AB  - Near the liquid vapor critical point, strong anomalies in thermodynamic and transport properties induce the piston effect. In the present study, the piston effect is investigated in spherical cells filled with near-critical fluids under zero gravity and small thermal disturbance conditions by numerically solving the thermodynamic model. The results show typical fast-responding bulk temperature, together with high and stable temperature efficiency, which is determined by the particular nature of near-critical fluids. Particularly, a nondimensionalization method is developed to study the influences of the specific heat ratio on the piston effect by simulations for eight near-critical fluids. Results show the specific heat ratio is an efficient indicator, which is negatively correlated with the nondimensional bulk temperature change. The influences of the characteristic length and the boundary conditions on the piston effect are also studied for near-critical carbon dioxide. In addition, some rules concerning the boundary heat flux and the overall heat transfer are also discussed and concluded. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Colombian National Federation of Coffee Growers (FNC) conducted an agro-ecological zoning study based on climate, soil, and terrain of the Colombian coffee-growing regions (CCGR) located in the tropics, between 1 degrees and 11.5 degrees N, in areas of complex topography. To support this study, a climate baseline was constructed at a spatial resolution of 5 km. Twenty-one bioclimatic indicators were drawn from this baseline data and from yield data for different coffee genotypes evaluated under conditions at eight experimental stations (ESs) belonging to the National Center for Coffee Research (CENICAFE). Three topographic indicators were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM). Zoning at a national level resulted in the differentiation of 12 agro-climatic zones. Altitude notably influenced zone differentiation, however other factors such as large air currents, low-pressure atmospheric systems, valleys of the great rivers, and physiography also played an important role. The strategy of zoning according to coffee-growing conditions will enable areas with the greatest potential for the development of coffee cultivation to be identified, criteria for future research to be generated, and the level of technology implementation to be assessed.

TI  - Views on planning and expectations of SEA: the case of transport planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - strategic environmental assessment
KW  - transport planning
KW  - decision making
AB  - This paper examines the effectiveness of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in transport planning in the light of different views of planning: synoptic optimising planning, communicative planning and planning as a social struggle. The analysis uses empirical materials from 17 case studies collected by survey from Member Countries of the United Nation's Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) and further processed in a practitioners' workshop, and also a detailed case study carried out in Finland. The case studies and the workshop identified a set of necessary conditions and facilitating factors that contribute to the effectiveness of strategic environmental assessments in transport planning. Our findings suggest that transport planning can often best be characterised as a social struggle over problem definitions and future choices. Thus, the effectiveness of SEA will depend on how well the assessment fits into the planning context and on its actual contribution to debates on problem definitions. Specific procedural steps may improve the effectiveness but explicit requirements to recognise SEA in decision making are likely to be a key condition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing Climate Information Use in Agribusiness. Part I: Actual and Potential Use and Impediments to Usage
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA  - English
AB  - A project for the development of methodology to enable agribusiness decision makers to utilize more effectively climate information involved investigation of three agribusiness firms, as well as measurement of their actual and potential use. The firms investigated included a food processing firm, a seed corn producing company, and an agri-chemical producing firm. Climate information is currently being used to some extent by each firm. This information, generally historical in nature, is often collected by the firms. Corporate officials make many decisions using data on conditions influenced by past climatic events; e.g., averages of past yields, but the role of climate information is not explicitly identified. The decision makers interviewed expressed considerable interest in making fuller use of this information. However, they considered climate predictions and year-to-date assessments of conditions as having potentially greater value than historical data, although these two desired data types currently were not being used to any great extent. Lack of procedures to integrate climate information within the decision processes of these large, complex firms was a major impediment to greater utilization of climate information. A scarcity of information about climate data was another major impediment.

AB  - Increasing climate change brings not only global warming, but also more frequent and severe extreme events, which greatly affect the indoor environment. There has been some research discussing the impacts of extreme events on indoor thermal environment, mostly related to heatwaves, but quite limited on extremely cold events which occurred in recent years. In this study, the indoor environment was simulated in a typical residential building in China's hot summer and cold winter climate zone, that has faced both kinds of events, using ERA5 database (reanalysis weather data) in the past 40 years. The simulation results were analyzed for a better understanding of the indoor events of extreme hot or cold conditions and were used to select the weather data for modelling extreme event impacts, including a typical hot year and typical cold year defined in this study. The impacts of the indicator were used to evaluate overheat or extreme cold conditions, and the building envelope level were also discussed.

AB  - The use of fish species uses as bioindicators is an important environmental monitoring tool. Histological biomarkers are adopted to assess the health conditions of different organisms and to indicate an environmental hazard. Histology can be applied as an effective method to analyze the effects of pollutants and other stressors. Accordingly, histological changes in the gill epithelium were analyzed to assess the adoption of fish species Menticirrhus americanus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest, 1823) as a bioindicator to measure environmental quality in Paraty and Sepetiba bays, in Rio de Janeiro. A random sample of 58 fish was collected from the assessed bays. We found Paraty Bay to be in good conservation condition, whereas Sepetiba Bay is contaminated. The fish species collected from Sepetiba Bay showed lesions such as epithelial lifting, aneurysm, and necrosis in the gills; thus, it was possible to suggest that histological biomarkers be used bioindicators to measure the environmental impact in these bays.

AB  - The Middle Eocene Man Aike Formation of southern Patagonia, Argentina, offers the opportunity to study the palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental significance of Macaronichnus ichnofabrics in a tide-dominated, coastal embayment compound-dune complex. Four recurrent Macaronichnus ichnofabrics are recognized: Macaronichnus IF-1 characterized by Macaronichnus segregatis segregatis; Macaronichnus IF-2 with M.segregatis segregatis, Ophiomorpha nodosa, Skolithos linearis and rare Palaeophycus tubularis; Macaronichnus IF-3 typified by M.segregatis segregatis, O.nodosa, Asterosoma radiciforme and rare S.linearis; and Macaronichnus IF-4 consisting of M.segregatis segregatis, Nereites missouriensis, A.radiciforme, O.nodosa, Rosselia socialis, S.linearis, P.tubularis, Planolites isp. and Chondrites isp. Variations in these ichnofabrics are linked to changes in local hydraulic conditions in the upper and lower trough areas of the compound dunes. In high-energy, shallow and marginal marine environments, the Macaronichnus tracemaker is commonly the first to colonize the shifting, sandy substrates. Overprinting by other ichnoguilds occurs only after the physiochemical conditions became favourable and the colonization window length increases.

AB  - The principal aim of this paper is to measure the efficiency of international airlines. We obtain measures of technical efficiency from stochastic frontier production functions which have been adjusted to account for environmental influences such as network conditions, geographical factors, etc. We observe that two alternative approaches to this problem have been proposed in the efficiency measurement literature. One assumes that the environmental factors influence the shape of the technology while the other assumes that they directly influence the degree of technical inefficiency. In this paper we compare the results obtained when using these two approaches. The two sets of results provide similar rankings of airlines but suggest differing degrees of technical inefficiency. Both sets of results also suggest that Asian/Oceanic airlines are technically more efficient than European and North American airlines but that the differences are essentially due to more favourable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, it is among Asian companies that the major improvements in managerial efficiency (technical efficiency with environmental factors netted out) took place over the sample period (1977-1990).

AB  - For a long time, the logistic of transportation of bulk materials, such as iron dust and other minerals, has been of great interest for industrial propositions. Along with the necessity of enhancement of such process, there is also the environmental concerns, since handling these materials generates a large amount of air pollution due to the spreading of thin dust to the atmosphere. In this work, we propose a mathematical model for the propagation of the aerial dust in an open field, based on the principle that the movement of the dust occurs in the quasi-static regime, i.e., a low Reynolds number condition. By using an air-dust mixed fluid-like model, four flow pattern zones were identified and showed a conceptual indicator of the zones serving as a potential source of dust spreading if subjected to an external force. This model consists of solving a Poisson EDP with proper boundary conditions given by the structure of the problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to determine changes in the structure of cryptogamic vegetation of poor psammophilous grassland along a pollution gradient near a zinc smelter to evaluate the potential of species assemblages as bioindicators of soil condition. Lichens and bryophytes were examined in study plots along six transects in four distance zones, and the physicochemical properties of corresponding soil samples were analysed. Four different responses of species to substrate contamination were identified, with a distinct group of species resistant to and favoured by metal contamination. Although species richness decreases as one approaches the smelter, the gradual replacement of certain sensitive species by resistant ones was observed along the pollution gradient. The results enabled us to develop a useful tool to diagnose strongly polluted sites. Two different cryptogamic assemblages of well-recognised key species characteristic for strongly polluted and lightly polluted sites were distinguished. We conclude that cryptogamic community structure clearly corresponds to the degree of soil contamination, thus demonstrating high bioindicative value. The study confirmed the high relevance of the community approach in metal pollution biomonitoring.

AB  - People tend to take notice of what is happening around them selectively. Discourses frames through which actors give meaning to aspects of the world act as built-in filters that distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. Use of knowledge generated by environmental assessments (EAs) in decision-making may be understood from this perspective. Environmental knowledge that is inconsistent with dominant discourses runs the risk of being ignored. Discourses on the value of EA as a tool for decision-making may have a similar effect. Stimulating decision-makers and stakeholders to critically reflect on and reconsider their discourses in the light of EAs also known as frame reflection or policy learning may enhance the probability that these assessments and the knowledge that they generate impact upon decision-making. Up to now little has been written about how discourse reflection in the context of EA can be promoted. Valuable inputs are fragmented over different bodies of literature. In this paper we draw from these bodies to identify favourable conditions for discourse reflection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the effect of soil water content on aggregate stability and determines the relationships between the variation in soil stability and soil physical properties (texture, organic carbon, bulk density, pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity) in a microcatchment located in a semi-arid area of southeast Spain. The aggregate stability of soils was determined at three soil water contents (close to saturation, field capacity and air-dry) using a laboratory rainfall simulator technique. The aggregate stability for wetter conditions was higher than for the air-dry conditions for 85% of the samples tested. Furthermore, considerable difference in air-dry aggregate stability values was observed for predominant erosional and depositional zones within the microcatchment. This variability in air-dry aggregates stability was closely related to hydraulic properties and organic carbon content of the soil. Test on aggregate stability of air-dried soils are particularly appropriate for soils from semi-arid environments, and provide a more sensitive indicator of differences in the soil stability within the microcatchment than wetter samples.

AB  - This paper examines the sustainability of urban development through the livelihood conditions of slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The empirical data were collected through interview schedule and FGD from 97 respondents in two slum areas of Bangladesh. The respondents were selected purposively from the second largest city of Bangladesh namely, Chittagong. The results clearly indicate that there exist significant diversity and differences of sustainability indicators, particularly household and housing characteristics, health, drinking water, waste disposal system and security. More specifically, the finding shows that slum dwellers have been experiencing with a wide range of substandard, overcrowded and unhealthy housing conditions in one hand. On the other hand, they have scarce and insufficient health, sanitation, water and waste disposal services which are unswervingly impeding to sustainable development in urban areas. Although the majority of slum dwellers have access to electricity, they are still threatened by the insecurities of women, drug dealing, eviction and natural disaster. Therefore, the findings suggest a holistic approach to address the multi-faceted sustainability issues that affect the livelihoods of slum dwellers within the framework of context-driven development policy of the country.

AB  - Women exhibit greater morbidity than men despite higher life expectancy. An evolutionary life history framework predicts that energy invested in reproduction trades-off against investments in maintenance and survival. Direct costs of reproduction may therefore contribute to higher morbidity, especially for women given their greater direct energetic contributions to reproduction. We explore multiple indicators of somatic condition among Tsimane forager-horticulturalist women (Total Fertility Rate = 9.1; n = 592 aged 15-44 years, n = 277 aged 45+). We test whether cumulative live births and the pace of reproduction are associated with nutritional status and immune function using longitudinal data spanning 10 years. Higher parity and faster reproductive pace are associated with lower nutritional status (indicated by weight, body mass index, body fat) in a cross-section, but longitudinal analyses show improvements in women's nutritional status with age. Biomarkers of immune function and anemia vary little with parity or pace of reproduction. Our findings demonstrate that even under energy-limited and infectious conditions, women are buffered from the potential depleting effects of rapid reproduction and compound offspring dependency characteristic of human life histories.

AB  - Welfare assessment methods and techniques developed as a result of great interest of scientific and consumer populations regarding the welfare of animals housed in farms. In view of the fact that welfare by definition includes both physical and mental health, the welfare quality assessment includes an extensive number of measures. Welfare assessment was performed in two stables in which cows are kept in tie-stall by using the specific method described in the Welfare Quality (R) Assessment Protocol for Cattle. The measures included body condition score, qualitative behaviour assessment and body hygiene. The welfare assessment confirmed the importance of quality housing for ensuring better performance from animals, thus also affecting their health and productivity. It also pointed out the necessity of freeing animals by providing them with the possibility of free movement, whereat they can exhibit their physiological behaviour. It is definitely important to continue research, expand the number of researched measures in order to confirm the most useful indicators for welfare assessment and to identify the factors that within the animals' physical and social environment affect the increase of their welfare.

AB  - Analysis of the survival ability of faecal streptococci/enterococci in the environment has almost invariably been conducted using the standard culture method (CFU counts) despite the demonstration that these microorganisms are capable of entering a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. In this study we evaluated the fate, in terms of culturability and viability, of different enterococcal species under laboratory stress conditions mimicking those of the aquatic environment. The results indicate that enterococcal species may activate two different survival strategies, namely starvation and the VBNC state, depending on the specific environmental condition. Moreover, the different enterococcal species can be divided into three groups on the basis of the time needed to activate the VBNC state and the resuscitation capability. The differences in activation of the two survival strategies and the different kinetics observed among the enterococcal species reaching the VBNC state should be taken into consideration when the microbiological quality of waters has to be evaluated and because of their role as faccal contamination indicators.

AB  - The domestic raw water sources in Nkonkobe and Gogogo were characterised by using both microbiological and standard physical methods to investigate the quality of the water at the sampling sites. For microbiological analysis, indicator bacteria namely, heterotrophic bacteria, total andfaecal coliforms and for physical parameters, pH, turbidity and temperature were assessed to check whether the distributed water as well as the water from dams, and rivers was safe for drinking and other domestic uses. The water quality parameters of concern were microbial contamination and turbidity. Almost all the indicator bacteria counts and turbidity values were above the South African recommended limits. Both Nkonkobe and Gogogo raw water sources had a poor water quality. The water was unfit for human consumption without prior treatment. The quality of the water source depended on local conditions. This indicated that poor sanitation and hygiene conditions and lack of, or little environmental awareness among the people in rural areas, could be considered as the major causes of source water contamination.

AB  - In this study, an interval parameter fuzzy relation analysis (IPFRA) model is proposed for environmental risk assessment of petroleum-contaminated aquifers dice to leakage from underground storage tanks. The model can effectively incorporate effects of different pollutants and different remediation techniques within a general framework. Also, it can directly reflect uncertainties presented as inexact intervals for a number of modeling inputs. Results of a case study indicate that reasonable solutions for risk assessment under different system conditions have been generated When no remediation action is undertaken, environmental conditions at the study site may be "highly risky" in terms of their relation to drinking water safety.
   Four potential site remediation strategies are analyzed They have different environmental and economic characteristics, with lower risks generally corresponding to higher costs. Trade-offs between environmental and economic objectives are then analyzed. In general, the IPFRA approach is useful for comprehensively evaluating risks within a system containing many factors with complicated interrelationships. The modeling results have provided bases for determining desirable site remediation actions.

AB  - Heat output can be used as an indicator of microbial activity and is usually measured in a microcalorimeter with closed ampoules. In long-term experiments particularly, interpretation of the data is hindered by the changing environment in the closed ampoules because of O-2 consumption and CO2 enrichment. We used a combination of a flow-microcalorimeter and a gas chromatograph to measure the heat flux and CO2 and N2O production rates under controlled conditions. Simultaneous detection of the heat output and CO2 emission allowed calculation of the calorimetric:CO2 (Cal/CO2) ratio. A mean ratio of -435 kJ mol(-1) CO2 was detected in six different soils amended with glucose and incubated under aerobic conditions. This ratio indicated that CO2 was the end-product of catabolism. In wet 10-12 mm soil aggregates of a gleyic vertisol amended with glucose, values of -285 kJ mol(-1) CO2 under an aerobic and -141 kJ mol(-1) CO2 under a N-2 atmosphere was determined. These findings indicated that fermentative metabolism occurred. The Cal/CO2 ratio was not affected when enough NO3- was available and denitrification processes (N2O production) were possible.

AB  - Threatened (n = 59) and non-threatened (n = 308) Swedish forest vascular plant taxa were compared with regard to a number of variables, including distribution, site factors, taxonomy, morphology and flowering time. A majority of the threatened taxa occur in the southern deciduous woodlands, which only constitute c. 0.5% of the total forested area in Sweden. There are considerably more threatened taxa in southern than in northern Sweden; a consequence of the successively higher number of forest vascular plants from the north towards the south. Threatened taxa grow in forests with significantly higher soil fertility than non-threatened taxa. Significant differences were also revealed regarding light conditions, soil water conditions and month of flowering. Threatened taxa grow on soils with significantly higher pH and also with slightly more available nitrogen than non-threatened taxa, as measured with Ellenberg indicator values. Forest stands on fertile soils are uncommon in Sweden and they are also very species-rich. Soil-type rarity in combination with high species diversity in these soil types thus partly explain why taxa are included in the Swedish Red data list.

AB  - Integration of DNA derived from ancient phototrophs with their characteristic lipid biomarkers has been successfully employed to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. However, it is poorly known that whether the DNA and lipids of microbial functional aerobes (such as ammonia-oxidizing archaea: AOA) can be used for reconstructing past environmental conditions. Here we identify and quantify the AOA amoA genes (encoding the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenases) preserved in a 5.8-m sediment core (spanning the last 18,500 years) from Qinghai Lake. Parallel analyses revealed that low amoA gene abundance corresponded to high total organic carbon (TOC) and salinity, while high amoA gene abundance corresponded to low TOC and salinity. In the Qinghai Lake region, TOC can serve as an indicator of paleo-productivity and paleo-precipitation, which is related to historic nutrient input and salinity. So our data suggest that temporal variation of AOA amoA gene abundance preserved in Qinghai Lake sediment may reflect the variations of nutrient level and salinity throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene in the Qinghai Lake region.

AB  - Interest in the measurement of wellbeing and quality of life has increased in recent decades and a wide range of statistical and econometric techniques have been used to investigate and measure individual quality of life. Following this line of research, this paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the wellbeing performance and ranking of the 20 Italian regions from 2005 to 2011. The analysis is based on 12 indicators which represent some of the different aspects of wellbeing. These include economic conditions, labour market conditions, neighbourhood relationships and the environment. The Malmquist indices obtained from the DEA scores are then used to measure changes in wellbeing over time. The results reveal that northern regions have been performing with more efficiency than southern ones. This paper also uses the self-organizing map technique to cluster regions into homogeneous groups where the within-group-object dissimilarity is minimized and the between-group-object dissimilarity is maximized. The clustering analysis confirms a marked duality in regional wellbeing in Italy.

AB  - Does dangerous work encourage young workers to speak up about their safety concerns? We conducted two experimental studies to test this question, with Hirschman's (1970) theory of behavioral responses to decline as a theoretical rationale. Study 1 (n = 159) manipulated two indicators of dangerous work hazardous working conditions and experiencing injuries to predict safety voice intentions, or willingness to speak up about safety concerns. Women had overall higher safety voice intentions than men, and in particular greater intentions to speak up about safety concerns under safe working conditions. Study 2 (n = 78) extended this model, showing that the relationship between experiencing an injury and safety voice intentions was moderated by psychological safety (i.e., belief that speaking up about safety concerns would be received without hostility), such that being injury-free in a psychologically unsafe environment yielded the lowest safety voice intentions. The results suggest that the extent to which young workers speak up about safety concerns may differ by gender and psychological safety when work is not particularly hazardous. We discuss implications for voice theory and safety in organizations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A reduction in the water available to plants will lend increasing importance to the dynamics of water uptake and to the water use efficiency (WUE) of cereals. The effect of drought on the water use efficiency of winter cereals was investigated in a greenhouse experiment in the Centre for Agricultural Research. The effect of water deficiency on the water use properties was studied by measuring changes in the grain weight, thousand-kernel weight and aboveground biomass. The water use efficiency of wheat varieties generally ranged from 1.5-2.3 kg/m(3) and 1.06-2.0 kg/m(3) in the case of optimum and limited water supplies, respectively, while these figures were 1.4 kg/m(3) and 0.8 kg/m(3) for winter barley and 0.8 kg/m(3) and 0.5 kg/m(3) for winter oat. Investigation on the relationship between harvest index (HI) and WUE was found that the harvest index is only one indicator of drought tolerance; but the stability of HI under non-optimum environmental conditions also needs to be determined.

AB  - Fisheries managers call for more nuanced understandings of complex interactions between exploitation and environmental variability, especially in data poor settings. We develop a bioeconomic model for the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) out of Nain, northern Labrador, incorporating climate variability into growth. We derive parameters necessary for the bioeconomic analysis through optimization and identify optimal equilibrium conditions for the model with and without climate variability. Accounting for variability results in a slightly higher optimal harvest, fishing effort and stock. We find an optimal effort of 591 fishing weeks and harvest of 156 920 kg for 2014, suggesting that both were below optimal. We further find that increased temperature leads to higher optimal effort and net benefits at steady state. Despite numerous uncertainties, data and knowledge gaps limiting the accuracy of our estimates, this is the first effort to identify the equilibrium harvesting conditions for this currently uneconomic, yet socially and culturally important fishery. The methodology can be applicable to other data-deficient fish-eries with similar challenges and unknowns, to advance the understanding of socially optimal harvesting and interactions with environmental variability.

AB  - The effect of epidemiological factors on the severity of stripe rust in cv. PBW 343, under early sowing conditions were studied during 2013-14 and 2014-15, rabi seasons. The disease was first appeared in 1st standard meteorological week (SMW) when the crop stage was at 73 days after sowing. Sharp increase in disease severity was observed during 6th to 8th SMW due to the conducive weather conditions which prevailed during the previous fortnight. The meteorological parameters like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, morning vapour pressure; evening vapour pressure and micro meteorological parameters (canopy temperature and soil temperature) had significantly positive correlation with the disease severity in the tested wheat variety, whereas, maximum relative humidity had significant negative correlation. Rainfall had moderately positive correlation with the disease severity. The models generated through stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that thermic, and hydric variables contributed significantly for the variance in disease severity. Among the three principal components, Pc-1 that was contributed by various epidemiological factors (thermic and biological) accounted for maximum variance in disease severity followed by Pc-2 (light variables) and Pc-3 (hydric variables).

AB  - Ozone is one of the key species in the processes of atmospheric chemistry, which can be taken as an indicator of oxidation capacity in the troposphere. The reaction of ozone with reactive gases is an important process in the troposphere. Experimental simulation equipment of smog chamber for atmospheric reactions is used to study the reaction of ozone with ethylene in real atmospheric environment with ozone concentrations of 100-200 ppb. The concentrations of ozone and ethylene were monitored during the reaction with the combination of Model 49C-O-3 Analyzer and GC-FID. A rate constant of 1.01x10(-18) (cm(3).mol(-1).s(-1)) was obtained at 286.5 K, under condition of which the half-life of ozone was 88 min. The results obtained from our experiments are in excellent: agreement with those reported previously by other researchers under extremely low pressure in terms of matrix-isolation technology. This demonstrates that our equipment of smog chamber for atmospheric reactions is reliable, which can be used for further research of the processes of atmospheric reactions.

KW  - AGRICULTURE
AB  - The concept of sustainability shows many facets. Ecologists, environmentalists, agronomists, sociologists, economists and politicians use it with different connotations. In addition, the sustainability of land management systems varies in space, according to climate, soil, technology and societal conditions. Sustainable farming systems vary also in time, as they evolve and may collapse, frequently together with the corresponding sociosystems. Because of its complexity, sustainability is difficult to measure directly and requires the use of appropriate indicators for assessment. A good indicator is free of bias, sensitive to temporal changes and spatial variability, predictive and referenced to threshold values. Relevant data are often incomplete or inadequate for indicator implementation. To embrace the whole width of sustainability, several methods and techniques should be used concurrently, including land evaluation and coevolutionary, retrospective and knowledge-based approaches. It is, however, at the application level that major constraints arise. A sustainable land management system must satisfy a large variety of requirements, including technological feasibility, economic viability, political desirability, administrative manageability, social acceptability, and environmental soundness. Real world conditions at farm and policy-making levels need to be substantially improved to achieve sustainable land management.

AB  - Shale gas is being considered as feedstock for the production of major petrochemicals. One such chemical is ethylene. Although the typical production for ethylene is carried out via thermal cracking, alternative processes have been gaining importance recently. Among such alternatives are the Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) and the Methanol to Olefins (MTO) processes. The first one is a direct conversion process while the second one involves several stages. The aim of this work is to carry out an economic, energy and environmental assessment for these two processes. The results show that the MTO process is more profitable under the economic and technical scenario considered here. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to show the shale gas and ethylene prices under which the OCM process would be economically attractive. An analysis on catalyst improvement needed for the OCM process to be profitable is also reported. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Attwater's prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri), a federally endangered grouse species, is currently experiencing high chick mortality in wild populations and the causes are unknown. We tested 3 indicators of innate immunity (hemaggluttination, serum lysozyme, and total immunoglobulin [IgY] levels) in the Attwater's prairie-chicken and a closely related sub-species, the greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus). Agglutination titers were approximately 25% higher in the juvenile and adult Attwater's prairie-chickens compared to equivalently aged greater prairie-chickens. Additionally, total IgY levels in wild-collected Attwater's prairie-chicken egg samples were 34% higher than IgY levels in captive greater prairie-chickens or Attwater's prairie-chicken eggs. These results suggest that differences in innate immune function exist between these sub-species and also among Attwater's prairie-chicken subpopulations that are exposed to different environmental conditions.

AB  - Twenty-seven marine sediment- and sponge-derived actinomycetes with a preference for or dependence on seawater for growth were classified at the genus level using molecular taxonomy. Their potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites was analyzed by PCR screening for genes involved in polyketide and nonribosomal peptide antibiotic synthesis. Using microwell cultures, conditions for the production of antibacterial and antifungal compounds were identified for 15 of the 27 isolates subjected to this screening. Nine of the 15 active extracts were also active against multiresistant Gram-positive bacterial and/or fungal indicator organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and multidrug-resistant Candida albicans. Activity-guided fractionation of fermentation extracts of isolate TFS65-07, showing strong antibacterial activity and classified as a Nocardiopsis species, allowed the identification and purification of the active compound. Structure elucidation revealed this compound to be a new thiopeptide antibiotic with a rare aminoacetone moiety. The in vitro antibacterial activity of this thiopeptide, designated TP-1161, against a panel of bacterial strains was determined.

AB  - This paper examines traditional ecological knowledge of weather and climate in Samoa, a Polynesian community in the South Pacific. The research found Samoans have their own unique seasonal calendar. The Samoan seasonal calendar is predominantly based on the observations of local environmental changes, which are in turn influenced by weather and climate. Monitoring changes in plants and animal behaviour, for example, are key indicators used by the Samoans to forecast changes in weather and climate. In addition, their communal and family social activities like hunting, fishing and feasting are driven by the seasonal calendar. The Samoans knowledge of cloud formation, conditions conducive to the formation and onset of severe weather systems and seasonal changes in climate, helped them anticipate, plan and adapt to extreme weather and climate events. The ability and knowledge of the Samoans to forecast the onset of extreme weather and climate events, relying predominantly on local environmental changes are vital tools that should be incorporated in the formulation of human induced climate change adaptation strategies.

AB  - Detection of various biological waste (BW) with the aid of complex formation on surface of composition "Biowadet" is described. This composition contains unmodified poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) granules with situated on their surface phenylboronic acid. Its hydrophobic part is dipped into hydrophobic polymer matrix, while hydrophilic boronic groups are orientated into water media. These groups can bind two nearly situated hydroxyls that provides complex formation with various polyhydroxilic substances, for example with polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glycoproteins, etc. These can be liberated by competition mechanism with glycerol in weakly acidic conditions. Periodate salts give oxidation of hydroxilic groups that gives a possibility to control experiment realization. "Biowadet"-method may be applied to diverse purposes, such as an indication of reservoirs pollution, preparation of immunoglobulins (Ig), isolation of gram-negative microbes (GNM) from water, etc. The simple method for environmental monitoring with application of blue dextran (BD) is proposed too.

AB  - 1. An alkaline elution procedure for the detection of DNA damage in marine invertebrate haemolymph has been developed.
   2. Provided that three criteria are optimized, such as buffer composition, small filter pores (0.22-mu-m GVWP 025 00, Millipore), and optimal amounts of haemolymph applied, flow rates may be changed within the range of 0.2 ml/min to 0.05 ml/min without adverse back-pressure on the filter and without blocking filter pores.
   3. Under optimal conditions, 70% of mussel haemolymph DNA, and 80% of crab haemolymph DNA will be retained on the filter after 6 hr of elution, indicating shorter DNA in mussel haemolymph.
   4. The technique is applicable for testing the in vivo effects of different compounds on DNA in marine invertebrates, and to measurements of DNA damage in naturally exposed mussels.
   5. This argues an important case for the use of alkaline elution technique for assessment of environmental genotoxicity, and especially for investigation of DNA damage in different marine organisms which cover a broad range in their DNA molecular weights.

AB  - For economic as well as environmental reasons, the determination of optimal nitrogen (N) fertiliser application rates under field conditions is of great importance, especially under irrigated conditions. A two-year field experiment was conducted in Hungary (47 degrees 33'N, 21 degrees 26'E, 111 m) with six N fertiliser rates (0-150 kg ha(-1)) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions with the aim to compare the chlorophyll (Chl) concentration of maize (Zea mays L.) leaves at different growth stages to the soil nitrate-N, the amount of N applied as fertilizer and grain yield. The effect of irrigation and N fertilisation on the soil water and nitrate-N dynamics, grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) was also examined. In the drought year of 2007, the volumetric soil water content increased from the surface (8.5-9.5, v/v%) to a depth of 1.2 m (15-20, v/v%) in both water treatments. In the extremely wet year of 2008, an opposite tendency was observed. In 2007, N applied without irrigation accumulated in the 0-0.2 m depth and nitrate-N did not significantly decrease, clue to minimal crop N uptake. Under irrigated conditions, nitrate-N was significantly reduced by crop uptake during the growing season of both years. In 2007, chlorophyll meter readings were related to the plant available N at the R1 stage in both water treatments ((P < 0.001). The CMR value and yield were in close correlation with each other at the R1 growth phase in the drought year in the irrigated treatment (P < 0.001; R = 0.724), and in the wet year both in the non-irrigated (P < 0.001: R = 0.735) and the irrigated treatments (P < 0.001; R = 0.782). The soil nitrate content could be concluded to in the dry year (2007) at the R1 growth stage in both irrigation treatments (R = 0.614: R = 0.648), and in the wet year (2008) in the non-irrigated treatment at the V12 growth stage (R = 0.763).
   In 2007, the lack of rainfall caused yield stress in the non-irrigated treatment, in contrast to the significantly reduced yield in every N treatment in comparison with the non-irrigated treatment recorded in 2008, clue to the extremely high amounts of rainfall. The yield surplus per 1 mm irrigation was negative and the level of WUE was also significantly lower. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since sewage is a hotspot for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the identification of ARGs in environmental waters impacted by sewage, and their correlation to fecal indicators, is necessary to implement management strategies. In this study, sewage treatment plant (STP) influent samples were collected and analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the abundance and correlations between sewage-associated markers (i.e., Bacteroides HF183, Lachnospiraceae Lachno3, crAssphage) and ARGs indicating resistance to nine antibiotics (belonging to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, macrolides, and tetracyclines). All ARGs, except bla(VIM), and sewage-associated marker genes were always detected in untreated sewage, and ermF and sul1 were detected in the greatest abundances. intl1 was also highly abundant in untreated sewage samples. Significant correlations were identified between sewage-associated marker genes, ARGs and the intl1 in untreated sewage (tau = 0.488, p = 0.0125). Of the three sewage-associated marker genes, the BIO-ENV procedure identified that HF183 alone best maximized correlations to ARGs and intl1 (tau = 0.590). Additionally, grab samples were collected from peri-urban and urban sites along the Brisbane River system during base and stormflow conditions, and analyzed for Escherichia coli, ARGs, the intl1, and sewage-associated marker genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Significant correlations were identified between E. coli, ARGs, and intl1 (tau = 0.0893, p = 0.0032), as well as with sewage-associated marker genes in water samples from the Brisbane River system (tau = 0.3229, p = 0.0001). Of the sewage-associated marker genes and E. coli, the BIO-ENV procedure identified that crAssphage alone maximized correlations with ARGs and intl1 in river samples (tau = 0.4148). Significant differences in E. coli, ARGs, intl1, and sewage-associated marker genes, and by flow condition (i.e., base vs. storm), and site types (peri-urban vs. urban) combined were identified (R = 0.3668, p = 0.0001), where percent dissimilarities between the multi-factorial groups ranged between 20.8 and 11.2%. Results from this study suggest increased levels of certain ARGs and sewage-associated marker genes in stormflow river water samples compared to base flow conditions. E. coli, HF183 and crAssphage may serve as potential indicators of sewage-derived ARGs under stormflow conditions, and this merits further investigation. Data presented in this study will be valuable to water quality managers to understand the links between sewage pollution and ARGs in urban environments.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare can be considered in terms of health, the nutrition animals receive, the behavior of animals, the humans they interact with, their living environment, or working conditions. Each of these indicators can be measured in myriad ways. Consequently, welfare assessments tend to be lengthy, resulting in a wealth of data about each animal. There is, however, a need to report animal welfare concisely in order to compare and measure change. We propose a method to aggregate an existing questionnaire-based welfare assessment into five 'grades' to reflect the main components of animal welfare. We aim to provide a succinct way for stakeholders such as animal welfare charities to measure and report on welfare, aiding resource allocation, and enabling monitoring of the efficacy of intervention measures aimed at improving welfare conditions. In an assessment of the health and behavior of over 6000 equids across Europe and Asia, equids in Pakistan and India were found to have the poorest welfare levels. We recommend detailed assessments in these areas to identify the specific causes of the identified issues in order to guide the development of appropriate intervention schemes and, ultimately, improve equid welfare.
   Abstract Animal welfare can be represented by an array of indicators. There is, however, increasing demand for concise welfare assessments that can be easily communicated and compared. Previous methods to aggregate welfare assessments have focused on livestock systems and produced a single welfare score, which may not represent all aspects of welfare. We propose an aggregation method for the recently developed Equid Assessment Research and Scoping (EARS) welfare assessment tool that results in grades for five welfare categories: housing conditions, working conditions, health, nutrition, and behavior. We overcome the problems associated with existing approaches by using a single aggregation method (decision trees) that incorporates the most important welfare indicators in a single step. The process aims to identify equids with the poorest welfare and aid decision-making when allocating resources. We demonstrate its application using a case study of over 6000 equids across Europe and Asia, where equids in India and Pakistan had the poorest welfare status in terms of health (respiratory disease and open wounds) and behavior (signs of fear and distress, and limb tethering practices). We recommend identification of the specific causes of these issues, using either existing detailed welfare data or through issue-specific assessments by an appropriate professional, to guide the development of appropriate interventions and, ultimately, improve equid welfare.

AB  - Purpose Most life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) approaches in life cycle assessment (LCA) are developed for western countries. Their LCIA approaches and characterization methodologies for different impact categories may not be necessarily relevant to African environmental conditions and particularly not for the timber sector in Ghana. This study reviews the relevance of existing impact categories and LCIA approaches, and uses the most relevant for the timber sector of Ghana.
   Materials and methods The study reviewed 23 life cycle inventories (LCIs) and LCAs on forestry, timber, and wood products for relevant impact categories and LCIA approaches for their relevance to the specific conditions in Ghana. This study uses an earlier LCI study of the timber industry as a starting point for an additional LCIA. We next performed a correlation and regression analysis to learn whether wood wastes may function as a reasonable single indicator for land use as proxy for biodiversity loss and the other impact categories.
   Results and discussion The literature review shows that no LCI or LCA studies were developed for Africa or the tropics. The LCIA approaches in the reviewed LCAs are indeed shown to take their basis in the environmental problems in western countries and characterization methodologies relating to how these problems manifest themselves in the western world. Characterization methodologies for different impact categories in CML-2000 and other LCIA approaches may not be necessarily relevant to African tropical environmental conditions and particularly not for the timber sector in Ghana. This situation hampers the reliability of our LCIA and points to a serious research gap in LCIA development in general.
   We applied the scientifically well-recognized CML 2000 to the earlier LCI results and characterized the preliminary selected impact categories of global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, and human toxicity. The correlation analysis indicated that wood waste is indeed strongly correlated with land use as proxy for biodiversity loss and also positively correlated with the other five potential impact results. It can be concluded that wood waste production is a major driving force for biodiversity loss and a sufficiently good single indicator for all other environmental performance indicators in the timber sector of Ghana.
   Conclusions This study and the previous LCI paper are pioneering a field not yet explored, since the correct environmental performance indicators are not yet developed or adapted to tropical conditions. The development of LCIA approaches in the tropics may be the start of a never-ending journey in LCA research in Africa, particularly Ghana.

AB  - Most of the remaining grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia exists as remnants on private land in agricultural landscapes. These have been subjected to various forms of disturbance including exotic plant invasion and livestock grazing. Little is known about the invertebrate communities in these remnants, which could contribute greatly to the diversity and function of these ecosystems. We need to know what invertebrates are present and how they respond to different types of land management, such as livestock grazing, in order to conserve them.
   We aimed to determine firstly if the invertebrate community was more diverse and abundant and leaf litter decomposition rates faster in woodlands with livestock excluded. Secondly, we asked how important microhabitat variation is for the invertebrate community and decomposition rates, and finally if grazing exclusion influences these microhabitat variables and alters the vegetation condition. We addressed these aims through the use of leaf litter decomposition bags and pitfall trapping near three microhabitats: beside logs, under trees and in open habitat, considering woodland remnants still grazed by livestock and remnants where livestock grazing had been excluded. A vegetation condition assessment was also performed at each site. Grazed woodlands were subject to either a strategic or set stocked grazing.
   Sites with grazing removed had a greater abundance of beetles and the Opportunist ant functional group, a faster rate of litter decomposition. greater native plant richness, greater length of logs and a better vegetation condition score. The Dominant Dolichoderinae ant functional group were the only insects trapped more frequently in currently grazed sites. Total invertebrate abundance, beetle abundance and richness, Anonychomyrma abundance and the quantity of leaf litter was greatest under trees. In comparison ants were in higher abundance and richness in the open areas. Leaf litter decomposition rates were fastest near logs. Beetles and Generalised Myrmicinae ants were more active near two of the microhabitats in rotationally grazed sites in comparison to the set stocked.
   Excluding livestock from woodlands has benefits for components of the invertebrate community, vegetation condition and the important process of litter decomposition. Strategic grazing which includes substantial periods of rest could play a role in balancing the production and conservation needs of privately owned woodlands. Woodland remnants have a range of invertebrates that are dependent on mature trees or logs, such that a variety of microhabitats needs to be retained within remnant native vegetation in agricultural landscapes to maintain a diverse and abundant invertebrate community.

AB  - Soil improvement using biopolymers has attracted considerable attention in recent years, with the aim to reduce the harmful environmental effects of traditional materials, such as cement. This paper aims to provide a review on the environmental assessment of using biopolymers as binders in soil improvement, biopolymer-treated soil characteristics, as well as the most important factors affecting the behavior of the treated soil. In more detail, environmental benefits and concerns about the use of biopolymers in soil improvement as well as biopolymer-soil interaction are discussed. Various geotechnical properties are evaluated and compared, including the unconfined compressive strength, shear strength, erosion resistance, physical properties, and durability of biopolymer-treated soils. The influential factors and soil and environmental conditions affecting various geotechnical characteristics of biopolymer-treated soils are also discussed. These factors include biopolymer concentration in the biopolymer-soil mixture, moisture condition, temperature, and dehydration time. Potential opportunities for biopolymers in geotechnical engineering and the challenges are also presented.

AB  - Climate variability and climate change impacts on hydrological conditions prescribe the need to better understand favourable conditions for developing and mobilising adaptive capacity. This paper presents new cases to the body of evidence on adaptive capacity in the context of institutional arrangements for water management. It aims to contribute insights into the challenges of developing approaches across governance scales for dealing with climate variability and climate change impacts. The different case studies explored in this article represent an exploration of the challenges across temporal and spatial scales in relation to the adaptive capacity of water governance to hydro-climatic stresses. The studies use a suite of governance related indicators to explore adaptive capacity in relation to past extreme hydrological events. Analysis is based on qualitative open ended interviews and questionnaires. Results indicate that tensions persist in developing proactive capacity and mobilising reactive capacity at different scales of governance to different scales of change. Findings support the increasing recognition in the literature for top down and bottom up approaches to be better balanced in efforts to improve resilience to climate variability and change.

AB  - We investigated the ecological significance of alkaline phsophatase (APase) and alkaline phosphatase-hydrolyzable phosphorus (APHP) in the northern part of Gamak Bay, Korea. APase activity was detectable throughout the year, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentration and APase activity are highly correlated and can be regarded as an indicator of DIP-limiting conditions. Also, a strong linear positive correlation between APase activity and Chl a concentration indicated that the major part of APase activity may have been induced by phytoplanktons. The APHP proportion in dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was above ca. 30% from winter to spring and below ca. 15% from summer to autumn due to freshwater discharge and uptake by phytoplankton. APHP may play an important role in species competition in coastal area such as northern part of Gamak Bay where DIP is limiting. Thus, APase induction by phytoplanktons may be ecologically significant, allowing dominance by these organisms under DIP-limiting conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of biodrying is to reduce moisture in the waste within a short period while preserving organic carbon for energy recovery. However, the municipal solid wastes in the Asian region contain high moisture content and organic matter, which affects the efficacy of the biodrying process. Two experiments were conducted to optimize the biodrying condition by balancing organic waste degradation and moisture reduction. The results showed that the optimum initial moisture content for biodrying was 50-60%. A small volume of water added to the waste enhanced the biodrying efficiency, while excess water reduced the drying effect due to temperature-rising inhibition. Most of the carbon was degraded, and the heat was generated during the temperature-rising phase. However, evaporation mainly occurred during the temperature-declining phase. The "Evaporation per dissimilated Carbon (Evap/Cdiss) ratio" could be used as a parameter to evaluate the efficacy of the biodrying process. Leaching of degradable organic carbon together with leachate reduced the fraction of organic carbon biodegraded. The gas composition could be used as an indicator for determining the fate of carbon conversion during biodrying.

AB  - The wisdom-of-the-crowd effect is a counter-intuitive phenomenon that results in the reduction of errors under some strict conditions. Those conditions are related to randomness and large enough sample size. Many research fields examine the potential use of this effect in error reduction and in overcoming limitations such as the limited number of experts in a given field. Selected environmental/human health impact assessments have been qualitatively examined for the potential existence of this phenomenon. In addition, a quantitative evaluation has been performed for four case studies of simplified life-cycle assessment. The quantitative results indicate that for end-point damage categories, the geometric mean leads to more accurate results than the arithmetic mean. Results suggest that it might be possible to reduce errors or expand the application of these assessments by using assessors with less expertise. The wisdom-of-the-crowd effect also can be used to fill in data gaps in life-cycle inventory databases. However, further research is required in this area to explore the practical uses of this phenomenon. The proposed method can be applied to any entity to examine possible improvements in any area of environmental/human health research.

AB  - Climate change is expected to affect the flow regime, cause loss of habitat, change community composition and behavioural habits of fish. This study assessed the impact of climate change on ecologically relevant streamflow conditions for fish migration and spawning in the Vistula and the Odra river basins. Streamflow simulations obtained with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the historical period and two future horizons were driven by nine bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Models under two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. This study identified a subset of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) that are relevant for pike, Esox lucius L., chub, Squalius cephalus (L.), and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. IHA indicators were calculated and compared for different scenarios. An index-based framework identified that all considered species will be impacted by climate change, with Atlantic salmon facing the largest impact. The model's uncertainty was addressed through an aggregation method that assessed inconsistencies in the model's response.

AB  - Fecal contaminations of inland and coastal waters induce risks to human health and economic losses. To improve water management, specific markers have been developed to differentiate between sources of contamination. This study investigates the relative decay of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, Escherichia colt and enterococci) and six human-associated markers (two bacterial markers: Bacteroidales HF183 (HF183) and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BifAd); one viral marker: genogroup II F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH II); three chemical markers: caffeine and two fecal stanol ratios) in freshwater and seawater microcosms seeded with human wastewater. These experiments were performed in darkness, at 20 degrees C and under aerobic conditions. The modeling of the decay curves allows us (i) to compare FIB and markers and (ii) to classify markers according to their persistence in seawater (FRNAPH II < HF183, stanol ratios < BifAd, caffeine) and in freshwater (HF183, stanol ratios < FRNAPH II < BifAd < caffeine). Although those results depend on the experimental conditions, this study represents a necessary step to develop and validate an interdisciplinary toolbox for the contaminations.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an attractive option to remove metal from contaminated soil since it is a simple, low-cost, and environmentally friendly procedure. To better examine the phytoremediation potential of kenaf (Hybiscus canabinnus), mustard (Brassica juncea), turnip (Raphunus sativus) and amaranth (Amaranthus crentus) plants, a greenhouse experiment was performed in which these species were grown on a soil contaminated with Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb and B. The translocation, the bioconcentration and the removal index, the transference factor and the time to reach 50% of element removal from soil, among other indicators, were used in order to identify a hyperaccumulator. Kenaf plants were more tolerant to the conditions tested, with the highest dry matter production and no visual toxicity symptoms. Amaranth would be the species chosen to remediate the soil under field conditions as it presented the higher indexes for decontamination of Zn and Mn and was also able to remove B. Turnip showed the best results for Pb removal. All species tested were able to remove B from soil. In spite, none of the plant species tested could be characterized as a hyperaccumulator.

AB  - Serological indicators of general condition would be helpful for monitoring or assessing ungulate wildlife. Toward that end, we report the Ist reference values for 2 cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha), in neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus). We obtained blood samples from 140 calves <= 6 days old in Yellowstone National Park during summer 2003-2005. IL-6 values ranged from 0 to 1.21 pg/ml with a median of 0.03 pg/ml. TNF-alpha values ranged from 0 to 225.43 pg/ml with a median of 1.85 pg/ml. IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were not significant predictors of elk calf survival through 21 days. Development of ungulate-based IL-6 and TNF-alpha assays that provide greater sensitivity than cross-reacting human-based assays could be helpful in monitoring ungulate condition and health status comparisons among herds. Such information could provide indirect assessments of range quality or environmental influences among herds.

AB  - Regulation measures like the installation of weirs led to distinct shifts in riparian plant communities and to a decline of typical riparian plant species occurring along the river shoreline, which is naturally poor in woody plants. These regulation measures include also run-of-river impoundments or weirs that cause distinct differences in hydrodynamic conditions in their direct proximity upstream and downstream. In the course of the year, the downstream reaches are exposed to significantly higher water level fluctuations than upstream. Thus, these reaches are assumed to provide also suitable habitat for riparian plant species of habitats being exposed to frequent disturbance by alternating water levels.
   We investigated the riparian vegetation in direct proximity upstream and downstream of nine weirs along the two regulated rivers Lahn and Fulda. Sampling was conducted in the transition zone from water to land directly above the actual water level during the summers 2016 and 2017. Differences in species composition were analyzed by means of NMS and indicator species analysis. Results of the indicator species analysis were used for further analyses regarding species functional traits and species habitat origin.
   A grouping of the releves in accordance to the weir reach, dissimilarities in site conditions, significant indicator species for each weir reach and common indicator species upstream along both rivers point towards differences in species composition upstream and downstream. Due to rather constant water levels, upstream species composition consisted mainly of perennial species from reeds of still waters, swamp and alluvial forests and terrestrial habitats that were mainly competitors. By contrast, species from reeds of flowing waters, flooded meadows and grasslands and typical riparian plant communities (Bidention tripartitae, Chenopodion rubri) occurred more frequently downstream. Species downstream exhibited also less competitive power and short life cycles as a result of higher water level fluctuations.
   Upstream and downstream species composition clearly reflect the observed hydrodynamic conditions, restricting continuity to the area within two weirs. This distinctly differs from natural conditions, which leads to the establishment of novel riparian plant communities. As downstream reaches in direct proximity to weirs are related to higher water level fluctuations in the course of the year, these areas are of essential meaning as refuge for typical riparian species. Against this background, we recommend to decrease bank steepness downstream to increase the effect of water level fluctuations, which would lead to the establishment of suitable habitats for typical riparian plant species.

AB  - Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 was dedicated to reconstruct the details of the Pliocene-Pleistocene paleoenvironmental conditions of the Bering Sea. In this study, fossil diatom assemblages from Hole U1343E were investigated to define diatom biostratigraphy and reveal paleoceanography of the Bering slope region throughout Pleistocene. As the results, four diatom zones with Neogene North Pacific Diatom zone codes (NPD) were determined from the Neodenticula seminae Zone (NPD 12) to the N. koizumii Zone (NPD 9). Diatom biohorizons defined in this study closely correspond with onboard data, but the distinct difference is recognized at the top of the N. koizumii. Additional four biostratigraphic zones estimated by three silicoflagellate and one ebridian datums suggest the core sediment age younger than 2.5 Ma. The fluctuations of several paleoenvironmental diatom indicators show that cold conditions with sea-ice existed throughout the duration of the interval studied as well as sea ice expansion occurred at ca. 1.9 Ma and ca. 0.9 Ma. Moreover, increases of neritic diatom species reveal a drop in sea level. Neodenticula seminae is the diatom tracer of the Aleutian Current and hence the decrease of this taxon suggests decrease in inflow of the North Pacific water mass. Although the sea levels must have been dropped during the cold time interval, the consistent occurrences of N. seminae indicate that the surface water circulation in the Bering Sea was significantly influenced by the Alaskan Stream at ca. 1.9 Ma. On the other hand, during the other cooling event at ca. 0.9 Ma, which corresponds to the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) event, an increase of neritic diatom species and decrease of N. seminae were observed. This suggests that coastal environmental conditions accompanied the sea level drop and that the inflow from the North Pacific was weakened. The increases of sea-ice and neritic diatom species suggest that the sea ice and coastal conditions were developed after the cooling at 0.9 Ma. The ages at remarkable changes of silicoflagellate assemblages correspond to the ages of global climate shifts at ca. 1.4 Ma, 1.25 Ma, and 0.8-0.9 Ma. The unusual alternate dominances of Distephanus medianoctisol in glacial and Dictyocha species in interglacial periods during the 1.25-0.8 Ma interval suggest the north-south migration of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Subarctic North Pacific.

AB  - This research was conducted to determine the water consumption of tomato plants, the effects of water stress on stem sap flow (SF) and its response to climatic factors. SFs in 100% irrigation (T-1), 75% (T-2) and 50% (T-3) of irrigation amount of T-1 were monitored using Dynagage sensors. Compared to T-1, the difference in SF was observed under deficit irrigation in the same climatic conditions on sunny days although there was no apparent difference between T-1 and T-2 on cloudy days. Under T-1, the correlation and regression relationships between SF and climatic factors were analyzed at daytime (6: 00-22: 00), morning (6: 00-14: 00) and afternoon (14: 00-22: 00). Considering daytime, the order of sensitive indicators to SF was VPD > LI > Ta and LI > VPD > Ta for the Fall-Winter sunny days and Spring-Summer season, respectively. The water uptake over SFs measured for Fall-Winter and Spring-Summer periods were calculated as 168.65 and 229.18 mm, respectively.

AB  - Submersed freshwater macrophytes are considered as relevant indicators for use in bulk bottom sediment contact tests. The purpose of this study was to estimate the validity of endpoints of aquatic plant Elodea canadensis for laboratory genotoxicity testing of natural bottom sediments. The inherent level of chromosome abnormalities (on artificial sediments) in roots of E. canadensis under laboratory conditions was lower than the percentage of abnormal cells in bulk sediments from the Yenisei River. The percentage of abnormal cells in roots of E. canadensis was more sensitive to the presence of genotoxic agents in laboratory contact tests than in the natural population of the plant. The spectra of chromosomal abnormalities that occur in roots of E. canadensis under natural conditions in the Yenisei River and in laboratory contact tests on the bulk bottom sediments from the Yenisei River were similar. Hence, chromosome abnormalities in roots of E. canadensis can be used as a relevant and sensitive genotoxicity endpoint in bottom sediment-contact tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conditions for the natural reproduction of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) in Lake Constance have been subject to strong variations during recent decades by the impact of fishing and trophic changes. We analysed fluctuations of stock size, age structure, spawning time, and amount of sampled eggs of this species. The onset of spawning altered because of changes in the age structure of the stock. We found a clear relation of spawning time to the mean age of the annual catch and the November epilimnion temperature. The quantity of eggs sampled from the lake bottom with a dredge is in relation to the number of female spawners and may serve as an early indicator for stock size changes. The proportion of viable eggs on the lake floor correlates with oxygen concentrations in deep water. Extremely low oxygen conditions and an almost total loss of eggs occurred when the nutrient levels were high and oxygen regeneration by vertical winter mixing was weak. A mathematical model serves to interpret the changing abundance of living eggs on the lake bottom over the course of a season and is also used to estimate mortality rates.

AB  - In boreal regions, soil can remain frozen after the start of the growing season. We compared relationships between root characteristics and water relations in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) saplings subjected to soil frost treatments before and during the first week of the growing period in a controlled environment experiment. Delayed soil thawing delayed the onset of sap flow or totally blocked it if soil thawing lagged the start of the growing period by 7 days. This effect was reflected in the electrical impedance of needles and trunks and in the relative electrolyte leakage of needles. Prolonged soil frost reduced or completely inhibited root growth. In unfrozen soil, limited trunk sap flow was observed despite unfavorable aboveground growing conditions (low temperature, low irradiance, short photoperiod). Following the earliest soil thaw, sap flow varied during the growing season, depending on light and temperature conditions, phenological stage of the plant and the amount of live needles in the canopy. The results suggest that delayed soil thawing can reduce tree growth, and if prolonged, it can be lethal.

AB  - 1. We examined the relative contributions of regional spatial characteristics and local environmental conditions in determining Paraguayan bat species composition.
   2. We used a suite of full and partial redundancy analyses to estimate four additive partitions of variance in bat species composition: (a) unexplained variation, (b) that explained purely by spatial characteristics, (c) that explained purely by local environmental conditions and (d) that explained jointly by space and environment. The spatial component to bat species composition was greater than the environmental component and both pure spatial and pure environmental characteristics accounted for significant amounts of variation in bat species composition.
   3. Results from variance decomposition suggest that the mass effects model describes metacommunity structure of Paraguayan bats better than species sorting or neutral models. Such mass effects may potentially be general for bats and could explain the inability of purely local factors to fully account for bat community organization. Mass effects also have substantial conservation implications because rescue effects may enhance the persistence of mobile species in fragmented landscapes with relatively few protected sites.

AB  - In recent years, the scale and pace of urban change have been associated with fine-scale fragmentation of the lifestyles of urban populations. One manifestation of this is that households of diverse means and circumstances may be found living in proximity to one another, particularly in urban areas. In this paper we argue that in these changed circumstances conventional deprivation indicators fail adequately to detect within and between small area variations in socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Using a case study of Bristol, England, we develop an analysis around Gordon and Forrest's Breadline Britain indicator in order to reveal the diversity of economic conditions that exist within wards that might be labelled as either affluent or deprived. We argue that adequate representation of diversity requires a greater sensitivity to difference at fine scales. In this context, we begin to evaluate the claims of marketeers who use commercial sources of data to model incomes at unit postcode and even household scales. We undertake an evaluation of such data and extend their application to calculation of Breadline Britain index scores. The results suggest some potential for using unconventional sources of data to 'freshen up' census information and provide direct, meaningful, measures of deprivation.

AB  - There are increasing concerns about the hazard posed to drinking water resources by persistent, mobile, and toxic (PMT) substances in the environment. For example, the extensive use of metaldehyde-based molluscicide to control slug populations in agricultural fields has frequently led to pollution of surface waters and contamination of drinking water at levels exceeding the statutory limit. Regulatory environmental fate assessments and studies in the literature did not predict that metaldehyde would be persistent in the environment, contrary to observations from monitoring schemes. To understand the reasons for this disparity, this study conducted a suite of degradation experiments, covering different soil types and environmentally realistic conditions in Northern Europe, and generated a distribution of DT50 values for metaldehyde to examine whether degradation rates are underestimated by current risk assessments. The results were found to vary, showing DT50 values ranging from 3.0 to 4150 days, which indicated that metaldehyde had the potential to become persistent. Lack of prior metaldehyde exposure, high moisture content, low temperature, and locally high metaldehyde concentration under pellets were identified as high-risk conditions for low pesticide biodegradation in UK soils.

AB  - 8.8 MT of food wastes are annually generated in the EU, in part due to the lack of real-time food freshness information provided by current food data labels. To address this issue, intelligent packaging strategies are being developed. In this study, in search of new natural and food grade pH-indicators, color stability and variability of curcumin (E-100), betanin (E-162), and anthocyanin (E-163) containing food colorants were studied in solution under different food storage conditions and pHs by light absorbance, color, pH and turbidity measurements. E-100 provided color variations (yellow/brown-yellow) at pH > 9 and was particularly photosensitive since a color loss of 67% was observed after 1 day of storage. E-162 and E-163 colorants, however, were thermosensitive and showed significant lower loss of color (30%) after 28 days of storage. E-163, especially, presented a broader color response (red-purple-blue-green) over a wider pH range. Furthermore, color variations at different pHs were dependent upon colorant type and concentration.

AB  - Predicted changes in sea level and other environmental conditions may threaten the marginal occupancy of coastal wetlands. In a field survey conducted in Weeks Bay, AL, we investigated intertidal wetland plant zonation along environmental gradients. The results of this survey may have implications for coastal wetland resilience both locally and across the Northern Gulf of Mexico as changing environmental conditions exceed plant community tolerances, resulting in "coastal squeeze" phenomena. Within the coastal marsh transition of Weeks Bay, there was heterogeneous micro-topography with a large overlap of plant distributions along the elevation gradient (-0.474-0.661m NAVD 88). In addition to elevation, salinity was a primary indicator of plant zonation for the dominant species in the area: Spartina cynosuroides (Big Cordgrass), Juncus roemerianus (Black Needlcrush), and Cladium mariscus ssp. jamaicense (Swamp Sawgrass). Based on our findings, the persistence of these plants in the intertidal zone of Weeks Bay may be especially susceptible to changes in flooding and salinity associated with sea-level rise and the presence of barriers to upslope migration.

AB  - In this paper, the dynamic behavior of square plates with various thicknesses and stiffening configurations subjected to underwater explosion (UNDEX) are evaluated through a relatively novel approach which is called Incremental Explosive Analysis (IEA). The IEA estimates the different limit-states and deterministic assessment of plats' behavior, considering uncertainty of loading conditions and dynamic nature of explosive loading. In this new approach, intensity parameter of explosive loading is enhanced in an incremental manner and response of the target plate is recorded for every depth-stand-off loading condition. Then, the multi IEA curves are derived from several simulation results. The fractiles method is employed to summarize large amount of IEA curves' data in a predictive mode. In addition, some summarized damage probability indicators such as fragility curves are extracted that provide useful information for quantitative damage analysis of plates in UNDEX loading. Results show that the IEA is a promising method for performance-based assessment of marine structures subjected to UNDEX loading.

AB  - Oxidative stress, a disturbance in the balance between oxidant/antioxidant ratios, is associated with cancer, aging, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is a redox-related enzyme that plays a key role in mitigating the effects of oxidative stress by maintaining cellular glutathione (GSH) metabolism and homeostasis. Therefore, oxidative stress will upregulate the intracellular GGT level. To better understand the major pathophysiological resist mechanism to oxidative injury in mediating many disease states, we designed and synthesized a novel two-photon (TP) fluorescent turn-on probe, Np-Glu, for GGT detection and bioimaging. Under the optimized conditions, Np-Glu exhibited remarkable fluorescence enhancement (150-fold), good selectivity and high sensitivity (LOD is 0.033 U L-1), with a wide linear concentration range (0-50 U L-1). More importantly, the probe Np-Glu was successfully applied in one-photon and TP fluorescence imaging of GGT activity in an oxidative stress model in living cells and tissues, suggesting Np-Glu as an ideal indicator for clinical and biological samples.

AB  - In this work, solar disinfection of wastewater was studied, focusing on the effect of selected environmental variables, namely light intensity, continuous/intermittent light delivery, and post-irradiation storage as well as dilution in lake water. These variables were studied for their effect on the disinfection efficiency and on post-irradiation survival/regrowth in undiluted wastewater and in wastewater diluted in lake water at different dilution rates. The bacterial inactivation curves were studied, and distinct kinetic phases were identified and interpreted. The dose primarily influenced the demonstration of phases and total inactivation times, independently of the irradiance. Intermittent illumination unevenly prolonged the required exposure time and highlighted the need for extended illumination times when unstable weather conditions are expected. Post-irradiation survival/regrowth in undiluted wastewater showed three distinct kinetic profiles, with transitions among them largely determined by the applied light dose. Lower doses resulted in similar inactivation profiles to the higher ones, when irradiation was followed by prolonged storage at high dilution rates in lake water. The studied factors show significant design and operation implications for solar wastewater applications based on local environmental conditions and water receptor restrictions.

AB  - The contamination of electrical insulators is one of the major contributors to the risk of operation outages in electrical substations, especially in coastal zones with high salinity levels and atmospheric pollution. By using the measurement of leakage-currents, which is one of the main indicators of contamination in insulators, this work seeks to the determine the correlation with climatic variables, such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar irradiance, atmospheric pressure and wind speed and direction. The results obtained provide an input to the behaviour of the leakage current under atmospheric conditions that are particular to the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and principal component analysis are utilised to determine the significant relationships among the different variables under consideration. The necessary information for the study was obtained via historical databases of both atmospheric variables and the leakage current measured in over a period of 1 year in a 220-kV potential transformer insulator. We identified the influencing factors of temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed and direction on the magnitude of the leakage current as the most relevant.

AB  - We investigated various essential factors for optimum infrared thermography for Cattle clinics. The effect of various factors on the detection of surface temperature was investigated in an experimental room with a fixed ambient temperature using a square positioned on a wall. Various factors of animal objects were examined using cattle to determine the relationships among presence of hair, body surface temperature, surface temperature of the eyeball, the highest temperature of the eye circle, rectum temperature and ambient temperature. Also, the surface temperature of the flank at different time points after eating was examined. The best conditions of thermography for cattle clinics were determined and were as follows: (1) The distance between a thermal camera and an object should be fixed, and the camera should be set within a 45-degree angle with respect to the objects using the optimum focal length. (2) Factors that affect the camera temperature, such as extreme cold or heat, direct sunshine, high humidity and wind, should be avoided. (3) For the comparison of thermographs, imaging should be performed under identical conditions. If this is not achievable, hairless parts should be used.
