AB  - The use of rivers for recreational and domestic practices makes it imperative to scrutinize the water quality circulating within surrounding communities. The complexity of biological, physical and chemical constituents in water is constantly evolving. This study evaluated various microbial and physico-chemical parameters in a polluted river system over a 12-month period. Apart from an increase in chemical pollutants, elevated levels of E. coli, total (TC) and faecal (FC) coliforms, and Shigella species could be attributed to faecal contamination entering the catchment. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed a strong relationship between FC, TC and temperature whereas moderate interactions was seen between total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, TC and FC populations. Furthermore, close relationships between the bacterial and phage communities were also observed. The complex interactions of these physico-chemical and microbial indicators could be due to anthropogenic activities, changing climatic conditions and the excreta of infected and non-infected individuals entering the river. Assessing the complexity of aquatic ecosystems can aid in the development of novel, customizable, inexpensive water purification tools.

AB  - The implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires evaluation of the ecological status (ES) of benthic communities in coastal and transitional water systems, and the intercalibration of assessment methodologies therefore becomes a research challenge. Our aim was to test the suitability of applying the M-AMBI index to assess the status of the Eo estuary (northern coast of Spain). Our results showed that M-AMBI was influenced by the natural variability of benthic communities, and presented an apparent dependence on habitat characteristics. Consequently, the definition of homogeneous areas in transitional water systems should be based on the salinity gradient combined with other factors. To achieve an accurate ES assessment, habitat-specific reference conditions should then be defined prior to the application of M-AMBI; this necessitates dividing an estuary into several sections, which may be classified as different ESs. From this perspective, a novel approach to integrate habitat heterogeneity in a global ES assessment was tested. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning. However, TTE data from freshwater food webs are ambiguous due to differences in time scales and methods. We investigated the transfer of essential substances (carbon, nutrients, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) through plankton communities in 30 Polish lakes with different trophic status in the middle of summer. The results of our study revealed that different essential substances were transferred from phytoplankton to zooplankton with varying efficiencies. The average TTE of C, N, P, and the sum of omega-3 PUFA were 6.55%, 9.82%, 15.82%, and 20.90%, respectively. Our results also show a large mismatch between the elemental and biochemical compositions of zooplankton and their food during the peak of the summer stagnation, which may further promote the accumulation of essential substances. There were also large differences in TTEs between trophic conditions, with the highest efficiencies in oligotrophic lakes and the lowest in dystrophic and eutrophic lakes. Therefore, our study indicates that disturbances like eutrophication and dystrophication similarly decrease the TTE of essential substances between phytoplankton and zooplankton in freshwater food webs.

AB  - The combined steam/dry reforming (S/DR) technology was used to produce syngas from clean biogas. In the reaction conditions proposed, the catalytic bed can produce, without deactivation, a syngas with a H-2/CO ratio of approximate to 2 directly processable for methanol or Fischer-Tropsch syntheses. Starting from the laboratory data obtained in the industrial conditions, mass and energy balances for the overall process were obtained from Aspen HYSYS simulations. The environmental evaluation was performed by applying the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, comparing different scenarios to the current industrial route to produce syngas (autothermal reforming or ATR of natural gas). The analysis showed that clean biogas-to-syngas technology using reforming processes has the potential to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment. The ReCiPe method showed that when the combined S/DR process is conducted using clean biogas also as a heat source, the CO2 balance turns negative, ensuring that the whole process has excellent potential as carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology providing the lowest damage in all categories. Its improvement would make it possible to further reduce the environmental burden of the overall process, which is essential for achieving sustainable development.

AB  - Knowledge of how animals cope with their environment is fundamental to the management of free-ranging populations. Urban animals face increased competition for resources, habitat fragmentation and predation. These pressures may impact an individual's welfare by releasing glucocorticoid hormones in the blood through a response from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in altered energy storage and utilisation. This study aimed to determine the applicability of measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in free-ranging bandicoots by using a simple enzyme immunoassay. We used long-nosed and southern brown bandicoots in northern Sydney to investigate whether environmental and demographic variables can influence faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Long-nosed bandicoots showed similar faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations between suburban backyards and National Park populations. Higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were recorded in female southern brown bandicoots than in males, whilst female and male long-nosed bandicoots had similar glucocorticoid metabolite levels. Ectoparasite load, body condition and season did not influence faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. This non-invasive method has a broad application and can be used to provide biological information to guide management of populations within a conservation context.

AB  - Re-use of nutrients within farming systems contributes to sustainable food production in nutrient limited production systems. Re-use is established when nutrients pass through several farm compartments before they leave the farm via marketable products. In this paper re-use of nitrogen is examined as an indicator for sustainable soil fertility management. Re-use (RU, kg farm(-1)) was defined as the amount of nitrogen that was translocated within one farm divided by the sum of transitions between farm compartments within a farm. In 2002, a total of 101 farms belonging to 4 farmer field schools in Kenya were analysed using the NUTMON (now known as MonQI) toolbox. The farms were distributed over 4 farmer field schools located in two agro-ecological zones. RU was positively related to the net farm income and to crop yields. However, data were scattered and often local farm conditions veiled the relation between nitrogen management strategies and farm performances. The results of this paper demonstrate that different agro-ecological zones with diverse production constraints have developed different in-farm nitrogen management strategies that are best adapted to the local conditions, but may have different environmental impacts.

AB  - Spruce-fir-beech mixed forests cover a large area in European mountain regions, with high ecological and socioeconomic importance. As elevation-zone systems they are highly affected by climate change, which is modifying species growth patterns and productivity shifts among species. The extent to which associated tree species can access resources and grow asynchronously may affect their resistance and persistence under climate change. Intra-specific synchrony in annual tree growth is a good indicator of species specific dependence on environmental conditions variability. However, little attention has been paid to explore the role of the inter-specific growth asynchrony in the adaptation of mixed forests to climate change. Here we used a database of 1790 treering series collected from 28 experimental plots in spruce-fir-beech mixed forests across Europe to explore how spatio-temporal patterns of the intra- and inter-specific growth synchrony relate to climate variation during the past century. We further examined whether synchrony in growth response to inter-annual environmental fluctuations depended on site conditions. We found that the inter-specific growth synchrony was always lower than the intra-specific synchrony, for both high (inter-annual fluctuations) and low frequency (mid- to long-term) growth variation, suggesting between species niche complementarity at both temporal levels. Intra- and inter -specific synchronies in inter-annual growth fluctuations significantly changed along elevation, being greater at higher elevations. Moreover, the climate warming likely induced temporal changes in synchrony, but the effect varied along the elevation gradient. The synchrony strongly intensified at lower elevations likely due to climate warming and drying conditions. Our results suggest that intra- and inter-specific growth synchrony can be used as an indicator of temporal niche complementarity among species. We conclude that spruce-fir-beech mixtures should be preferred against mono-specific forests to buffer climate change impacts in mountain regions.

AB  - Background and aims - Ligularia sibirica is a glacial relict plant species in Europe. Its populations are rare and endangered in most of the European localities. Studies on glacial relics are insufficient; among them only a few focus on the population characteristics and their reproductive capacity. We aimed to determine the habitat requirements of L. sibirica populations; which factors affect the reproductive output of the populations and how the interaction of ecological and biological parameters influences their germination capacity.
   Methods - We described habitat conditions in terms of the Ellenberg indicators (for nitrogen availability, moisture, light, soil reaction, and temperature) in each analysed population. To determine which factors affect the population viability we performed a series of regression analyses. Germination experiment was carried under laboratory-controlled conditions at a 14/10 h. photoperiod and 24/16 degrees C temperature, for 32 days, with cold stored seeds (at 4 degrees C), and seeds stored at room temperature on a different substrate (moist filter paper and oligotrophic soil). The parameters influencing population germination rate were determined with general linear models.
   Key results - We found that the soil humidity, nitrogen availability, temperature, and lighting arc the ecological factors influencing the morphological features of L. sibirica populations. The largest seeds are in the middle part of the inflorescence though this parameter has no influence on germination rate. The seeds germinated better on moist filter paper. Cold stored seeds did not show higher germination rate. Germination increased with the altitude of the populations and the seeds mass, whilst higher values of density had a negative influence on it.
   Conclusions - Our results suggest that habitat conditions and population characteristics am highly related to the germination success of L. sibirica. The prosperity of a population (expressed by the number of individuals) is not a guarantee of reproductive success, the densest populations having the lowest rates of germination.

AB  - Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating species associations (residual co-occurrence patterns after accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as well as for increasing the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs) by accounting for such associations. Yet, one critical limitation of JSDMs developed thus far is that they assume constant species associations. However, in real ecological communities, the direction and strength of interspecific interactions are likely to be different under different environmental conditions. In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression to environmental covariates. We illustrate the performance of the statistical framework with both simulated and real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for generating predictions that account for environment-dependent biotic associations. We implemented the statistical framework as a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model parameterization as well as for post-processing of results, particularly for addressing whether and how species associations depend on the environmental conditions. Our statistical framework provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method can be applied to answer the fundamental questions in community ecology about how species' interactions shift in changing environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of species' interactions in response to global change.

AB  - The DRIB Index-Disaster Risk Indicators in Brazil - provides a tool to help assess, visualise and communicate different levels of exposure, vulnerability and risk in Brazil. The index may sensitise public and political decision-makers towards the important topic of disaster risk and climate change adaptation. This article aims to explore the feasibility and usefulness of such a national risk index that considers both natural hazard phenomena and social vulnerability. The exposure to natural hazards was assessed by using four indicators that describe the exposure of people towards landslides, floods, droughts and sea level rise. Whereas vulnerability dimension consists of susceptibility, coping capacity and adaptive capacity was calculated on the basis of 32 indicators which comprise social, economic and environmental conditions of a society. The county comparison provides an initial ranking of exposure and vulnerability. Specific analysis of coping and adaptation capacities also indicates that risk or vulnerability are not pre-defined conditions, but rather are constructed by societies exposed to natural hazards.
   The results of the DRIB Index were mapped and classified by means of a GIS system to show different patterns of exposure, vulnerability and risk on global scale. The national perspective of risk clearly shows that the vulnerability of a society or a country is not the same as exposure to natural hazards. The information provided by the DRIB Index highlights the need for preventive measures towards Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in the country as a whole, but also at regional and local scales. The results showed that the risk is strongly interwoven with social-economic and cultural conditions and normal everyday life, as well as with the performance of state institutions dealing with Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), in other words, vulnerability. Spatial trends of disaster risk and vulnerability, products of this research, also have stressed the serious social inequalities between and within regions of the country, which result in barriers to the development of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)in Brazil as a whole.

AB  - Peatland testate amoebae (TA) are well-established bioindicators for depth to water table (DWT), but effects of hydrological changes on TA communities have never been tested experimentally. We tested this in a field experiment by placing Sphagnum carpets (15 cm diameter) collected in hummock, lawn and pool microsites (origin) at three local conditions (dry, moist and wet) using trenches dug in a peatland. One series of samples was seeded with microorganism extract from all microsites. TA community were analysed at T0: 8-2008, T1: 5-2009 and T2: 8-2009. We analysed the data using conditional inference trees, principal response curves (PRC) and DWT inferred from TA communities using a transfer function used for paleoecological reconstruction. Density declined from T0 to T1 and then increased sharply by T2. Species richness, Simpson diversity and Simpson evenness were lower at T2 than at T0 and T1. Seeded communities had higher species richness in pool samples at T0. Pool samples tended to have higher density, lower species richness, Simpson diversity and Simpson Evenness than hummock and/or lawn samples until T1. In the PRC, the effect of origin was significant at T0 and T1, but the effect faded away by T2. Seeding effect was strongest at T1 and lowest vanished by T2. Local condition effect was strong but not in line with the wetness gradient at T1 but started to reflect it by T2. Likewise, TA-inferred DWT started to match the experimental conditions by T2, but more so in hummock and lawn samples than in pool samples. This study confirmed that TA responds to hydrological changes over a 1-year period. However, sensitivity of TA to hydrological fluctuations, and thus the accuracy of inferred DWT changes, was habitat specific, pool TA communities being least responsive to environmental changes. Lawns and hummocks may be thus better suited than pools for paleoecological reconstructions. This, however, contrasts with the higher prediction error and species' tolerance for DWT with increasing dryness observed in transfer function models.

AB  - Atmosphere-ocean interactions are particularly strong along the Chile-Peru coast and largely account for the extreme aridity of the Atacama Desert. Near the center of the driest part of this coastal desert, we found that the embayment Bahia Mejillones constitutes an unusually favorable setting for the formation and subsequent preservation of a sedimentary record of the successive oceanographic conditions of the last few thousand years. This work deals with relative abundance of various bio-indicators, including fish scales, foraminifers and phytoplankton, with a centimetre-scale resolution, in several gravity cores taken from 80 to 120 m depth, in a low-oxygen environment. We use this information to document ocean-climate changes at decadal to centennial time scales in the region. Radiocarbon dating on the bulk organic-rich sediment provides the chronological framework for the observed paleoceanographic changes. We interpret that an episode of relatively warmer water, with a stratified water column and enhanced anoxic (< 0.1 ml 1(-1)O(2)) conditions at the bottom of the bay, might correlate with the Warm Medieval Interval (11th-15th centuries) of the northern hemisphere. A younger episode, characterised by cooler water, richer in planktonic foraminifers and anchovy remains, with dysoxic (0.1 to 0.3 ml 1(-1)O(2)) or suboxic (> 0.3 ml 1(-1)O(2)) conditions at the bottom of the water column, may correspond to the Little TCP Age (16th to mid-19th centuries). During the first millennium of our era, two thin sedimentary layers which present similarities with the bed assigned to the warm episode are interpreted as possible remnants of very strong, or "mega" El Nino events. The study confirms that Bahia Mejillones sediments did record ocean-climate changes with a very high time-resolution, and thus deserve a closer attention to investigate the ocean-atmosphere interactions over the last few thousand years.

TI  - DEVELOPMENTS AND PERSPECTIVES IN PIG FARMING AS RELATED TO ANIMAL-WELFARE - STATUS-REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ANIMAL-WELFARE OF THE SENATE OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY, FEDERAL-REPUBLIC-OF-GERMANY
T2  - LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
LA  - German
AB  - The working group ''Animal Welfare'' of the Senate of the Federal Research Centers of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry has dealt with problems and perspectives of pig welfare.
   The results can be summarized as follows: 1. In today's practical pig production the following organizational principles are preferably applied: Separation of different areas and phases of production, according to hygienic, technical, functional aspects as related to animal requirements. Effective reproductive management in so called eros centers. Individual control, care and supply of sows, mainly by keeping them tethered or in individual crates. Litterwise rearing of piglets until weaning in farrowing pens, and postweaning housing in various rearing facilities. Fattening of pigs on slatted floors with automized systems of supply and disposal of wastes. No or very little use of bedding material especially in the housing of pregnant sows and fattening pigs. Highly concentrated food stuffs in performance-oriented rations. 2. There are many rational reasons, also with respect to pig welfare, for the systems predominantly employed in pig production. However, the following welfare problems have to be considered: Locomotional restrictions in individual housing of sows. Problems arising from relatively barren environmental conditions, possibly resulting in disturbed behaviour. Restrictions with respect to the differential utilization of space in pig housing facilities.
   Pig welfare regulations (e.g. Germany) and guidelines (e.g. EC) aim at respective solutions of the problems listed above. 3. Recent developments in pig production are reflecting the legal situation, besides aiming for other production-related improvements. They comprise the following tendencies: Improvements and modifications within existing systems, in order to eliminate welfare-relevant deficiencies. Employment of modern technologies to improve pig welfare, e.g. facilitating of group housing by means of electronic identification and transponder-feeding of sows. Systems including multiple offers of environmental conditions. Alternative systems without differentiation of production phases, e.g. so called family pens. 4. The following tasks in pig welfare research can be identified: Since the behavioural inventory for pigs can be regarded as relatively complete, it seems important to investigate ethological preferences of pigs with respect to management systems, by means of adequate techniques, such as multiple choice experiments and operant conditioning. Welfare-relevant effects of modified and new pig housing facilities cannot be deducted theoretically, but have to be carefully identified by means of significant indicators relevant to animal welfare. Further physiological parameters of stress and their correlations to specific and unspecific defense mechanisms against health disorders have to be investigated. Development of integrated systems of pig production, which meet the requirements of pig welfare, ecological necessities, economic efficiency as well as those of humane working conditions and high product quality.
   Effective solutions of pig welfare-related problems require interdisciplinary and integrated research.

AB  - A brief characteristic of the yield observation plots ZWI 138/1 and ZWI 138/2 in the virgin forest relict stand ''Hollbachgspreng'', which was installed in 1987, shows some important aspects:
   The 2 plots show great variety in site and stand structure characteristics, even at short horizontal and vertical distance. It underlines the importance of this nature reserve stand in respect of long term comparing research.
   By its extrem site conditions the stand will react very sensible upon changing environment conditions. Therefore the stand has importance as indicator for global change effects.
   The main stand has well balanced stability in single tree and stand structure; but demonstrates an almost total loss of fir during the last 100 to 150 years, may be by reason of game.
   The multiform regeneration with the main important species - including again fir - is already waiting for a breach in the canopy and will be able to use it. Game nowadays does not seem to be the problem.
   The yield observation plots contribute as an important part to the complex research aims in nature preserve stands; first informations about the developing stand structures soon will be available after the second measurement.

AB  - Shrub willows (Salix species) are widespread beyond the latitudinal and altitudinal tree lines. Their ring width has been shown to be a reliable ecological indicator for changes in the harsh cold conditions in the Arctic, but little is known on their growth in alpine conditions. The shrubby Salix oritrepha grows above the treeline on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), making it an interesting woody species to explore responses of alpine communities to ongoing climate warming in this area. Since precipitation increases with increasing elevation (until 4670 m) in the study area, we hypothesize that the growth of S. oritrepha is mainly constrained by cold summer temperature. We sampled 35 S. oritrepha individuals above the juniper treeline (4200 m), and took basal wood cross sections for dendrochronological analyses. Few missing rings were detected at the shoot base when serial sectioning was applied. Ring width (RW) and basal area increment (BAI) standard chronologies were established. We found that BAI reflected a stronger climatic signal than RW. The radial growth was constrained by low July to August temperatures. We expect that climate warming would enhance the growth of alpine willows, which could alter the services provided by these high-elevation ecosystems.

AB  - Despite the pressing need for accurate forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, commonly used modeling approaches exhibit mixed performance because they omit many important aspects of how organisms respond to spatially and temporally variable environments. Integrating models based on organismal phenotypes at the physiological, performance, and fitness levels can improve model performance. We summarize current limitations of environmental data and models and discuss potential remedies. The paper reviews emerging techniques for sensing environments at fine spatial and temporal scales, accounting for environmental extremes, and capturing how organisms experience the environment. Intertidal mussel data illustrate biologically important aspects of environmental variability. We then discuss key challenges in translating environmental conditions into organismal performance including accounting for the varied timescales of physiological processes, for responses to environmental fluctuations including the onset of stress and other thresholds, and for how environmental sensitivities vary across lifecycles. We call for the creation of phenotypic databases to parameterize forecasting models and advocate for improved sharing of model code and data for model testing. We conclude with challenges in organismal biology that must be solved to improve forecasts over the next decade.

AB  - Intensive building of shore protection structures to control erosion of the shores took place along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast during the 1980s. The main goal of the accomplished investigations was to assess the role of fouling assemblages on a T-shaped shore protection structure for the biodiversity increase in comparison with the natural rocky reef (Aladzha Bank) fouling complex under recent environmental conditions along the Bulgarian coastal zone. The most significant changes in relation to environmental factors were caused by the introduction and mass development of the alien predator Rapana venosa during the past 30-40 years. By destroying the population of the main habitat forming species M. galloprovincialis, it contributed to the negative changes in the epifauna, expressed in reduction of pollution-sensitive species and biodiversity in the area of the shore protection structures and stagnant zones formed at the T-shaped groin. In order to achieve the maximum positive environmental effect, manifested by elimination of stagnant zones and R. venosa presence, we recommend submerged breakwaters similar to the natural bank, exposed to the prevailing NE winds and waves from East for implementation in the future.

AB  - Methods and approaches for paleoecological interpretations of Quaternary insect faunas are considered. Data from modern entomological research in central Northern Eurasia have been used as the main source of information. The principles determining interactions between insects and their environment are found to have important value. Indicator species include stenothermic species as well as species that are morphologically and physiologically adapted to certain environmental conditions. In addition to species composition, another important factor in paleoenvironmental reconstruction is the modern-day structure of insect associations above the species level (from subgenus to family) that typify each modern biological community, as well as certain ratios of taxa within ecological and trophic groups. The following types of faunas are distinguished: arctic, subarctic, boreal, nemoral, sub-boreal azonal and "mixed" (non-analogue). Each complex is referred to one of these types, forming the basis of paleoenvironmental reconstructions. For "mixed" faunas, the MCR method is used. These results are compared to the paleobotanical and megafaunal mammal data. The final paleoenvironmental reconstructions are based on data synthesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the present paper was to assess the biological damage caused by exposure of the test organism (Gambusia holbrooki: Cyprinodontiformes, Poecilidae) to various mutagenic agents present in the polluted waters of the Sarno River. For this purpose, we performed a micronuclei (MN) test and single cell gel electrophoresis (the Comet assay), testing DNA migration in an electrophoretic field using erythrocytes of G. holbrooki specimens both from the Sarno River and from the waters of the crater of the Astroni natural reserve as negative controls: The results indicate statistically higher values for both MN and DNA migration in the samples from the Sarno River compared with those from Astroni and point to a strong genotoxic action of the mixture of pollutants present in the Sarno River. These data were compared with the values found in the G. holbrooki specimens from the Sarno River kept under laboratory conditions for 100 days in clean water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - An integrated impact assessment model is used to calculate the impact per tonne of SO2, NOx, fine particles, and NMVOC emitted from different source countries on human health, acidification, eutrophication, and the man-made environment (crop yield and building materials). Indicators on the endpoint level are used to measure the effects resulting from a marginal change in emission levels. While the assessment of impacts on ecosystems and the man-made environment is limited to Europe, damage factors for health effects are also derived for Asia and South America. For Europe, emission scenarios for the years 1990 and 2010 are considered to analyse the influence of changing background conditions on the resulting impacts. Results show that there is a significant variation in the damage resulting from a unit emission for some of the impact categories, both between countries and between base years. Depending on the scope of the study and the information available from the life cycle inventory, results from the paper can be used to consider site dependent conditions in life cycle impact assessment as a complement to the current site-independent (or global) approach.

AB  - The effects of certain environmental factors on spatial variation of the mollusc community associated with the alga Halopteris scoparia in Algeciras Bay (southern Spain), located in The Strait of Gibraltar, are studied. Environmental gradients from the exterior to the interior of the bay have been detected, related above all to water movements, solids in suspension, organic content of sediments, and structural complexity of plants. These gradients are seen as differences in the composition of the mollusc communities of the outer zones (Isla de Las Palomas, San Garcia, and Cucareo) and inner ones (Guadarranque and Crinavis). Although the conditions of the inner zone restrict the growth of some groups such as crustaceans and polychaetes, mollusc populations have developed well there in both number and diversity. Species are found exclusively at the exterior of the Bay (include Cingula amabilis, Pisinna glabrata, and Nodulus contortus) and for the interior (Alvania montagui, Alvania rudis, and Rissoa similis), the latter being the most discriminating between the two major zones of the bay. The environmental parameters having the greatest effect on the molluscs associated with Halopteris scoparia are water movement, the morphological characteristics of the substrate, and most importantly the availability of food.

AB  - Solar cooling systems are gaining more attention as eco-friendly cooling technology, which could be an alternative to the conventional vapor compression cooling one to meet the growing demand of space cooling. This paper proposes the investigation of different solar cooling systems, namely: solar absorption, solar adsorption, photovoltaic and photovoltaic thermal cooling systems on the basis of performance, economic and environmental aspects. The main objective is to identify the most favorable system depending on climate condition and solar fraction. Moreover, a numerical simulation is performed on EnergyPlus software to determine the cooling loads of a typical office building for air-conditioning purpose. Performance, economic and environmental analyses are carried out in terms of key indicators, such as solar coefficient of performance (SCOP), levelized cost of cooling (LCOC), discounted payback period (DPP), and life cycle climate performance (LCCP). The results showed that the increase of solar fraction impacts positively the economic and environmental indicators, since this could reduce the LCOC, DPP and LCCP values. Besides, the photovoltaic thermal cooling system exhibits the better performance in all climate conditions with SCOP values ranging from 36% to 52%, depending on climate. Furthermore, the economic findings revealed that the lowest values of LCOC are acquired by using photovoltaic cooling system; varying within the range of 0.056-0.25 euro/kWhc, depending on climate. While the lowest DPP values are observed in regions with high solar irradiation using photovoltaic cooling system. Moreover, solar adsorption cooling system was found to be the most environmentally-friendly since it exhibits the lowest LCCP value. In addition, it was found that the increase of ambient temperature and solar radiation results in higher SCOP and lower LCOC and DPP values, especially for solar absorption and solar adsorption cooling systems. The current work is expected to serve as a reference for engineers and designers to select the suitable solar cooling system to be installed according to the target location and solar fraction.

AB  - Despite its key role in population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, little is known about factors shaping survival in long-lived territorial species. Here, we assessed several hypotheses that might explain variability in survival in a migratory Spanish population of a long-lived territorial species, the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, using a 16-year monitoring period and live-encounter histories of 835 individually marked birds. Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models showed no evidence for effects of sex or nestling body condition on survival. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of primary productivity) of natal territories had positive effects on juvenile survival, indicating that environmental conditions experienced early in life can determine survival prospects. Survival increased with age (0.73 +/- 0.02 in the first 2 years to 0.78 +/- 0.03 in years 3 and 4) to later decrease when birds were five years old (0.60 +/- 0.05), the age at which they acquire the adult plumage, abandon the communal lifestyle of juveniles, and may look for a breeding territory. At older ages, survival was higher for non-breeding (0.75 +/- 0.02) and breeding adults (0.83 +/- 0.02). Among the latter, birds that recruited into better territories had higher survival prospects. Age-specific variation in survival in this species may be related to behavioural changes linked to dispersal and recruitment into the breeding population, while survival prospects of adult birds strongly depend on breeding territory selection. These results suggest a tradeoff between recruiting soon, and thus reducing mortality costs of a long and extensive dispersal period, and trying to recruit into a good quality territory. Finally, annual survival rates for birds of all age classes were positively related with the NDVI in their African wintering grounds. Although this relationship was probably mediated by food availability, further research is needed to properly identify the limiting factors that are affecting trans-Saharan migrants, especially in light of global climate change.

AB  - Ecologically meaningful predictors are often neglected in plant distribution studies, resulting in incomplete niche quantification and low predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs). Because environmental data are rare and expensive to collect, and because their relationship with local climatic and topographic conditions are complex, mapping them over large geographic extents and at high spatial resolution remains a major challenge.
   Here, we propose to derive environmental data layers by mapping ecological indicator values in space. We combined similar to 6 million plant occurrences with expert-based plant ecological indicator values (EIVs) of 3600 species in Switzerland. EIVs representing local soil properties (pH, moisture, moisture variability, aeration, humus and nutrients) and climatic conditions (continentality, light) were modelled at 93 m spatial resolution with the Random Forest algorithm and 16 predictors representing meso-climate, land use, topography and geology. Models were evaluated and predictions of EIVs were compared with soil inventory data. We mapped each EIV separately and evaluated EIV importance in explaining the distribution of 500 plant species using SDMs with a set of 30 environmental predictors. Finally, we tested how they improve an ensemble of SDMs compared to a standard set of predictors for ca 60 plant species.
   All EIV models showed excellent performance (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.9) and predictions were correlated reasonably (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.4) to soil properties measured in the field. Resulting EIV maps were among the most important predictors in SDMs. Also, in ensemble SDMs overall predictive performance increased, mainly through improved model specificity reducing species range overestimation.
   Combining large citizen science databases to expert-based EIVs is a powerful and cost-effective approach for generalizing local edaphic and climatic conditions over large areas. Producing ecologically meaningful predictors is a first step for generating better predictions of species distribution which is of main importance for decision makers in conservation and environmental management projects.

AB  - Three DNA fragments belonging to genes involved in nitrogen uptake and assimilation, including a nitrate transporter gene (IgNrt2), an ammonium transporter gene (IgAmt), and a glutamine synthetase gene (IgglnII, were obtained from the marine haptophyte, Isochrysis galbana. Based on alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences, the IgNRT2 fragment shared 47%,, identity with the Cylindrotheca fusiformis (Bacillariophyceae) nitrate transporter, the IgAMT fragment shared 48%, identity with the C. fusiformis ammonium transporter, and the IgGSII fragment shared 61% identity with Skeletonema costatum (Bacillariophyceae) glutamine synthetase. Southern hybridization indicated that both IgNrt2 and IgAmt may have more than one copy in the genome of L galbana, but only a single copy was detected for IgglnII. The transcript abundances of these three genes under various nitrogen-supply conditions were monitored simultaneously by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the presence of ammonium, both IgNrt2 and IgAmt were severely repressed with mean mRNA concentrations of 0.67 and 3.45 mu mol (mol 18S rRNA)(-1). IgNrt2 and IgAmt mRNA transcripts increased 41-fold and 8.3-fold, respectively, in the presence of nitrate, and increased 160-fold and 15-fold, respectively, in the ni trogen-depleted condition. The mRNA level of IgglnII was low in cells grown in the presence of ammonium [3.98 mu mol (mol 18S rRNA)(-1)], but mild increases in the range of 2- to 4-fold were observed in cells grown in both nitrate-containing and nitrogen-depleted cultures. Our results demonstrated that the expression patterns of IgNrt2, IgAmt, and IgglnII shared a common trend with their homologous genes in diatoms and green algae under various nitrogen-supply conditions. This group of genes could be used as indicators in natural environments to estimate the degree of nitrogen deficiency and chemical forms of nitrogenous nutrients in use on a species-specific basis.

AB  - The Swiss soil-monitoring network (NABO) was launched in 1984 and comprises currently 105 observation sites covering all characteristic land-use types across Switzerland. So far, the sampling periodicity was 5 y, and the fifth sampling campaign will be accomplished by end of 2009 The concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb, Cu, Hg, Ni, Cr, Co, and F were measured. The major results and conclusions are (1) Even topsoils in remote areas are to some extent polluted, mainly by Pb, Cu, and Cd. However, elevated concentrations can also be of natural origin, e.g., for F, Ni, Cr, and Cd (2) Land use alone is often a rather unreliable indicator to discriminate soil pollution (3) After the 2nd campaign positive, negative, or no temporal concentration changes were measured From the 3rd campaign onwards, nonmonotonous (zigzag) evolutions were frequently observed. Therefore, no certified trends can be stated after three measurement campaigns during a period of 10 y. (4) Soil monitoring is an environmental time-series problem The only way to detect reliable signals and trends earlier is to improve the overall measurement quality (precision and bias) and to shorten the measurement periodicity. (5) The causes of temporal soil concentration changes are complex and result from natural processes, anthropogenic processes, and methodological artifacts Hence, not all soil concentration changes are due to anthropogenic inputs Based on the state-of-art of our experience, some basic methodological requirements and recommendations can be supported for a "good soil-monitoring practice". (1) Assurance of long-term continuity and consistency under changing boundary conditions as site conditions, methodologies, etc. (2) Implementation of a scientifically and politically appropriate spatial and temporal measurement resolution. (3) Long-term assessment of reliability (quality assurance) by adequate quantification of precision, bias, and confidence intervals along the whole measurement chain (4) Documentation of all potentially relevant boundary conditions by suitable metadata. Only soil-monitoring results meeting these requirements are fit to support political decisions

AB  - We examined invertebrate prey. fish diet, and energy assimilation in relation to habitat variation for steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous rainbow trout) and rainbow trout in nine low-order tributaries of the South Fork Trinity River, northern California. These streams spanned a range of environmental conditions, which allowed us to use bioeneractics modeling to determine the relative effects of forest cover, stream temperature, season, and fish age on food consumption and growth efficiency. Evidence of seasonal shifts in reliance on aquatic versus terrestrial food sources was detected among forest cover categories and fish ages, although these categories were not robust indicators of O. mykiss condition and growth efficiency. Consumption estimates were generally less than 20% of maximum consumption, and fish lost weight in some streams during summer low-flow conditions when stream temperatures exceeded 15 degrees C, Current 100-year climate change projections for California threaten to exacerbate negative growth patterns and may undermine the productivity of this steelhead population, which is currently not listed as endangered or threatened. To demonstrate the potential effect of global warming on fish growth. we ran three climate change scenarios in two representative streams. Simulated temperature increases ranging from 1.4 degrees C to 5.5 degrees C during the summer and from 1.5 degrees C to 2.9 degrees C during the winter amplified the weight loss: estimated average growth for age-1 fish was 0.4-4.5 times lower than normal (low to high estimated temperature increase) in the warm stream and 0.05-0.8 times lower in the cool stream. We conclude that feeding rate and temperature during the summer currently limit the growth and productivity of steelhead and rainbow trout in low-order streams in the South Fork Trinity River basin and predict that climate change will have detrimental effects on steelhead growth as well as on macroinvertebrate communities and stream ecosystems in general.

AB  - Responses of ecosystems to human-induced stress vary in space and time, because both stressors and ecosystem vulnerabilities vary in space and time. Presently, ecosystem impact assessments mainly take into account variation in stressors, without considering variation in ecosystem vulnerability. We developed a method to address ecosystem vulnerability variation by quantifying ecosystem vulnerability distributions (EVDs) based on monitoring data of local species compositions and environmental conditions. The method incorporates spatial variation of both abiotic and biotic variables to quantify variation in responses among species and ecosystems. We show that EVDs can be derived based on a selection of locations, existing monitoring data and a selected impact boundary, and can be used in stressor identification and ranking for a region. A case study on Ohio's freshwater ecosystems, with freshwater fish as target species group, showed that physical habitat impairment and nutrient loads ranked highest as current stressors, with species losses higher than 5% for at least 6% of the locations. EVDs complement existing approaches of stressor assessment and management, which typically account only for variability in stressors, by accounting for variation in the vulnerability of the responding ecosystems.

AB  - Scholars have focused on militaristic metaphors of invasion for more than a decade, but few if any studies look to the on-the-ground language of restoration practitioners to determine how they talk about invasive species. Here we demonstrate the absence of militaristic metaphors in one subset of restoration managers in coastal Rhode Island who manage for introduced Phragmites australis, the highly invasive common reed. Instead, these managers frame their discussions of Phragmites in terms of indicators of condition, ecosystem services, and resilience, which might indicate a shift away from command-and-control models of invasive species management. We suggest that qualitative research, including interviews with restoration managers, can offer a useful, in depth view onto issues of management and decision making and that it is crucially important to attend to the language of invasion science and management in an era of global change. Ecological changes in coastal ecosystems seem to impact managers' language choices, while these language choices, in turn, can have far-reaching impacts on decision making in coastal systems.

AB  - Information on the ecological functions of forests is important for sustainable forest management. In this study, we introduced the national monitoring program which has been used in China to evaluate the overall health status and ecological functions of forests. We also compared it to similar monitoring programs operating in Europe and the United States of America. We revealed the strength and drawbacks of China's monitoring program by analyzing the initial evaluation results. Our analysis showed that among the three programs, the European program gives the most detailed measurements of conditions of forests while the U.S. program generates the most detailed information on individual trees. In comparison, China's monitoring program has a higher spatial resolution but is narrowly focused on trees and uses coarse classifications of indicators. The health status of forests in China suggested that more resources should be invested to improve the health of existing forests, especially plantations. The limitations in China's monitoring program need to be addressed to improve the accuracy of future assessments.

AB  - A remote sensing based land cover change assessment methodology is presented and applied to a case study of the Oil Sands Mining Development in Athabasca, Alta., Canada. The primary impact was assessed using an information extraction method applied to two LANDSAT scenes. The analysis based on derived land cover maps shows a decrease of natural vegetation in the study area (715,094 ha) for 2001 approximately -8.64% relative to 1992. Secondary assessment based on a key resources indicator (KRI), calculated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI measurements acquired by NOAA-AVHRR satellites), air temperature and global radiation was performed for a time period from 1990 to 2002. KRI trend analysis indicates a slightly decreasing trend in vegetation greenness in close proximity to the mining development. A good agreement between the time series of inter-annual variations in NDVI and air temperature is observed increasing the confidence of NDVI as an indicator for assessing vegetation productivity and its sensitivity to changes in local conditions.

AB  - Principles of integrated ecosystem-based management have been used to derive 61 potential environmental indicators for reporting on Australia's marine and estuarine ecosystems. They are focused on tracking the condition of marine ecosystems in the face of a variety of uses and pressures, and are consistent with approaches used for assessment of public- and private-sector environmental activities, and with the international standard. The indicators cover issues in protected species, common habitats, renewable and non-renewable resources, water and sediment quality, and integrated management. Gaps in knowledge and technical capacity include: knowledge of the nature of the ecosystems is incomplete (ineffective indicators may be selected); scientific understanding of environmental issues is limited (the wrong cause may be identified); the resolving capacity of a monitoring programme cannot be determined (monitoring may falsely infer that no changes have occurred, or provide an answer to the wrong question); procedures for synthesis and aggregation of data across spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, or for estimating uncertainty in national summaries are lacking; case-study trials, reference sites, and suitable interpretative models are needed; and an established procedure for revising and updating the indicators as new knowledge accrues, or if new issues arise, is lacking.

AB  - A multi-proxy Lateglacial environmental record is described from Lake Naleng (31.10 degrees N; 99.75 degrees E, 4200 m above sea level), situated on south-eastern Tibetan Plateau to gain deeper insights into the hydrological and palaeoclimate development since 17.7 cal ka BP. Palynological reconstructions of variations in mean annual precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT), sedimentological data and sediment chemistry including weathering indicators provide a multi-faceted picture of local and regional environmental changes since the Lateglacial. Principal component analyses of all parameters provide information on interrelationships between each parameters, which help to evaluate their traceability to temperature and precipitation and to estimate their usability as proxy indicators for local and or regional variations.
   During the Lateglacial from 17.7 to 14.0 cal ka BP Lake Naleng experienced cold and dry climate conditions with low biological productivity and supply of unaltered fine-grained material due to the high supply of glacier milk. During the second half of the Lateglacial, climate conditions changed abruptly: increases in MAT (from -4 to -2.2 degrees C) and MAP (from 500 mm to 820 mm) between 14.0 and 13.0 cal ka BP indicate a climate amelioration. This time interval can be correlated to the Bolling/Allerod (B/A) warming period in the North Atlantic region and is followed by the Younger Dryas cold reversal indicated by abrupt decreases of MAT (from -2.2 to -5 degrees C) and MAP (from 820 to 650 mm). The onset of the Holocene at about 11.5 cal ka BP is indicated by rises in reconstructed MAT (from -5 to about -03 degrees C) and MAP (from 600 mm to 950 mm), which led to an increased supply of weathered material and higher biological productivity. Between 5.0 and 3.0 cal ka BP, MAT increases to about 0.2 degrees C and MAP rises to maximum values of about 1000 mm, followed by slightly decreasing MAT and MAP between 3.0 and 0 cal ka BP.
   The biogeochemical parameters (total organic carbon (TOC), C/N, delta C-13(org)) and weathering indicators (e.g. the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and Sr/Ba) are directly (erosion of soils) or indirectly (changing provenance) related to moisture availability on the south-eastern TP and shows matching regional climate oscillations since the Lateglacial. In comparison to other Lateglacial records from the TP, MAP reconstructions from Lake Naleng indicate wetter climate conditions in the south-eastern part of the TP and dryer conditions farther away from moisture sources.

AB  - Metals are concerning pollutants in estuaries, where contamination can undergo significant remobilisation driven by physico-chemical forcing. Environmental concentrations of metals in estuarine sediments are often higher than natural backgrounds, but show no contiguity to potential sources. Thus, better understanding the metal mobility in estuaries is essential to improve identification of pollution sources and their accountability for environmental effects. This study aims to identify the key biogeochemical drivers of metal mobilisation on contaminated estuarine sediments through 91) evaluation of the potential mobilisation under controlled conditions, and 92) investigation of the relevance of metal mobilisation for in situ pollution levels in an area with multiple contaminant sources. Sediments from a saltmarsh adjacent to a coastal landfill, a marina, and a shipyard on the Thames Estuary (Essex, UK) were exposed in the laboratory 924 h, N = 96, 20 degrees C) to water under various salinity, pH, and redox potential. Major cations, Fe(II), and trace metal concentrations were analysed in the leachate and sediment. Salinity, pH and redox had a significant effect on metal mobilisation (p < 0.001), e.g. under certain conditions Fe(II) leaching was increased similar to 1000-fold. Measurements in situ of surface and subsurface sediment cores revealed that landfill proximity poorly explained metal spatial distribution. However, physicochemical parameters explained up to 97% of geochemically normalized metal concentrations in sediments. Organic matter and pH were dominant factors for most of the metal concentrations at the sediment surface. At subsurface, major cations (Ca, Na, Mg and K) were determinant predictors of metal concentrations. Applying the empirical model obtained in the laboratory to geochemical conditions of the studied saltmarsh it was possible to demonstrate that Fe mobilisation regulates the fate of this (and other) metal in that area. Thus, present results highlight the importance of metal mobility to control sediment pollution and estuarine fate of metals. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glucocorticoids (GCs) are often interpreted as indicators of disturbance, habitat quality, and fitness in wild populations. However, since most investigations have been unable to examine habitat variability, GC levels, and fitness simultaneously, such interpretations remain largely unvalidated. We combined a quantification of two habitat types, a manipulation of foraging ability (feather-clipping just prior to nestling rearing), multiple baseline plasma GC measures, and multi-year reproductive monitoring to experimentally examine the linkages between habitat quality, GCs, and fitness in female tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor. Control females experiencing the higher early-season food resources of inland-pasture habitat laid larger clutches, but fledged an equal number but lower mass offspring compared to those in riparian-cropland habitat. Despite these differences in reproductive success, females nesting in the two habitat types did not differ in baseline GC levels at the early-or late-breeding stage. Feather-clipping reduced provisioning rate in both habitat types. However, baseline GC levels were affected in a habitat-specific way; only individuals in inland-pasture habitats showed an increase in GCs. Despite this difference in GC levels, the manipulation did not influence offspring mass, reproductive output, adult return rate (a proxy for survival) to the following year, or reproductive success in the subsequent year. Nonetheless, regardless of treatment, individuals with higher GC levels during the late breeding stage returned in the following year with higher GC levels at incubation, indicating a long-term effect on future GC levels. Our results indicate that environmental changes (e.g. foraging conditions) can have consequences for body condition, behaviour, and current and future baseline GC levels without concomitant influences on fitness, and that differences in fitness components between habitats may not be reflected in baseline GC levels. These results illustrate that baseline GCs may not simultaneously reflect environmental quality and fitness, potentially limiting their application in ecological and conservation settings.

AB  - A detailed analysis of organic matter from the Oxfordian-Lower Valanginian interval of the Nordvik section (Anabar Bay) allows the definition of three geochemical horizons (terpane, diasterene, and hopane), which are characterized by specific geochemical compounds and their ratios. These horizons are correlated with several stages in the evolution of microfossils associated with ecological and geochemical changes in sea paleobasin. Our study shows a good correlation among the variation in many geochemical parameters, the composition of microfossil assemblages, and the transgressive-regressive phases of the paleobasin evolution. Moderately shallow-water facies was reconstructed using micropaleontological, palynological, and lithological data from the upper and lower parts of the section, where the terpane and hopane horizons were identified. Both horizons are characterized by a general dominance of hopanes over other polycyclic biomarkers, the presence of compounds with the biological configuration and organic matter of mixed terrestrial-marine origin, the presence of benzohopanes and retene, an indicator of the conifer resins. This is also reflected in the composition of palynological assemblages, which are dominated by terrestrial palynomorphs, with rare conifer pollen grains. Relatively deep-water facies were identified in the middle part of the section (diasterene horizon). A distinctive geochemical feature of this interval is high relative abundances of diasterenes and 4-methyldiasterenes. The lower subhorizon is characterized by the highest values of the pristane/n-C-17 ratio and relatively light delta C-13 values of noncarbonate carbon. The aromatic fractions have anomalously high concentrations of methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs), which are interpreted to be derived mostly from chlorophyll of prasinophytes. The terpenoid distribution is marked by the presence of neohop-13(18)-enes, which probably originated from the activity of methanotrophic bacteria. The above geochemical parameters indicate high photic zone productivity (which is confirmed by the composition of palynological assemblages with abundant dinocysts and prasinophytes) that favored the accumulation of organic matter in dysaerobic conditions, which periodically occurred in the bottom of paleobasin. The alternation of dysaerobic and low-oxic bottom water conditions is easily reconstructed from the analysis of microbenthic communities. The analysis of biogeochemical, micropaleontological, paleontological, and palynological data on the Upper Volgian-lowermost Berriasian organic-rich shales revealed a very good source rock potential for this part of the section, as indicated by relatively high concentrations of organic matter of mixed bacterial-algal genesis and stagnant conditions during deposition and diagenesis. However, this potential was not realized because of the extremely "mild" thermobaric conditions that existed within the Mesozoic strata of the present-day Anabar Bay. At the same time, our results and analysis of the available data allow an optimistic assessment of the hydrocarbon potential of Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous deposits on the Laptev Sea shelf.

AB  - The purpose of the research presented in the article is to study the attitude of various social groups of residents of the Far North - the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation to health, taking into account extreme natural and climatic conditions. Geospatial conditions are imposed by the socio-spatial vector of development of the Russian Arctic, which should coordinate neo-industrial development of certain parts of this territory, the formation of a new transport and logistics system, and the reproduction of the agro-industrial complex. There are groups of actors in each of the identified areas, who carry out their activities in the Arctic territories on a permanent or temporary basis, which makes the northerners' health issues highly specific and requiring a comprehensive analysis, including the sociological one. The scientific novelty of the research and its results presented in the article consists in a combination of geo- and socio-spatial approaches to studying the attitude to health among various social groups of northerners, and analysis of their specifics in Arctic conditions. The Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is the base region of the study. Its health care system has both positive results and unresolved issues in the field of population health. The authors reveal the possibilities of its further improvement based on sociological and interdisciplinary research from a systemic perspective, taking into account the fact that the main resources of health saving are lifestyle, nutrition, quality medical care, and the environment. The authors note that the situation significantly differs in large and small cities of the Arctic, villages and shift settlements, and among nomads in the tundra. The materials of statistics, mass representative surveys, and comparative expert assessments are analyzed. The research findings illustrate the identified opportunities for improving the health of different groups of the Arctic population and indicate the need to significantly strengthen the comprehensive scientific support of Arctic projects, including sociological monitoring. The materials and results of the work are particularly relevant due to the upcoming Russia's presidency in the international Arctic Council.

AB  - The Southern Ocean is currently experiencing major environmental changes, including in sea-ice cover. Such changes strongly influence ecosystem structure and functioning and affect the survival and reproduction of predators such as seabirds. These effects are likely mediated by reduced availability of food resources. As such, seabirds are reliable eco-indicators of environmental conditions in the Antarctic region. Here, based on 9 years of sea-ice data, we found that the breeding success of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) reaches a peak at intermediate sea-ice cover (ca. 20%). We further examined the effects of sea-ice conditions on the foraging activity of penguins, measured at multiple scales from individual dives to foraging trips. Analysis of temporal organisation of dives, including fractal and bout analyses, revealed an increasingly consistent behaviour during years with extensive sea-ice cover. The relationship between several dive parameters and sea-ice cover in the foraging area appears to be quadratic. In years of low and high sea-ice cover, individuals adjusted their diving effort by generally diving deeper, more frequently and by resting at the surface between dives for shorter periods of time than in years with intermediate sea-ice cover. Our study therefore suggests that sea-ice cover is likely to affect the reproductive performance of Adelie penguins through its effects on foraging behaviour, as breeding success and most diving parameters share a common optimum. Some years, however, deviated from this general trend, suggesting that other factors (e.g. precipitation during the breeding season) might sometimes become preponderant over the sea-ice effects on breeding and foraging performance. Our study highlights the value of monitoring fitness parameters and individual behaviour concomitantly over the long-term to better characterize optimal environmental conditions and potential resilience of wildlife. Such an approach is crucial if we want to anticipate the effects of environmental change on Antarctic penguin populations.

AB  - The skin is the largest organ in the body and is consistently exposed to aggressive environmental attacks (biological/physical/chemical, etc.). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed during the normal oxidative metabolism which enhances to a lethal level under stress conditions referred to as oxidative stress. While, under normal conditions, cells are capable of dealing with ROS using non-enzymatic and enzymatic defense system, it can lead to a critical damage to cell system via the oxidation of cellular components under stress condition. Lipid peroxidation is a well-established mechanism of cellular injury in all kinds of organisms and it is often used as an indicator of oxidative stress in cells and tissues. In the presence of metal ions, ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produces highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) via Fenton reaction. In the current study, we have used the porcine skin (intact pig ear/skin biopsies) as an ex vivo/in vitro model system to represent human skin. Experimental results have been presented on the participation of HO center dot in the initiation of lipid peroxidation and thereby leading to the formation of reactive intermediates and the formation of electronically excited species eventually leading to ultra-weak photon emission (UPE). To understand the participation of different electronically excited species in the overall UPE, the effect of a scavenger of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) on photon emission in the visible and near-infrared region of the spectrum was measured which showed its contribution. In addition, measurement with interference filter with a transmission in the range of 340540 nm reflected a substantial contribution of triplet carbonyls (L-3=0*) in the photon emission. Thus, it is concluded that during the oxidative radical reactions, the UPE is contributed by the formation of both L-3=0* and O-1(2). The method used in the current study is claimed to be a potential tool for non-invasive determination of the physiological and pathological state of human skin in dermatological research.

AB  - With the development of open source community, through the interaction of developers, the collaborative development of software, and the sharing of software tools, the formation of open source software ecosystem has matured. Natural ecosystems provide ecological services on which human beings depend. Maintaining a healthy natural ecosystem is a necessity for the sustainable development of mankind. Similarly, maintaining a healthy ecosystem of open source software is also a prerequisite for the sustainable development of open source communities, such as GitHub. This paper takes GitHub as an example to analyze the health condition of open source ecosystem and, also, it is a research area in Symmetry. Firstly, the paper presents the healthy definition of GitHub open source ecosystem health and, then, according to the main components of natural ecosystem health, the paper proposes the health indicators and health indicators evaluation method. Based on the above, the GitHub ecosystem health prediction method is proposed. By analyzing the projects and data collected in GitHub, it is found that, using the proposed evaluation indicators and method, we can analyze the healthy development trend of the GitHub ecosystem and contribute to the stability of ecosystem development.

AB  - In the higher-tier environmental risk assessment of chemicals, species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) are used to statistically describe differences in sensitivity between species and derive community level endpoints. SSDs are usually based on the results from short-term laboratory experiments performed under constant environmental conditions. However, different species may be kept at different "optimal" temperatures, which influence their apparent sensitivity and thus the derivation of endpoints. Also, the extrapolation capacity of SSDs is largely limited to the tested species and conditions. Time-variable exposures and effects at higher levels of biological organization, including biological interactions, are not considered. The quantitative effect prediction at higher tiers would ultimately require the extrapolation of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics to untested species and the involvement of population and community modeling. In this regard, we tested a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling approach to mechanistically consider and correct endpoints for ambient temperature and demonstrate the significance for SSDs. We explored correlations in toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model parameters which would allow for the extrapolation of sensitivities to untested species. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the approach for higher level effect predictions using an individual-based model. Our results suggest that mechanistic effect modeling approaches can reduce the uncertainties in higher tier effect assessments related to knowledge gaps.

AB  - Biological damage due to material characteristics and climatic change poses serious threats to wooden cultural heritage objects in Korea. This study is a preliminary survey for the preparation of a conservation/management plan for Janggyeongpanjeon (depositories of the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks), which is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, and Daejanggyeongpan (Printing woodblcoks of the Tripitaka Koreana), which is part of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme. Over a period of two years, we monitored the distribution of insect and microbial species and the environmental condition in and around the Janggyeongpanjeon, including wood moisture content, and conducted relevant comparison and analysis. As a result, we compiled a list of species of wood-damaging organisms for the long-term conservation and management of the Janggyeongpanjeon (depository halls) and Daejanggyeongpan (woodblocks) and identified high-risk periods of biological damage for these wooden cultural heritage objects. The results of comprehensive analysis of the biological distribution and environmental condition demonstrated that conservation of the original form of the Janggyeongpanjeon and Daejanggyeongpan is based on a complex interplay of the material characteristics of the wood used, architectural features of the Janggyeongpanjeon enabling ventilation, and Daejanggyeongpan manufacturing technique.

AB  - Degradation processes in reinforced concrete structures that affect durability are partially controlled by transport of aggressive ions through the concrete microstructure. Ions are charged and the ability of concrete to hold out against transfer of ions greatly relies on its electrical resistivity. Hence, a connection could be expected between electrical resistivity of concrete and the deterioration processes such as increase in permeability and corrosion of embedded steel. Through this paper, an extensive literature review has been done to address relationship between concrete electrical resistivity and its certain durability characteristics. These durability characteristics include chloride diffusivity and corrosion of reinforcement as these have major influence on concrete degradation process. Overall, there exists an inverse or direct proportional correlation between these parameters. Evaluated results, from measuring the concrete electrical resistivity, can also be used as a great indicator to identify early age characteristics of fresh concrete and for evaluation of its properties, determination of moisture content, connectivity of the micropores, and even condition assessment of in-service structures. This paper also reviews and assesses research concerning the influential parameters such as environmental conditions and presence of steel rebar and cracks on measuring electrical resistivity of concrete. Moreover, concrete resistivity concept, application, and its various measurement techniques are introduced.

AB  - The architecture and regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network are among the best studied owing to its widespread use in both basic research and industry. Yet, several recent studies have revealed notable limitations in explaining genotype-metabolic phenotype relations in this yeast, especially when concerning multiple genetic/environmental perturbations. Apparently unexpected genotype-phenotype relations may originate in the evolutionarily shaped cellular operating principles being hidden in common laboratory conditions. Predecessors of laboratory S. cerevisiae strains, the wild and the domesticated yeasts, have been evolutionarily shaped by highly variable environments, very distinct from laboratory conditions, and most interestingly by social life within microbial communities. Here we present a brief review of the genotypic and phenotypic peculiarities of S. cerevisiae in the context of its social lifestyle beyond laboratory environments. Accounting for this ecological context and the origin of the laboratory strains in experimental design and data analysis would be essential in improving the understanding of genotype-environment-phenotype relationships.Could complex genotype-phenotype observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae originate from its evolutionary history rich with social life?.Could complex genotype-phenotype observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae originate from its evolutionary history rich with social life?.

AB  - Currently, a common obstacle to the operation of wind turbines are states of extreme power, and above all the power of their actions, and the associated unpredictability of profitability. Net profit margin of power and energy, also the CO2 emissions in the case of wind turbines - indicates how much profit (loss) after tax (net) generate income from operations.High economic profits and low ecological mischievousness of activities of wind power plant are desirable states, but energy security requires to Effectively counteract the negative effects of extremely high or low value of the energy characteristics utilities, or the aerodynamic and meteorological conditions, which are a direct cause of negative phenomena.
   In the paper for the aim of research adopted to verify mathematical models to estimate the mean and variance of energy, economic and environmental profitability of wind power for the updated distribution of wind on the basis of the mean and variance of the annual profitability of a wind turbine for "elderly" and the current distribution of wind.
   The article presents issues related to the operational management and exploitation of complex technical objects on the example of large wind turbine. In the paper developed the mathematical model of wind turbine productivity depending on variable wind speed and localization. Considered operational profits and losses of energy in sub- and supercritical wind conditions. Research of productivity for the real object was carried out on the basis of the research results of the wind turbine Vestas V90 / 105m 2 MW located in the municipality of Blaszki.It is assumed that the basic utility characteristic, characterizing the work of wind power is the amount of electricity generated in time. For determination this characteristic the parameters C and K of Weibull function was used.
   Positively tested and rated the assumption of speed ranges and wind flow: subcritical, supercritical and effective. Variable wind conditions make it difficult to estimate the theoretical productivity of a wind power plant. Estimates made on the basis of theoretical dependence and calculations are burdened with mistake precisely because of the volatility and unpredictability of wind conditions.
   The study did not assess the short-term (eg. Monthly), specific profitability, due to the volatility of prices and the value of certificates of energy origin in different periods of research. Compiled while the annual economic, energy and environmental indicators of benefits defined as differences in productivity and operational costs to obtain it in terms of annual wind (2013-2015). The highest values were obtained in the studied years: in 2013 for economic benefits, k(e) = f*(v, n(e),p(e)) 1436 thousand PLN; in 2014 for the of energy benefit ken = f(v, n(en), p(en)) 5504 MWh; also in 2014 for the environmental benefits k(ekol) = f(v, n(ekol), P-ekol) 4457 teqCO(2).

AB  - A spatially developing transitional flow in a vertical channel with one side heated uniformly and subjected to random velocity fluctuations at the inlet is investigated in this experimental and numerical study. Two Rayleigh numbers are studied. Experimentally, Particle Image Velocimetry is used to obtain a complete two-dimensional velocity field of the streamwise flow development. A three-dimensional Large-Eddy-Simulation investigation is also performed to obtain a complete streamwise evolution of the flow. The results allow the definition of three transition indicators on the basis of the time-averaged velocities and temperatures fields as well as on the turbulent statistics of the flow. The detailed experimental and numerical spatial development of the transitional natural convective flow is then presented and the ability of the indicators to capture the early and the advanced stages of the transition is assessed. The numerical simulations were performed on the assumptions of a thermally stratified environment, submitted to an environmental noise, and for which wall to wall radiations were considered. These conditions aim at representing realistic experimental conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hyperarid region of Israel and Jordan covers a large area where numerous sites of Pleistocene lake sediments suggest that climate conditions were significantly wetter during the Pleistocene. This region experienced a significant increase in aridity in recent decades and the number of existing surface waters is diminishing rapidly. We studied ostracod shells from 49 pond and stream sites to determine the species distribution and to infer ecological preferences especially with respect to general differences in water movement, conductivity and ion composition. Twenty-two ostracod species were identified in total of which 12 taxa occur at three or more sites. Among the rarer species. Cyprinotus scholiosus was identified for the first time after two records from Plio- and Pleistocene sites in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Further, Paracypretta amati was recorded and its ecological preferences discussed for the first time following the description of the species from its type locality in Sudan. Cypridopsis elongata is the only typical inhabitant of lotic habitats, strictly preferring freshwater conditions and waters with an alkalinity/Ca ratio around 1 and cations dominated by Ca2+ and anions by HCO3-. In contrast, Cyprideis torosa, Limnocythere inopinata and Heterocypris incongruens apparently prefer waters dominated by Na+ associated with cations and Cl- associated with anions. Heterocypris salina and C. torosa occur over a wide conductivity (or salinity) range and in waters with alkalinity/Ca ratios around 1 and with significant alkalinity depletion. Humphcypris subterranea, Ilyocypris spp. and H. sauna are the only taxa which do not show any preference with respect to both the cation and anion dominance of the waters. The ecological preferences of the ostracod species from water bodies in the study area are discussed in detail and can be used for a qualitative assessment of the hydrodynamical and hydrochemical conditions of former water bodies in the presently hyperarid environment based on ostracod species composition analysis of Pleistocene aquatic sediments.

AB  - Estuaries are under major impacts from pollution even when managed as conservation units. Here we used multiple biogeochemical indexes of contamination and trophic status, including faecal sterols, biopolymers and trace metals, to determine and compare environmental quality of two tropical estuaries with contrasting conservation status. In the metropolitan estuary, eutrophic/hypereutrophic conditions and high concentrations (> 1.0 mu g g(-1)) of coprostanol were spatially correlated to sources of raw sewage input. Unexpected eutrophic sediments were also detected at the estuarine reserve, but with low sewage contamination indicating that high organic availability and burial predominated. The natural or polluted eutrophic sediments were determined by comparing multiple contamination indexes, which indicated sediment contamination within the metropolitan estuary. This study indicates that the long-term conservation of estuarine ecosystems on the Atlantic coast of Brazil are threatened by a typically poor sewage treatment and suggests that estuarine sediment quality need to be evaluated by multiple proxies before estuaries can be included in spatial conservation planning.

AB  - Intertidal wetlands are fragile ecological systems vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. Using the Rapid Assessment Approach, intertidal wetland sediments were dynamically evaluated in the Deep Bay, South China in terms of monitored benthic macroinvertebrates. The observation and expectation ratio indicated variations of intertidal wetland sediment quality had taken place at certain ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Mai Po Marshes. Series of dynamic models were used to simulate the behavior of certain environmental variables (i.e. cadmium, copper, lead and zinc accumulation rates) that might have adverse effect on the growth of benthic macroinvertebrates, and hence interpreted the results of the ecological assessment. The changes of sediment quality were primarily due to anthropogenic activities and were further attributed largely to the industrial discharged heavy metals which were unevenly distributed and heavily accumulated at some sensitivity areas (i.e. Futian National Natural Reserve and Mai Po Marshes) with help of sediment deposition altered by long-term tidal flow actions in Deep Bay.

AB  - Spatial patterns of phytoplankton communities and relationships with water quality status were studied in the Hangzhou section of Jing-Hang Cannel, northern China during a 1-year cycle (February 2008-January 2009). Samples were collected monthly at six sampling stations within a contamination gradient. Physico-chemical variables, such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen, were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. The phytoplankton communities showed a clear spatial pattern in response to the changes in environmental parameters, especially COD, TN and TP. Phytoplankton-based saprobien indices may reflect the spatial variation in water quality status (from beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic zone) in the canal system. However, species diversity, richness and evenness failed to discriminate between different levels of water quality status although these parameters are often used to summarize community relationships with environmental conditions. These results suggest that phytoplankton communities, but not diversity indices, can be used as a potential bioindicator of water quality in freshwater river systems.

AB  - Ants can represent a useful model for studies on the impact of forest fragmentation because these organisms are found abundantly in soil and plants sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Our study characterized the structure of ground foraging ant communities present in 10 fragmented areas of dry forest surrounding areas under soybean and maize cultivation. Using baited pitfall traps, our study identified 60 ant morphospecies, distributed in 21 genera. Species richness of ground foraging ants was not influenced by size of dry forest fragment. Fragment edge traps captured fewer species when compared with traps located in the center of the fragment. Species richness and species composition differed significantly between dry forest fragments and both cultivated crops as well as inter-crop periods. Dry forest fragments had the greatest ant species richness. Integrated knowledge of the mechanisms through which fragmentation effects alter ant communities can be useful for the development of strategies to mitigate harmful effects on those species affected, and to improve methods that can be used to evaluate the conservation value of the remaining natural environment.

AB  - Mine subsidence can induce streambed ruptures that pirate surface water from a stream. Current understanding of the effects of longwall mining on streams lacks rigorous analytical approaches to detect hydrologic effects and does not consider the efficacy of streambed restoration techniques to address flow disruption. CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company, LLC (CPCC) collected and analyzed pre-mining, post-mining, and post-restoration stream discharge and flow duration data from 51.9 km of streams overlying its Bailey Mine to define pre-mining flow variability, detect post-mining changes, and evaluate post-intervention flow recovery. The primary intervention method for restoring stream flow was bedrock permeation grouting. Pre-mine and post-mine baseflow data were compared using both parametric and non-parametric hypothesis testing, which yielded similar results. An environmental flow assessment method for headwater streams using probabilistic risk assessment and correlation analysis of change threshold criteria was developed to differentiate hydrologic change as induced by mine subsidence or explained by natural variability. The method is objective, pragmatic, and statistically delimited.

AB  - Water scarcity and destruction of natural resources are two most important environmental challenges in Zayanderood basin and proper use of water is important in the management of the basin. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the non-expert decision of managers on the environment and water in the Zayanderud basin. So, land cover changes were investigated using Landsat images in the basin from 2008 to 2015. Then, the cost of the destruction of rangeland for agricultural development was estimated using some of the indicators of measuring the economic values of ecosystems. Results showed that the change cover land is increasing quickly in some parts of the basin, while water scarcity of Zayanderood basin has remained in critical condition. Also, an economic value of at least US$1455.49per hectare was delivered to people in 2015 by the rangeland and the cost of destruction rangelands was USS10559.6per hectare over the last decade. Considering the impact of natural resource services destruction on person's welfare, proposed to the decision makers to determine the high social value of rangeland for assessment of agricultural development projects.

AB  - Ecological momentary assessment includes continuous, real-time gathering of self-report data in a participant's natural environment. The current study evaluated the possible impact of this assessment strategy on severity of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a sample of participants who reported experiencing a past traumatic event. Participants with clinically elevated PTS symptoms reported symptom severity at three time-points: during an initial screening, following an unmonitored period, and following two weeks of monitoring. During the monitoring period, participants carried an Android device which prompted them to report PTS symptoms and negative emotions six times daily. PTS severity scores were then compared across these three time-points. Results indicated that participating in the ecological momentary assessment protocol was associated with a significant reduction in PTS severity, whereas significant changes were not noted over the unmonitored control condition. The authors conclude that ecological momentary assessment may have therapeutic value even when not combined with formal intervention, and it may be a useful tool for improving the efficiency of a stepped-care approach to treating PTS symptoms.

AB  - Edaphic cyanobacteria and algae have been extensively studied in dryland soils because they play key roles in the formation of biological soil crusts and the stabilization of soil surfaces. Yet, in temperate agricultural crop soils, little is understood about the functional significance of indigenous photosynthetic microbial communities for various soil processes. This study investigated how indigenous soil algae and cyanobacteria affected topsoil aggregate stability in cereal cropping systems. Topsoil aggregates from conventional and organic cropping systems were incubated in microcosms under dark or photoperiodic conditions with or without a treatment with an herbicide (isoproturon). Physicochemical parameters (bound exopolysaccharides, organic carbon) and microbial parameters (esterase activity, chlorophyll a biomass, and pigment profiles) were measured for incubated aggregates. Aggregate stability were analyzed on the basis of aggregate size distribution and the mean weight diameter (MWD) index, resulting from disaggregation tests. Soil photosynthetic microbial biomass (chl a) was strongly and positively correlated with aggregate stability indicators. The development of microalgae crusts in photoperiodic conditions induced a strong increase of the largest aggregates (>2 mm), as compared to dark conditions (up to 10.6 fold and 27.1 fold, in soil from organic and conventional cropping systems, respectively). Concomitantly, the MWD significantly increased by 2.4 fold and 4.2 fold, for soil from organic and conventional cropping systems. Soil microalgae may have operated directly via biochemical mechanisms, by producing exopolymeric matrices surrounding soil aggregates (bound exopolysaccharides: 0.39-0.45 mu g C g(-1) soil), and via biophysical mechanisms, where filamentous living microbiota enmeshed soil aggregates. In addition, they may have acted indirectly by stimulating heterotrophic microbial communities, as revealed by the positive effect of microalgal growth on total microbial activity. The herbicide treatment negatively impacted soil microalgal community, resulting in significant decreases of the MWD of the conventional soil aggregates (up to -42% of the value in light treatment). This study underscores that indigenous edaphic algae and cyanobacteria can promote aggregate formation, by forming photosynthetic microbiotic crusts, thus improving the structural stability of topsoil, in temperate croplands. However, the herbicide uses can impair the functional abilities of algal and cyanobacterial communities in agricultural soils.
   Originality/Significance: Edaphic algal and cyanobacterial communities are known to form photosynthetic microbial crusts in arid soils, where they drive key ecosystem functions. Although less well characterized, such communities are also transiently abundant in temperate and mesic cropped soils. This microcosm study investigated the communities' functional significance in topsoil aggregate formation and stabilization in two temperate cropping systems. Overall, our results showed that the development of indigenous microalgal communities under our experimental conditions drove higher structural stability in topsoil aggregates in temperate cropland soils. Also, herbicide use affected photosynthetic microbial communities and consequently impaired soil aggregation.

AB  - Termite communities reflect soil conditions and the condition of the ecosystem services that they provide. The present study first evaluated the relationship between termite communities and soil conditions in a wide range of land use systems in deforested areas in the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon. Then, we identified termite indicator species for the ecosystem service levels provided by them. Termites were collected on 38 farms in both countries (12 in Colombia and 26 in Peru) at 190 sampling points (five per farm). Eight types of plant cover were identified: natural forests, secondary vegetation, agroforestry systems, sylvopastoral systems, perennial and annual crops, degraded and wooded pastures. Variables representing chemical fertility, hydrological functions of the soil, soil macro-aggregation and macroinvertebrate communities respectively, were measured at each point. Then, four synthetic indicators of ecosystem services were designed, respectively, based on this information. Termite indicator species for soil ecosystem services were searched for using the index value indicator method (IndVal). Among the 48 species collected (12 in Colombia, 45 in Peru and nine in common), 11 were identified as indicator species. Two indicator species were found in Colombia: one for chemical fertility and one for state of soil macro-aggregation. No indicator species were registered for hydrological soil functions and macroinvertebrate community biodiversity. In Peru, nine species were statistically significant indicators: four for chemical fertility, one for soil macro-aggregation, six for macroinvertebrate community biodiversity, two for hydrological soil functions, and four species were indicators for more than one service. This study presents significant evidence of the negative effects of degrading changes in land use on the abundance and richness of termite communities. The indicator ability demonstrated by termite species makes them a valuable monitoring tool. Their absence or presence can opportunely indicate the negative effects of certain management practices on soil ecosystem services. It can also indicate progress in soil restoration processes.

AB  - This study applies the Carbon-Generic Estuary Model (C-GEM) modeling platform to simulate the estuarine biogeochemical dynamics - in particular the airwater CO2 exchange - in three idealized tidal estuaries characterized by increasing riverine influence, from a socalled "marine estuary" to a "riverine estuary". An intermediate case called "mixed estuary" is also considered. C-GEM uses a generic biogeochemical reaction network and a unique set of model parameters extracted from a comprehensive literature survey to perform steady-state simulations representing average conditions for temperate estuaries worldwide. Climate and boundary conditions are extracted from published global databases (e.g., World Ocean Atlas, GLORICH) and catchment model outputs (GlobalNEWS2). The whole-system biogeochemical indicators net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), C and N filtering capacities (FCTC and FCTN, respectively) and CO2 gas exchanges (FCO2) are calculated across the three idealized systems and are related to their main hydrodynamic and transport characteristics. A sensitivity analysis, which propagates the parameter uncertainties, is also carried out, followed by projections of changes in the biogeochemical indicators for the year 2050. Results show that the average C filtering capacities for baseline conditions are 40, 30 and 22% for the marine, mixed and riverine estuary, respectively, while N filtering capacities, calculated in a similar fashion, range from 22% for the marine estuary to 18 and 15% for the mixed and the riverine estuaries. Sensitivity analysis performed by varying the rate constants for aerobic degradation, denitrification and nitrification over the range of values reported in the literature significantly widens these ranges for both C and N. Simulations for the year 2050 suggest that all estuaries will remain largely heterotrophic, although a slight improvement of the estuarine trophic status is predicted. In addition, our results suggest that, while the riverine and mixed systems will only marginally be affected by an increase in atmospheric pCO(2), the marine estuary is likely to become a significant CO2 sink in its downstream section. In the decades to come, such a change in behavior might strengthen the overall CO2 sink of the estuary-coastal ocean continuum.

AB  - Grassland plants, especially their root systems, are dynamic and can buffer changes resulting from exposure to multiple stressors; however, the interactive stressor effects on root dynamics and associated above-ground growth are poorly understood. Here, we examine the effects of changed precipitation and air temperature, and defoliation intensity on root length dynamics and above-ground biomass using the third year data from a multifactor experiment conducted across three northern temperate grasslands. We found that root length was more sensitive to the changes in environmental and management conditions than root mass, demonstrating the importance of root length as an indicator of rapid root system changes. Across all sites, warming, altered precipitation and defoliation intensity interacted to affect root length while above-ground biomass was only affected by defoliation intensity, indicating that the root system was more responsive than above-ground biomass when climatic conditions change. Overall, drought reduced root length, particularly under low defoliation intensity, as well as in combination with warming and heavy defoliation, highlighting the risk of additive effects of such environmental stresses. Across unclipped plots, above-ground biomass was positively associated with total root length, the latter of which further interacted with precipitation, to affect above-ground biomass. Compared to defoliated communities, non-defoliated plant communities exhibited a greater ability to maintain above-ground biomass under drought conditions via increases in root system efficiency (the amount of above-ground biomass produced per unit of root length invested). Our results highlight the rapid change of root length in the face of interactive stressors. We postulate that the degree of stability in above-ground biomass is driven by the altered root system dynamics or species turnover. Future studies are warranted that more directly assess how root length responses under climate change impact other important plant traits in grasslands.

AB  - Relationships between various techniques of stream restoration and selected characteristics of larvae of Ephemera danica (Muller 1764), were investigated along a small lowland watercourse, the Kwacza (N Poland). Effects of stream restoration were assessed on the basis of abundance, biomass, and body length of mayfly larvae as well as their biological condition (i.e. relation of mean body weight and length) within a decade (2007-2017) at each of 10 various hydrotechnical constructions along a 2.5-km stretch of the watercourse. Our results show that hydromorphological changes in the stream bed were strong stress factors for the mayfly population, especially in the first year of monitoring. In the following years, the applied restoration techniques created windows of opportunity for the population of E. danica which were successfully used by this species, as it increased in abundance and body length and colonized the whole restored stretch of the stream. Finally, 10 years after the river bed transformation, mayfly density increased 4-fold, while larval body length and biomass increased about 40-fold, as compared with the pre-restoration period. The improved habitat conditions of E. danica were observed in the sections where stream banks were strengthened with tree trunks, double groynes, and double semi-palisades to protect the banks against erosion. Surprisingly, the highest increase in larval abundance was recorded in a by-pass zone, an isolated part of the stream bed, which played the role of a refuge. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that the mayfly population development after the stream restoration was primarily due to modified water velocities in the transformed sections and changes in water quality (e.g. higher pH, lower concentrations of N-NO3-). We inferred that the modification of the stream bed has contributed to favourable changes in the studied mayfly population, which constitutes an important food base for the fish fauna.

AB  - Forecasting the ecological effects of climate change on marine species is critical for informing greenhouse gas mitigation targets and developing marine conservation strategies that remain effective and increase species' resilience under changing climate conditions. Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.

AB  - Introduction. Introduction Feature of the modern radio electronic systems is the need to ensure their effective functioning in conditions of the changing working conditions and the uncertainty regarding the internal factors and the external random factors. In such situations, more and more often, there are critical events of a diverse nature, when a number of target indicators of the system or functional characteristics of the environment go beyond the permissible limits. From the point of view of information analysis, the critical situation arises under the condition of insufficient information support of processes in the radio electronic systems, the information loss and the restrictions on the operation time of radio electronic systems.
   The use of existing methods of information analysis for evaluating the qualitative characteristics of radio electronic systems in critical operating modes is not possible. This is due to several circumstances. Firstly, generally known methods are based on a static approach. Consequently, time limits for the work of radio electronic systems cannot be taken into account. Secondly, the dynamics of entering the critical regime remains hidden, this does not allow to evaluate the threat of an accident or disaster in the event of further deployment of critical events. In addition, it is impossible to predict the consequences of the information loss or the effect of deliberate interference on the radio systems characteristics. Thus, the task of evaluating the qualitative characteristics of radio electronic systems in critical operating modes is relevant and practically oriented.
   Results. For solve the problem use the analogy method, which involves the reduction of predictive models and models of technical systems to the level of multi-elemental physical systems.
   The effectiveness of the radio electronic systems depends on the amount and value of information that comes to them in the process of functioning. Taking into account the peculiarities of the work of the radio electronic systems In critical operating modes, we will consider useful information and misleading or lost information.
   On the basis of the method of partial quantities, the task of evaluating the qualitative characteristics of the radio electronic systems in the critical operating modes is solved. In the process of solving the task automated and automated systems are considered separately.
   The need to use automated systems is due to the fact that the human operator can give way to technical means for the speed, timing of tasks and the amount of perceived information, but it is the most flexible, versatile and active link. Thanks to the human operator, the intra-system interaction is combined into a single, purposeful process of functioning.
   Taken into account, that in conditions of deliberate interferences with an unknown distribution of probabilities, the main burden lies on the human operator, who uses a priori knowledge about the nature of useful signals and interferences, experience and intuition. A critical situation arises when disorientation and overloading of the operator is achieved.
   The classical results of the application of the partial-value method were supplemented by information components, which enabled to take into account the information capabilities of typical dynamic links and relative errors of the transition process. For automatic systems, the dependence of the error on time, the initial values of the partial values and the constant time of the dynamic units is established. The essential factor was that the dynamic properties of the human-operator, which follows the object in the conditions of interference is taken into account, and the requirements for the time of its operation is established.
   Conclusions. The obtained results allow us to proceed to a qualitatively new level of macroscopic analysis of radio electronic systems, give an opportunity to evaluate their characteristics in critical operating modes and to predict these characteristics at the initial stage of the design of radio electronic systems.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in hydrological effects on riverine ecosystems, few studies have documented the impact of hydrology on biofilm community functions, and those existing have typically focused on annual-based hydrological indices. In this study, we conducted monthly samplings during a year in five lowland streams with different flow regimes and investigated the impacts of hydrological conditions and physico-chemical variables on the trait composition of diatoms growing on artificial substrates, biomass (chlorophyll a and ash free dry weight), and biofilm community functions (biochemical processes, i.e., biofilm metabolism and nutrient uptake rates measured in the laboratory). Instead of the commonly used annual-based hydrological indices, we calculated indices for shorter periods (14 and similar to 28 days) of the hydrological regimes. Results of species-based variation partitioning showed that short-period hydrological indices (10.10 +/- 7.18%) contributed more to explain species distribution than physico-chemical variables (5.90 +/- 3.83%), indicating the dominant role of hydrology in structuring the diatom community. Specifically, we found different response patterns for different guilds and size lasses to the hydrological and physico-chemical variables, and our results demonstrated that species tolerating high disturbance may be more appropriate as indicators of environmental disturbance than low-tolerant species. We also found dominant effects of short-period hydrological events on biomass and biofilm community functions. Despite an overall negative effect of high flow events and flow variations on biomass and biofilm community functions, positive effects on function-biomass ratios were also observed, indicating that the effects of flow regimes on biofilm are complex. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of including short-period hydrological conditions in studies on environmental factors shaping benthic algae. Based on our results, we recommend use of short-period hydrological conditions when investigating the effects of flow regime on biofilm community composition and functions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The deterioration of environmental quality in the Sinos River basin is directly associated with the impacts of intense industrialization and urbanization. An integrated environmental assessment (IEA) was conducted in July and September of 2012, in areas along the sources of the EstanciaVelha/Portao, Pampa and Schmidt streams using physical, chemical and biological methods. The water in the three sampling sites was not proper for human consumption, presented a low toxic contamination index (TCI) and mesotrophic characteristics. One site was included in Class 4, and two, in Class 3, according to current legislation. The rapid assessment protocol (RAP) indicated a natural environmental condition for habitat diversity and environmental impact in the three sites. The Tradescantia pallida (Rose) D.R. Hunt var. purpurea Boom biomarker showed water genotoxicity in two of the sites. The integrated diagnosis of water quality in these streams is fundamentally important to ensure the sustainable management of water resources and their multiple uses, as well to estimate their contribution to pollution in this river basin.

AB  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the effects of several biotic and abiotic factors likely to intervene in situ on the accumulation of Co-60 by freshwater mosses. Three species were compared from the point of view of their value as bioindicators. Two opposite seasons were simulated, through lighting and water temperature. To better understand the mechanisms involved in cobalt fixation by mosses, the respective roles of light and temperature were studied separately. As the watercourses know seasonal fluctuations, the possibility of temporary emersion of plants was considered. Finally, the competition between mineral suspended matter and mosses was evaluated. These experiments demonstrate that two successive phases occurs in the contamination of aquatic mosses by Co-60, i.e., the first one to surface adsorption and the second one to biological absorption. As regards the studied factors, only season and temporary emersion have a marked influence on the mosses contamination by Co-60. Under the experimental conditions, the presence of mineral suspended matter modify little the Co-60 accumulation by mosses, but, in this scope, extrapolating experimental findings to the natural environment was difficult.

AB  - Hypoxia is an issue that affects ocean coastal waters worldwide. It has severe consequences for marine organisms, including death and rapid adaptive changes in metabolic organization. Although some aquatic animals are routinely exposed and resistant to severe environmental hypoxia, others such as sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus nudus) have a limited capacity to withstand this stress. In this study, hypoxia induced a significant increase in the number of red spherule cells among coelomocytes, which function as immune cells. This suggests that sea urchin immune cells could be used as a biological indicator of hypoxic stress. In the current study, we used cDNA microarrays to investigate the differential expression patterns of hypoxia-regulated genes to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of immune cells to hypoxia. Surprisingly, the predominant major effect of hypoxia was the widespread suppression of gene expression. In particular, the expression of RNA helicase and GATA-4/5/6 was decreased significantly in response to hypoxia, even in field conditions, suggesting that they could be utilized as sensitive bioindicators of hypoxic stress in the sea urchin.

AB  - The Salek valley used to be exposed to huge amounts of pollutants due to its close vicinity to the largest Slovene thermal power plant of Sostanj (STPP). Due to large emissions of SO2 and heavy metals as well as dumping of fly ash negative effects on the environment appeared (e.g. forest decline in area exposed to deposition of emission by the STPP, pollution of lake Velenje and the river Paka). Therefore, several ecological remediation measures on the STPP were implemented in the 1990s, and several research projects on reasons and effects of forest decline and degradation of environment began as well. A continuous and marked improving of the condition of both forest and freshwater ecosystems (of lake Velenje and the river Paka) after the installation of desulphurization devices on Units 4 and 5 of the STPP and construction of a closed loop system for the ash transportation is emphasized in the present paper.

AB  - The natural upper boundary of a forest (forest line) in mountain environments is an indicator of climate conditions. An increase in global average temperatures has resulted in an upward advance of the forest line. This advance may result in fragmentation of the alpine ecosystem and a loss of biodiversity. Therefore, it is important to identify potential areas where current forests can advance under scenarios of future climate change. I used expert knowledge and cartographic modeling to create a hybrid cartographic model considering five topographic variables to predict areas where forest line can expand in the future. The prediction accuracy of the model is around 82%. The model is able to predict areas above the current forest line that are suitable or unsuitable for future forest advance. Further inclusion of high-resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation models, as well as field-based information into the model can help to improve the model accuracy.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity (EH) in space and time promotes niche-partition, which leads to high variation in biological communities, such as in algae. In streams, EH is highly related to the intensity of the water flow and may lead to community variation mainly during the low flow conditions. Despite the wide knowledge on the responses of phytoplankton communities to EH in lentic and semi-lentic systems, studies of riverine phytoplankton community variation are still scarce. Here, we first investigated the relationship between phytoplankton community variation and EH in different courses of the river and between seasons. We expected that under low or intermediate flow conditions, there is a positive correlation between community variation and EH. Alternatively, we did not expect any relationship between EH and community variation under high flow condition because stronger downstream transport would mask environmental filtering. We sampled nine sites monthly (May 2012 to April 2013) in a tropical river of Brazilian Southeast. We calculated EH from abiotic data whereas for community variation, here community distinctiveness (CD), we used Sorensen (CDSor) and Bray-Curtis (CDBray) dissimilarities. Differences in EH, CDSor and CDBray were tested at between-season and among-course levels. We found lower distinctiveness during the dry season when EH was the highest. Contrastingly, phytoplankton CD was the highest even when EH was low during the wet season. We found that this pattern raised from the increasing in individuals dispersal during the wet season, promoting mass effects. Finally, our results thus reject the first hypothesis and show a negative relationship between EH and distinctiveness. However, results support our alternative hypothesis and show that during the wet season, distinctiveness is not driven by EH. These results provide new insights into how EH drives community variation, being useful for both basic research about riverine algal communities and biomonitoring programs using phytoplankton communities as bioindicators.

AB  - A novel strategy that allows to predict the responses of zooplanktonic species to environmental conditions in an estuarine temperate ecosystem (Mondego estuary) is presented. It uses 12 indicator species from the zooplanktonic Mondego database (102 species) that are common members of the different habitats, characterized by their specific hydrological conditions. Indicator-species analysis (ISA) was used to define and describe which species were typical of each of the five sampling stations in a 4-year study (2003-2006). First, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was carried out to objectively identify the species-habitat affinity based on the relationship between species, stations and environmental data. Response curves for each of the zooplanktonic species, generated by univariate logistic regression on each of the independent variables temperature and salinity, were generally in agreement with the descriptive statistics concerning the occurrence of those species in this particular estuarine ecosystem. Species-specific models that predict probability of occurrence relative to environmental parameters like salinity, water temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total suspended solids and dissolved oxygen were then developed for the zooplanktonic species. The multiple logistic models used contained between 1 and 3 significant parameters and the percentage correctly predicted was moderate to high, ranging from 62 to 95%. The predictive accuracy of the model was assured by direct comparison of model predictions with the observed occurrence of species obtained in 2006 (validation) and from data collected in the early 2000s in another Portuguese estuary-Ria de Aveiro (Canal de Mira), a complex mesotidal shallow coastal lagoon. The regression logistic model here defined, correctly suggested that the distribution of zooplankton species was mainly dependent on salinity and water temperature. The logistic regression proved to be a useful approach for predicting the occurrence of species under varying environmental conditions at a local scale. Therefore, this model can be considered of reasonable application (and should be tested in other estuarine systems) due to its ability to predict the occurrence of individual zooplanktonic species associated with habitat changes.

AB  - Diatoms are good indicators of ecological conditions in lotic systems. The objective of this study was to assess responses of benthic diatoms to changes in water quality in tropical streams draining Chinhoyi Town, Zimbabwe. Eight sites were selected to evaluate the impact of sewage effluent on water quality and the associated diatom communities. Diatom and water quality sampling were conducted once in January, March, May, June, and August in 2012. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine environmental gradients along which species vary with physical and chemical variables. As pollution increased (i.e., increase in nutrients, conductivity, and metal levels, and decrease in pH and dissolved oxygen levels), low or moderate pollution tolerant species such as Cymbela tumida, Cocconeis placentula, and Eunotia formica were replaced by high pollution tolerant species such as Gophonema. parvulum, Navicula gregalis, and Nitzschia palea. The autecological data presented in this study corroborates other studies from tropical regions and further contributes to our understanding of how diatoms are distributed in tropical lotic systems with respect to environmental variables.

AB  - The bacteriological analysis of samples of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, used as a biological indicator, has shown a microbiological pollution of Saint Gervais harbour in the gulf of Fos. Experiments were carried out with the use of classical tests (faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, salmonellae) taking into account the study of the environmental factors able to modify the physiological activity of mussels (wind, rain, temperature, salinity, turbidity). The highest values, which sometimes widely exceeded the French and European guidelines regarding edible shellfish, were revealed in summer but also during the weekends of Whitsun and All Saints' day, times when boat activity was greatest. The absence of storm and wastewater outlets and the stability of the meteorological conditions at the times of sampling show that this pollution is directly connected to the pleasure boats, the toilets of which flow into the harbour in most cases. The present study of this small harbour demonstrates the importance of boats being fitted with toilets to prevent the flow of faecal material into the ambient waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Animals often communicate in complex, heterogeneous environments, leading to hypothesized selection for increased detectability or discriminability in signaling traits. The extent to which secondary sexual ornaments have evolved to overcome the challenges of signaling in complex environments, however, remains understudied, especially in comparison to their role as indicator traits. This study tested the hypothesis that the condition-dependent secondary sexual ornamentation in the wolf spider Rabidosa rabida functions to increase detectability/discriminability in visually complex environments. We predicted that male ornamentation would interact with the complexity of the signaling environment to affect male mating success. In particular, we expected ornaments to confer a greater mating advantage when males courted in visually complex environments. To test this, we artificially manipulated male foreleg ornamentation (present/absent) and ran repeated-measures mating trials across laboratory microcosms that represented simple versus complex visual signaling environments. Microcosm visual complexity differed in their background pattern, grass stem color, and grass stem placement. We found that ornamented males mated more often and more quickly than unornamented males across both environments, but we found no support for an ornament-by-environment interaction. Male courtship rate, however, did interact with the signaling environment. Despite achieving the same level of mating success across signaling environments, ornamented males courted less rapidly in complex versus simple environments, although environmental complexity had no influence on unornamented male courtship rates. Our results suggest that the visual complexity of the signaling environment influences the interactive influence of ornamentation and dynamic visual courtship on female mate choice.
   Animal communication often happens in environments with noisy backgrounds. We investigated how condition-dependent sexual ornaments may help receivers detect signals in complex environments. Ornamented male wolf spiders experienced greater mating success than unornamented males, regardless of their signaling environment. Interestingly, ornamented males maintained their mating success despite lower courtship effort in complex signaling environments. These results highlight the interactive nature of selection from receivers and the environment on complex signal form and function.

AB  - Uptake of contaminants is linked to their toxicity and is usually estimated through their lipophilicity (logKow). Here, we review current literature regarding bioconcentration, i.e. uptake of contaminants from the external environment only, and the effects of exposure to neuroactive pharmaceuticals in fish. We aim to determine if lipophilicity is a suitable predictor of bioconcentration of these compounds in fish, to identify major drivers of bioconcentration and explore the link between bioconcentration potential and toxicity, focusing on survival, growth, condition, behaviour and reproduction endpoints. Additionally, we compare concentrations known to elicit significant effects in fish with current environmental concentrations, identifying exposure risk in ecosystems. The majority of studies have focused on antidepressants, mainly fluoxetine, and encompasses mostly freshwater species. Few studies determined pharmaceuticals bioconcentration, and even a smaller portion combined bioconcentration with other toxicity endpoints. Results show that lipophilicity isn't a good predictor of neuroactive pharmaceuticals' bioconcentration in fish, which in turn is highly influenced by experimental parameters, including abiotic conditions, species and life-stage. The need for increased standardization of experimental settings is key towards improving accuracy of environmental risk assessments and application in future regulatory schemes. Still, increased fish lethality was linked to increased bioconcentration, yet no other correlations were observed when considering effects on growth, condition, behaviour or reproduction, likely as a result of insufficient and variable data. In the context of current environmental concentrations, several neuroactive pharmaceuticals were found to be potentially threatening, while data on occurrence is lacking for some compounds, particularly in brackish/marine systems. Specifically, nine compounds (fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline, amitriptyline, venlafaxine, clozapine, carbamazepine, metamfetamine and oxazepam) were found at concentrations either above or critically close to minimum response concentrations, thus likely to affect fish in freshwater and brackish or marine environments, which supports further exploration in risk management strategies and monitoring programs in aquatic environments.

AB  - The contemporary state of functional traits and species richness in plant communities depends on legacy effects of past disturbances. Whether temporal responses of community properties to current environmental changes are altered by such legacies is, however, unknown. We expect global environmental changes to interact with land-use legacies given different community trajectories initiated by prior management, and subsequent responses to altered resources and conditions. We tested this expectation for species richness and functional traits using 1814 survey-resurvey plot pairs of understorey communities from 40 European temperate forest datasets, syntheses of management transitions since the year 1800, and a trait database. We also examined how plant community indicators of resources and conditions changed in response to management legacies and environmental change. Community trajectories were clearly influenced by interactions between management legacies from over 200years ago and environmental change. Importantly, higher rates of nitrogen deposition led to increased species richness and plant height in forests managed less intensively in 1800 (i.e., high forests), and to decreases in forests with a more intensive historical management in 1800 (i.e., coppiced forests). There was evidence that these declines in community variables in formerly coppiced forests were ameliorated by increased rates of temperature change between surveys. Responses were generally apparent regardless of sites' contemporary management classifications, although sometimes the management transition itself, rather than historic or contemporary management types, better explained understorey responses. Main effects of environmental change were rare, although higher rates of precipitation change increased plant height, accompanied by increases in fertility indicator values. Analysis of indicator values suggested the importance of directly characterising resources and conditions to better understand legacy and environmental change effects. Accounting for legacies of past disturbance can reconcile contradictory literature results and appears crucial to anticipating future responses to global environmental change.

AB  - Holocene sediments in Lake Winnipeg are expressed in the lower Lake Agassiz sequence which is unconformably overlain by the Lake Winnipeg sequence. Nine sites, covering the North and South basins and the connecting Narrows, were selected for analysis of Holocene changes in thecamoebian faunae. Only the Lake Winnipeg sequence contains thecamoebians.
   This study indicates that biologic productivity and consequently the type of organic material in the sediments is the main control on thecamoebian taxa in Lake Winnipeg. Other factors controlling the distribution of thecamoebians are water chemistry and turbidity. Inorganic sediment geochemistry and water temperature do not appear to significantly influence the thecamoebian fauna of Lake Winnipeg.
   Variations in the abundance of key thecamoebian species along a north-south transect divide Lake Winnipeg into three distinct areas. The North Basin has remained relatively unchanged since the retreat of Lake Agassiz as indicated by the domination of Difflugia manicata throughout its history. This species appears to prefer Cyanophyta and diatoms as its food source. In the Narrows harsh conditions created by turbid waters and lack of algal food taxa result in Centropyxis aculeata replacing Difflugia manicata as the dominant species. In the South Basin three thecamoebian assemblages are recognized. Cucurbitella tricuspis, indicative of eutrophic conditions, dominates the most recent sediments of the South Basin. The underlying sediments are characterized by Difflugia globulus. In Lake Winnipeg this species is not a cold climate (arctic) indicator as suggested elsewhere but instead seems to prefer sediments containing green and yellow-green algal material. A Centropyxis-Arcella Assemblage occurs only at the base of the southernmost core where it is indicative of an early phase of hyposaline conditions as developed in shallow pools during the southward transgression of Lake Winnipeg.
   This study illustrates the usefulness of thecamoebians as paleolimnological indicators. Environmental changes are more significant in the restricted South Basin resulting in distinct thecamoebian assemblages. In contrast, the North Basin provided a stable environment throughout the late Holocene reflected in only subtle faunal changes.

Here we investigated an 89-cm-long sediment core (TH1) from Tian Lake, southeastern China, for sedimentological, physical and geochemical parameters in order to understand climate and environmental changes for the latest two centuries. Cs-137-and Pb-210-based age models show that the fine sand-coarse silt-dominated core contains similar to 170 years (c. AD 1842-2011) of continuous sedimentation. Sediments with fine sands, low MS values, high water content, high TOC content and a high C:N ratio from c. AD 1842 to 1897 suggest intense hydrological conditions and strong runoff in the catchment, probably because of a humid climate. From AD 1897 to 1990, sediments with very fine sand and coarse silt, high MS values, low water content and unchanged TOC and C: N ratios indicate normal hydrological conditions and in-lake algae-derived organic matter. During this interval, the chemical weathering indicators show stronger weathering conditions compared with sediments deposited during AD 1842-1897, supporting the dominance of weathered surface soil input in the earlier interval and physical erosion dominance in the later period, respectively. Since AD 1990, the continuous decrease of geochemical proxies suggests human-interacted Earth surface processes in the catchment of Tian Lake. A PCA revealed four dominant geochemical controlling factors -detrital input, trophic status, grain size and early diagenesis -, accounting for 26, 20, 18 and 16% of total variance, respectively. This study for the first time provides lacustrine geochemical evidence for the most recent two centuries of climate and environmental changes in coastal southeastern China, a region that is currently undergoing an inversion of critical zone, i.e. an overturning of its soil profile, owing to swift modernization.

AB  - Changes in land use and vegetation cover affect various soil properties, including the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and the transfer of atmospheric CO2 to terrestrial landscapes. In natural or quasi-natural conditions a reduction in biomass increases the risk of erosion, and can reduce the stored soil organic matter content. This can cause (i) consolidation of low levels of organic carbon stored in the soil; (ii) reduction in the levels of organic carbon because of the onset of erosion processes; and (iii) differing rates of recovery of the soil in response to environmental factors including precipitation, which is a principal agent of indirect recharge of soil organic matter.
   Few comparable studies have analyzed the reduction of SOC because of erosion, and assessed how this contributes to the loss of soil as vegetation cover decreases. This is particularly the case in semiarid Mediterranean environments, where erosion is one of the main causes of soil degradation.
   This study presents the results of an experiment carried out along a pluviometric gradient from humid to semiarid Mediterranean conditions, in southern Spain. The study involved two soil depths at five field sites having similar lithology, slope and aspect, but differ in vegetation cover and composition related to their location along the gradient. We used soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) as an indicator of soil degradation. The results showed that: a) SOC decreased with decreasing rainfall; b) SOC is greater at the soil surface than at depth; c) CEC is a good indicator of the degradation of soil surface formations, as it is directly related to the SOC storage capacity; and d) the so-called "Mediterranean mountain" landscape, with sparse and mixed vegetation composed of scrubland and woodland species, is a good organic carbon sink with direct implications in relation to climate change.

AB  - Globally, wetlands are in decline due to anthropogenic modification and climate change. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity and biological processes within wetlands provides essential baseline data for predicting and mitigating the effects of present and future environmental change on these critical ecosystems. To explore the potential for environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide such insights, we used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to characterise prokaryote communities and predict the distribution of prokaryote metabolic pathways in peats and sediments up to 4m below the surface across seven New Zealand wetlands. Our results reveal distinct vertical structuring of prokaryote communities and metabolic pathways in these wetlands. We also find evidence for differences in the relative abundance of certain metabolic pathways that may correspond to the degree of anthropogenic modification the wetlands have experienced. These patterns, specifically those for pathways related to aerobic respiration and the carbon cycle, can be explained predominantly by the expected effects of wetland drainage. Our study demonstrates that eDNA has the potential to be an important new tool for the assessment and monitoring of wetland health.

AB  - The Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem. Recent changes in the region have been reported due to a rise in relative sea level along with increased salinity intrusion. Intertidal benthic foraminifera are widely used as indicators of relative sea level change. The taxonomic diversity of foraminifera in the Sundarbans remains relatively understudied due to the remoteness of this ecoregion. The present study documented modern intertidal benthic foraminiferal assemblages across eight sites from previously unexplored eastern parts of the Indian Sundarbans. We also analyzed sediment texture from the study sites, which is essential for sea level reconstructions. Our study recorded an assemblage dominated by agglutinated genera that are characteristic of mangroves globally. However, we also recorded calcareous genera characteristic of higher-salinity zones, indicating saline intrusion further upstream in the region. In total, we recorded 15 species, representing ten different foraminiferal families. Total organic carbon (TOC) content and sediment composition showed variation across the studied sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of the biological and environmental data confirmed its usefulness for understanding shifts in hydrological conditions across this region.

AB  - There has been considerable recent concern over the amount of vegetation clearance and associated environmental degradation risk in the Western Division of New South Wales. An integrated remote sensing/GIS approach was used to provide information required to address this issue. The extent and nature of recent vegetation clearance was quantified to give a basic indication of the prevailing land condition in a study area in the central-eastern portion of the Western Division. Between 1973 and 1991 there was an increase of 86 per cent in the extent of cleared landscapes. Further interpretation of this indicator with respect to the study period identified spatial and temporal trends critical to understanding the significance of observed environmental change. Change has not been uniform, with environments covering the red-earth lands fringing the Lachlan River floodplain particularly impacted. The nature of changes was quantified with respect to various land units. The suitability of the approach for providing decision support for environmental management at ecosystem level, and the review of land-use planning and environment protection strategies, is discussed.

AB  - The alkane fraction of more than 200 rocks, biodegraded oils and non-biodegraded oils, have been analysed by means of computerized GC-MS, in order to investigate the effect of natural biodegradation on the occurrence of "demethylated hopanes", i.e. 17alpha-25-norhopanes. The results obtained indicate that 25-norhopanes are preexisting biomarkers the concentration of which is enhanced by selective biodegradation of more readily degradable homologs, i.e. regular hopanes, rather than by demethylation of hopanes in reservoirs. However, the use of 25-norhopane enrichment as a palaeobiodegradation indicator in apparently non-biodegraded oils is still valuable providing the initial background content in the corresponding source rocks is known. Furthermore, 25-norhopanes appear to be diagnostic of specific environmental conditions (marine and lacustrine source rocks. dysoxic and not very hypersaline). Lastly, one other (novel) bacterially resistant rearranged hopanoic compound, namely a C29 neohopane, is applicable for both biodegradation and maturation evaluation.

AB  - The typically elevated natural attenuation capacity of riverbed-hyporheic zones is expected to decrease chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) groundwater plume discharges to river receptors through dechlorination reactions. The aim of this study was to assess physico-chemical processes controlling field-scale variation in riverbed-hyporheic zone dechlorination of a TCE groundwater plume discharge to an urban river reach. The 50-m long pool-riffle-glide reach of the River Tame in Birmingham (UK) studied is a heterogeneous high energy river environment. The shallow riverbed was instrumented with a detailed network of multilevel samplers. Freeze coring revealed a geologically heterogeneous and poorly sorted riverbed. A chlorine number reduction approach provided a quantitative indicator of CHC dechlorination. Three sub-reaches of contrasting behaviour were identified. Greatest dechlorination occurred in the riffle sub-reach that was characterised by hyporheic zone flows, moderate sulphate concentrations and pH, anaerobic conditions, low iron, but elevated manganese concentrations with evidence of sulphate reduction. Transient hyporheic zone flows allowing input to varying riverbed depths of organic matter are anticipated to be a key control. The glide sub-reach displayed negligible dechlorination attributed to the predominant groundwater baseflow discharge condition, absence of hyporheic zone, transition to more oxic conditions and elevated sulphate concentrations expected to locally inhibit dechlorination. The tail-of-pool-riffle sub-reach exhibited patchy dechlorination that was attributed to sub-reach complexities including significant flow bypass of a low permeability, high organic matter, silty unit of high dechlorination potential. A process-based conceptual model of reach-scale dechlorination variability was developed. Key findings of practitioner relevance were: riverbed-hyporheic zone CHC dechlorination may provide only a partial, somewhat patchy barrier to CHC groundwater plume discharges to a surface water receptor; and, monitoring requirements to assess the variability in CHC attenuation within a reach are expected to be onerous. Further research on transient hyporheic zone dechlorination is recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: Evolutionary branching is a process of evolutionary diversification induced by frequency-dependent ecological interaction. Here we show how to predict the occurrence of evolutionary branching in bivariate traits when populations are evolving directionally.
   Methods: Following adaptive dynamics theory, we assume low mutation rates and small mutational step sizes. On this basis, we generalize conditions for evolutionary-branching points to conditions for evolutionary-branching lines and areas, which delineate regions of trait space in which evolutionary branching can be expected despite populations still evolving directionally along these lines and within these areas. To assess the quality of predictions provided by our new conditions for evolutionary-branching lines and areas, we analyse three eco-evolutionary models with bivariate trait spaces, comparing the predicted evolutionary-branching lines and areas with actual occurrences of evolutionary branching in numerically calculated evolutionary dynamics. In the three examples, a phenotype's fitness is affected by frequency-dependent resource competition and/or predator prey interaction.
   Conclusions: In the limit of infinitesimal mutational step sizes, evolutionary branching in bivariate trait spaces can occur only at evolutionary-branching points, i.e. where the evolving population experiences disruptive selection in the absence of any directional selection. In contrast, when mutational step sizes are finite, evolutionary branching can occur also along evolutionary-branching lines, i.e. where disruptive selection orthogonal to these lines is sufficiently strong relative to directional selection along them. Moreover, such evolutionary-branching lines are embedded in evolutionary-branching areas, which delineate all bivariate trait combinations for which evolutionary branching can occur when mutation rates are low, while mutational step sizes are finite. Our analyses show that evolutionary-branching lines and areas are good indicators of evolutionary branching in directionally evolving populations. We also demonstrate that not all evolutionary-branching lines and areas contain evolutionary-branching points, so evolutionary branching is possible even in trait spaces that contain no evolutionary-branching point at all.

AB  - Historically, fires occurred throughout the year in the Fescue Prairie of Canada, but little is known about plant community responses to burning at different times of the year. Composition of plant communities was determined annually for 6 years after burning one or three times in a remnant Fescue Prairie in central Saskatchewan. A multiple-response permutation procedure indicated that plant community composition was different in the two burning histories (P < 0.001) and among times of burning (P < 0.001). Variables related to plant community composition after burning were evaluated using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling. Three gradients explained 86% of the variation in composition of plant communities. Environmental conditions leading up to burning and at the time of burning correlated poorly with species composition. Differences in composition of plant communities were attributed primarily to burning history, cumulative precipitation in the 12 months before sampling, cumulative cold-stress days in the 12 months before sampling, cold-stress days in March and April, and months since burning. Plant communities burned once responded negatively to increasing cold-stress days while those burned three times responded positively to cold-stress days. Cover of Festuca hallii and Symphoricarpos occidentalis was 88 and 350% greater after one burn as compared to three burns, whereas cover of Carex obtusata, Carex pensylvanica, and Elymus lanceolatus was 126, 53, and 220% greater after three burns than after one burn. Festuca hallii, Galium boreale, Pulsatilla patens ssp. multifida, Symphoricarpos occidentalis, and Symphyotrichum ericoides had the highest indicator value of a single burn; Carex obtusata, Elymus lanceolatus, and Koeleria macrantha had the greatest indicator values for sites burned three times. Longer-term effects of burning history exert a strong influence on plant community composition while short-term conditions after burning, namely, precipitation and cold-stress days, appear important in controlling species responses and composition of plant communities in Fescue Prairie.

AB  - Knowledge about the effects of captivity and environmental stress on fish populations is basic to culture them for ornamental, conservation or exploitation purposes. The aim of this study was to test how captivity affect morphological development of bilateral characters and whether levels of fluctuating asymmetry, morphological abnormalities and ectoparasites reflect developmental stress caused by adverse environmental conditions in two species of cyprinids, goldfish Carassius auratus and two varieties of carp Cyprinus carpio, scale and mirror carp. Samples from captivity were caught in an artificial pond (Madrid City, Spain), which presents poor environmental conditions; while samples from nature were captured in the Ebro River basin (NE Spain). Six meristic and four morphometric bilateral characters were measured and compared between the two samples, Additionally, the incidence of morphological abnormalities and ectoparasites was also recorded. Captive goldfish presented significant lower number of scales of the lateral line, scale rows above lateral line and length of pectoral and ventral fins. Captive carps showed significant shorter first barbels and longer ventral fins. Ornamental goldfish showed significant higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry than wild samples for number of branched rays of pectoral fin, lateral line, scale rows below lateral line and length of pectoral and ventral fins. Ornamental carps presented a similar trend for the same characters, except for branched rays and length of pectoral fins, together with the length of second barbels. in the artificial pond, the incidence of abnormalities was higher in carp, whereas goldfish showed a higher occurrence of ectoparasites. These facts support the hypothesis of a different species response to environmental stress. The overall results indicate that fish from the artificial pond are subjected to environmental stress caused by adverse conditions such as overcrowding and lower water quality. Moreover, estimated parameters in this study mean a useful tool to detect developmental instability in confined fish. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our analyses of the incidence of cooperative breeding among South African birds differ from previous studies performed elsewhere in two respects. First, we distinguish between ''obligate'' (i.e. regular) and ''facultative'' (i.e. opportunistic) cooperative breeding species (OCS and FCS). Second, we have restricted our analyses to 217 South African bird species considered to be sufficiently well-studied in terms of their basic biology and life-history characteristics. This was done in order to control for the well-known bias against the often poorly studied avifaunas of extreme environments such as rainforests and deserts. The results of our analysis do not accord fully with those of Australian birds by Ford et al. (1988). Cooperative breeding in South Africa is associated with seasonal environments, whereas in Australia the opposite is the case. Analyses of ecological factors that promote cooperative breeding among South African birds suggest that the evolutionary pathway to obligate and facultative breeding may be fundamentally different. First, OCS live mainly in savanna habitats that have predictable seasonal peaks in food availability, yet where the baseline level of food availability during the nonbreeding season is sufficient to support permanent residence by groups. Small to medium-sized birds of the African savannas are particularly vulnerable to avian predators, and foraging and roosting in permanent groups may enhance their survival. We propose that the benefits of obligate cooperative breeding are derived chiefly from survival of individuals away from the nest (i.e. during the nonbreeding season). Secondly, FCS live largely in unpredictable, seasonal steppe habitats. Under these conditions it may be impossible for birds to maintain permanent group territories, and variation in the tendency to breed cooperatively may depend largely on the opportunistic assessment of environmental conditions. We therefore suggest that birds (i.e. FCS) will opt to breed cooperatively only when conditions are unfavourable for independent breeding, and that the benefits thus accrued are chiefly related to reproduction.

AB  - A battery of biomarkers is often used to evaluate the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants and detect responses to environmental stress. Unfortunately, field application of biomarkers is subject to various constraints (e.g., the availability of living material) that can limit data acquisition and prevent the use of multivariate methods during statistical analysis. In these circumstances, a simple method is needed to summarize biomarker responses and simplify their interpretation in biomonitoring programs. The present study used star plots to display results for the panel of biomarkers used for cacti station and survey. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) was then computed as the star plot area. Star plots using IBR values instead of biomarker data make it possible to visualize between-site and/or between-survey differences For comparison with exposure conditions, This approach was applied to sites in the Baltic Sea and the Seine Estuary, English Channel. In both cases, IBR values ere visually compared to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) levels measured in mussel or fish tissues. The IBR. as an indicator of environmental stress, appears to be a useful tool or scientists and managers in assessing ecological risk.

AB  - Monospecific and mixed-leaf litters from plant species of Mediterranean maquis (Quercus ilex, Phillyrea angustifolia, Pistacia lentiscus, Cistus spp.) in an undisturbed area in southern Italy were studied with respect to the structure and composition of their decomposer fungal community over an incubation period of 403 d. The data matrix structure was analyzed by means of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), while indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to determine the preferential association of species with a substrate, a succession phase and monospecific/mixed experimental conditions. The ecological nature of the gradient expressed by the DCA axes was investigated by means of experimental and main chemical leaf-litter variables. The litter mixture had non-additive effects on the decomposition process even though the fungal species richness of the mixed litter was considerably higher than that of the monospecific litter. Our findings highlight the occurrence of shifts in the fungal community during decomposition in response to changes in the substrate, such as those related to the cellulose content and lignin/N ratio.

LA  - English
AB  - In the wealth of studies on measuring the quality of life, an autonomous 'urban' trend has been progressively distinguishing itself, namely the extension of urban conditions of life to an ever higher percentage of the world's population. From the concept of city understood as a negation of environmental values, we have passed, thanks to a long multidisciplinary evolution, to the concept of the urban ecosystem and to that of the ecological city. What type of indicators may be used for the measurement of the quality of life in the urban environment? And what is their most appropriate ambit of application? An Italian experience in environmental planning (the Ten-Year Plan for the Environment - DECAMB, and the Territorial Frame of Reference - QUADROTER, for the Ministry of the Environment) may offer starting points for a research programme. Concepts such as land supply and demand; territorial loading; equilibrium and spill-over of urban systems; critical population mass, are used to introduce an initial experimental set of (objective and subjective) indicators of the quality of life orientated towards planning, both as regards the provision of services, and for participatory and symbolic aspects.

AB  - Ecological and socio-economic indicators are used as proxies for attributes of ecosystems and human communities, respectively. End-to-end models are used to predict how ecosystems will respond to alternative management actions and changing environmental conditions. Despite the importance of these two tools for Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM), there has been limited integration of ecological indicators directly into end-to-end models; the former are typically calculated post hoc with output from the latter. Here we explore how ecological indicators can be better incorporated into end-to-end models and examine the importance of this union with regards to cumulative impacts and indirect effects, setting management objectives, practical indicator selection, and applications to management. We conclude that the inclusion of ecological indicators in end-to-end models is not only feasible, but provides needed guidance on describing ecosystem status relative to strategic as well as tactical ecosystem-level management goals, and will escalate the implementation of EBM.

AB  - The measurement of hair cortisol is increasingly used to understand the effect of natural and anthropogenic stressors on wild animals, but it is potentially confounded by individual, seasonal and sex-dependant variations in baseline cortisol secretion. This study validated an enzyme-linked immunoassay for hair cortisol measurement and characterized its baseline variation in a wild population of Egyptian mongoose. The analysis encompassed individuals of both sexes and all ages, across a range of geographic, environmental and seasonal conditions that the species experiences in Portugal allowing us to account for spatial, temporal and biological factors that contribute to hair cortisol variation. Our results showed that age, sex and storage time had an effect on hair cortisol, but season did not. Hair cortisol was higher in early stage juveniles compared to other age cohorts, in males when compared to females, and decreased with longer storage time. By identifying the factors that influence baseline hair cortisol in this wild population, we establish the basis for its application as an indicator of the effect of natural and anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Functioning of natural geosystems is aimed at preserving their structure, but economic activity leads to imbalances, decreases in order, loss of internal organization and the inability to maintain the necessary stabilization.
   Analysis of previous research. Studies of the last decades have shown that the climatic conditions of Ukraine can be unfavorable for the life and economic activity of the society.
   Problems of further research. To find the solution to the problem of preserving the ability of the biosphere to self-regulation, self-restoration by optimizing anthropogenic load on natural systems is very important. Identification of climate change factors is aimed at finding the most active sources of environmental impact in order to determine the real threat of global climate change.
   The purpose of the research is to determine the causes, areas of initial formation, further development of negative meteorological processes and phenomena on the territory of Kharkiv region during the last decades and to study parameters and causes of air masses transformation, changes in their properties and various resistance to anthropogenic impact.
   Research methods are observation with the help of various devices and technical means. An integrated approach using field-based observations and technology of climatic series analysis with the help of statistical methods for climate information processing, characterized by high accuracy, allow us to determine their spatial-temporal features and future projections to the natural environment.
   Presentation of the main research material. Optimal strategic socio-economic development of the regions requires identification of specific links between natural and socio-economic entities, as well as studying large-scale and profound by the consequences violations of the ecosystem at the planetary level - the biosphere and its components. There is a general tendency towards directed climate change, the so-called "global warming", which threatens natural landscapes, upsetting and destroying them.
   Practical value. There are causal relationships between climatogenic changes, influence of human activity and the reaction of landscapes to them. This is manifested in creation of a variety of transformed landscapes (agrarian, residential, industrial). The consequence of anthropogenic transformations is the change in the parameters and characteristics of the components of nature.
   Research results. Indicators are the basis for information blocks concerning decision-making in the areas of socio-economic development. Climate parameters of a certain territory may differ from zonal ones and in combination with anthropogenic transformation affect the general condition of the landscapes, lead to the intensification of adverse hydrometeorological and exogenous geodynamic processes and phenomena (erosion, deluvial processes, landslides, suffusion, deflation, flooding.

AB  - Owing to increasing concern of global climate-change, temperature rise is of great interest which can be primarily evaluated from the seasonal variations in some organisms. Aquatic environment can be extremely stressful to its inhabitants because most of them are poikilothermous. In the present study, attempt was made to evaluate the biological effects of oxidative-stress and adaptive/antioxidant capacities during temperature variations (36-40 degrees C for 24hrs to 72hrs) in Bellamya bengalensis both in environmental and laboratory conditions by testing some biomarkers like HSP70, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR). The biomarker potency of the molecules and the anti-oxidative metabolic network was postulated and extrapolated to find its resemblance to the climate-change associated organismal variations. In a natural and eco-restored environment in the Eastern part of India, 10-20 fold increases in CAT, SOD and HSP70 protein expressions (Western blot results) were noticed in Bellamya paralleling to their increased enzymatic activities (gel zymogram studies) due to the seasonal (summer versus winter) temperature variation. It is evident from the consecutive three years' study that this variation resulted in the unfavorable physicochemical changes of water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, alkalinity and consequently decreased the animal density in summer. And that was revived due to their higher reproduction rate in post rainy/winter season when temperature normalizes resulting in a restoration of favorable environment. In laboratory condition, the reduced GR and increased GPx indicated the oxidative damage as evident by higher tissue MDA level following to higher mortality. Changes in SOD and CAT activities suggest activation of physiological mechanism to scavenge the ROS produced during heat stress. However, when mortality increased at different time points (36 degrees C - 72h and 38 degrees C - 72 h), these enzyme activities also decreased as they failed to save the tissues from ROS. The results suggest that temperature variation does alter the active oxygen metabolism by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities, which can be used as biomarker to detect sub-lethal effects of climate change-associated pollution. The parity in environmental and laboratory experimental results may justify this laboratory experiment as model heat-stress experiment and indicate temperature as a universal stressor which alone or in combination with other water parameters initiates a consistent adapting behavior. The Bellamya bengalensis being the highest faunal representative in its habitat may serve as a good bioindicator species.

AB  - The increasing incidence of soil degradation requires monitoring strategies adapted to the scale of interest. We propose an innovative approach to the large-scale investigation of predominantly green areas where healthy vegetation is the clue to identifying vital and protected soil. We started with the well-established environmentally sensitive areas (ESA) model, which provides an evaluation of overall land vulnerability that is based on structural, biophysical and socio-economic indicators. To improve the estimation of soil vulnerability, we integrated information on the potential extent of compaction caused by agricultural machinery. To differentiate the degree of degradation in areas that show similar potential vulnerability we included information on the temporal variation of photosynthetic activity in the model for early detection of the soil's reduced ability to carry out ecosystem services and functions. Satellite data were used to obtain vegetation cover properties to integrate into the ESA model to improve estimation of land degradation in southern Italy, where both natural and agricultural areas are widespread. Inclusion of the temporal dimension is essential for discriminating between different degrees of soil productivity in areas characterized by similar structural conditions. Our procedure is adaptable, user-friendly and easily transferable.

AB  - The investigations concerned sites of Acer platanoides L. infected or not by Rhytisma aceriniu (Pers.) Fr. The aim of the study was to check the occurrence of R. acerinium. and whether it reflects the environmental status. Furthermore, an analysis was carried out to find out whether the applied SOFM offers additional advantages to solve problems in relation to conventional methods. Concentrations of selected elements in soils and leaves, and leaf and "tar-spot" morphometric traits were also measured. A significant differentiation was found between sites in relation to the analyzed traits. It appeared, that sites showing lower concentrations of chemical elements and proper developmental habitat conditions massive infections take place. The study showed that R. acerinium is a good biological indicator for assessment of environmental status. The applied, conventional statistical methods, SOFM and image techniques showed similar, but not identical results for assessment of environmental quality using R. acerinium. SOFM appeared to be more useful for ordination of results and ought to be taken into account as a proper tool of estimation of various plants and their biotopes.

AB  - The uncontrolled urbanization caused significant changes in urban environmental conditions due to increased buildup areas of cities, reduction the urban landscape, disruption of human-environment relations. The urban environments consist of two superimposed systems as being natural and human-made. Urban plans consist of both design and these urban environmental components. Especially planner's environmental perception is too important for setting of environmental quality. Therefore, urban environmental quality and human value became the two key concepts of visual environment assessment. Each of these components have differences to its own geological, morphological, climatic structure etc. physical characteristics and that coming from social, cultural and systematic properties. So urban and environmental planners are responsible for shaping the urban environment as well as human, urban and environmental health professionals. This paper will be analyzed the environmental perceptions of university students of urban planning about urban environment and nature related to human and nature relationships. It chose Konya as a sample area for being a central living space of many all of university students. NEP scale with sample 12 % applied to the student of University of Necmettin Erbakan's City and Regional Planning.

AB  - Colonization of periphytic ciliates and their usefulness for monitoring water quality were evaluated using the glass slide method in two enclosed mariculture ponds used to culture crab larva and in a natural seawater reservoir. The results revealed that (1) the ciliate species composition and colonizing process differed between the culturing ponds and the natural reservoir and (2) the dominant ciliate species showed a greater distribution in terms of both the abundance and the occurrence frequency. This study also demonstrated that structural parameters were strongly related to water conditions. For example, the abundance was positively associated with NO3--N and soluble reactive phosphate (P < 0.05), whereas the species number, species diversity and evenness were negatively correlated with nutrients (e. g. NO3--N and NH3-N) and temperature (P < 0.05). These findings support the evidence that periphytic ciliates are useful bioindicators of water quality in enclosed mariculture ecosystems.

AB  - Many morphological, chemical and physiological indicators have been proposed to evaluate the conditions of plants in ecological systems. Among them, the analysis of the prompt fluorescence (PF) of chlorophyll is considered a powerful tool that combines the richness of the achievable information with the operational quickness. This technique is especially suitable in large ecological surveys, where it is required to screen many samples in a brief time. The PF allows evaluating photochemical properties and functionalities of photosynthetic organisms utilizing a set of parameters, known as 'AP-test'. The distinct phases of the photochemical processes in terms of energy absorption, trapping and electron transport can be described by these parameters. In this paper, we reanalyse large PF datasets obtained in past researches, carried out in field conditions (forests, plantations and pasture meadows) and in experimental setups (semi-controlled conditions). The aim was to explore the relationships (redundancy and independence) among the JIP-test parameters to select the most suitable ones to capture the variability of plant photosynthetic efficiency and their responses to environmental pressures. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to 43,987 measurements. The overall PCA results evidenced that the variability of the PF parameters is explicated mainly by two factors, connected respectively to the processes of photon capture and first photochemical events, and to the efficiency of the electron transport around the photosystem I. This result suggests that, in ecological studies, the photosynthetic functioning of the member of a population can be effectively described with two parameters representative of these two phases: the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry of a dark-adapted sample (F-V/F-M) and the amplitude of the I-P phase (Delta V-IP). F-V/F-M and Delta V-IP. probed to be independent and their correlation in various datasets may be either positive or negative in relation to the environmental factors considered. The physiological significance of the correlations between these parameters is discussed.

AB  - This study examines the cost structure of Japanese electric power industry to investigate whether a structural reform on the industry really enhances a cost-saving benefit to consumers. A composite cost function model, using a panel data set, is used for this study. The data set consists of nine electric power companies from 1990 to 2008. Based upon the estimation results, this study examines whether economies of scale and vertical economies exist in the industry. Then, this study conducts a cost subadditivity test that is a necessary condition of natural monopoly. The empirical results indicate that the electric power firms exhibit the status of economies of scale in their transmissions and distributions and the operation as a whole. However, they do not exhibit economies of scale in their generations. Thus, the transmission operation, by integration, in a large area can improve its economic efficiency. Furthermore, the industry should introduce more competition in both generation and wholesale power markets where more firms can participate in their power trades. This study also empirically confirms that vertical economies have existed in the industry. Moreover, this study confirms that all the estimates in the cost subadditivity test satisfy the necessary condition of natural monopoly, where each estimate indicates cost saving in cost subadditivity. The test does not guarantee a sufficient condition of natural monopoly. However, it clearly indicates that the functional separation between generation and transmission will increase total production cost in the industry. The complete separation may result in a net loss of economic efficiency if a competition benefit does not exceed an expected economic loss. Consequently, this study suggests that the industrial structure of future Japanese electric power industry should be evaluated from not only an expected benefit by introducing competition but also an unbundling cost that occurs with a loss of vertical integration.

AB  - Because soil nematode populations play a key role in regulating the turnover of microbial communities and respond to changes in environmental conditions, shifts in their abundance and composition can be useful indicators of soil conditions. In this study nematode communities and other ecosystem variables were investigated over 7 yr under an annual (Zen mays) and a perennial (Asparagus officinale) crop using three weed management practices (cultivation, herbicide application, mulching) which can be related to agricultural intensification. Crop productivity and soil conditions did not change significantly during the trial. All management practices influenced the nematode fauna but the greatest long-term effects were from sawdust mulching. In the mulched plots there was an initial flush of both total and bacterial-feeding nematodes but both subsequently declined, which was coincident with enhanced populations of top predatory nematodes. The apparent negative interaction between bacterial-feeding and predatory nematodes was also demonstrated through the former being significantly (P < 0.001) negatively correlated with soil carbon, bacterial mass and weed biomass and the latter being positively correlated with the same variables. Herbicide use did not exert any consistent detrimental effects on nematode communities and the nematode fauna in the herbicide treated plots tended to have greater diversity (as indicated by the Shannon-Weiner index) than that in many of the other plots. The effects of cultivation varied, but under the perennial crop the greatest number of total and bacterial-feeding nematodes were commonly at 5-10 cm depth in cultivated plots. While most treatments had relatively little general effect on the composition of the nematode fauna over the study period, several important specific effects were only apparent after at least 3 yr. Thus to effectively evaluate the relative effects of different agricultural practices in the long-term it is necessary to sample until the ecosystem has achieved some degree of equilibrium rather than monitoring only initial cropping cycles.

AB  - Shrimp captures have reached a record in Southern Brazil, and some populations show signs of overexploitation. One shrimp species in particular, Xyphopenaeus kroyeri, abundant in Brazilian landings, is caught by bottom trawl. Trawl fishery is recognized by the impacts it causes on the seabed and on organisms that live in or on the substrate. The present study was conducted in traditional fishing areas on the southern Brazilian coast to assess the conditions of the habitat and the ecological aspects of the marine macroinvertebrate community at 3 areas (Barra do Sul, Penha and Porto Belo) in the Central and Northern Coast of the state of Santa Catarina (southern Brazil). Bottom water and sediment data were used to analyze the differences between the sites. Macroinvertebrate captures were used to analyze ecological aspects of the communities such as composition, diversity and patterns associated with the abiotic variables and habitat conditions. We used a trawling vessel for samplings. The results showed a homogeneous water mass between the areas. However, the sediment characteristic differentiates the areas and contributes to the species composition's heterogeneity between the samples. The ABC and species-ranking curves results suggest moderate disturbances in the three areas, but with a better structure for the Porto Belo communities. In this context, Barra do Sul was characterized by an environment relatively poor in sediment structure, the abundance and biomass of species. In contrast, Porto Belo and Penha were the opposite. Since trawling changes the sediment's characteristics are strongly correlated with the diversity and the permanence of sensitive species, we suggest that increased small-scale trawling activities might contribute to the substrate's homogenization and reduce species diversity in these areas. Therefore, constant surveys to monitor the physical structure and the community and its dynamics in trawling areas are indispensable for the conservation of species and fisheries' sustainability.

AB  - Results of the layer-by-layer studies of distribution of organic matter (OM) and mercury in ice cores sampled from the Amur River near the Khabarovsk city: its mainstream and the Pemzenskaya and Amurskaya branches, are presented. Comprehensive investigation of ice performed at the end of the freeze-up period allows making a retrospective analysis of the river ecosystem pollution during winter. Analysis of the total content of dissolved organic substances and aromatic compounds, determining a level of humification of the aquatic environment, was carried out with a spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-3600 at 254 and 275 nm. The mercury content was determined by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The number of cultured heterotrophic bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and their resistance to mercury (0.0005 and 0.001 mg/L) were used as indicators of biogeochemical processes going on in vitro. The maximum resistance to mercury at concentration of 0.001 mg/l was revealed from the sulfate-reducing bacteria in cores taken from the upper ice layer (0-10 cm) near the right bank of the Amurskaya branch. Periodical high mercury contamination of ice (up to 0.71 mkg/L) is estimated as a risk factor. In Pemzenskoy branch, the main factors for the mercury methylation in the ice were fine detritus, coming at the reservoir discharges, and the SRB resistant to mercury. These microorganisms were found in upper layers of the ice (10-35 cm) near the left bank and in the middle of the water stream (60-80 cm). A layer of ice (70-117 cm) with conditions also favourable for the sulfate reduction and the mercury methylation had been revealed in the mainstream of the Amur River near its right bank that is the cross-boundary area in the zone of influence of the Songhua river runoff. Among these conditions are high levels of OM, the presence of heterotrophic bacteria, which are destructors of high-molecular compounds, the potential producers of metabolites with methyl radicals, and the activity of the SRB resistant to mercury.

AB  - During the past several decades, extensive areas of the humid tropical Amazon have been cleared for the introduction of pasture or subsistence farming and later abandoned after a few years of use. An option for recovering these areas is the planting of rubber trees because it is a native tree that could restore conditions similar to those existing before the clearing. In addition, the high economic value of natural rubber is a source of income for small producers. In soil management under the Amazon conditions, low phosphorus (P) has been the most limiting factor. Under natural conditions, P is provided to the plants almost exclusively by organic matter mineralization. The aim of this study was to evaluate a chronosequence of reforestation with rubber trees planted at different times in cleared areas, with primary forest as a reference. The amounts of litter and P content in the plant, in the litter, and in soil, as well as biological indicators (acid and alkaline phosphatase and P microbial biomass) associated with the P cycle in a Xanthic Ferralsol (Oxisol), in the Central Amazon were assessed. Rubber tree growth resulted in changes in total organic carbon, with an increase of 104.6% in the 45-year-old rubber trees compared with the 6-year-old rubber tree plantation. This was also observed for acid and alkaline phosphatase activities, which were close to those of the primary forest. The formation of litter and the P content of the microbial biomass in soil were higher in rubber areas. The P immobilized into microbial biomass was the main reserve to meet the plant's nutritional demand for phosphorus. The content of P available in the soil, regardless of the extractants (Mehlich 1, Mehlich 3, and Bray 1) and the age of vegetation cover were below the levels indicated as appropriate.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is promoted as the solution for sustainable use. An ecosystem-wide assessment methodology is therefore required. In this paper, we present an approach to assess the risk to ecosystem components from human activities common to marine and coastal ecosystems. We build on: (i) a linkage framework that describes how human activities can impact the ecosystem through pressures, and (ii) a qualitative expert judgement assessment of impact chains describing the exposure and sensitivity of ecological components to those activities. Using case study examples applied at European regional sea scale, we evaluate the risk of an adverse ecological impact from current human activities to a suite of ecological components and, once impacted, the time required for recovery to pre-impact conditions should those activities subside. Grouping impact chains by sectors, pressure type, or ecological components enabled impact risks and recovery times to be identified, supporting resource managers in their efforts to prioritize threats for management, identify most at-risk components, and generate time frames for ecosystem recovery.

AB  - Understanding the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to global change remains a major challenge of ecological research. We exploited a natural elevation gradient in a northern hardwood forest to determine how reductions in snow accumulation, expected with climate change, directly affect dynamics of soil winter frost, and indirectly soil microbial biomass and activity during the growing season. Soils from lower elevation plots, which accumulated less snow and experienced more soil temperature variability during the winter (and likely more freeze/thaw events), had less extractable inorganic nitrogen (N), lower rates of microbial N production via potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and higher potential microbial respiration during the growing season. Potential nitrate production rates during the growing season were particularly sensitive to changes in winter snow pack accumulation and winter soil temperature variability, especially in spring. Effects of elevation and winter conditions on N transformation rates differed from those on potential microbial respiration, suggesting that N-related processes might respond differently to winter climate change in northern hardwood forests than C-related processes.

AB  - The benthic and demersal communities in the Colombian Caribbean Sea (CCS) are heavily fished by the shrimp trawling fishery, which presents very high discard levels. Here, we conducted an analysis of the size structure of these benthic and demersal communities in the northern and southern zones of the CCS. Sampling was conducted onboard shrimp trawlers throughout an entire year. No significant differences were found in the size distributions of the two zones, among sites within southern ecoregions, or among the analyzed cruises. This homogeneity in size structure is remarkable since the zones analyzed possess very different species compositions and environmental conditions. The observed size structures were adequately described by non-linear distributions rather than the traditionally employed linear normalized biomass size spectra. It is hypothesized that the non-linearity is due to the effect of fishing and particularly, of discarding. This study emphasizes the need for a greater understanding of the impacts that trawl fishing has on community size structure and the applicability of this knowledge towards fishery resource management in ecosystems with high diversity.

AB  - Though the importance of coppicing for the conservation of forest biodiversity is acknowledged, little is known about flora diversity and how it may be affected by the perceptions, constraints and regulations governing how loggers choose to exploit forest resources. Building on previous research on coppiced forests in the central Italian Apennines, unstructured and structured social surveys were performed along with structural and compositional vegetation sampling to determine how the ecology of the understory flora, where most of the biodiversity is found, may be affected by direct and indirect interactions between formal rules, namely Marche Region prescriptions, and informal rules applied in coppicing management.
   We identified economic/logistical and ecological variables that influence change in understory plant communities, particularly focusing on specialist forest species, and we explored how commercial, private and group property (Comunanza Agraria) loggers are influenced by these variables in deciding whether a forest is suitable for coppicing. Our insights on the relationships between the human and the ecological dimensions of the coppicing system suggest that the users prefer specific forest conditions because they facilitate efficient harvesting. These conditions also happen to be compatible with the life cycle of the specialist forest species in the ground flora.
   The stand attributes considered to be indicators of productivity drive decision making almost independently from (but largely compatibly with) formal rules. This is true across the three groups of loggers. These attributes seem to act as determinants of the conservation of the functional diversity of understory plant species, at plot and forest patch scale. We conclude that economically viable coppicing can occur after the stumps have been allowed to regenerate and grow beyond a certain diameter. This enables understory conditions favorable to forest specialist plants to re-establish and makes the present coppicing regime compatible with conservation of the diversity of these species in the forest landscape.

AB  - Predictive species distribution models have become increasingly common in conservation management. Among them, envelope-based approaches like the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) are particularly advantageous, as they require only presence data. Based on the assumption that the absolute frequency of species presence is a direct indicator of habitat suitability (HS), habitat suitability indices (HSI) are computed. However, this assumption may be misleading when the scarcity of optimal habitat forces most of the individuals to live in suboptimal conditions. This often happens when the environmental conditions in the study area represent only a marginal part of the species fundamental niche.
   In this study we propose three new HS algorithms for ENFA models, which address such 'edge of niche' situations. The first algorithm (area-adjusted median, M-a) takes the availability of environmental conditions in the study area into account, the second (median + extremum, M-e) addresses situations where the species' optimum is at or beyond the extremum of the investigated environmental gradient, and the third (area-adjusted median + extremum, M-ae) combines both approaches. These algorithms were applied to two populations of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), situated in different positions relative to the environmental gradient represented in the respective study area, and compared with the classical median algorithm (M). We evaluated the models using cross-validation and a comparison with an expert model based on external data.
   In both study areas, the HS maps obtained with the three new algorithms differed visibly from those calculated with the median algorithm. Cross-validation and comparison with external data showed that the new algorithms always provided better models, with the extremum-based algorithms (M-e and M-ae) performing best. We conclude that the new algorithms can extend the applicability of ENFA-models to a broader range of conservation relevant species by improving HS calculations for skewed species-habitat relationships in marginal habitats.

AB  - The paper summarizes experimental and calculation data on the effect of oxygen fugacity on the origin of mineral assemblages in Mn-bearing rocks and demonstrates the possibility of application of these data to the reconstruction of conditions under which metalliferous deposits were metamorphosed. A new variant of the T-log f(O2) diagram is proposed for the Mn-Si-O system, which differs from previous ones by the location of the lines for the formation (decomposition) of braunite and tephroite. These two minerals are the most universal indicators of oxygen fugacity during the metamorphism of Mn-bearing deposits, because these minerals are widespread in nature and can be formed in diverse environments: braunite at high values in the pore solution, and tephroite at low values. The occurrence of Mn oxides and rhodonite (pyroxmangite) in a rock makes it possible to constrain the oxygen fugacity range. An original T-log f(O2) diagram is constructed for the Ca-Mn-Si-O system. As follows from this diagram, a Ca admixture expands the stability field of rhodonite toward higher oxygen fugacity values. Johannsenite can be formed in these rocks at even higher. The stability of both minerals is constrained in the region of low. The paper reports data on the Fe-Si-O and Mn-Fe-Si-O systems and discusses the possibility of applying the results of experiments in the Mn-Al-Si-O system to the estimation of conditions under which andalusite, spessartine, and galaxite can be formed in Mn-bearing rocks. Data on the mineralogy of numerous Mn deposits metamorphosed under various PTX parameters indicate that the origin of Mn-bearing mineral assemblages depends not so much on the temperature and pressure as on the oxygen fugacity, which is, in turn, controlled primarily by the composition of the pristine sediments (the presence or absence of organic matter in them) and host rocks and depends on the permeability of the rocks to oxygen, the P-T conditions, and the duration of the metamorphic processes.

AB  - Bacterial lipids are well-preserved in ancient rocks and certain ones have been used as indicators of specific bacterial metabolisms or environmental conditions existing at the time of rock deposition. Here we show that an anaerobic bacterium produces 3-methylhopanoids, pentacyclic lipids previously detected only in aerobic bacteria and widely used as biomarkers for methane-oxidizing bacteria. Both Rhodopila globiformis, a phototrophic purple nonsulfur bacterium isolated from an acidic warm spring in Yellowstone, and a newly isolated Rhodopila species from a geochemically similar spring in Lassen Volcanic National Park (USA), synthesized 3-methylhopanoids and a suite of related hopanoids and contained the genes encoding the necessary biosynthetic enzymes. Our results show that 3-methylhopanoids can be produced under anoxic conditions and challenges the use of 3-methylhopanoids as biomarkers of oxic conditions in ancient rocks and as prima facie evidence that methanotrophic bacteria were active when the rocks were deposited.

AB  - We investigated foraminifera in sediment samples from three different depths (2 to 5 m, 6 to 8 m and 9 to 13 m) on six reefs along an environmental gradient in the Whitsunday Island Group of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to test the hypothesis that light is the main factor regulating communities of symbiont bearing benthic foraminifera. In addition, an experiment was conducted quantifying growth and photophysiological response using pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, of three abundant foraminiferal taxa under three light conditions; all three of these taxa harbouring diatom-symbionts. Diversity of symbiotic foraminiferal taxa increased with distance from the mainland, and most symbiont bearing species increased in abundance. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that sampling depth and percent surface light only explained a small amount of the observed variance in the distribution of species. In contrast, distance from the mainland alone explained nearly three times as much of the variance. The redundancy analysis grouped sample locations from most individual reefs together, irrespective of sample depths. This grouping was confirmed by an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), yielding significant differences between most pairs of reefs. In the light manipulation experiment, Amphistegina spp. and Calcarina spp. exhibited similar growth rates (changes in surface area measured by photography and image analysis software) in all light conditions (ca. 100% Surface light, 30% and 7%). Growth of Heterostegina depressa significantly increased with a decrease in light intensity. All three foraminiferal taxa had the highest maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) in the lowest light condition. The range of yields in low light conditions (F-v/F-m values of ca. 0.6 - 0.7) was similar to that measured from foraminifera directly after field collection. Reduced F-v/F-m suggested that high irradiance conditions exert stress on the photosystem of the symbionts. Rapid light curves (RLCs) demonstrated that even specimens in high light were adapted to relatively low light conditions (light saturation occurring at ca. 43 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). With decreasing light intensity, the initial slope of the RLCs (alpha) increased and the light intensity at onset of saturation (E-k) decreased, demonstrating that the symbiotic microalgae can rapidly respond to changes in light conditions. Thus, both field and laboratory experiments did not support the hypothesis that light is the train limiting factor of symbiont bearing foraminifera in our study area.

AB  - Trace element composition in plant biomass could be used as an indicator of environmental stress, management practices and restoration success. A longitudinal study was conducted to compare Pb, Cd, and Cu content in seagrass Syringodium filiforme collected at a former bombing range in Puerto Rico with those of a Biosphere Reserve under similar geoclimatic conditions. Trace elements were measured by atomic absorption after dryashing of samples and extraction with acid. In general, levels of Pb, Cd, and Cu varied during 2001, 2003, 2005-2006, and 2013-2016. Results showed that bioaccumulated concentration of these trace elements were consistently higher, but not significant, at the bombing range site. As expected in polluted areas, greater variability in Pb and Cd content were observed in the military impacted site with levels up to 14 and 17 times higher than seagrass from the reference site, respectively. Although a decrease in Pb was observed after cessation of all military activities in 2003, the concentration in plant biomass was still above levels of ecological concern, indicating that natural attenuation is insufficient for cleanup of the site.

AB  - Environmental conditions of the national economy development are determined. The authors propose the mechanism for the integrated assessment of environmental costs based on the correction factors for regions of Ukraine. The authors propose the main components of the mechanism: correction factor that takes into account the number of inhabitants of the area; the correction factor that takes into account the economic importance of the region; the correction factor, which takes into account the background level of pollution; the correction factor, which takes into account the vulnerability of public health; the correction factor, which takes into account the potential of reproduction of ecosystems; the correction factor, which takes into account the time factor. All these factors are to provide the integrated assessment of environmental costs of ecological, economic and social factors. The authors highlighted that in a case of integrated assessment of environmental costs it would have a lot of ecological, economic and social positive effects in regions. One of the main effects is the reducing of the environmental damage. In the article authors estimated the environmental costs with correction factors system and without it. According to the results the environmental costs are enough high in Ukraine.

AB  - Evaluating different environmental policy options requires extensive modelling of biophysical processes and attributes linked with metrics to measure the magnitude and distribution of societal impacts. An integrated ecosystem services assessment (IESA) has potential to provide salient, credible and legitimate information for environmental policy- and decision-makers. Here we present results of an IESA of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, an Australian Government initiative to restore aspects of river flow regimes to improve the ecological condition of floodplains, rivers and wetlands in south-eastern Australia. The main outcome from the IESA is that the supply of most ecosystem services (ES) improves under Basin Plan policy and that these improvements have considerable monetary value. An IESA can provide actionable ecological, economic and social information for policy- and decision-makers. In the Basin Plan case the IESA was underpinned by hydrological scenarios that were input into ecological models and interdisciplinary integration across scales, values and variables.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Florida Everglades controls a number of environmental processes important for ecosystem function including the absorption of light, mineral dissolution/precipitation, transport of hydrophobic compounds (e.g., pesticides), and the transport and reactivity of metals, such as mercury. Proposed attempts to return the Everglades to more natural flow conditions will result in changes to the present transport of DOM from the Everglades Agricultural Area and the northern conservation areas to Florida Bay. In part, the restoration plan calls for increasing water flow throughout the Everglades by removing some of the manmade barriers to flow in place today. The land- and water-use practices associated with the plan will likely result in changes in the quality, quantity, and reactivity of DOM throughout the greater Everglades ecosystem. The authors discuss the factors controlling DOM concentrations and chemistry, present distribution of DOM throughout the Everglades, the potential effects of DOM on key water-quality issues, and the potential utility of dissolved organic matter as an indicator of success of restoration efforts.

AB  - Although benthic macroinvertebrates have been used as indicators of ecological condition for a variety of aquatic ecosystems, large reservoirs present challenges for assessment design. Reservoir embayments may have unique characteristics relevant for assessment, and the reservoirs may include zones that combine the characteristics of lotic and lentic systems. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial variation in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of three large upper Missouri River reservoirs in the USA. A probability design was used to select sample sites from Lake Oahe (North and South Dakota), Lake Sakakawea (North Dakota), and Fort Peck Lake (Montana). Sites were chosen to represent the main stem of each reservoir, as well as small, medium, and large bays. The assemblages in all lakes were dominated by oligochaetes (46-60 % of total organisms) and chironomids (29-49 %). Small and medium bays generally had greater total densities, particularly of chironomids and the burrowing mayfly Hexagenia. Composition and density of the benthos were strongly influenced by depth. Information on the density, distribution, and variability of benthic macroinvertebrates will be used to further refine assessment strategies for large reservoirs.

AB  - Soil sealing and crusting are common, widespread processes in arid and semiarid soils that strongly affect runoff and erosion. In these soils, biological soil crusts (BSCs) are an essential surface component known to have an important role in water processes, and are also strong erosion protection agents. However, these crusts are also highly vulnerable to disturbances, which seriously affect their pedological and ecological roles. The aims of this study were to examine whether penetration resistance (PR) depends on BSC developmental stage and how removal of BSCs affects PR, under dry and wet soil conditions, and to analyse the relationship between PR and runoff and soil detachment in these soils. This research was conducted in two semiarid ecosystems representative of crusting processes in SE Spain (El Cautivo and Las Amoladeras, Almeria province). Four pairs of plots containing the main BSC types identified at both sites were selected and two treatments were considered, one in each plot in the pair: i) unaltered BSC and ii) BSC removal by scraping. Two intense rainfall simulation experiments were performed one after another in these plots. Runoff was measured during both, and water samples were collected for further determination of sediment yield. PR was measured in undisturbed BSC and scalped soil on dry soil prior to rainfall, on wet soil after the first and second rainfalls, and on dry soil seven months after BSC removal. Crust PR was higher at Las Amoladeras (3.13 +/- 0.54 kg cm(-2)) than at El Cautivo (1.52 +/- 0.74 kg cm(-2)) due to soil compaction from trampling by livestock in the former. PR varied with BSC development, with less developed cyanobacteria BSCs showing higher resistance (under dry and wet conditions) than more developed lichen BSCs. BSC removal was followed by the formation of a new seal (physical crust) upon raining, which however, did not result in increased PR. No significant relationship was found between PR and runoff, but there was a weak negative relationship between PR and soil detachment, because in BSCs, which had higher PRs, soil detachment rates were much lower than in recently scalped soils. Seven months after BSC removal, PR was significantly higher in scalped soils than for undisturbed BSCs. Our results show that PR was not a good indicator of hydrological and soil detachment response of BSCs or the soil sealing during rain immediately after BSC removal, but it was a good indicator of physical soil crust formation in scalped soils over time.

AB  - 1. Physiological parameters can give valuable indications about the performance of animals in their environment and the combined deleterious effects of several factors on the individual. The concentration of circulating glucocorticoids is often taken as a measurement of the level of stress an animal is exposed to. As an alternative, the ratio of heterophils (or neutrophils in mammals) to lymphocytes in blood (H/L-ratio) has been proposed. Although laboratory studies with exogenous corticosterone treatment or strong stressors found a positive correlation between circulating corticosterone and the H/L-ratio, studies in free-living birds did not.
   2. In Eurasian kestrel nestlings Falco tinnunculus, we first confirmed that implanting exogenous corticosterone elevated the H/L-ratio and depressed the immune response to PHA in altricial nestlings under field conditions, as found in precocial species.
   3. In non-treated, free-living kestrel nestlings we showed that circulating corticosterone concentration and the H/L-ratio were not correlated among each other and that various environmental factors were not correlated with baseline corticosterone concentration to the same degree as with the H/L-ratio. Baseline corticosterone concentrations were only elevated when nestlings had no body fat stores and as a reaction to our presence at the nest. In contrast, the H/L-ratio was increased as a response to five potential natural stressors: being later-hatched and thus competitively inferior, low body fat stores, ectoparasite infestation, after rain which impaired food delivery of adults and with ongoing season which reflects deteriorating environmental conditions. Baseline corticosterone on day 10 of age was a better predictor of survival until day 13 than the H/L-ratio.
   4. In accordance with findings from the literature, it appears that baseline corticosterone concentration and H/L-ratio differ in sensitivity to various stressors. While the H/L-ratio increases already in response to more subtle stressors, both measures react to severe, life-threatening stressors, like starvation in free-living birds, although in our study corticosterone was the better predictor of survival.
   5. This study showed that baseline corticosterone and H/L-ratio cannot be used interchangeably as indicators of stress, but together can provide a comprehensive picture about the stress-status of a bird in ecological studies. If only one measure is to be taken, the choice depends on the questions to be answered, practical issues (speed of blood sampling after first disturbance) and physiological interpretability and amenability to experiments.

AB  - The existence of contradictions between the natural environment and economic activity, including the functioning of agricultural clusters, has led to the need to transfer production to a qualitatively new level, associated with adaptation to environmental conditions. In this regard, the objective of this study is to develop algorithms and economic-mathematical models for environmental safety assessment and decision support in the environmental management system of the agricultural cluster. The article formulates criteria for assessing the environmental safety of agricultural enterprises, which are divided by types of environmental performance of the agricultural cluster (impact on the environment, impact on workers of enterprises participating in the cluster, impact on the environment and people through agricultural cluster products). On the basis of the specified criteria the algorithm of ecological management system estimation of the enterprises-participants of an agrarian cluster is constructed. As a result of the study, an economic and mathematical model of the formation of the investment program of the agricultural cluster was developed, aimed at protecting the environment and improving the environmental situation in general.

AB  - From the 1980's, Indonesian shrimp production has continuously increased through a large expansion of cultured areas and an intensification of the production. As consequences of diseases and environmental degradations linked to this development, there are currently 250,000 ha of abandoned ponds in Indonesia. To implement effective procedure to undertake appropriate aquaculture ecosystem assessment and monitoring, an integrated indicator based on four criteria using very high spatial optical satellite images, has been developed to discriminate active from abandoned ponds. These criteria were: presence of water, aerator, feeding bridge and vegetation. This indicator has then been applied to the Perancak estuary, a production area in decline, to highlight the abandonment dynamic between 2001 and 2015. Two risk factors that could contribute to explain dynamics of abandonment were identified: climate conditions and pond locations within the estuary, suggesting that a spatial approach should be integrated in planning processes to operationalize pond rehabilitation.

AB  - Soil organic matter is a key indicator of many ecosystem functions, particularly in agricultural systems. With carbon as its majority constituent (similar to 58%), soil organic matter is a key variable relating production and environmental responses. However, it is argued that depth distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) may be more important in understanding how agriculture affects ecosystem services derived from soil than the total quantity of SOC. Conservation agricultural systems lead to highly stratified SOC, which helps to protect soil from erosion and prevent runoff loss of nutrients (i.e., water quality improvement), creates a concentrated organic habitat for nutrient storage and soil biological diversity (i.e., soil quality improvement) and promotes a structurally stable pore network connecting surface and subsurface to avoid negative impacts on soil aeration and GHG emissions (i.e., air quality improvement). A protocol is described to calculate the stratification ratio of soil organic matter fractions from a diversity of sampling procedures, which may be relevant in different ecoregions and conditions of the soil.

AB  - In northern California, black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scopoli complex) can be a major pest of sugarbeet, particularly in spring-planted fields. The major natural enemies of the aphid are predators, including the coccinellids Hippodamia: convergens Guerin, Coccinella novemnotata Herbst & C. septempunctata L., and the chrysopids Chrysopa oculata Say & C. nigricornis Burmeister. Augmentative releases of eggs of either Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) or C. rufilabris (Burmeister) failed to significantly reduce aphid populations under field conditions. This was attributed in part to incompatibility between black bean aphids and lacewing larvae from commercial sources. Application of food sprays containing yeast hydrolysate, sucrose and molasses resulted in increased densities of eggs and adults of C. carnea in treated plots. These results suggest that the potential for augmentative biological control of black bean aphid through the application of food sprays is greater than that for release of commercially available lacewings. Regardless of method, an holistic approach to augmentation that takes into account the ecological structure of the target agroecosystem will be required. Some aspects of ''pre-emptive'' biological control are discussed.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify, quantify and qualify the anthropic environmental impacts resulting from the urbanization processes around the Araca Lagoon, Recife, Pernambuco. The impacts were investigated, being divided into three sectors (SI, SII and SIII) through a checklist, which contains a list of environmental and anthropic indicators, these indicators with impact weights and effects, resulting in a negative value of the class of impact. Besides the analysis of urbanization processes that caused environmental impacts, with the evaluation of the conditions of the mangrove ecosystem. The Araca Lagoon has been subjected to several anthropogenic actions, which have caused degrading alterations, but with small effect (Sectors I: -49 and III: -78) and moderate (Sector II: -106) in its physiography. Consequently, the cause of several shocking interventions, with little planning, led to shocking modifications ranging from small to moderate. However, the action of man-induced anthropic impacts, coupled with the natural stressors acting on the mangrove ecosystem, limit the development of the mangrove forest. In view of this, the anthropic actions, arising from urbanization, advance on the natural environment, requiring preventive and emergency measures for the conservation of Araca Lagoon.

AB  - The use of aquatic plants as bio-indicators constitutes an irreplaceable tool for investigation in ecological research, applied to the conservation of littoral ecosystems. Today, studies in both the laboratory and the field have provided encouraging insights into the capacity of aquatic plants to act as biomonitors of environmental quality, through the use of biomarkers, and these are reviewed here. Photosynthetic activity, secondary metabolites, heat shock proteins, enzymes of detoxication, and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in the case of various stressors, (e.g. light, thermal, hydric/haline stress, or herbicides, metals, organic contaminants). Most of them seem to be valuable and early markers of the environmental conditions, as demonstrated by experimentations carried out on Posidonia oceanica. Nevertheless, none can be in itself a valuable solution, and only a multiparametric approach, including both 'physiological' biomarkers, biomarkers of general stress and more specific biomarkers seems to be appreciable in an ecotoxicological diagnostic.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to study the effects of wind velocity and temperature profiles on the patterns of the pollutant dispersion by using the Fluent CFDcode for three cases of atmospheric stability conditions. The discrete phase model (DPM) along with Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) was used to model the dispersion pattern. For neutrally stable atmospheric condition, the velocity, temperature, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and dissipation profiles predicted by the model in downwind direction were compared with the results of other investigators to assess the accuracy of the model. It was observed from the simulation results that the pollutant dispersion and turbulence intensity patterns strongly depend on the temperature profile. In addition, the TKE profile was shown to be a good indicator of the mixing zone and the dispersion patterns, These results can be used to assess environment impact of coastal industries which are under various diurnal temperature profiles.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) are essential to maintaining biodiversity, while effective management plans (MPs) are essential for the management of these areas. Thus, MPs must have relevant data analyses and diagnoses to evaluate ecological conditions of PAs. We evaluated the environmental diagnoses of 126 Brazilian federal PAs, the methods used to collect data and defined the diagnostic level of PMs according to the type and number of analyzes performed for each PA category. We found a low level of diagnosis in MPs. Primary field data or research programs resulted in environmental diagnostics of higher levels. Participatory workshops and secondary data, most used in Extractive Reserves, were related to low levels of diagnoses. The most frequent analysis was the identification of threats (97% of MPs), while the least frequent were the definition of conservation targets and future scenarios for management (1.6% of MPs). Our results show that the diagnoses of the MPs need to be more analytical to generate useful information for decision-making. MPs should prioritize data analysis and specific management studies, focused on the use of natural resources, the status of conservation targets, future scenarios, and key information to planning.

AB  - Within the European Water Framework Directive, many studies have been conducted to evaluate the sensitivity/robustness of a variety of indices in relation to natural or anthropogenic disturbance events. However, these indices have rarely been applied to verify the impacts of disturbances in offshore environments, though the Marine Strategy Framework Directive recommends their use for assessing benthic community conditions and functionality. The aim of this paper was to determine which biotic indicator performed the best for detecting the impacts of offshore structures on benthic populations in the Adriatic Sea. The impacts of four rigs were investigated six months after their installation, and the H', AMBI, m-AMBI, BENTIX, and BOPA indices were assessed. Although these five indices delivered some contradictory results because of the differences in their structure and discrepancies in their assignment of species sensitivity, the BENTIX, H' and BOPA indices appear to evaluate stress levels better than the AMBI and m-AMBI indices, which tend to provide results that are slightly overly optimistic.

AB  - A field survey in a transitional environment (lagoon of Venice, Italy) and a laboratory exposure experiment were carried out to validate the use of polychaetes, Perinereis rullieri, as indicators of PCB and PAH contaminants in the sediments. Results from the field study showed that PCBs, predominantly the hexa- and hepta-chlorinated biphenyls, were promptly bioaccumulated in the tissues of P. rullieri, whereas PAH levels were generally low and fluctuating among seasons.
   Organisms experimentally exposed to natural polluted sediments bioaccumulated all the examined PCB congeners, whereas those exposed to the reference sediments were able to reduce them at least to, some extent. A PAH depletion was always observed, although the time variations for the single compounds differed from each other.
   The biomarker malondialdehyde (MIDA), evaluated both in native and in treated organisms, was helpful as a supporting parameter in elucidating their oxidative stress condition, although depending on numerous natural confounding factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Atlantic western coast of Portugal includes several shallow coastal lagoons, such as Obidos, Albufeira and Santo Andre, that are intermittently closed to the ocean by sand barriers. Their physico-chemical characteristics, as well as their residence time and tidal influence, are highly dependent on the open/closed periods and on the inter-annual raining/dry season's variability with important impacts on the phytoplankton community structure, abundance and dynamics. Furthermore, the number of coastal ecosystems with identified eutrophication symptoms is increasing worldwide due to the increasing anthropogenic pressures. Eutrophication is one of the greatest threats to water quality in coastal lagoons and a major concern for the European water quality regulators. One of the first symptoms of eutrophication is enhanced algal biomass. Thus, phytoplankton is generally one of the most important biological indicator of these processes.
   In this study, all available phytoplankton (chlorophyll and taxa blooms) and nutrient data from a period of more than 50 years were gathered. During the periods of closure, these lagoons have favoring conditions for phytoplankton growth, which can reach high levels of chlorophyll a (chl a, 290 mu g L-1), as observed in Obidos lagoon during the 80's. At that time, during the open periods, the highest chl a concentration registered was about one fifth lower (64 mu g L-1). At present, this lagoon is artificially maintained open during almost all the time and the highest observed chl a concentration was 7 mu g L-1. Comparatively, the lagoon of Albufeira still presents high phytoplankton biomass levels during the closed periods (e.g. 55 mu g L-1, during winter 2004). In these semi-enclosed systems, phytoplankton blooms are recurrent and HAB species are frequently observed.
   Significant linear relationships were found between nutrient and chlorophyll concentration, during the open and closed periods, for the lagoon of Obidos. This assessment was performed to validate the use of phytoplankton as an indicator of anthropogenic pressures. A tool for the classification, under the WFD, of the ecological quality of water bodies within these coastal lagoons is also described based on two different situations: open vs closed lagoon. A set of reference conditions and boundaries are also proposed. This tool was tested and validated against a scale of risk. In addition, the usefulness of specific species as ecological quality indicators is discussed, highlighting the occurrence of frequent Prorocentrum minimum blooms and its association with nutrient enrichment events worldwide.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to show how short-term laboratory tests, conducted according to US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) procedures, can be used effectively to assess water-quality conditions in streams or rivers that receive pollutants from industry or municipal or agricultural areas. Standardized, short-term tests with fish, aquatic invertebrates or algae are commonly used to estimate the acute or chronic toxicity of wastewaters; this is referred to as effluent testing. The methods used for testing effluents also can be used to assess water quality in receiving streams: in this application, the procedures are referred to as ambient testing. Despite similarity in methods, the major objective of effluent testing differs importantly from that of ambient testing. In effluent testing, the key objective is to determine how toxic an effluent is; in ambient testing, the main objective usually is that of determining if the water at a site is toxic. This difference is subtle but very important: it shapes the strategy for cost-effective ambient testing, and determines the framework for effective statistical analysis and interpretation of ambient toxicity test results. Specific case-study examples are provided demonstrating the kinds of information that can be extracted from ambient toxicity testing by use of different statistical methods, including analysis of variance, contingency-table analysis, and two types of multivariate procedures (principal components analysis and logistic regression). Examples also are given supporting the idea that an effective ambient testing programme should be long-term, and contain a diagnostic-testing component analogous to the toxicity identification procedures used to supplement effluent-testing programmes. Recommendations derived as 'lessons learned' from large-scale ambient toxicity testing programmes for receiving streams at Department of Energy facilities include: (1) testing more frequently with one species (preferably Ceriodaphnia) generally is more effective, in terms of information gained per dollar spent, than testing less frequently with two or more species; (2) use five or more sites per test period, plus two or more reference sites, whenever possible; (3) use four to six test periods per year; and (4) use diagnostic testing to supplement the ambient-testing programme. Various laboratory and in situ methods for environmental assessment are now under development, but these methods probably will not gain acceptance for use in regulatory situations for many years. Rapid growth in need for ecological risk assessments outstrips the rate at which new test procedures are approved for regulatory purposes. Thus, laboratory tests for estimating possible environmental impacts of toxic or disruptive pollutants are likely to be used more frequently during the next decade.

AB  - This work aimed to investigate effects of the ocean contamination by the sunscreen Benzophenone-3 (BP3) and acidification, caused by CO2 enrichment, to the yellow clam, Amarilladesma mactroides. Biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in tissues (gills, digestive gland, and mantle) of clams exposed to the environmental concentration of 1 mu g/L BP3, at seawater natural pH (pH 8.1) and at lower pH (pH 7.6). The tissues responded in different ways considering their physiological roles. In general, BP3 altered activity of the enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione cysteine ligase (GCL); but mostly increased the level of glutathione (GSH). These effects were enhanced by acidification, without augmenting lipid peroxidation (LPO). Carbonic anhydrase activity (CA) increased after BP3 exposure in the digestive gland and decreased in the gills at pH 7.6, while Ca2+-ATPase activity was affected by acidification only. Changing levels of these enzymes can alter shell formation and affect the bivalve maintenance in impacted environments.

AB  - Standardized ecosystem-based monitoring surveys are critical for providing information on marine ecosystem health. Environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) metabarcoding may facilitate such surveys by quickly and effectively characterizing multi-trophic levels. In this study, we assessed the suitability of eDNA/eRNA metabarcoding to evaluate changes in benthic assemblages of bacteria, Foraminifera and other eukaryotes along transects at three offshore oil and gas (O&G) drilling and production sites, and compared these to morphologically characterized macro-faunal assemblages. Bacterial communities were the most responsive to O&G activities, followed by Foraminifera, and macro-fauna (the latter assessed by morphology). The molecular approach enabled detection of hydrocarbon degrading taxa such as the bacteria Alcanivorax and Microbulbifer at petroleum impacted stations. Most identified indicator taxa, notably among macro-fauna, were highly specific to site conditions. Based on our results we suggest that eDNA/eRNA metabarcoding can be used as a stand-alone method for biodiversity assessment or as a complement to morphology-based monitoring approaches.

AB  - Understanding and mapping presettlement fire regimes is vitally important for ecosystem restoration, helping ensure the proper placement of fire back into ecosystems that formerly burned. Witness trees can support this endeavor by serving as pyro-indicators of the past. We mapped fire-adapted traits across a landscape by categorizing trees into two classes, pyrophiles and pyrophobes, and applying this classification to a geospatial layer of witness-tree points centered on the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia. A pyrophilic percentage was calculated for each point and spatially extrapolated via ordinary kriging to form a continuous geospatial cover. Regression analyses showed pyrophilic percentage was significantly related to a number of key environmental factors and changed along an elevation gradient from low, dry valleys (high pyrophilic percentage) to high, wet mountaintops (low pyrophilic percentage). This approach represents a significant advancement through the direct use of witness trees to depict past fire regimes applicable to both Public Land Survey and metes-and-bounds records.

AB  - Mining is an important human activity, but it strongly alters terrestrial and aquatic landscapes. Understanding the response of community-level descriptors is essential to plan monitoring and management strategies. In this context, we investigated differences in the environmental conditions and ichthyofauna (taxonomic and functional) structure in five pristine and four disturbed streams in a Central Amazon protected area sampled in the dry season of 2012. Additionally, we analyzed if taxonomic and functional structure exhibited similar spatial variation patterns among streams. Pristine streams exhibited higher richness and proportion of catfishes (Siluriformes) than disturbed streams, but no differences in the functional structure. The taxonomic and functional structure of the fish assemblages in the Saraca-Taquera National Forest varied concomitantly among the streams. Our results indicate that taxonomic-based metrics were more sensitive to the mining impacts in the Saraca-Taquera National Forest, probably because of the high functional redundancy of the local assemblages. We highlight the sensitivity of richness and proportion of siluriformes for monitoring stream fish assemblages in the Central Amazon.

AB  - A fundamentally new integrated approach to the state activity on the adaptation to changing environmental conditions, namely, the territorial planning of land use is proposed by the example of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation being the most vulnerable region to climate change. Adaptation measures for natural ecosystems are scientifically grounded for the Arctic region: the prevention of permafrost surface cover disturbances, the minimization of other types of anthropogenic impact and pollution, the maintenance and increase in surface albedo in winter. The examples of development of a dual indicator system are given: for monitoring the implementation of measures and adaptation efficiency (the quantitative markers of climate-caused damage). The analysis of all indicators in the adaptation efficiency monitoring system, as well as the projections of indicators for 5-10 years ahead help to make reasoned management decisions to correct the applied adaptation measures. The practical application of the results includes the use of the developed approaches in the sectoral and regional plans and at the second stage of the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential of birds as indicators of sustainable forest management. Several reviews have been critical of birds as indicators of environmental change, and we discuss the major criticisms in the context of forest management. We address these criticisms by suggesting alternative approaches for an indicator research program including the use of focussed studies to identify cause-and-effect relationships, habitat modelling to act as a surrogate to extensive monitoring of populations, and spatially-explicit population modelling (1) to conduct exploratory sensitivity analysis to identify the most important parameters; (2) to incorporate the spatial configuration of habitat into consideration of the impacts of management; (3) to anticipate future impacts as an alternative to measuring past impacts; (4) and, as a means of evaluating alternative management scenarios including natural disturbance regimes. Birds are unlikely to be able to act as a precise tool for the measurement of some forest condition, but they could be useful indicators of sustainable forest management as part of an iterative research program.

AB  - The study investigated whether plasmatic parameters in fish such as Cl- content could serve as physiological indicators to evaluate water quality. The variations of plasma Cl- content in two fish species caught in a wide range of rivers representative of the hydrographic system of Lorraine (N-E France) were investigated. First, we studied autochthonous populations of chub (Leuciscus cephalus) which is a widespread species in the rivers of Lorraine. Organisms living in highly mineralised rivers (> 1500 muS cm(-1))-either naturally or due to salt mine contamination-showed plasma Cl- content significantly greater than organisms living in river with a lower mineralisation. Second, we investigated plasma Cl- content of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) in poorly mineralised streams (<80 muS cm(-1)) with different degrees of acidification, both on autochthonous and transferred organisms. While indigenous trout maintained their Cl- content even in the acidic streams, transferred trout exhibited an important decrease of Cl- content after 48 h of exposure under acidic conditions.

A study on the ecological service value of Dengzhou City and its evolutionary characteristics can provide a theoretical basis for the water supply security of the Central Line Project and regional ecological environmental protection. Based on the ecosystem service value equivalent factor method, GIS, ENVI and GeoSOS-FLUS software were used to monetize the ecosystem service values of Dengzhou City in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2020; analyze the spatial and temporal change characteristics under its land use change conditions and predict the regional ecosystem service values of Dengzhou City in 2025. The results show that since the completion and commissioning of the South-North Water Transfer Central Project in 2014, the value of ecosystem services in Dengzhou City has rapidly increased from US$3.792 billion to US$4.612 billion, and in 2025, the value of ecosystem services in Dengzhou City is expected to reach US$4.8 billion.

AB  - Background
   Understanding how the conservation of nature can lead to improvement in human conditions is a research area with significant growth and attention. Progress towards effective conservation requires understanding mechanisms for achieving impact within complex social-ecological systems. Causal models are useful tools for defining plausible pathways from conservation actions to impacts on nature and people. Evaluating the potential of different strategies for delivering co-benefits for nature and people will require the use and testing of clear causal models that explicitly define the logic and assumptions behind cause and effect relationships.
   Objectives and methods
   In this study, we outline criteria for credible causal models and systematically evaluated their use in a broad base of literature (similar to 1,000 peer-reviewed and grey literature articles from a published systematic evidence map) on links between nature-based conservation actions and human well-being impacts.
   Results
   Out of 1,027 publications identified, only similar to 20% of articles used any type of causal models to guide their work, and only 14 total articles fulfilled all criteria for credibility. Articles rarely tested the validity of models with empirical data.

AB  - Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) detected in groundwater may have adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems. This paper reviews the existing occurrence data in groundwater for a range of EOCs including pharmaceutical, personal care, 'life-style' and selected industrial compounds. The main sources and pathways for organic EOCs in groundwater are reviewed, with occurrence data for EOCs in groundwater included from both targeted studies and broad reconnaissance surveys. Nanogram-microgram per litre concentrations are present in groundwater for a large range of EOCs as well as metabolites and transformation products and under certain conditions may pose a threat to freshwater bodies for decades due to relatively long groundwater residence times. In the coming decades, more of these EOCs are likely to have drinking water standards, environmental quality standards and/or groundwater threshold values defined, and therefore a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variation remains a priority.

AB  - Estuaries and coastal lagoons play a key role in the functioning of coastal ecosystems and represent important natural areas for fish communities. Species living in these habitats often show specialised ecological and life history traits. The reproductive periodicity of a northern population of the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus was assessed using the male courtship behaviour as indicator of reproductive motivation under laboratory conditions. Timing of egg development was also checked to further support the existence of a tidal-related periodicity. Using a statistical model applied to the intensity of courtship behaviour measured over a two-month period, a semilunar periodicity was revealed, with two main peaks corresponding with full moons. Both behaviours and timing of egg development were consistent with a periodicity of 14 days, suggesting that the tidal cycle drives the reproduction of A. fasciatus in Northern Adriatic saltmarshes. The findings are assessed with a comparative approach within both European and North American transitional waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past decade new ecological indices based on phytoplankton and macrophytes were developed as part of the tools for assessment of the ecological status of water bodies. This study demonstrates the applicability of two of them (Assemblage index /Q/ and Algae Group Index /AGI/) for evaluation of water bodies from a lake type L4 as well as their comparability. Assessment of the ecological status of two lake ecosystems was performed in order to ensure successful protection, enhancement and management of lowland and semi-mountain lakes in Bulgaria. Data on the aquatic flora from Golyamo Skalensko Lake and Malko Skalensko Lake over a period of two years were used to assess their ecological status. In addition, the toxic potential of the established dominant cyanoprokaryotic species was also evaluated. Phytoplankton- and macrophyte-based metrics resulted in complementary evaluation of temporary and long-term environmental conditions. Despite the hydraulic connection and proximity between the two lakes, Golyamo Skalensko Lake and Malko Skalensko Lake appear as completely different ecosystems, according to the phytoplankton structure (species composition, number of species, abundance, seasonal succession), macrophytes and ecological status.

AB  - The contribution of non-loricate ciliate assemblage to the ecological pattern of a ciliated protozoan community was studied based on a 1-year (June 2007-May 2008) dataset collected from Jiaozhou Bay, northern China. Samples were collected biweekly from five sampling sites. Results showed that: (1) the non-loricate ciliate assemblages were the primary components and significantly correlated with the total ciliate communities in terms of species number, abundance and biomass; (2) the ecological pattern of non-loricate ciliate assemblages was significantly related to that of both total ciliate communities and variations in environmental variables; and (3) spatio-temporal variations in biodiversity (richness, diversity and evenness of species) indices of non-loricate ciliate assemblages were significantly correlated with those of total ciliate communities and the environmental conditions, especially nutrients nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorous. These results suggest that the non-loricate ciliates are a primary contributor to the ecological pattern of total ciliate communities and might be used as a potential bioindicator for bioassessment in marine ecosystems.

AB  - A new method for assessing the response of biota to climatic changes in the ecosystem has been tested. In the Central Forest Natural Biosphere Reserve, the average annual air temperature between 1990 and 2019 was 4.8 +/- 0.13 degrees C (increasing at a rate of 0.35 degrees C per 10 years), and the amount of precipitation was 781 +/- 22.9 mm/year (22.6 mm per 10 years). A significant change in the timing of the seasonal activity has been determined for 11 phenological phenomena in nine bird species (52%). The clustering of phenological events in birds depends on the pattern of their seasonal migrations, the effect of agro- and hydrometeorological and trophic factors, and on whether spring or autumn phenological dates are used. Along with multivariate statistical methods, the integral index based on the standardized deviation makes it possible to unify the meteorological series and phenological traits on a biologically and statistically sound basis for improving the sensitivity of indicative properties of the biota under conditions of climatogenic changes.

AB  - Heavy visitor use in many areas of the world have necessitated development of ways to assess visitation impacts. Arches National Park recently completed a Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP) plan. Integral to this plan was developing a method to identify biological indicators that would both measure visitor impacts and response to management actions. The process used in Arches for indicator selection is outlined here as a model applicable to many areas facing similar challenges. The steps were: (1) Vegetation types most used by visitors were identified. Impacted and unimpacted areas in these types were sampled, comparing vegetation and soil factors. (2) Variables found to differ significantly between compared sites were used as potential indicators. (3) Site-specific criteria for indicators were developed, and potential indicators evaluated using these criteria. (4) Chosen indicators were further researched for ecological relevancy. (5) Final indicators were chosen, field tested, and monitoring sites designated. In Arches, indicators were chosen for monitoring annually (soil crust index, soil compaction, number of used social trails and soil aggregate stability) and every five years (vegetation cover and frequency; ground cover; soil chemistry; and plant tissue chemistry).

AB  - The resurvey of forest plant communities some decades after the first survey has become a valued approach to determine long-term responses in species diversity and composition to various anthropogenic environmental drivers, such as management changes, excess nitrogen deposition, or overabundant deer populations. However, little is known about the effects of initial site conditions, such as soil acidity or soil moisture, on these long-term responses and how multiple drivers interact with each other in affecting herb layer diversity and composition. Moreover, the extent to which local changes in canopy cover and composition may mimic or counterbalance effects of regional or global drivers is largely unexplored. Here, we resurveyed herb layer vegetation plots in northeastern Germany after more than five decades. Our main objectives were (1) to determine the effects of initial site conditions, here soil pH buffer range, on herb layer and environmental changes; (2) to disentangle the effects of presumed regional and global drivers from local changes in canopy density and composition; and (3) to identify interactions between environmental drivers in affecting species diversity and composition. We observed significant changes in species diversity and environmental conditions, mostly in dependence on the initial site conditions. Species richness increased only at moderately acidic to base-rich sites, while floristic distinctiveness (beta diversity) generally decreased but decreased significantly stronger on base-rich than on acidic sites. The indicated environmental changes comprised increased shading (particularly on acidic sites), a decrease in soil moisture, acidification (only on initially moderately acidic to base-rich sites), eutrophication (only on acidic sites), an increase in browsing pressure and more continental climatic conditions, probably in terms of increased summer drought (on well-drained sites only). The presumed regional/global environmental changes could not be explained by local changes in canopy composition. The herb layer responses were affected by several important interactions among the drivers. The floristic homogenization was more pronounced the stronger the eutrophication signal, but only on (moderately) acidic sites, while the homogenization occurred independent of any eutrophication on base-rich sites. The environmental change indicators for soil acidity and nitrogen availability showed opposing effects on temporal species turnover and a positive interaction, pointing to atmospheric deposition as the most important driver. Our study demonstrates that both initial site conditions and interactions between different drivers should be taken into account in resurvey studies to broaden our understanding of plant community responses to environmental changes.

AB  - This paper deals with the water management infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on the hydropower structures and environmental protection in the "Dolina Radwi, Chocieli i Chotli" Natura 2000 site in the Radew river basin (the zachodniopomorskie province in the north-western Poland). Advantages and drawbacks (environmental, economic and social) of water power generation and a characterization of the Radew basin and characterization of hydropower usage of this area are discussed. The natural conditions of the terrain are described and the legal setting is characterized for undertakings in the Natura 2000 sites (Water Framework Directive, the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive, Water Resources Law, the Nature Conservation Act, Act on Access to Information on the Environment and Its Protection and on Environmental Impact Assessments and executory provisions in the form of regulations). The paper presents an assessment of the operation of the hydropower plants "Rosnowo" and "Niedalino" on the river Radew in the context of the environment protection requirements for such facilities. Attention is also given to the social conflicts related to the operation of water management facilities in the Natura 2000 sites (on the example of the Trout Farm in Ubiedrze on the river Chociel). The authors conclude that in the "Dolina Radwi, Chocieli i Chotli" site rational actions are being taken for sustainable water management of hydraulic engineering facilities and that the principles of environmental protection are observed. The hydropower plants discussed in this paper have contributed to the formation of ecosystems related to water, already in existence at the time of creation of the "Dolina Radwi, Chocieli i Chotli" site. They also contributed to the specific species composition and the hydrological regime as well as other properties of the animate and inanimate world. The hydropower plants play various positive roles in the environment and economy, they generate inexpensive clean energy to be used by man. This way both the power production policy and the environmental policy are implemented. The use of this alternative energy source should be promoted also in the Natura 2000 sites. The structures related to water management may operate properly, but certain social, legal and environmental conditions apply. Any arising problems are minimized and users manage the natural resources in a rational and appropriate manner, both in terms of planning or modernizing these structures or by using compensation means. Moreover, several. water management works have been carried out in the Radew river basin and despite the rich hydro-engineering infrastructure in the area, the unique natural qualities of the site are preserved.

AB  - High soil acidity and elevated soil Al concentrations limit plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems. Aluminium toxicity can be ameliorated by Ca. Thus, Ca/Al molar ratios in soil solution and in plant tissues have been proposed as superior indicators than Al concentration itself for evaluating the Al toxicity stress to trees (Cronan & Grigal, J Environ Qual 1995;24:209-226). This article presents an overview of publications since 1995 where the reduced Ca/Al ratio in fine tree roots has been used as an indicator of stress for Al and/or soil acidity. The main aim of this review was to evaluate the use and the critical threshold of the fine root Ca/Al ratio as a potential indicator for Al toxicity stress to trees in acid soils. Based on the reviewed literature, the fine root Ca/Al molar ratio was strongly negatively related to Al stress in small tree seedlings in controlled environments, whereas the response was not clear under field conditions where other environmental factors interact. Fine root Ca/Al ranged from 0.03 to 17 in tree seedlings and from 0.1 to 18 in mature trees depending on experimental and site conditions, as well as the tolerance and uptake mechanisms of the different tree species. Fine root Ca/Al was positively related to the soil solution Ca/Al molar ratio. Fine root Ca/Al ratios were related positively to fine root length, growth, specific root length, and biomass, and negatively to root diameter, callose formation, respiration chain activity, starch concentration, and root necromass. A number of relationships have been also found between the fine root Ca/Al and above-ground seedling and/or mature tree growth and nutrient uptake. The critical thresholds for the Ca/Al fine root ratio of 0.2 suggested by Cronan and Grigal (1995) is estimated to represent 90% risk of inverse impact on root and above-ground tree growth. Values of Ca/Al molar ratio in the fine roots of mature trees were only rarely determined below the critical 0.2. The caveats for the use and the interpretation of Ca/Al ratio in fine roots have been addressed in detail. A protocol for root processing and elemental analysis to obtain reliable and comparable results of Ca and Al concentrations in roots is also provided. The article concludes with recommendations for a wider use of the Ca/Al ratio in roots as a bioindicator of Al toxicity to trees in acid soils.

TI  - Class and the changing nature of work: Testing hypotheses of deskilling and convergence among Swedish employees
T2  - WORK EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIETY
LA  - English
KW  - SKILLS
AB  - The changing nature of work is often supposed to be of consequence for interest formation and political alliances between social classes. Three hypotheses are tested: classes converge due to the deskilling of white-collar work or the upskilling of blue-collar work; lower white-collar workers essentially share the conditions of manual workers; the gender dimension cross-cuts the class dimension. Empirical analyses are carried out on the Swedish Level of Living Surveys in 1968, 1974, 1981 and 1991. The major trend is towards an upskilling, though jobs have not become less monotonous. There are signs of class convergence, e.g., in wages and authority, but sharp differences remain. While class divisions exist for both men and women, gender differences within classes are substantial for physical working conditions and market capacity For several indicators, lower white-collar workers are exposed to similar conditions as manual workers while men in thr highest stratum stand out as the consistently most privileged.

AB  - The effect of storage conditions (light, temperature, container types) and time on the quality of natural olive oil from different varieties and Australian regions were studied. The changing quality of the oils was monitored through several physico-chemical methods (free fatty acids, peroxide value, UV-spectrometry (K-232, K-270 and AK), induction time, total polyphenol content, bitterness, pyropheophytin a and 1,2-di-acyl-glycerol content) and sensory analysis over 24 months.
   Pyropheophytins sand 1,2-di-acyl-glycerols criteria showed a very good performance as indicators of overall olive oil quality and freshness as well as highlighting any problems during the storage of the product. Pyropheophytin a has an average increment of 7% per year and the 1,2-di-acyl-glycerols decreases at an average of 23% per year at normal storage conditions over time.

AB  - Oral administration of active pharmaceutical ingredients, nutraceuticals, enzymes or probiotics requires an appropriate delivery system for optimal bioactivity and absorption. The harsh conditions during the gastrointestinal transit can degrade the administered products, hampering their efficacy. Enteric or delayed-release pharmaceutical formulations may help overcome these issues. In a Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem model (SHIME) and using caffeine as a marker for release kinetics and L. acidophilus survivability as an indicator for protection, we compared the performance of ten capsule configurations, single or DUOCAP (R) combinations. The function of L. acidophilus and its impact on the gut microbiota was further tested in three selected capsule types, combinations of DRcaps (R) capsule in DRcaps (R) capsule (DR-in-DR) and DRcaps (R) capsule in Vcaps (R) capsule (DR-in-VC) and single Vcaps (R) Plus capsule under colonic conditions. We found that under stomach and small intestine conditions, DR-in-DR and DR-in-VC led to the best performance both under fed and fasted conditions based on the slow caffeine release and the highest L. acidophilus survivability. The Vcaps (R) Plus capsule however, led to the quickest caffeine and probiotic release. When DR-in-DR, DR-in-VC and single Vcaps (R) Plus capsules were tested through the whole gastrointestinal tract, including under colonic conditions, caffeine release was found to be slower in capsules containing DRcaps (R) capsules compared to the single Vcaps (R) capsules. In addition, colonic survival of L. acidophilus was significantly increased under fasted conditions in DR-in-DR or DR-in-VC formulation compared to Vcaps (R) Plus capsule. To assess the impact of these formulations on the microbial function, acetate, butyrate and propionate as well as ammonia were measured. L. acidophilus released from DR-in-DR or DR-in-VC induced a significant increase in butyrate and a decrease in ammonia, suggesting a proliferation of butyrate-producing bacteria and reduction in ammonia-producing bacteria. These data suggest that L. acidophilus included in DR-in-DR or DR-in-VC reaching the colon is viable and functional, potentially contributing to changes in colonic microbiota composition and diversity.

AB  - The conservation state of buildings is of increasing interest due to the need to renovate aging building stock and provide a safe and healthy place for end users. Numerous uncertain factors have an impact on building condition, including environmental agents, building age, type of assets and maintenance. Previous studies have focused on identifying these factors, but the relationships among them remain unclear. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) approach to develop a model for assessing a building's condition. The BN model is based on an extensive review and evaluation of degradation causal factors supported by an analysis of 1974 defects and 5373 maintenance requests in forty buildings. The model was verified by sensitivity analysis, and the proposed approach was tested on an existing building. The model could be used as a supporting tool to identify renovation strategies that can enhance the conservation state of buildings and constructed assets.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry has been proposed as an indicator of environmental stress and population health. However, a notable feature of research examining the relationship between fluctuating asymmetry and population fitness is that of inconsistency. Logging dramatically alters habitat and has the potential to increase or decrease environmental stress. To evaluate the response of fluctuating asymmetry to logging, I conducted research to determine whether fluctuating asymmetry differs in the frog Crinia signifera captured at logged and unlogged sites and if any differences were correlated with body size or body condition. There was a decrease in fluctuating asymmetry but also a decrease in body size and body condition as a result of logging. I also investigated whether any relationship existed between the subtle asymmetry of individuals and the following indicators of fitness: clutch size, clutch mass, average egg mass, testes size, body size and body condition. There was no significant relationship between subtle asymmetry and the fitness indicators.

AB  - Planners are being called on to prioritize marine shorelines for conservation status and restoration action. This study documents an approach to determining the management strategy most likely to succeed based on current conditions at local and landscape scales. The conceptual framework based in restoration ecology pairs appropriate restoration strategies with sites based on the likelihood of producing long-term resilience given the condition of ecosystem structures and processes at three scales: the shorezone unit (site), the drift cell reach (near-shore marine landscape), and the watershed (terrestrial landscape). The analysis is structured by a conceptual ecosystem model that identifies anthropogenic impacts on targeted ecosystem functions. A scoring system, weighted by geomorphic class, is applied to available spatial data for indicators of stress and function using geographic information systems. This planning tool augments other approaches to prioritizing restoration, including historical conditions and change analysis and ecosystem valuation.

The concentration factors of Cs-137 in, brown shrimp and polychaete species were also investigated under brackish water conditions. At equilibrium, the concentration factors in macroalgae, isopod, fish, brown shrimp and polychate samples were found to be 2.5, 33, 2, 16 and 11 at 16 degreesC in brackish water conditions, respectively. The accumulation rate in macroalgae species was influenced by temperatures between 6 degreesC and 16 degreesC. The bioaccumulation of Cs-137 in, isopods at low salinity regime was increased significantly. At the same time, the bioaccumulation rate in macroalgae species also showed slight increase at low salinity. On the other hand, the bioaccumulation rate of Cs-137 in, the fish species in sea water was higher than in brackish water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Iberia, if current mining projects are grouped by their geographic and metallogenic characteristics, more important similarities appear among them. These refer to economic conditions, applied innovative technologies, environmental sustainability measures and circular economy patterns. The work uses indicators of these four dimensions to evaluate and qualify mining projects in progress and those still under development with sufficient guarantees of viability. The proposed methodology is oriented towards considering groupings of projects that present an appreciable dynamic towards an incipient or developing district "cluster". The assessment (classification) refers to the degree of evolution achieved at present and the near future, which facilitates discussion of the conditions of each grouping. The most economically important base metal region, the Iberian Pyritic Belt (IPB), indicates positive conditions for a successful cluster according to the new methodology implemented. The other, formed by technological metal deposits, is still far from achieving this success.

AB  - The Segura River Basin is one of the most arid and regulated zones in the Mediterranean as well as Europe that includes four hydrologic river types, according to their natural flow regime: main stem rivers, stable streams, seasonal streams and temporary streams. The relationships between flow regime and fluvial and riparian habitats were studied at reference and hydrologically altered sites for each of the four types. Flow regime alteration was assessed using two procedures: (1) an indirect index, derived from variables associated with the main hydrologic pressures in the basin, and (2) reference and altered flow series analyses using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration in Rivers (IAHRIS). Habitats were characterized using the River Habitat Survey (RHS) and its derived Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) score, whereas riparian condition was assessed using the Riparian Quality Index (RQI) and an inventory of riparian native/exotic species. Flow stability and magnitude were identified as the main hydrologic drivers of the stream habitats in the Segura Basin. Hydrologic alterations were similar to those described in other Mediterranean arid and semiarid areas where dams have reduced flow magnitude and variability and produced the inversion of seasonal patterns. Additionally, the Segura Basin presented two general trends: an increase in flow torrentiality in main stems and an increase in temporality in seasonal and temporary streams. With the indirect alteration index, main stems presented the highest degree of hydrologic alteration, which resulted in larger channel dimensions and less macrophytes and mesohabitats. However, according to the hydrologic analyses, the seasonal streams presented the greatest alteration, which was supported by the numerous changes in habitat features. These changes were associated with a larger proportion of uniform banktop vegetation as well as reduced riparian native plant richness and mesohabitat density. Both stream types presented consequent reductions in habitat and riparian quality as the degree of alteration increased. However, stable streams, those least impacted in the basin, and temporary streams, which are subject to great hydrologic stress in reference conditions, showed fewer changes in physical habitat due to hydrologic alteration. This study clarifies the relationships between hydrologic regime and physical habitat in Mediterranean basins. The hydrologic and habitat indicators that respond to human pressures and the thresholds that imply relevant changes in habitat and riparian quality presented here will play a fundamental role in the use of holistic frameworks when developing environmental flows on a regional scale.

AB  - The species composition of the epiphytic benthic foraminiferal fauna was compared at two coastal locations in the Aegean Sea. Samples were collected during August 2001 and July 2003 along the southeastern coast of Andros Island at Korthi Gulf, where there are minimal anthropogenic activities, and at Kastro Gulf, with substantial anthropogenic influence. This study represents the first application of the FORAM Index (FI), which is a single-metric index for water quality originally developed for western Atlantic reef foraminiferal assemblages, to Mediterranean assemblages.
   Multivariate analyses distinguished three clusters of sample sites representing three foraminiferal assemblages. Samples dominated by the mixotrophic species, A. lobifera, were collected primarily from sites along the northern coasts of both gulfs. Characteristics of this assemblage, including relatively high dominance (D=0.27-0.51), lower Shannon-Wiener diversity (H' =1.3-2.1) and high FI (6.6-8.2), all reflect oligotrophic environmental conditions typical of pristine waters of the Aegean Sea. A. lobifera was typically the most common species in the second assemblage, though relative abundances of heterotrophic taxa were higher, resulting in somewhat higher diversity (H' =1.6-2.4) and lower dominance (D = 0.14-0.36). These indices, as well as the FI range of 3.5-7.0 indicated somewhat more prevalent organic carbon resources but still relatively high water quality. This assemblage was found along the southern coast of Korthi Gulf and at more interior sites in northern Kastro Gulf. The third assemblage was dominated by smaller heterotrophic species, including notable proportions of the stress-tolerant taxa Ammonia spp. and Elphidium spp., and had few or no A. lobifera. Diversity (H' =1.4-2.0) and dominance (D = 0.22-0.47) indices were similar to those for the first assemblage, but FI values were much lower (2.0-3.4). Samples characterized by this assemblage were collected only from the southern Kastro Gulf, in the vicinity of the primary sewage outfall.
   The results of this study document the sensitivity of benthic foraminiferal assemblages, and particularly A. lobifera populations, to sewage pollution in the Aegean Sea. These observations are consistent with studies from other biogeographic regions where the FORAM Index, which is based upon this genus and associated mixotrophic taxa, has been used as a water-quality indicator. This observation is particularly noteworthy because A. lobifera is an invasive species in the Mediterranean. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increased aquaculture production has raised concerns about managing protocols to safeguard the welfare of farmed fish, as consumers demand responsible aquaculture practices to provide 'welfare friendly' products. Feeding is one of the largest production cost in a fish farm and can be one of the biggest stressors for fish. Under farming conditions, fish are challenged with artificial diets and feeding regimes, and inadequate feeding conditions cause stress, alteration of normal behavioural patterns, poor performance and eventually diseases and death, which are by no means acceptable neither economically nor ethically. This review aims to highlight the impact of feeding rhythms and feeding time upon physiological and behavioural welfare indicators, which show circadian rhythms as well. Therefore, all these variables should be considered when designing feeding strategies in farming conditions and assessing the welfare state of cultured fish.

AB  - The invertebrate species index (ISI) is a new biotic index to assess stream health in southeast Queensland, Australia, using benthic macroinvertebrates. The index aims to refine stream monitoring, in particular for eutrophication, as nutrient input is a major stressor of streams in the region. Biotic indices previously used for the region were based on sensitivity scores for macroinvertebrate families and orders, and were valid for all streams across the continent. The ISI is based on species level and tailored to the specific traits of southeast Queensland, thus yielding an increased level of detection of biological change. This will improve monitoring of environmental impact on a regional and local scale. The ISI is a site-specific index calculated as the weighted average (WA) of species' sensitivity scores (S-10), with a species-specific indicator weight (W) and the abundance (A) of each species used as weights. S-10 scores for 203 species of benthic macroinvertebrates ranging from 10 (species most sensitive to pollution) to 1 (tolerant of excessive pollution) were derived by means of WA regression and calibration using site scores representing an environmental impact gradient. W measures the indicator strength of the species, and was derived from the weighted standard deviation of the S-10. The initial site scores for the WA modeling were derived using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to ordinate the sites along a gradient associated with 12 abiotic variables. The data on benthic macroinvertebrates are based on 212 quantitative samples collected in wadeable freshwater streams in southeast Queensland. Two major stream types, (1) small creeks, mainly of uplands and (2) larger streams and rivers of lowlands, were recognised for the region, and for both types the ISI range representing reference condition was established. These reference conditions can be used to establish ecological quality ratios by comparing observed to expected indices and to define ecological quality classes. The ISI is the first biotic index for streams in Australia that uses sensitivity scores and indicator weights for macroinvertebrate species. There is a growing trend in Australia to identify stream macroinvertebrates to species level and to study their specific traits and ecological requirements. The reasons for this are manifold; assessing and monitoring stream health is only one of them. For most regions of Australia, no common ground exists, so far, on how to use species data for stream health assessment. The new biotic index fills this gap for southeast Queensland in providing a standard for the use of species level data in stream health assessment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cow Green dam is situated in Northern England on the River Tees in a region with high average wind speeds (24 km h(-1)), low average annual temperatures (circa 5 degrees C) and average rainfall of 1800 mm. The River Tees was impounded by the Cow Green dam in 1970 and early studies revealed significant changes arising from flow regulation. This study compares macroinvertebrate communities in 2004 with those recorded in the first 5 years after impoundment in the Tees and in the unregulated Maize Beck. Nineteen of the 31 common taxa in the regulated sites declined in abundance by a factor of 5 or more. These included Hydra sp., Ancylus fluviatilis, Naididae, Heptagemidae, Leuctridae and Brachycentrus subnubilus. Some taxa, Lymnaea peregra, Epheinerella ignita, Hydroptila sp. increased in numbers, and others Hydropsychidae and Gammarus pulex declined at sites nearest the dam but increased downstream. In Maize Beck there were fewer changes. The changes in faunal communities in the Tees were evident from multivariate analyses where the Tees sites sampled in 2004 were separated from those sampled in the period 1972-1975, as a result of abundance changes in common taxa and the appearance of taxa not previously recorded. Maize Beck in contrast was characterized by few changes in abundance and no new taxa and samples from all years grouped together. The results suggest that the Tees communities have changed since 1975 and are still possibly undergoing change, although without evidence from intervening years this cannot be proved. A narrower range of environmental conditions and increased flow stability have led to a dynamically fragile community (indicated by observed changes in community diversity and abundance) which is very susceptible to perturbations because it has developed in their absence. Periphyton and reservoir plankton play an important role in structuring the faunal composition by creating an environment where biotic interactions are more likely. Increased interaction between components of the faunal community may account for the observed changes since 1975 in the regulated sites in contrast to the situation in the unregulated Maize Beck where there has been little change in faunal community between the original study and the 2004 survey. An unregulated natural flow regime continues to dominate the Maize Beck environment and the variable and unpredictable conditions have resulted in a dynamically robust faunal community.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experiment related to cultivation of red-leaf lettuce type 'Lollo rosso' variety. Tuska' outdoors, in transition to organic production. The experiment has been conducted in field conditions on the premises of the Agricultural University in the region of Plovdiv. During the lettuce growth several variants were tested: 1. NPK (mineral fertilization); 2. Control (non-fertilization); 3. Italpollina; 4. Arkobaleno; 5. LC (Lumbricompost); and 6. Ekoprop NX. The effect of the different organic fertilizers has been studied through the main biometrical parameters. Statistically significant differences have been reported for the most important indicators - fresh mass weight g and number of leaves with highest values observed in variants 6. Ekoprop NX and 4. Arkobaleno. Organic fertilization successfully replaces the fertilization with a combined fertilizer (NPK) under the different hydrothermal conditions of the experimental period.

AB  - In the Ligurian Alps, a wide range of site conditions that influence soil development and may affect humus variability is present. In this work, we wanted to evaluate the potentialities of humus forms as a synthetic indicator of both chemical properties of the humic episola and site conditions in the upper Tanaro Valley (NW Italy). Vegetation affected the C/N ratio of the least transformed organic horizons, but the effect disappeared in mineral ones, where soil pH was related to the parent material. All terrestrial humus forms were found in the area and their distribution well reflected the interactions between vegetation, lithology, elevation that shaped soil properties and affected the degradability of litter and its actual degradation by microorganisms and soil fauna. Humus forms were thus able to capture the ecological conditions, integrating the information provided by soil classifications.

AB  - The paper contains descriptions of methods and laboratory practices for measuring leachability of inorganic substances from waste materials. The test methods include: availability for leaching where an option includes oxidised conditions, equilibrium controlled leaching in batch and column tests and pH influence. Diffusion controlled leaching and lysimeter tests are brief-ly described. The test performances are discussed and exemplified by results from leaching tests on slags and ashes. The results and the discussion stresses the importance of knowing the fundamental test principles for the leaching tests, i.e., equilibrium and diffusion controlled leaching, as well as the need to further clarify the boundary between the application of these two concepts. Further, a test scheme is described for leaching of inorganic substances from waste materials under equilibrium-like conditions. The scheme includes: time-dependent leaching, availability for leaching in the long-term perspective and the influence on the leaching process of ambient conditions such as pH and redox.

AB  - The traditional use of piped systems for stormwater management is increasingly criticized as being unsustainable'. These systems are part of the water domain where much research has focused on sustainable development indicators to support decision-makers in selecting systems that are more sustainable. However, the interest in sustainable development indicators is low. This paper identifies conditions to engage the practitioners to inform their actions in regard to sustainable stormwater management. Empirical evidence has been obtained from interviews with water professionals from Swedish municipalities. The environmental-technical discourse of sustainable stormwater development is a strong barrier in the change process, to the neglect of the social aspects. In the interviews, reframing the discourse was possible in visions of future sustainable stormwater systems embracing green infrastructure. In action, primary conditions can support sustainable pathways in realizing this vision. The paper suggests further incentives for increased implementation of non-structural measures by developing the identified conditions.

AB  - A monitor consists of n identical sensors working independently. Each sensor measures a variate of output or environment of a system, and is activated if a variate is over a threshold specified in advance for each sensor. The monitor alarms if at least k out of n sensors are activated. The performance of the monitor, the probabilities of failure to alarm and false alarming, depends on the number k, the threshold values and the probability distributions of the variate at normal and abnormal states of the system. In this paper, a sufficient condition on the pair of the distributions is given under which the same threshold values for all the sensors are optimal. The condition motivates new orders between probability distributions. Solving an optimization problem an explicit condition is obtained for maximizing or minimizing a symmetric function with the constraint of another symmetric function.

AB  - The profile of acidification has declined markedly in recent years, despite significant impacts remaining across large areas of Europe and North America. While evidence of chemical recovery has been reported, the apparent magnitude of improvements depend on the indicator(s) used, the quality of data and length of time series. Evidence of biological recovery is more elusive and questions remain as to the historical and contemporary effects of forestry on acid impacts and recovery.
   This study uses long term data (1976-2009) of unusually high quality and consistency to assess evidence of chemical and biological recovery in eight streams with contrasting landuse. Streams ranged from highly acidic (median annual pH 4.1) to circum-neutral (pH 7.1). Significant reductions in non-marine sulphate (NM-SO4) concentrations closely followed reported trends in deposition. Reductions in NMSO4 delivered significant increases in pH and ANC, and reductions in toxic inorganic labile aluminium (L-Al). Significant non-linear increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also observed, potentially offsetting some of the improvements in acid status associated with reductions in NM-SO4. Streams draining large areas of mature or 2nd phase forestry were characterised by greater NM-SO4 and L-Al concentrations, and lower pH and ANC than sites with a more modest forestry influence or moorland vegetation. Recovery (reductions in NM-SO4 and L-Al concentrations and increases in pH and ANC) at sites with a strong forestry influence was greater than observed for the moorland catchment. Nonetheless, relative inter-site differences persisted, indicating the continued influence of forestry on hydochemical conditions under contemporary conditions and the legacy of forestry effects from previous decades.
   Invertebrate assemblages showed strong relationships with acidification gradients. Constrained ordination indicated that both spatial differences and temporal trends in community structure were strongly associated with pH (and other correlated variables such as ANC) and L-AL. Despite their geographic proximity, there was complete turnover of species between some of the streams, reflecting differences in acid status. Non-linear temporal trends consistent with ecological recovery from acidification were detected in all streams, regardless of their absolute chemical status.
   Important questions remain as to the most appropriate way to assess biological recovery given the complicated chemical and biological interactions, the often non-linear nature of change, the potential for chemical and biological hysteresis associated with acidification and recovery, and ongoing debates over recovery endpoints. Consequently, the definition of appropriate recovery endpoints required for the management of landuse and freshwaters remains a significant challenge.

AB  - The mountain areas of Austria are major locations for dairy farming in the country. Owing to natural conditions, milk in these areas is produced at considerably higher cost than elsewhere. Nevertheless, structural change in the mountain areas is proceeding at a lower pace, although there is a clear distinction between less and extremely disadvantaged regions. The general result of this analysis is that milk production in Austria will further increase in less disadvantaged mountain areas and decrease in plain areas and extremely disadvantaged mountain areas. Possible strategies for adaptation of particular dairy farms were evaluated using a recursively dynamic single farm model and assuming alternative economic conditions in the future. The analysis and discussion is based on farm indicators and on the overall budgetary situation. Results of the model simulations vary according to the strategies analysed, and the economic benefits of these strategies depend substantially on conditions and circumstances within and outside of the farm.

AB  - The fruticose lichen Ramalina ecklonii (Spreng.) Mey. and Plot was transplanted to 28 biomonitoring sites in Cordoba, Argentina. Pigments, hydroperoxy conjugated dienes, malondialdehyde, soluble protein and sulphur were quantified in the lichen samples. The biomonitoring sites were determined according to different environmental conditions: traffic industries, buildings, trees and altitude.
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) was applied to detect We variation of We pattern on the lichen variables that can be 'best' explained by the environmental Variables considered. The quantified chemical parameters that showed variations were sulphur accumulation, phaeophytin a concentration, soluble protein concentration and the phaeophytin a/chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b/chlorophyll a ratios.
   The biomonitor chemical response was associated with the emission sources in the area, and also with some of the environmental variables such as the presence of trees, buildings and altitude, that affect We spread of pollutants. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - The environmental risk assessment of toxicants is often derived from chemical monitoring, based on single species tests performed in the laboratory. However, to provide ecologically relevant information, community approaches are required. The aim of this study was to causally link prometryn exposure to community-level effects in complex field situations and to identify response times of adaptation to pollution and recovery from pollution. For this reason sensitivity shifts in communities were detected and related to structural changes within the periphyton community. Furthermore, it was intended to illustrate the possibility of a combined approach of community translocation and sensitivity assessment for active monitoring of polluted sites.
   Periphyton was grown at a reference (R) and at a polluted (P) site of the river Elbe basin for 26 days, was subsequently transferred from the polluted site to the reference site and vice versa. Sensitivity of communities to prometryn was determined according to the pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT)-concept in short-term tests by measuring photosynthesis inhibition and was related to structural changes in algal class and diatom species composition. Exposure to prometryn was determined using polar organic integrative samplers (POCIS), giving time-weighted average concentrations.
   Environmental concentrations of prometryn were significantly higher at the polluted site compared to the reference site.
   Communities grown at the polluted site showed a higher tolerance to prometryn in comparison to the reference site. 17 Days after the translocation to the reference site, EC(50) decreased 2-fold compared to the non-translocated P-community of the same age. By contrast, EC(50) of the community grown at the reference site was 5 times higher after 17 days exposure at the polluted site. Furthermore, P-R communities were less sensitive to prometryn (higher EC(50)) than R-P communities, 24 days after translocation. These changes in sensitivity to prometryn were consistent with changes in species composition and clearly indicate that the exposure history of communities is defining the time-response of recovery and adaptation.
   In conclusion, the PICT-concept is shown to be a suitable tool for analysis of recovery and adaptation processes of communities under natural conditions. Therefore, it improves the link between cause and effect in field situations. In situ translocation studies provide an ecological relevant assessment of pesticide effects under field conditions and could be used as a diagnostic tool in active monitoring for decision-making frameworks as used in the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB  - This investigation is an endeavor to propose an innovative indicator in order to eliminate the restrictions of similar indices. The Outdoor Tourism Climate Index (OTCI) elucidates whether or not the combination of different climatic elements, their compatibility with the climate at the travel origin, and the tourist's purpose of traveling is desirable for outdoor tourists, nature-based tourists, and the other tourists who undertake some activities in the open areas. OTCI was calculated for the outdoor tourists traveling from three different travel origins in Iran, including Tabriz, Shiraz, and Bandar Lengeh, to Bandar Abbas. The findings illuminated further accuracy and closeness to the reality of OTCI rather than Tourism Climate Index (TCI). Furthermore, as far as traveling to Bandar Abbas was concerned, the OTCI score of tourists from Bandar Lengeh (with similar climatic conditions to those at Bandar Abbas) was recognized to be higher than those from Shiraz and Tabriz (with more different climatic conditions).

AB  - Habitation conditions significantly affect the physiological and biochemical state of aquatic organisms, including the balance of lipids that performs important functions in cellular metabolism. The lipid and fatty acid profiles of White Sea herring in Dvina, Kandalaksha, and Onega bays, and in the waters of Tersky Shore (the mouth of the Varzuga River) in autumn (after the fattening period) were studied. Different methods-thin-layer, high-performance liquid and gas chromatography-were used for this purpose. Determined heterogeneity on studied parameters of lipid metabolism of fish from different habitats is associated with differences in trophic and hydrological conditions in these bays. Variations of lipid compositions of herring groups can be a reflection of qualitative and quantitative strategies of biochemical adaptations, aimed at compensating the lipid metabolism of fish under different trophic-ecological conditions of habitation in the White Sea.

AB  - The mission of defining animal welfare indicators is methodologically difficult, limited, and possibly impossible. A promising alternative, however, to evaluate suitable environmental conditions is the assessment of play behaviour. In the present review, we summarise the general aspects of play behaviour in nonhuman animals and propose its use as a potential indicator of animal welfare. Play behaviour probably occurs in most vertebrates and some invertebrates, but predominately in mammals. It is also more frequent in young males and is associated with the environmental context in which animals find themselves. Animals play if they are healthy and well-fed, but not if they are under stressful conditions or if they are in a stressful state. We can therefore use the prevalence of play behaviour as an indicator of suitable environmental conditions, considering the specificity associated with the above-mentioned modifying factors.

AB  - The main objective of this research was to identify factors that affected worker productivity, occupational health and safety in selected industries in a developing country. Fifty production managers participated in the study. Fifty-four percent of the managers reported hot environmental conditions, 28% a noisy environment, and 26% a lack of resources and facilities. Managers received worker complaints of fatigue, back pain, upper-body pain, hand and wrist pain and headaches. Management (88%) acknowledged not having knowledge or access to ergonomics information. Ninety-four percent of the companies did not carry out ergonomic assessments. A significant correlation (p < 0.01) was found among productivity indicators and health and organizational attributes. Lack of skills in ergonomics and training, communication and resources are believed to be some of the factors contributing to the poor ergonomic conditions and consequent loss of worker productivity and reduced health and safety in these industries.

AB  - Shigellosis is communicated when the pathogen is swallowed down through the factors like stool or polluted hands with dust. Inappropriate hygienic conditions may reach such clinical manifestations. Shigellosis is frequently originated in crowded places and where hygienic conditions are insufficient and sanitation is poor. Infections easily transmissible from person to person like family members or infected playmates. The disease can easily transmit through infected food handlers with inappropriate hygienic conditions, crops nurturing in contaminated water with sewage line system, swimming in contaminated pool water. Similarly houseflies can also form an important vector for its transmission. In this study, Ecological factors were also the causative indicators for the disease. The issue was the water contamination of the different areas of Karachi mainly the Pehlwan Goth, Safora Goth. Then another area we focused was Patel Para in which Salmonella species were present. Other indicator was the individual-to-individual transfer that was common in Safora Goth.

AB  - Oxidative stability tests were performed on field and laboratory-aged crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE), ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) and polypropylene (PP) insulations using differential scanning calorimetry. Flat films and miniature cables aged in the laboratory were subjected to a wide range of aging conditions that included thermal, electrical and a combination of thermal-electrical aging, in dry and wet environments. The results were analyzed using the Eyring rate theory. It is shown that for a given material the oxidative stability data can be described by a single linear relationship between the activation entropy Delta S and the activation enthalpy Delta H of the oxidative process, and thus are governed by the so called compensation effect. It is argued that the position of a data point representing a certain operating condition of an insulation on the Delta S vs. Delta H compensation plot is a measure of the degree of degradation and can be used as a diagnostic indicator of the operating conditions of the insulation.

AB  - In Simple Minds, Dan Lloyd presents a reductive account of naturally representing machines. The theory entails that a system represents an event by virtue of potentially misrepresenting it whenever the machine satisfies a multiple information channel, convergence, and uptake condition. I argue that Lloyd's conditions are insufficient for systems intrinsically naturally to misrepresent, and hence insufficient for them intrinsically naturally to represent. The appearance of potential misrepresentation in such machines is achieved only by reference to the extrinsic design or extrinsic interpretation or attribution of an intrinsically nonexistent or underdetermined purpose, end, or goal to such devices in identifying an intended object of representation in the system's salient behavior under the uptake condition. The implication is that Lloyd-representation is not intrinsic natural representation in a cognitively relevant sense, and Lloyd's simple 'minds' are not minds but mere machines.

AB  - The amount of waste produced and the control of separate collection are crucial issues for the planning of a territorial Integrated Waste Management System, enabling the allocation of each sorted waste fraction to the proper treatment and recycling processes. The present study focuses on assessing indicators of different waste management systems in areas characterized by different territorial conditions. The investigated case study concerns the municipalities of Emilia Romagna (northern Italy), which present a rather uniform socioeconomic situation, but a variety of geographic, urban and waste management characteristics. A survey of waste generation and collection rates was carried out, and correlated with the different territorial conditions, classifying the municipalities according to altitude and population density. The best environmental performances, in terms of high separate collection rate, were found on average in rural areas in the plain, while the lowest waste generation was associated with rural hill towns.

AB  - Total lipids in anchovy and sprat were measured and interpreted as indicators of their nutritional condition and food supply for the period 2005 to 2010. High lipid content in anchovies suggested that they were able to found sufficient food and favorable environmental condition supporting their stock biomass on a certain level which was strongly limited by heavy fishing. Wide inter-annual fluctuations in anchovy landings could be caused by variability in yearly recruitment and due to shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of the exploited stock. Unlike anchovy, lipid reserves in sprat declined remarkably to the lowest levels recorded during the 50-year observations period. Such a significant worsening in sprat nutritional condition followed the evident warming of the Black Sea and coincided with a sharp decline in sprat catches off Crimea. Thus, the deterioration of food supply together with intensive fishing could have contributed to the reduction of that local sprat stock.

AB  - The relationships between age-specific total lengths, weights, condition factors, and a measure of the thermal opportunity for growth (TOG; calculated as the sum of degree-days greater than 5 degrees C) were estimated for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens from data available for 16 populations spread throughout much of the species' natural range. The TOG explained a significant proportion of the observed variation in length at age irrespective of age. Correlations between weight at age and condition factor improved significantly as lake sturgeon aged, although TOG remained a poor indicator of the differences in condition at age among sturgeon populations. As elsewhere in the literature, declines in length and weight at age occurred at higher latitudes. However, growth rates (mm/degree-day), when adjusted for TOG, showed a significant inverse relationship between growth rates and latitude. The latitudinal countergradient in growth rates partially compensates for reduced growth opportunities in northern populations of lake sturgeon.

AB  - The article discusses the results of breeding Hereford cattle imported from Australia and their several progeny generations in conditions of the Southern Urals. Within three years there was a comprehensive study of clinical medical, hematological, exterior, productive and reproductive indicators of the imported animals in terms of their naturalization to the sharp continental climate. The body temperature, respiratory frequency and heart rate were found to be within reference limits of the physiological standards. An adaptation index was lower. Coefficient and rate of animal adaptability to high and low temperatures demonstrated no sharp stress reactions of animals to the changing living conditions. The received results of morphological and biochemical blood composition of the imported cattle were within the physiological standards. Reproduction quality indicators of the female cattle increased by the third year of acclimatization that proves certain livestock adaptation flexibility. Young cattle of the the first, second and third Russian generation growth and development indicates common adaptation processes of the cattle imported from Australia.

AB  - We compared seasonal shelter selection and social behavior of Mesobuthus gibbosus from autumn to mid-summer in two similar phryganic ecosystems, in continental Greece (near Volos city) and in insular Greece (eastern Crete), and in the laboratory under simulated abiotic conditions. Our results showed that shelter selection is a critical indicator of the seasonal social behavior of the species. The abrupt climatic changes in spring caused a differentiation in shelter selection between the cold period (November-February) and the warm period (March-June) at both sites. Sociality was exhibited only during winter in the field and was more extensive under cold conditions in the laboratory. Co-occurrence of scorpions proved to be age-specific, facilitated by population density and by harsh abiotic conditions during winter, and negatively influenced by intraspecific competition, which was higher in continental Greece. The response of scorpions to changes of abiotic factors reveals synchronization of seasonal shelter selection with climatic changes.

AB  - Water currents are among the strongest environmental variables determining the occurrence and/or abundance of aquatic plants and the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) considers river morphology and current conditions important aspects of reference conditions. We used the database of the Joint Danube Survey JDS-2, organised by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR, Vienna), to assess the relationship between water flow velocity and the occurrence and abundance of aquatic macrophyte to be species along the navigable reach of the Danube River. Species abundance was assessed in accordance with European Standard EN 14184-2003. Flow velocities were assessed close to the plant stands and estimated in 4 classes, worked out in earlier studies in combination with flow meter measurements, which is appropriate for the conditions in this large river. Statistical analysis revealed that only survey units with either no visible flow or those with fast flow were characterised by indicator species with high significance. Still water conditions or barely visible flow (flow class 1) were indicated by Potamogeton friesii, Nitellopsis obtusa and Trapa natans, and by Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton nodosus and Stuckenia pectinata. Lemna minor, indicative for flow class 1 as well, was detected in all the other flow classes, too: in all these cases it established its stands closely intermingled with other aquatic species. For survey units with slow (flow class 2) or intermediate flow (flow class 3). No statistically significant indicator species could be determined. The highest flow velocities (flow class 4) were significantly indicated by Fissidens rufulus, Cinclidotus fontinaloides and Cinclidotus riparius. Occurrence of aquatic mosses was also highly related to the Berger-Parker dominance index in NMDS analysis. In the same analysis, but towards the smallest flow velocities, the majority of vascular species and the Simpson diversity index were closely related. The spectrum of life forms was considerably reduced under medium and high flow velocity conditions. With regard to Simpson species diversity, our analysis indicates an agglomeration of diversity in the Middle Danube reach that includes the Iron Gates impoundment. Our results offer a first look at the macrophyte/water flow relationship of a very large river in Europe, the Danube. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the paper is to present the results of research on the assessing of the ecological-economic efficiency of the implementation of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water (on an example of the specific projects under soil-and-climatic conditions of Kharkiv and Donetsk regions).
   Methodology / approach. The research methodology is based on the use of an interdisciplinary approach. The study used the following methods: monographic (to generalize methodological and practical experience in the use of irrigation projects); laboratory-analytical (to determine the quality indicators of irrigation water); constructive-calculated (for calculating the indicators of economic efficiency of yield growth under irrigation conditions); Monte Carlo method (for simulation of crop yields without irrigation and under irrigation conditions); statistical (analysis of variance) (to assess the reliability of the results); generalizations (to summarize the intermediate and general results of ecological-economic analysis of experimental and model data).
   Results. As a result of laboratory analysis, water quality was assessed, which can be used for irrigation. The advantages of the project of organization of agricultural production under the conditions of drip irrigation are substantiated, and the investment attractiveness of this project was estimated. It is proved that the use of drip irrigation contributes not only to the economic effect, but also to adaptation to climate change. The economic efficiency of irrigation in agriculture, in particular, limited to suitable water (low quality) during the cultivation of various crops, was evaluated. Given the economic assessment, the cultivation of most crops under irrigated conditions with limited suitable water is ineffective.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of the paper is that the provisions on ecological and economic efficiency of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water has been further developed. This is one of the first paper devoted to the economic management of irrigation projects in Ukrainian agriculture in the context of climate change.
   Practical value / implications. The results of the study allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the implementation of drip irrigation projects, taking into account potential economic risks and expected benefits. The results of simulation modeling of crop yields under irrigation conditions can be used by agricultural enterprises to manage project risks.

AB  - High-resolution pollen and dinoflagellate cyst records from sediment core M72/5-25-GC1 were used to reconstruct vegetation dynamics in northern Anatolia and surface conditions of the Black Sea between 64 and 20 ka BP. During this period, the dominance of Artemisia in the pollen record indicates a steppe landscape and arid climate conditions. However, the concomitant presence of temperate arboreal pollen suggests the existence of glacial refugia in northern Anatolia. Long-term glacial vegetation dynamics reveal two major arid phases similar to 64-55 and 40-32 ka BP, and two major humid phases similar to 54-45 and 28-20 ka BP, correlating with higher and lower summer insolation, respectively. Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles are clearly indicated by the 25-GC1 pollen record. Greenland interstadials are characterized by a marked increase in temperate tree pollen, indicating a spread of forests due to warm/wet conditions in northern Anatolia, whereas Greenland stadials reveal cold and arid conditions as indicated by spread of xerophytic biomes. There is evidence for a phase lag of similar to 500 to 1500 yr between initial warming and forest expansion, possibly due to successive changes in atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic sector. The dominance of Pyxidinopsis psilata and Spiniferites cruciformis in the dinocyst record indicates brackish Black Sea conditions during the entire glacial period. The decrease of marine indicators (marine dinocysts, acritarchs) at similar to 54 ka BP and increase of freshwater algae (Pediastrum, Botryococcus) from 32 to 25 ka BP reveals freshening of the Black Sea surface water. This freshening is possibly related to humid phases in the region, to connection between Caspian Sea and Black Sea, to seasonal freshening by floating ice, and/or to closer position of river mouths due to low sea level. In the southern Black Sea, Greenland interstadials are clearly indicated by high dinocyst concentrations and calcium carbonate content, as a result of an increase in primary productivity. Heinrich events show a similar impact on the environment in the northern Anatolia/Black Sea region as Greenland stadials.

AB  - Soil carbon (C) management is identified as a key element of sustainable agriculture, and an increase in nitrogen (N) mineralization rates is expected with an increase in soil C. However, any practical recommendation for using soil C management to substitute the application of synthetic N fertilizer needs to account simultaneously for other important agronomic variables and environmental conditions. For this purpose we investigated the simultaneous impact of soil C management, environmental conditions, and soil structure on N mineralization in two apple orchard systems in Havelock North, New Zealand. One system is an organic orchard using regular compost applications and the other is a neighboring integrated orchard with no external inputs of organic matter. The soil type, texture, and climate are identical in both orchards. We selected different temperatures (10A degrees C, 15A degrees C, and 20A degrees C) and soil moistures (-30, -100, and -300 kPa) as the environmental conditions for N mineralization. Simultaneously, the hot-water extractable C (HWC) contents were measured and served as the indicator for the soil C management of the orchards. To analyze the impact of soil structure, the N mineralization of undisturbed cores was compared with that of disturbed samples. The net N mineralization of the soil in the organic orchard was on average six times higher than that in the integrated orchard. At the same time, in the organic orchard the HWC contents at the beginning of the N mineralization experiment were about two times higher than in the integrated orchard. In a multiple regression as a practical recommendation for the orchards of our case study, we could explain 84% of the variability of N mineralization rates using HWC and environmental conditions as the independent variables. The HWC content was the most significant variable in the multiple regression model and showed that soil C management has a more prominent role than the environmental conditions. Soil C management such as regular compost applications which increase the soil's HWC contents can also be used to manage N mineralization. The significant difference between the undisturbed and disturbed samples showed the soil structure can have an effect on N mineralization.

AB  - We construct a novel index of households' macroeconomic environment (HOME) based on the data from 22 high-income European countries between 2002 Q1 and 2018 Q4. The resulting index is in line with the broad features of the countries' business and financial cycles and captures well households' perception of their underlying economic situation. We discuss joint properties of the HOME index and the widely employed survey-based consumer confidence indicator. We show that households' expectations are tightly linked to current macroeconomic conditions. This finding echoes the literature linking consumer attitudes and actual economic developments. The HOME index also reflects the importance of asset prices and lending conditions for households' behavior. In a single-country case study, we provide empirical evidence that links the proposed index to new credit extended to households. The evidence suggests that households need a longer period of good macroeconomic conditions to decide to take on a mortgage than they do in the case of a consumer loan.

AB  - Our study proposes a novel virtual mapping method to define reference conditions in a water body that is assumed to be not affected by human activities. We applied a modified PolFlow model, a raster-GIS analysis tool, to the Lake Peipsi basin. Running 'reference conditions' scenario revealed that the mean annual reference load comprised 225 t (31%) of phosphorus while the remaining 498 t (69%) originated from anthropogenic sources. Of the total reference load, 77 t (34%) originated from the Estonian part of the catchment, while the remaining 148 t (66%) came from Russia. High variability appeared in key factors that determine the P load to the lake in Estonia and Russia. The management measures in Estonia should prioritize land use issues, such as a reduction of diffuse emissions from agriculture. In contrast, the short-term Russian policy should focus on improved municipal and industrial waste-water treatment.

AB  - The present study was conducted to provide basic information on the physiological damages (mucosal indicators) of Round Goby under laboratory and environmental conditions of lead contamination. The other goal was to find mucosal biomarkers of lead contamination in the Gulf of Gorgan. In the laboratory study, 400 pieces of fish with an average the weight of 35 +/- 7.16 g were caught alive and were exposed to lead concentrations of 0, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg / l for 14 days. Once the experiment was completed, the samples of mucus and liver were collected from the fish samples with the samples being surveyed by analyses of SDS-PAGE, mucus safety and toxicology. In the field test, the samples of fish, water, and sediment were prepared from four stations. In addition to measuring the lead in water, sediment and liver tissue, the samples of mucus from the caught fish were similarly analyzed under the laboratory conditions mentioned. According to the results under laboratory conditions, obvious differences were observed between the protein pattern of samples of treatment with the control group. Further, among innate immune parameters of the mucus, only lysozyme showed a significant correlation with the concentrations of lead accumulated in the liver of Round Goby (P < 0.05). Under environmental conditions, obvious differences were also observed between the protein pattern of samples of contaminated stations with the control station. Further, among innate immune parameters of the mucus, lysozyme indicated a positive correlation while alkaline phosphatase showed a negative correlation with lead contamination in the liver of Round Goby (P < 0.05). In total, in the pattern of mucus protein, the intensity of the band within the range of 25 kDa was enhanced in both conditions, suggesting the presence of proteases in this region. Also, among the immune parameters, lysozyme enzyme showed a significant and positive correlation with liver lead contamination in both conditions (P < 0.05). These can be considered as the biomarkers of protein pattern and safety in Round Goby mucus for assessing lead pollution in Gulf of Gorgan.

AB  - A central issue of community ecology is finding rules that explain the composition and abundance of coexisting species. Nowadays two main processes, environmental filtering and limiting similarity, are thought to play the main roles in structuring communities. Their relative importance under different environmental conditions, however, is still not properly clarified. We studied the strength and the effect of environmental filtering (causing convergence) and limiting similarity (causing divergence) in 137 sample plots along an extremely long environmental gradient ranging from open sand grasslands to highly productive marshes, using a trait-based approach. The main environmental gradient (i.e. productivity) was characterized by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, an indicator of above-ground live biomass. Cover of the plant species was estimated visually. Values of 11 plant traits were collected from field measurements and data bases. Mean and dispersion of the trait values of the plots were quantified by community-weighted means and Rao's quadratic entropy. Trait convergence and divergence were tested by randomization tests, followed by the study of changes in effect size along the productivity gradient by fitting generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). For vegetative traits we found mainly convergence, indicating the filtering effect of environmental constraints, while traits related to regeneration showed divergence. The strength of convergence in vegetative traits generally decreased as productivity grew, indicating that while under harsh conditions environmental constraints strongly limit the possible trait values, under more benign conditions various water and nutrient use strategies are adaptable. At high productivity, the strength of divergence in regenerative traits decreased. Since the larger diversity of vegetative traits found here reduces competition, the importance of diverse reproductive strategy is probably lower.Synthesis. Our results partly support the stress-dominance hypothesis, but reveal that assembly rules are more complex. The relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity depends on the trait and on the environmental conditions of the habitat. Traits related to resource use are generally limited by environmental filtering, and this restriction is weakening as conditions become more favourable, while traits related to regeneration are constrained by limiting similarity and are more diverse under harsh conditions.

AB  - The operation of a power transformer On-Load Tap-Changer (OLTC) produces a well-defined series of vibration bursts as its signature. Due to the harmonic and nonstationary nature of the transient vibration signal, traditional frequency and time-frequency techniques are on longer effective for characterization of this type of vibration signals, as the localized time domain features, such as delays between bursts, the number of bursts, and the strengths of bursts, are essential for the condition assessment of OLTC. A wavelet transform based technique is developed in this paper to characterize the OLTC vibration signals. This technique gives a simplified format for displaying and representing the essential features of the OLTC vibration signatures, Application results from a selector ta pe OLTC demonstrate that the features extracted in the wavelet domain can be utilized to provide reliable indications of the actual heath of an OLTC.

AB  - The use of biostimulants with plant growth-promoting properties, but without significant input of nutrients, is discussed as a strategy to increase stress resistance and nutrient use efficiency of crops. However, limited reproducibility under real production conditions remains a major challenge. The use of combination products based on microbial and non-microbial biostimulants or microbial consortia, with the aim to exploit complementary or synergistic interactions and increase the flexibility of responses under different environmental conditions, is discussed as a potential strategy to overcome this problem. This study aimed at comparing the efficiency of selected microbial single-strain inoculants with proven plant-growth promoting potential versus consortium products under real production conditions in large-scale tomato cultivation systems, exposed to different environmental challenges. In a protected greenhouse production system at Timisoara, Romania, with composted cow manure, guano, hair-, and feather-meals as major fertilizers, different fungal and bacterial single-strain inoculants, as well as microbial consortium products, showed very similar beneficial responses. Nursery performance, fruit setting, fruit size distribution, seasonal yield share, and cumulative yield (39-84% as compared to the control) were significantly improved over two growing periods. By contrast, superior performance of the microbial consortia products (MCPs) was recorded under more challenging environmental conditions in an open-field drip-fertigated tomato production system in the Negev desert, Israel with mineral fertilization on a high pH (7.9), low fertility, and sandy soil. This was reflected by improved phosphate (P) acquisition, a stimulation of vegetative shoot biomass production and increased final fruit yield under conditions of limited P supply. Moreover, MCP inoculation was associated with selective changes of the rhizosphere-bacterial community structure particularly with respect to Sphingobacteriia and Flavobacteria, reported as salinity indicators and drought stress protectants. Phosphate limitation reduced the diversity of bacterial populations at the root surface (rhizoplane) and this effect was reverted by MCP inoculation, reflecting the improved P status of the plants. The results support the hypothesis that the use of microbial consortia can increase the efficiency and reproducibility of BS-assisted strategies for crop production, particularly under challenging environmental conditions.

AB  - Crop rotations induce changes in yield production and in properties of topsoil. In a typical Mediterranean topsoil in southern Italy, 6-year durum wheat-forage rotation experiments were conducted from 1991 to 1996 under different water regimes to ascertain the effect of rotations on crop yield and soil properties. The following rotations were investigated under irrigated and tainted treatments: 6-year continuous wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) (cW), wheat after 3 year of meadow (AW), meadow after 3 year continuous wheat (WA), wheat after 3 year of continuous annual binary mixture (BW) and annual binary mixture after 3 year continuous wheat (WB). After 6 years of cropping, was investigated the effect of rotations and irrigation on biochemical soil parameters (organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-tot), microbial biomass (B-c), soil respiration (SR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDAH), acid and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (respectively, acP and all?) and arylsulfatase (aryS)). Irrigation increased the dry biomass yield of all crops by 31.6%. Dry biomass of rotation AW and BW was, respectively, 18.8% and 8.8% higher than cW under irrigation and 17.1% and 12.9% higher under rainfed condition. Cereal grain yield under irrigation was 30.4%, 25.8% and 25.6% higher than rotations cW, AW and BW, respectively, for the rainfed condition. The results indicated that cW in comparison to AW and BW, under both irrigated conditions, stressed all biochemical compounds. In other crop rotations, irrigation over rainfed reduced the content of Corg, Ntot and B, in the soil. The relationships between biochemical and enzyme compounds under irrigated condition presented higher number of statistical significant r-values than rainfed. Significant correlations of all? and FDAH parameters with wheat dry matter under both condition of irrigation. The WA and WB rotations increased biochemical parameters under both irrigated conditions. The large amount of biochemical compounds of the WA and WB rotation left in the soil enhance aerial crop yields and not reduced the content of C-org parameter, in the durum wheat cultivation in Mediterranean environment.

AB  - With different cage-free (CF) housing styles and management schemes, retailers have developed their own CF criteria. One highly debated aspect is if hens may be kept inside the system for part of the day-during the first few hours after lights-on. Research is lacking regarding the impacts of such a practice on hen welfare, incidence of eggs laid on the litter floor, litter condition, and air quality. This 14-mo field study was conducted to help assess such impacts. Hens (Dekalb White) in an aviary house (50,000-hen nominal capacity) were allowed to have full litter access (FLA) vs. part-time litter access (PLA) from 10: 50 am to 9: 00 pm, coupled with the absence or presence of experienced hens (1.5% of the population), hence a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The measured variables included a) incidence of floor eggs, b) percentage of birds remaining on litter floor at night, c) mortality, d) body weight (BW) and BW uniformity, e) litter condition (depth, moisture content, texture, amount removed, and bacteria concentration), f) environmental conditions, and g) welfare conditions (10 variables). Compared to FLA, PLA had a significantly lower incidence of floor eggs (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 12.6 +/- 1.1 eggs per hen housed as of 76 weeks of age (WOA), i.e., approximately 89% reduction), less manure deposition on the floor (0.53 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.04 kg/100 hens/d, dry basis, i.e., approximately 50% reduction), and lower ammonia concentrations due to drier litter (averaging 22% lower). Inclusion of 1.5% experienced hens in the young flock did not show benefit of reducing the incidence of floor eggs (P = 0.48). The percentage of hens remaining on the floor at night was low (< 0.01%) in all cases from 24 WOA onward. No differences were detected between FLA and PLA in hen welfare conditions, mortality, BW, BW uniformity, bacteria concentration in the litter, air temperature, or relative humidity.

This study assessed the effect of feed restriction on growing pigs submitted to a moderate inflammatory challenge induced by the degradation of the environmental hygiene that is known to alter growth rate. The experiment was run on 80 pigs selected at 7 weeks of age according to a 2 x 2 factorial design: two feeding levels, ad libitum (AL) and feed restricted (FR) at 60% of AL, and two conditions of environmental hygiene, clean and dirty. Pigs were housed individually throughout the experiment. From 61 to 68 days of age (day 0 to 7), pigs were housed in a post weaning unit and feed restriction was applied to half of the pigs from day 0 to day 29. At 68 days of age (day 7 of the experiment), pigs were transferred in a growing unit where half of FR and half of AL pigs were housed in a dirty environment (poor hygiene) and the other half in a clean environment (good hygiene) until day 42. Growth performance was recorded weekly. Blood and faeces samples were collected to measure indicators of inflammation, nutrient digestibility and microbiota composition. Faecal consistency was monitored daily to detect diarrhoeas. Feed restriction decreased daily weight gain (-35% to -50%, P <0.001), increased the feed conversion ratio (+15%, P <0.001) and CP digestibility (+3%, P <0.05) and reduced the occurrence of diarrhoeas irrespective of hygiene conditions. Poor hygiene conditions decreased growth performance (-20%, P <0.05) and total tract digestibility of all nutrients (P <0.001). Haptoglobin (+50%) concentrations and lymphocyte (+10%) and granulocyte (+40%) numbers were higher in poor hygiene conditions (P <0.05), confirming that the model was effective to induce a systemic inflammatory response. Both feed restriction and hygiene modified the profile of the faecal microbiota. In this study, feed restriction did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response caused by poor hygiene conditions despite the limitation of the occurrence of digestive disorders. However, our study opens discussions regarding the impact of hygiene and feed restriction on gut microbial communities and digestive health.

AB  - Disability as a health outcome deserves more attention than it has so far received. With people living longer and the epidemiological transition from infectious to noncommunicable diseases as the major cause of health burden, we need to focus attention on disability - the non-fatal impact of heath conditions - over and above our concern for causes of mortality.
   With the first Global Burden of Disease study, WHO provided a metric that enabled the comparison of the impact of diseases, drawing on a model of disability that focused on decrements of health. This model has since been elaborated in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as being either a feature of the individual or arising out of the interaction between the individual's health condition and contextual factors. The basis of WHO's ongoing work is a set of principles: that disability is a universal human experience; that disability is not determined solely by the underlying health condition or predicated merely on the presence of specific health conditions; and finally, that disability lies on a continuum from no to complete disability. To determine whether interventions at individual or population levels are effective, an approach to disability measurement that allows for an appropriate and fair comparison across health conditions is needed. WHO has designed the Model Disability Survey (MDS) to collect information relevant to understand the lived experience of disability, including the person's capacity to perform tasks actions in daily life, their actual performance, the barriers and facilitators in the environment they experience, and their health conditions. As disability gains prominence within the development agenda in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the MDS will provide the data to monitor the progress of countries on meeting their obligations. The lesson learned from WHO's activities is that disability is a universal human experience, in the sense that everyone can be placed on a continuum of functioning and either currently experiences or is vulnerable to experiencing disability over the course of their lives. This understanding of disability is the key to mainstreaming disability within the public discourse.

AB  - In this paper, the central Pacific cold event of 2008 and its exceptionally warm conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific are analyzed by using rainfall data of south Ecuadorian meteorological stations, sea surface temperatures in the El Nino3 and 1+2 regions, and simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. It can be shown that El Nino-like rainfall conditions with severe inundations occur particularly in the coastal plains of southern Ecuador while a central Pacific cold event prevails. In contrary to previous situations, positive rainfall anomalies as a result of El Nino-like conditions in the El Nitiol +2 region during the 2008 La Nina event occurred in both regions, the coastal plains and the highlands, for the first time. A detailed analysis of the ocean-atmosphere system during episodes of heavy rainfall reveals typical El Nino circulation and rainfall patterns as observed during previous El Nino events for the coastal area and La Nina-like conditions for the highlands. The spreading of Pacific instability in the Nino1+2 region to the eastern escarpment of the Andes could be the result of a temporary eastward shift of the Walker circulation. The unusual combination of El Nib-like conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific during a La Nina state in the central Pacific is the newest indicator for an impact mode shift regarding severe rainfall anomalies during El Nino/La Nina events in the traditional El Nino area of southern Ecuador since the end of the last century Since 2000, El Nino events unexpectedly provide below average rainfall while central Pacific La Nina conditions generate exceptional severe flooding in the normally drier coastal plains. The novel sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly dipole structure between the eastern and central/western tropical Pacific and the weakening of El Nino events since 2000 could be due to natural decadal oscillations in the El Nino background state, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). However, the observed atmospheric patterns and the recent increase of the SST anomaly difference between the central and the eastern tropical Pacific resemble structures that also result from climate change simulations.

AB  - Changes in habitat extent as well as landscape and habitat structure are often caused by human pressure within protected areas and at their boundaries, with consequences for biodiversity and species distributions. Thus quantitative spatial information on landscape mosaic arrangements is essential, for monitoring for nature conservation, as also specified by frameworks such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the European Union's Habitat Directive. While measuring habitat extent is a relatively straightforward task, approaches for measuring habitat fragmentation are debated. This research aims to delineate a framework that enables the integration of different approaches to select a set of site- and scale-specific indices and synthetic descriptors and develop a comprehensive quantitative assessment of variations in human impact on the landscape, through assessment of habitat spatial patterns, which can be used as a baseline for monitoring. This framework is based on the use of established methodologies and free software, and can thus be widely applied across sites. For each landscape and observation scale, the framework permits the identification of the most relevant indices, and appropriate parameters for their computation. We illustrate the use of this framework through a case study in a protected area in Italy, to indicate that integrated information from multiple approaches can provide a more complete understanding of landscape and habitat spatial pattern, especially related to locations experiencing disturbance and pressure. First, identification of a parsimonious set of traditional LPIs for a specific landscape and spatial scale provides insights on the relation between landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation. These can be used for both change assessment and ranking of different sections of the study area according to a fragmentation gradient in relation to matrix quality. Second, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), provides a pixel based structural characterisation of the landscape. Third, compositional characterisation of the landscape at the pixel level is provided by landscape mosaic analysis. These three approaches provide quantitative assessments through indices which can be used singly or in combination to derive three synthetic descriptors for a comprehensive quantitative baseline representation of landscape structure that can be used for monitoring: the first descriptor, landscape diversity profiling, based on the output of landscape mosaic analysis, at the landscape level, complements the evaluation which at the pixel level can be obtained by more complex modelling; the second descriptor, obtained combining of the outputs of MSPA and the landscape mosaic analysis, informs on the local structural pattern gradient across the landscape space; the third descriptor, derived from the integration of selected LPIs and those derived from MSPA into a discontinuities detection procedure, allows for the identification of "critical points" of transitions in management where threats to biodiversity and ecosystems integrity may be likely. The framework developed has significant potential to capture information on major landscape structural features, identify problematic areas of increased fragmentation that can be used to prioritise research, monitoring and intervention, and provide early warning signals for immediate response to pressures increasing habitat fragmentation, with the goal of facilitating more effective management.

AB  - The end-Ordovician (Hirnantian) crisis is the first globally distinct extinction during the Phanerozoic, but its causes are still not fully known. Here, we present an integrated geochemical and petrographic analysis to understand the sedimentary conditions taking place before, during and after the Late Ordovician ice age. New data from the Zbrza (Holy Cross Mountains) and Goldap (Baltic Depression) boreholes shows that, like in other worldwide sections, the total organic carbon (TOC) content is elevated in the upper Katian and uppermost Hirnantian to Rhudannian black shales, but depleted (below 1%) during most of the Hirnantian. Euxinic conditions occurred in the photic zone in both TOC-rich intervals. This is based on the maleimide distribution, occurrence of aryl isoprenoids and isorenieratane, as well as a dominance of tiny pyrite framboids. Euxinic conditions were interrupted by the Hirnantian regression caused by glaciation. Sedimentation on the deep shelf changed to aerobic probably due to intense thermohaline circulation. Euxinia in the water column occurred directly during the time associated with the second pulse of the mass extinction with a termination of the end-Ordovician glaciation and sea level rise just at the Ordovician/Silurian (O/S) boundary. In contrast, we suggest based on inorganic proxies that bottom water conditions were generally oxic to dysoxic due to upwelling in the Rheic Ocean. The only episode of seafloor anoxia in the Zbrza basin was found at the O/S boundary, where all inorganic indicators showed elevated values typical for anoxia (U/Th > 1.25; V/Cr > 4.25; V/(V + Ni): 0.54-0.82 and Mo > 10-25 ppm). Significant differences in hopanes to steranes ratio and in C-27-C-29 sterane distribution between the Katian, Rhudannian and Hirnantian deposits indicate changes in marine microbial communities triggered by sharp climate change and Gondwana glaciation. The increase from biomarkers of cyanobacteria (2 alpha-methylhopanes) after the O/S boundary implied enhanced microbial activity following the mass extinction event. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Living and detrital biomass in a riparian buffer zones ameliorate diffuse-source pollution originating from adjacent landscapes, with higher nutrient removal potential, particularly with respect to nitrogen and sediments, associated with more biomass (i.e., older forests). Pollution removal is mediated by sediment trapping and uptake of nitrogen by plants and by denitrification by microbial communities in root zones using organic matter and root exudates as energy sources. However, as a consequence of various land management activities, the amount of biomass of most forest riparian zones is much lower than its potential, which is mature forest. This makes restoration of riparian buffer zones to mature forest an ideal way to both improve water quality and increase carbon sequestration. This study measures the amount of biomass aboveground and in soils for a variety of common, age-related condition-types associated with riparian buffer zones along low order (headwater) streams in agricultural landscapes of Coastal Plain North Carolina. The data are used to determine pollution removal potential in relation to stand age and distance from channel and a basis for developing an indicator of riparian condition. Mean biomass for common riparian cover types were Mature Forest (>50 y old): 483 Mg/ha; Young Forest (25-50 y old): 257 Mg/ha; Regenerating Forest (5-25 y old): 205 Mg/ha; recently Harvested Forest (0-5 y old): 165 Mg/ha; Perennial Herb: 67 Mg/ha; Shrub/Sapling: 63 Mg/ha; and Annual Rowcrop: 36 Mg/ha. Trees contained >96% of all aboveground biomass and >58% of total biomass present in the forested conditions. Biomass in recently harvested forests were >97% detrital, mostly due to the large amount of slash left after harvesting and the mostly intact soil organic matter. Most (>80%) of the biomass in non-forest cover types was stored in the detrital pool. By partitioning the riparian zone into inverse distance-weighted subzones based on distance from stream channel, we developed an indicator for determining riparian condition based on both biomass and proximity of biomass to channel.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is a useful indicator of plant photosynthesis and stress conditions. ChlF spectra can be simulated with the Fluspect model, which is a radiative transfer model that simulates leaf reflectance, transmittance, and fluorescence; however, it has never been used or validated under natural conditions. In this paper, a new fluorescence quantum yield efficiency of photosystem (FQE) retrieval method based on the Fluspect model is proposed for use in simulating ChlF in two healthy varieties of soybeans grown under natural conditions. The parameters, Chlorophyll a + b content (C-ab), carotenoid (C-ca), dry matter content (C-dm), indicator of leaf water content (C-w) and leaf mesophyll structure (N) and the simulated fluorescence from the experiment were compared with the measured values to validate the model under natural conditions. The results show a good correlation (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.7-0.9) with the measured data at wavelengths of 650-880 nm. However, there is a large relative error (RE) that extends up to 150% at the peak of the fluorescence curve. To improve the accuracy of the simulation, an inversion code containing the emission efficiency parameters for photosystems I and II was added, which retrieves FQE I and II from the measured fluorescence spectra. The evaluation results for all wavelengths and two peaks demonstrated a significant reduction in the error at the peak of the curve by the Fluspect model with the FQE inversion code. This new method reduced the overestimation of fluorescence from 150% to 20% for the RE, and the R-2 value was higher than 0.9 at the spectra peaks. Additionally, the original plant parameter information remained mostly unchanged upon the addition of the inversion code.

AB  - Fly ash from coal combustion contains trace elements which, on disposal or utilisation, may leach out, and therefore be a potential environmental hazard. Environmental conditions have a great impact on the mobility of fly ash constituents as well as the physical and chemical properties of the fly ash. Existing standard leaching methods have been shown to be inadequate by not representing possible disposal or utilisation scenarios. These tests are often criticised on the grounds that the results estimated are not reliable as they are not able to be extrapolated to the application scenario. In order to simulate leaching behaviour of fly ash in different environmental conditions and to reduce deviation between measurements in the fields and the laboratories, it is vital to study sensitivity of the fly ash constituents of interest to major factors controlling leachability. pH, liquid-to-solid ratio, leaching time, leachant type and redox potential are parameters affecting stability of elements in the fly ash. Sensitivity of trace elements to pH and liquid to solid ratio (as two major overriding factors) has been examined. Elements have been classified on the basis of their leaching behaviour under different conditions. Results from this study have been used to identify leaching mechanisms. Also the fly ash has been examined under different standard batch leaching tests in order to evaluate and to compare these tests. A Leaching Test Framework has been devised for assessing the stability of trace elements from fly ashes in different environments. This Framework assists in designing more realistic batch leaching tests appropriate to field conditions and can support the development of regulations and protocols for the management and disposal of coal combustion by-products or other solid wastes of environmental concern..

AB  - The conditioning parameters used to obtain silver-modified clinoptilolite-rich tuffs and the characterization as well as the bactericidal activity behavior of these zeolitic materials were investigated, choosing Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) as an indicator of fecal contamination of water. Natural zeolites (clinoptilolite type) with a grain size between 1.68-1.41 and 0.71-0.60 mm were conditioned with 0.01, 0.1 and 0.3 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) solutions at room temperature in static contact or under reflux, manipulated in darkness or visible light and reduced by exposure to gamma-irradiation or contact with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was also considered. The experimental data were fitted to Chick's model to estimate the disinfection kinetics and to Higuchi's model to evaluate the release of silver (Ag) from the modified zeolitic materials. The results showed the presence of Ag in different chemical species, Ag+ and nanoparticles of silver (NpsAg) in the zeolite crystalline network, and their concentrations were variable. It was found that the Escherichia coli inhibition rate depends on Ag release from the silver-modified zeolite-rich tuffs, which is related to the sites that are occupied by the metallic ion in the zeolite network. In general, the silver-modified zeolite-rich tuffs conditioned at room temperature in static contact presented the highest bacterial inhibition rate. Under these experimental conditions the total mortality of Escherichia coli was observed in a shorter time compared with that of the other silver-modified zeolitic materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes in structure and function of coral reefs are increasingly significant and few sites in the Caribbean can tolerate local and global stress factors. Therefore, we assessed coral reef condition indicators in reefs within and outside of MPAs in the southeastern Dominican Republic, considering benthic cover as well as the composition, diversity, recruitment, mortality, bleaching, the conservation status and evolutionary distinctiveness of coral species. In general, we found that reef condition indicators (coral and benthic cover, recruitment, bleaching, and mortality) within the MPAs showed better conditions than in the unprotected area (Boca Chica). Although the comparison between the Boca Chica area and the MPAs may present some spatial imbalance, these zones were chosen for the purpose of making a comparison with a previous baseline presented. In actuality these indicators found in the MPAs have improved when compared to results from previous reports (2001) in the same reefs and others in the Caribbean. Additionally, we found no evidence of massive bleaching during the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of 2015. Reef-building species belonging to Orbicella species complex dominate MPAs, while small colonies of Pseudodiploria strigosa and Siderastrea siderea with low structural complexity dominate the unprotected sites. Key findings include the potential offered by MPAs as a network; our results show that a combination of MPAs protect the variation in diversity and promote the conservation of coral while maintaining historical evolution traits. This study offers an evaluation framework that considers multiple aspects of relevance in the conservation of Caribbean coral reefs, presenting a baseline of ecological indicators in the southeastern region of the Dominican Republic. It also recognizes some protected reefs in this region that can be designated as places of hope, with excellent conditions in the coral community. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - monitoring
AB  - Up-to-date, reliable information on the type, extent and condition of vegetation is increasingly required at a range of scales for a range of policy, regulation and management purposes. This paper describes the development of national level vegetation information frameworks for mapping vegetation across Australia. Vegetation mapping and monitoring in Australia have historically been the responsibility of state governments. In the late 1980s, the Australian and State and Territory governments developed the National Forest Inventory to facilitate the collection and availability of contemporary, valid and standardised forest data to assist in the planning and management for the conservation and use of Australia's forests. The National Vegetation Information System framework (ESCAVI, 2003) expanded this concept for compiling vegetation structure and floristic information for entire landscapes. The National Vegetation Information System framework has recently been used to inteorate data from a range of sources to provide a whole-of-landscape view of vegetation, including native, non-native and non-vegetation land covers.
   Map compilation approaches to vegetation assessment provide only one form of information required for policy, regulation or management decisions. Compiling and updating such snapshots of Australia's vegetation cover provide little, if any, information on the condition of the vegetation. Differences between repeated snapshots through time using this approach are often the result of differences in classification approaches or mapping technologies rather than actual chances in the structure and/or floristics of the vegetation. It is argued that efficient assessment of change in vegetation condition requires repeated measurements of condition indicators at the same sites over time. We present a continental forest monitoring framework design concept to address this concern. Issues that need to be addressed relating to monitoring framework data and map-based information are also discussed in the context of adaptive management for improved natural resource management.

AB  - The purpose of the work was the need to study the change in weight and hematological indicators of the rats as a reaction-response to being in difficult and unfavorable experimental conditions. The biological experiment was conducted in compliance with the normative conditions of keeping the rats, in accordance with ethical standards and recommendations for humanization of work with laboratory animals. In order to accomplish these tasks, rats were divided into two groups: control rats were housed in a spacious cage with comfortable living conditions and experimental animals were housed in a small cage with limited ability to move freely. For the purity of the experiment, the feed ration of animals of two groups was the same. Weight and hematological indicators were determined by conventional methods in physiology. It has been found that improper housing conditions, causing a stressful situation adversely affect the eating activity of the test animals, which explains the weak correlation of the dynamics of the weight of the animals in the control and experimental groups. The analysis of the absolute mass of the internal organs of rats showed their direct dependence on body weight and the correlation of these parameters between animals of both groups. The study found that the quantitative ratios of the main hematological parameters of each of the rodents are strictly different. The tendency to increase of the investigated parameters in the experimental group in comparison with the control one is symptomatic and can be explained by sympathetic-vegetative influences. The amount of hemoglobin is directly correlated with the number of red blood cells. Comparison of the content of hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes with body weight showed inversely proportional relationship between them. The persistent predominance of leukocytes in the blood of rats in both groups is likely to genetically determined.

AB  - Hardness is one of the most important factors in water chemistry as it affects fish physiology and metal toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate osmoregulatory responses in the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloncus exposed to copper and cadmium (1.0 mu g/mL) in soft water (SW) (hardness 80 mg CaCO3/L and conductivity 1.77 mS/cm) and hard water (HW) (hardness 320 mg CaCO3/L and conductivity 5.80 mS/cm) for 0, 1, 7 and 14 days. Following the exposures, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, ion and Cu levels in the gill, kidney and intestine were measured. There was no fish mortality within 14 days, except Cu exposure in SW which killed all fish between 8 and 12 days. Generally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity was altered by both metal exposures in the gill and kidney as it increased in HW condition, but decreased in SW condition. There were also alterations in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the intestine as its activity generally decreased. Data, in general, showed that Cd was more effective on Na+/K+-ATPase activity comparing to Cu. However, ion levels altered mainly in the kidney and intestine. Tissue metal accumulation was higher in fish tissues from SW condition comparing to HW condition. Data represented here showed that the effects of metals differed in differing water hardness. This suggests that special attention should be paid to the water chemistry when natural monitoring studies are carried out. This study also suggests that the response of osmoregulation system of fish may be a sensitive indicator under stressful conditions in different natural waters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The practice of palmiped overfeeding consists of introducing a tube (embuc) into the an imals'oesophagus to deposit increasing quantities of feed in order to produce "foie gras": This practice is being questioned and strongly contested by animal welfare organisations, and a part of society. However, in the absence of an effective alternative, it remains the only way to produce "foie gras", a product to which a majority of French people remain attached. This summary places "foie gras" production within the context of societal issues surrounding animal welfare and reviews scientific data on the impact of overfeeding in the broad sense ("embuc" introduction, feed load, housing) on various indicators of animal's condition. In particular, it appears that i) overfeeding and liver hypertrophy are probably not nociceptive under normal overfeeding conditions; ii) animals are sensitive to capture and restraint; iii) liver function and histological structure are preserved and liver hypertrophy is reversible; iv) overfeeding induces behavioral changes: increased occurrence of drinking and panting without appearance of hypoxia; decreased occurrence of grooming; v) these behaviors also vary according to climatic conditions and housing configuration; vi) overfeeding can generate specific injuries (esophageal injury) when it is poorly performed and housing conditions of animals tend to aggravate pre-existing injuries (leg lesions); and vii) mortality rate increases during overfeeding. This article also reviews the knowledge and resources available to develop a method that would enable a multi-criteria assessment of the animal state, adapted to palmipeds during the overfeeding period, and that could be used on farms. Such an evaluation would make it possible to assess objectively the state of comfort or discomfort of animals and to support the "foie gras" production chain in a process of progress.

AB  - Objective
   The objective of this study was to verify whether the inclusion of professionals who completed a specialized distance learning course in family health teams is associated with rates of hospitalization for primary healthcare-sensitive conditions and better monitoring of chronic conditions in municipalities within the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
   Methods
   Negative binomial regression models with fixed effects were used for the 79 municipalities in the state, with repeated observations for the selected years (2009-2015). For our reference, the parameter "Municipality Ratio" was the number of professionals who completed the course divided by the total number of PHC professionals in the municipality. This ratio has been cumulative over the years. No reference values were found in the scientific literature, so three cutoff points were used for tertile distribution: T3:high (0.35-1.00), T2:intermediate (0.02-0.33), and T1:Low (0.00-0.01). In order to avoid capturing biased results, the analysis was also performed for the years before the specialization course was offered (2009 and 2010).
   Results
   Indicators of the share of hospitalizations for primary care-sensitive conditions (overall rate and specific rates for asthma, gastroenteritis, and heart failure) decreased during the study period when related to a high and intermediate proportion of professionals who completed the specialization course, and the same was seen for indicators of chronic conditions (diabetic and hypertensive patients) who were registered, monitored and group care.
   Conclusion
   The specialization course impacted important indicators related to the attributions of primary health care professionals, considering that decreases in hospitalizations for primary care sensitive causes (overall rate of sensitive causes, specific rates for asthma, gastroenteritis and heart failure) were seen in the territories where professionals who completed this course worked, along with increased registration and monitoring of diabetic and hypertensive patients.

AB  - The great sensitivity of amphibians to land disturbance is one of the main causes that contributed to their worldwide decline. One fundamental approach in assessing amphibian ability to reflect habitat degradation is to measure their phenotypic changes in contrasting environments. We examined the extent to which several morphological traits of the endemic anuran Pelophylax perezi responded to agricultural conversion in Monegros, an arid region in NE Spain. Specifically, we determined how body size, body mass, body condition (BC) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of different frog classes varied among habitats with different degree of management, i.e. rice fields vs. control ponds (i.e. small reservoirs). Pelophylax perezi juveniles showed a decrease in size and mass in rice fields, revealing that early life stages are generally more susceptible to habitat alteration. Adult body condition, on the other hand, increased significantly in cultivated habitats, which apparently indicates a good fitness in this size class. Nonetheless, skeletal asymmetry of both, juveniles and adults was significantly higher in rice fields. Moreover, during postmetamorphic development FA increased significantly towards adult stage indicating that the development controlling mechanisms were not able to buffer the stress induced by land use change. Among traits, humerus, radio-ulna and metatarsal were highly sensitive in terms of expressing significant FA differences between habitats, contrary to tibio-fibula, whose precise symmetry is essential for animal locomotion. The former bones have therefore the potential to be used as sensitive indicators of stress in amphibians. FA showed no relationship with body condition. This, together with the previous results demonstrates that FA is able to capture habitat stress more reliably than the morphological estimates such as body size, mass and BC. Therefore, FA is a useful morphological tool, highly recommended to monitor stress levels in amphibian populations.

AB  - Individual variation in aerobic capacity has been extensively studied, especially with respect to condition, maturity or pathogen infection, and to gain insights into mechanistic foundations of performance. However, its relationship to mate competition is less well understood, particularly for animals in natural habitats. We examined aerobic capacity [maximum rate of O-2 consumption ((V) over dot(O2,max)) in forced exercise] in wild satin bowerbirds, an Australian passerine with a non-resource based mating system and strong intermale sexual competition. We tested for repeatability of mass and (V) over dot(O2,max), differences among age and sex classes, and effects of several condition indices. In adult males, we examined interactions between aerobic performance and bower ownership (required for male mating success). There was significant repeatability of mass and (V) over dot(O2,max) within and between years, but between-year repeatability was lower than within-year repeatability. (V) over dot(O2,max) varied with an overall scaling to mass(0.791), but most variance in (V) over dot(O2,max) was not explained by mass. Indicators of condition (tarsus and wing length asymmetry, the ratio of tarsus length to mass) were not correlated to (V) over dot(O2,max). Ectoparasite counts were weakly correlated to (V) over dot(O2,max) across all age-sex classes but not within any class. Adult males, the cohort with the most intense levels of mating competition, had higher (V) over dot(O2,max) than juvenile birds or adult females. However, there was no difference between the (V) over dot(O2,max) of bower-owning males and that of males not known to hold bowers. Thus one major factor determining male reproductive success was not correlated to aerobic performance.

AB  - Debate continues over paleoenvironmental conditions that prevail during deposition of organic-carbon (C)-rich marine source rocks in foreland basins and epicontinental seas. The focus of disagreement centers largely on paleowater depth and the prevalence of anoxia/euxinia. The issues of paleodepth and water column conditions are important for prediction of lateral variations in source quality within a basin because the viability of a hydrocarbon play depends on a thorough understanding of the distribution of source rock quality and depositional environments. We used inorganic geochemical data from the Middle Devonian Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Basin to illustrate interpretive strategies that provided constraints on conditions during deposition. Source evaluation typically relies on the analysis and interpretation of organic geochemical indicators, potentially also providing evidence of the degree of thermal maturity and conditions of the preservation of the organic matter. The Marcellus Formation is thermally mature, making the evaluation of the organic-carbon fraction for geologic interpretation inadequate. Because most labile organic matter has largely been destroyed in the Marcellus Formation, analysis of inorganic elements may be used as an alternative interpretative technique. Several inorganic elements have been correlated to varying depositional settings, allowing for their use as proxies for understanding the paleodepositional environments of formations. A high-resolution geochemical data set has been constructed for the Union Springs Member along a transect of cores from proximal to distal in the Appalachian Basin in central Pennsylvania using major, minor, and trace elemental data. Our results suggested that during deposition, the sediment-water interface, and a portion of the water column, was anoxic to euxinic. As deposition continued, euxinia was periodically interrupted by dysoxia and even oxic conditions, and a greater influx of clastic material occurred. Such variations were likely related to fluctuations in water depth and progradation of deltaic complexes from the eastern margin of the Appalachian Basin.

AB  - The interaction of melting glaciers and oceanic stormy weather produce a large variability in the water column structure of the coastal sea from the south Pacific coast of Patagonia. This area is largely utilized as spawning and nursery ground for the mesopelagic fish Maurolicus parvipinnis (Sternoptichyidae) during the austral spring. Using microstructure analysis of sagittal otoliths and fluctuating asymmetry of M. parvipinnis larvae from 4.0 to 11.4 mm standard length (SL), we studied the spatial distribution, the variation of larval condition and recent growth during October-November 2009 between 50 degrees 06 and 52 degrees 45S. Hydrographic conditions varied between 1.4 and 9.5 degrees C, 14.6-33.5 units of salinity, 11.5-26.5 units of sigma-t and the stability ranged from 3.6 to 594 cycles h(-1). Larval abundance ranged between 3.1 and 293.7 ind. 10 m(-2), with the highest abundance associated with channels connecting fjords and the adjacent ocean. Larvae grew at a rate of 0.174 mm day(-1), and those individuals collected in areas with intermediate water column stability (216-270 cycles h(-1)) showed greater body condition, measured as recent otolith growth index (ROGI). However, these larvae had a similar departure from ideal symmetry (FA1 residual model) as larvae collected in more stratified or well-mixed areas. Overall, larvae showed size-dependent asymmetry, sagittal otoliths of smaller larvae (< 7 mm SL) being more asymmetrical than those of large larvae (P <0.05). This suggests that M. parvipinnis larvae may be experiencing the impacts of water column variability differently, as well as other ecological interactions at different larval stages. Thus, water column structure at hatching would be important for the survival of this fish inhabiting the Patagonian fjords of southern Chile.

AB  - Two studies to examine the effect of waterborne clofibric acid (CA) on growth rate and condition of rainbow trout were conducted using accepted regulatory tests (Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development [OECD] 215) The first study (in 2005) showed significant reductions after 21 d of exposure (21 d growth lowest observed effect concentration [LOEC] = 0 1 mu g/L 21 d condition LOEC = 0 1 mu g/L) that continued to 28 d Growth rate was reduced by approximately 50% (from 5 27 to 2 67% per day) while the condition of the fish reduced in a concentration dependant manner Additionally in a concentration dependent manner significant changes in relative liver size were observed such that increasing concentrations of CA resulted in smaller livers after 28 d exposure A no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was not achieved in the 2005 study An expanded second study (in 2006) that included a robust bridge to the 2005 study with four replicate tanks of eight individual fish per concentration did not repeat the 2005 findings In the 2006 study no significant effect on growth rate condition or liver biometry was observed after 21 or 28 d (28 d growth NOEC = 10 mu g/L 28 d condition NOEC = 10 mu g/L) contrary to the 2005 findings We do not dismiss either of these findings and suggest both are relevant and stand for comparison However the larger 2006 study carries more statistical power and multiple tank replication so probably produced the more robust findings Despite sufficient statistical power in each study interpretation of these and similar studies should be conducted with caution because much significance is placed on the role of limited numbers of individual and tank replicates and the influence of control animals Environ Toxicol Chem 2010 29 2831-2839 (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - The population of wild boar has rapidly increased over the past decades in many environments. Climate changes, changes in agricultural policy orientation, and, for example, insufficient hunting and predation pressure on the wild boar have made it one of the key species of the 21st century in Europe. Currently, the biggest threat related to the distribution and abundance increasing of wild boar in Europe is their contribution to spreading of African swine fever (ASF) disease. In order to prevent the spread of ASF and its consequences, it is essential to reduce the population of the wild boar to the lowest possible level. The rate of reduction required depends on the initial population size and the population recruitment rate. These are affected, among other factors, by the carrying capacity of the environment, the provision of artificially supplied foods, and feeding at baiting sites, to assist hunting. This study evaluated the reproductive potential of wild boar populations in the Czech Republic, across a range of environmental conditions. The environment significantly affected the physical condition of piglets, yearlings, and adult sows. In lower-quality environments, piglets entered puberty earlier than in higher-quality environments. Pregnancy has been reported in piglets from the age of 7 months. The average litter size was 4.08 for piglets, 5.83 for yearlings, and 7.01 for adult sows. The sex ratio of piglets was affected by the body condition of the mother. The reproductive potential of the current Central European wild boar population is high. This study showed that approximately 95% of females will be impregnated during the non-vegetative season. An average increment of 5 piglets per female, or 3 piglets per wild boar who survived the winter, can be expected.

AB  - Many approaches have been taken to the condition monitoring of gas turbines including performance analysis, vibration monitoring and lubricant debris monitoring. Acoustic emission monitoring has the potential to provide information about turbine operation and faults as they occur and has two possible advantages over other techniques. Firstly, because acoustic emission is sensitive to minor changes which do not necessarily involve whole-body motion, it is potentially able to reveal faults at an early stage. Secondly, because acoustic emission propagates over the structure from the source(s) to the sensor(s), it has the capacity to locate the source of any fault signal without intrusion. This paper explores the nature of the acoustic emission signals generated in a laboratory-scale gas turbine in order to extract and select features of the signal under normal running conditions and to establish the physical source(s) of this acoustic emission. A series of tests with the turbine running normally, either idling with the speed being controlled by fuel and air flow, or under load at fixed fuel and air flow with the speed being controlled by the amount of load applied, provided a range of conditions of gas flow through the turbine. An ancillary set of simplified tests with the free power turbine impeller jammed or absent was used to help distinguish between components of the acoustic emission associated with standing waves in various parts of the turbine and turbulence around the impeller. The results provide the first systematic study of fluid-induced acoustic emission in turbines and, as such, offer a baseline interpretation for acoustic emission generation in turbines and fluid machinery generally. Specifically, the findings will be compared with measurements made on the same turbine with simulated blade faults in a future publication.

AB  - The dynamic response of gear transmissions holds essential information for the recognition of faults in the system. A realistic nonlinear dynamic model is used to predict the vibration regime of spur gear transmissions. This model was validated experimentally for both healthy and damaged conditions. The model allows to simulate each combination of rotational speed, load and surface roughness, and to isolate its influence on the dynamic response. An experimental study would be limited due to the large amount of cases to consider. The simulated surface roughness enables a more realistic evaluation of the condition indicators robustness. The first part of the study examines the effects of the operating conditions, e.g. speed, load and surface roughness, on the vibration signature of a healthy gearbox. It was found that the levels at the gear mesh frequencies (GMF) have a strong dependency on speed and load. The energy of the frequency modulation (FM) sidebands depends mainly on speed but hardly affected by load. The second part of the study examines the manifestation of a single tooth face fault in the vibration signature. Based on the conclusions of the first part, the analysis was focused on the synchronous average spectrum and the difference signal. The investigation using hundreds of simulations shed a new light on the physical phenomena in the dynamic response - the fault's expression is amplified around the natural frequencies of the gears. Based on this insight, it was found that the analysis of the spectrum around the natural frequencies allows the detection of incipient faults that cannot be detected using the analysis of the difference signal. The understanding of the physical phenomena, based on the dynamic model, enabled the generalization of this new finding. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Key Message The investigation of the relations between climate and intra-annual density fluctuation (IADF) traits (e.g. frequency, width and functional anatomical traits) in Quercus ilex tree rings of stands living on two opposite slopes, highlighted the influence of local site conditions on the climate signal contained in tree rings. Moreover it allowed to identify the main site-specific environmental drivers for IADF formation.
   Context Wood functional traits such as IADFs result from the adaptation of tree physiological processes to seasonal climate variability. They could be used to reconstruct tree response to intra-annual variations in environmental conditions.
   Aims We investigated the relationship between IADF features and climate in Quercus ilex L. populations living on opposite slopes, aiming to evaluate the influence of local site conditions on wood plasticity in response to seasonal climate variability.
   Methods Dominant trees were sampled and dated. IADF frequency and width, non-lumen fraction, vessel size, and frequency were measured. Time series analyses using precipitation and temperature data were performed.
   Results A decrease in IADF frequency over time influenced by summer and autumn temperature was observed at both sites. IADFs were more frequent, wider, with smaller vessels and a higher non-lumen fraction in trees growing at the north slope compared to the south slope site. IADF anatomical parameters of south slope tree rings were mainly influenced by precipitation, while the ones of north-slope tree rings by temperature.

AB  - The potential impacts of changes in precipitation patterns associated with global climate change on the relationship between soil community diversity and litter decomposition were investigated. For a period of ca. 5 months, two decomposer communities in litterbags (1000 and 45 mum mesh size) containing spruce litter were subjected to two irrigation treatments: constant and fluctuating (drying/rewetting) moisture conditions. The latter were expected to induce moisture stress on the decomposer communities. The two mesh sizes were used to exclude different faunal components from the decomposer communities. The 1000 mum mesh excluded only the macrofauna, whereas the 45 mum mesh excluded both the macro- and mesofauna. In the short-term perspective of the present study, mesofauna abundance showed no response to imposed fluctuating moisture conditions. Irrespective of the presence of mesofauna, mass loss, microbial biomass and the control mechanisms, regulating carbon mineralization appeared unaffected by fluctuating moisture conditions. The reduction in the functional/structural diversity of the decomposer communities in the 45 mum litterbags resulted in strongly increased Nematoda abundance but it did not alter the response of Nematoda to fluctuating moisture conditions. Processes in the nitrogen (N)-cycle and mass loss were sensitive indicators of changes in the structural and functional complexity of decomposer communities. However, a negative effect of fluctuating moisture conditions on extractable N was coupled to the presence of mesofauna. Extremes in rainfall patterns, generated by climate change, may have a negative impact on the availability of nutrients, particularly N, for plants. This effect could be amplified by an additional impoverishment in the structural and functional complexity of the respective decomposer communities.

AB  - Ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time. Current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate Ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45 degrees C, although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect. Here, we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on Ascaris inactivation. We exposed Ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34 degrees C and 45 degrees C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3-log reduction. Indeed, we found that temperatures lower than 45 degrees C did inactivate these eggs, and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines. Results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time-temperature relationship that is appropriate for Ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures. Data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative, with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when Ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure. A specific aerobic relationship was not developed, but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions. We demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact Ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens. The development of safe, low-input, mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Quality of life, which has been assessed by measuring the degree to which objective human needs are met in relation to personal or group perceptions, has been largely investigated over the years. In this direction, various methods and techniques have been employed in order to determine the most effective criteria and indicators of obtaining adequate residential or work spaces. It can be said that one of the priorities of a "healthy" building is to comply with health and comfort criteria. Various organizations all over the world consider that the built environment is characterized by a number of parameters which might threaten human health. The effects upon human health of the time spent in a building could not be entirely explained. The performance indicators used nowadays are not enough to perform a correct assessment and many times the current standards differ greatly from the needs of those who work in these spaces. Taking into consideration the fact that urban society spends more and more time indoors, indoor air quality has become an important public health problem at global scale. Besides the benefits of comfort it brings, air conditioning can affect human health, because it greatly modifies the environment in which the individual is placed. The strategies employed to ameliorate the conditions offered by modern buildings imply measures related to the indoor environment and also to the building itself. Preventive methods for maintaining a sustainable quality of life in an air conditioned environment address the human factor and imply a close medical evaluation of candidate employees, in order to avoid the occurrence of some disorders in those people who are prone to illnesses determined by this type of environment according to their personal or family medical history, or the decompensation of already existing illnesses.

AB  - Morphology and physiology are two key aspects of the adaptation of kelp to varying environments. Some of these kelp responses to co-occurring highly hydrodynamic condition and high nutrient availability are well documented, but little is known about how these factors affect frond surface shape, particularly in the central frond. In this study, morphological and physiological traits of acclimatized Saccharina latissima (Phaeophyceae) (three size classes: 44.14 +/- 1.15 cm, 29.60 +/- 0.75 cm, and 16.07 +/- 0.45 cm) were compared after 56 days under fully controlled conditions of waves or no waves, and high or low nutrient availability (i.e., LN-NW, LN-W, HN-NW, and HN-W treatments). Waves primarily increased frond biomass, elongation rate, and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) and induced both a greater variety in and rougher frond surface shapes. The fastest, second-fastest, and slowest growth rates were observed in the HN-W, LN-W, and LN-NW treatments, respectively. The highest C:N ratio was observed in the LN-W treatment. Together, these results seem to suggest that the thready and spring-like shapes found in the central frond (i.e., rougher frond surface) in wave-exposed conditions can at least partly compensate for low nutrient availability by enhancing nutrient and photon acquisition, particularly in low nutrient conditions. Additionally, large individuals showed significantly larger and heavier fronds compared with other size classes, and the meristematic sections of fronds had the most variance in frond surface shapes and highest C:N ratios compared with distal and mid-sections. Together, these results indicate that frond surface shapes in the newly formed central frond of S. latissima can be regarded both as possessing high morphological and physiological plasticity that enables kelp to cope with contrasting environments.

AB  - In Poland, Anthriscus caucalis reaches the north-eastern limit of its secondary geographical range in Central Europe and is a declining archaeophyte in ruderal habitats. However, in recent years, new localities of A. caucalis were found in the north-western and western Poland in forest communities. A high number of individuals of A. caucalis in these localities suggests that it finds optimal growth conditions in these strongly eutrophic forests, exhibiting an invasive potential in this habitat. To compare the floristic composition and habitat conditions between ruderal and forest plant communities occupied by A. caucalis in Poland, a total of 23 releves were collected. For each vegetation plot, median Ellenberg's indicator values (EIV) were estimated in order to evaluate the environmental conditions. The differences in EIV and floristic composition between the localities were analyzed using the Non-Metric Multi Dimensional Scaling (NMDS). In addition, we examined the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence variation for five individuals from four populations to analyze the association of particular genotype with ruderal or forest habitat. The results showed that the specific configuration of environmental factors, including moderate shade, mild and stable thermal and moisture conditions as well as high concentration of nutrients in the soil, is more important to A. caucalis occurrence than the floristic composition of the plant communities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the vanishing of A. caucalis in the ruderal habitats is a response to the currently observed increase of the extreme weather events. Likely, it finds more suitable and stable microclimate conditions in the forest areas. The results of the molecular analyses revealed two ribotypes which occurred in both types of habitats. The lack of correlation between genotype and habitat supports our conclusion from EIV analysis that the colonization of forests should be treated rather as a niche tracking than as an adaptive shift in habitat preference.

AB  - Understanding the functional relationship between marine predators and their prey is vital to inform ecosystem-based management. However, collecting concurrent data on predator behaviour and their prey at relevant scales is challenging. Moreover, opportunities to study these relationships in the absence of industrial fishing are extremely rare. We took advantage of an experimental fisheries closure to study how local prey abundance influences foraging success and chick condition of Endangered African penguins Spheniscus demersus in the Benguela ecosystem. We tracked 75 chick-provisioning penguins with GPS-time-depth devices, measured body condition of 569 chicks, quantified the diet of 83 breeding penguins and conducted 12 forage fish hydro-acoustic surveys within a 20 km radius of Robben Island, South Africa, over three years (2011-2013). Commercial fishing for the penguins' main prey, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, was prohibited within this 20 km radius during the study period. Local forage fish abundance explained 60% of the variation in time spent diving for 14 penguins at sea within 2 days of a hydro-acoustic survey. Penguin foraging effort (time spent diving, number of wiggles per trip, number of foraging dives and the maximum distance travelled) increased and offspring body condition decreased as forage fish abundance declined. In addition, quantile regression revealed that variation in foraging effort increased as prey abundance around the colony declined. Policy implications. Our results demonstrate that local forage fish abundance influences seabird foraging and offspring fitness. They also highlight the potential for offspring condition and the mean-variance relationship in foraging behaviour to act as leading indicators of poor prey abundance. By rapidly indicating periods where forage resources are scarce, these metrics could help limit seabird fisheries competition and aid the implementation of dynamic ocean management.

AB  - When consuming plants, herbivores must deal with both low nutritional quality from cell wall constituents and potentially toxic plant secondary metabolites, which are often inversely related. Herbivores that consume a highly nutritious, but chemically defended plant, may consume high levels of toxins that require energy for detoxification. Alternatively, herbivores may avoid consuming high levels of toxins by consuming a diverse diet that may be lower in overall nutritional quality. In this study, we assessed the relationship among nutritional restriction, detoxification and diet diversity in a free-ranging wild herbivore. We collected urine deposited in the snow (hereafter, snow-urine) and feces by free-ranging moose Alces americanus, a generalist browser, during winter. We used the ratio of urinary urea nitrogen to creatinine (UN:C), measured in snow-urine samples, as an indicator of nutritional restriction, and the ratio of glucuronic acid to creatinine (GA:C), as an indicator of investment in detoxification. We used microhistology to determine diet composition from fecal pellets. GA:C and UN:C were positively associated, suggesting that nutritional condition tends to be worse for individuals investing more in detoxification. We found, after accounting for the influence of winter severity, diet diversity and UN:C to be negatively related, suggesting that increasingly diverse diets were associated with improved nutritional condition. Overall, the most important predictor of UN:C was winter severity and proportion of diet comprised of balsam fir Abies balsamea. Physiological indicators of nutritional restriction tended to be worse during severe winters and among individuals that had consumed more balsam fir. These results highlight complex relationships among environmental conditions, foraging decisions, and costs of detoxification that can influence nutritional condition of herbivores.

AB  - Chickpea production is low and unstable due to rainfed conditions. Using priming and other pre sowing treatments in many crops have improved seed performance. In order to evaluate the effect of hormonal priming on emergence, growth, physiological traits and yield of chickpea under drought stress, two separate experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the effect of gibberellic acid on the emergence and vigor of chickpea (cultivar ILC 6266) under drought stress was studied in glasshouse. Different gibberellic acid treatments including zero, 50, 100 and 150 ppm were used in the study. While different drought treatment levels used in the study were 70, 50 and 30 percent of field capacity. The second experiment was conducted under field conditions with drought stress levels as in the first experiment conducted in glasshouse. It was observed that hormonal priming with gibberellic acid increased seed emergence and plant vigor in glasshouse conditions. Moreover, application of gibberellic acid also resulted in improved growth and physiological traits under field condition but could not affect the seed yield. In this experiment drought stress caused a significant reduction in all tested characteristics. Gibberellic acid priming prominently reduced the adverse effects of drought. Of course, this positive effect was more pronounced at higher levels of stress than the control condition. In general, 150 ppm gibberellic acid treatment was the best priming level while with increasing concentration of priming agent, emergence and plant growth indicators also improved. We concluded that priming with appropriate concentration of gibberellin plays an important role in the induction of tolerance to drought and overcome limitations created by the environmental stress such as osmotic effects, ion toxicity and nutritional imbalance.

AB  - There is compelling evidence that postural instability occurs at very early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), making it tempting to speculate that changes in postural sway may even occur at a prodromal phase. Studies estimate that approximately half of patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RED) will eventually develop PD, so RED may be an indicator of prodromal PD. This study was undertaken to investigate postural sway and its relation to stereopsis function in patients with RED. We examined 24 patients with polysomnography-confirmed RED and 23 healthy, sex-and age-matched control subjects. Postural sway was measured with an accelerometer at the center of mass at the lower spine. Subjects were asked to stand quietly for 30s under two usual conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and three challenging conditions (eyes open with dual task, eyes closed with dual task, and tandem standing). Stereopsis was assessed using the Titmus fly test. RED patients showed an increased variability of trunk acceleration and a decrease of smoothness of sway, compared to control subjects. These differences reached significance in the challenging conditions. RED patients demonstrated significant impairment in stereopsis. There were statistically significant correlations between log seconds of arc of the Titmus test and some sway parameters within the RED group. RED patients with abnormal stereopsis showed a significant increase of JERK values compared to patients with normal stereopsis in the challenging conditions. Our results indicate that idiopathic RED patients, especially with abnormal stereopsis, have subtle signs of postural instability under challenging conditions. Postural sway performance may serve as a biological marker for prodromal PD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reduction of air-conditioning energy consumptions is one of the main indicators to act on when improving the energy efficiency in buildings.
   In the case of advanced technological buildings, a meaningful contribution to the thermal loads and the energy consumptions reduction could depend on the correct configuration and management of the envelope systems. In recent years, the architectural trend toward highly transparent all-glass buildings presents a unique challenge and opportunity to advance the market for emerging, smart, dynamic window and dimmable daylighting control technologies (Lee et al., 2004).
   A prototype dynamic glazing system was developed and tested at ITC-CNR; it is aimed at actively responding to the external environmental loads. Both an experimental campaign and analyses by theoretical models were carried out, aimed at evaluating the possible configurations depending on different weather conditions in several possible places. Therefore, the analytical models of the building-plant system were defined by using a dynamic energy simulation software (EnergyPlus).
   The variables that determine the system performance, also influenced by the boundary conditions, were analysed, such as U- and g-value; they concern both the morphology of the envelope system, such as dimensions, shading and glazing type, gap airflow thickness, in-gap airflow rate, and management, in terms of control algorithm parameters tuning fan and shading systems, as a function of the weather conditions.
   The configuration able to provide the best performances was finally identified by also assessing such performances, integrating the dynamic system in several building types and under different weather conditions.
   The dynamic envelope system prototype has become a commercial product with some applications in facade systems, curtain walls and windows.
   The paper describes the methodological approach to prototype development and the main results obtained, including simulations of possible applications on real buildings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of body condition score to metabolic acclimation in heat stressed Holstein cows. Body condition of cows had no effect on any of the tested parameters during the thermal neutral period, except for the percentage of protein in milk. Heat stress has been demonstrated to have an impact on all the selected parameters, and has been found to be the cause of decreased milk production and quality, increased rectal temperature and respiration rate, decreased glucose, non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and cholesterol concentration, increased urea and bilirubin concentration, and loss of subcutaneous fat. Obese cows (BCS > 4) had less ability of acclimation to heat stress as compared to normal and thin cows (significantly lower production and milk quality, and significantly higher rectal temperature and respiration level in relation to the other groups of cows). Obese cows showed a significantly higher concentration of NEFA and significantly lower glucose during exposure to heat stress. The steady increase in NEFA concentrations and decrease of backfat thickness suggested that fat was used for energy purposes, which significantly increased the heat balance and led to poor acclimation to heat stress in obese cows. Cows with high body condition were at higher risk of developing liver failure and lipidosis (reduced cholesterol and elevated bilirubin concentration) during heat stress, which could be linked with increased concentrations of fatty acids in the blood. This was found with an increased concentration of urea during exposure to heat stress, with significantly higher concentration in obese cows. Using the fat for energy purposes depends on the sensitivity to insulin, which increases during heat stress. Obese cows are naturally less sensitive to insulin and more prone to lipolysis. However, these signs should be the focus of future research.

AB  - Background
   Network types and characteristics have been linked to the capacity of inter-personal environments to mobilise and share resources. The aim of this paper is to examine personal network types in relation to long-term condition management in order to identify the properties of network types most likely to provide support for those with a long-term condition.
   Method
   A cross-sectional observational survey of people with type 2 diabetes using interviews and questionnaires was conducted between April and October 2013 in six European countries: Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, Norway, United Kingdom, and Netherlands. 1862 people with predominantly lower socio-economic status were recruited from each country. We used k-means clustering analysis to derive the network types, and one-way analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between network type socio-economic characteristics, self-management monitoring and skills, well-being, and network member work.
   Results
   Five network types of people with long-term conditions were identified: restricted, minimal family, family, weak ties, and diverse. Restricted network types represented those with the poorest self-management skills and were associated with limited support from social network members. Restricted networks were associated with poor indicators across self-management capacity, network support, and well-being. Diverse networks were associated with more enhanced self-management skills amongst those with a long-term condition and high level of emotional support. It was the three network types which had a large number of network members (diverse, weak ties, and family) where healthcare utilisation was most likely to correspond to existing health needs.
   Discussion
   Our findings suggest that type of increased social involvement is linked to greater self-management capacity and potentially lower formal health care costs indicating that diverse networks constitute the optimal network type as a policy in terms of the design of LTCM interventions and building support for people with LTCs.

AB  - Background
   Improving care for people with long-term conditions is central to NHS policy. It has been suggested that the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a primary care pay-forperformance scheme that rewards practices for delivering effective interventions in long-term conditions, does not encourage high-quality care for this group of patients.
   Aim
   To examine the evidence that the QOF has improved quality of care for patients with long-term conditions.
   Design and setting
   This was a systematic review of research on the effectiveness of the QOF in the UK.
   Method
   The authors searched electronic databases for peer-reviewed empirical quantitative research studying the effect of the QOF on a broad range of processes and outcomes of care, including coordination and integration of care, holistic and personalised care, self-care, patient experience, physiological and biochemical outcomes, health service utilisation, and mortality. Because the studies were heterogeneous, a narrative synthesis was carried out.
   Results
   The authors identified three systematic reviews and five primary research studies that met the inclusion criteria. The QOF was associated with a modest slowing of both the increase in emergency admissions and the increase in consultations in severe mental illness (SMI), and modest improvements in diabetes care. The nature of the evidence means that the authors cannot be sure that any of these associations is causal. No clear effect on mortality was found. The authors found no evidence that the QOF influences integration or coordination of care, holistic care, self-care, or patient experience.
   Conclusion
   The NHS should consider more broadly what constitutes high-quality primary care for people with long-term conditions, and consider other ways of motivating primary care to deliver it.

AB  - Soil microbes support multiple ecosystem functions in woody biomes and are regulated by both plant communities and soil properties. While most microbes reside in the uppermost soil layer, we have a poor understanding of how the condition of the soil surface affects soil microbes across different woody biomes. This knowledge is important because it could provide a cost-effective means of predicting the extent to which different soil surface types could be useful predictors of microbial communities in soil health monitoring programs. We collected data on soil bacterial and fungal communities, and 13 soil surface indicators and grazing intensity at 173 sites in eastern Australia along a climatic gradient (humid to arid) varying in tree cover. Our aim was to investigate potential relationships among the condition of the soil surface and soil microbes in forests and non-forests using linear regressions, correlations and structural equation modelling. We found that both bacterial and fungal richness were closely associated with measures of soil surface condition, particularly in forests. Greater microbial diversity was related to enhanced plant structure and richness, and lower litter characteristics in both ecosystems. In forests, these relationships were enhanced by higher temperatures or suppressed by greater tree richness. Bacterial and fungal communities responded differently to changes in soil surface attributes in forests, with winners (e.g., Proteobacteria) and losers (e.g., Cyanobacteria) among bacterial phyla, but consistent responses across fungal phyla. Our study provides empirical evidence of significant relationships among microbes and indicators of soil surface condition. This finding advances our understanding of plant-soil interactions, and indicates the possibility of using field-based soil surface attributes as potential cost-effective, practical, yet informative indicators to monitor changes in microbial richness and composition in forests and non-forests (open woodlands, shrublands).

AB  - Objective: Individuals who are satisfied and experience frequent positive emotions tend to have reduced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, conflicting evidence exists and little research has investigated whether well-being is associated with early-warning indicators of biological risk that precede CHD. We investigated whether life satisfaction and positive emotions longitudinally predicted reduced risk of incident cardiometabolic conditions and healthier cardiometabolic risk scores, which may provide insight into underlying mechanisms and novel prevention targets.
   Methods: Initially healthy men and women (N = 754-854) reported their baseline life satisfaction and positive emotions. During follow-up, presence of manifest cardiometabolic conditions was assessed and a separate cardiometabolic risk score was constructed from eight biomarkers. Poisson and linear regression analyses tested whether life satisfaction and positive emotions were associated with reduced incident disease risk and lower cardiometabolic risk scores 8-11 years later.
   Results: Life satisfaction and positive emotions were each prospectively associated with reduced risk of manifest conditions, controlling for demographics and family history of CHD. Associations were attenuated for positive emotions after adjusting for depressive symptoms and for life satisfaction after adjusting for health behaviors. Life satisfaction was associated with lower cardiometabolic risk scores until adding health behaviors, but positive emotions were not (regardless of the included covariates).
   Conclusion: Well-being, particularly life satisfaction, is associated with reduced risk for incident cardiometabolic conditions in minimally-adjusted models. However, accounting for underlying behavioral pathways attenuates the association. Low levels of life satisfaction (but not positive emotions) may also provide early warning of cardiometabolic risk prior to disease development. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Modulation of short-term emotions by long-term mood is little understood but relevant to understand the affective system and of importance in respect to animal welfare: a negative mood might taint experiences, whilst a positive mood might alleviate single negative events.
   To induce different mood states in sheep housing conditions were varied. Fourteen ewes were group-housed in an unpredictable, stimulus-poor and 15 ewes in a predictable, stimulus-rich environment. Sheep were tested individually for mood in a behavioural cognitive bias paradigm. Also, their reactions to three physical stimuli thought to differ in their perceived valence were observed (negative: pricking, intermediate: slight pressure, positive: kneading). General behaviour, activity, ear movements and positions, and haemodynamic changes in the cortical brain were recorded during stimulations. Generalised mixed-effects models and model probabilities based on the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) were used.
   Only weak evidence for mood difference was found. Sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing condition had a somewhat more negative cognitive bias, showed slightly more aversive behaviour, were slightly more active and moved their ears somewhat more. Sheep most clearly differentiated the negative from the intermediate and positive stimulus in that they exhibited more aversive behaviour, less nibbling, were more active, showed more ear movements, more forward ear postures, fewer backward ear postures, and a stronger decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin when subjected to the negative stimulus.
   In conclusion, sheep reacted towards stimuli according to their presumed valence but their mood was not strongly influenced by housing conditions. Therefore, behavioural reactions and cortical brain activity towards the stimuli were hardly modulated by housing conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The events or factors that lead from normal cell function to conditions and diseases such as aging or cancer reflect complex interactions between cells and their environment. Cellular stress responses, a group of processes involved in homeostasis and adaptation to environmental change, contribute to cell survival under stress and can be resolved with damage avoidance or damage tolerance outcomes. To investigate the impact of environmental agents/conditions upon cellular stress response outcomes in epithelium, a novel quantitative assay, the stress response resolution (SRR) assay, was developed. The SRR assay consists of pretreatment with a test agent or vehicle followed later by a calibrated stress conditions exposure step (here, using 6-thioguanine). Pilot studies conducted with a spontaneously-immortalized murine mammary epithelial cell line pretreated with vehicle or 20 mu g N-ethyl-N-nitrososurea/ml medium for 1 hr, or two hTERT-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines pretreated with vehicle or 100 mu M zidovudine/lamivudine for 12 days, found minimal alterations in cell morphology, survival, or cell function through 2 weeks post-exposure. However, when these pretreatments were followed 2 weeks later by exposure to calibrated stress conditions of limited duration (for 4 days), significant alterations in stress resolution were observed in pretreated cells compared with vehicle-treated control cells, with decreased damage avoidance survival outcomes in all cell lines and increased damage tolerance outcomes in two of three cell lines. These pilot study results suggest that sub-cytotoxic pretreatments with chemical mutagens have long-term adverse impact upon the ability of cells to resolve subsequent exposure to environmental stressors.

AB  - In mechanics, viscoelasticity was the first field of applications in studying geomaterials. Further possibilities arise in spatial non-locality. Non-local materials were already studied in the 1960s by several authors as a part of continuum mechanics and are still in focus of interest because of the rising importance of materials with internal micro- and nano-structure. When material instability gained more interest, non-local behavior appeared in a different aspect. The problem was concerned to numerical analysis, because then instability zones exhibited singular properties for local constitutive equations. In dynamic stability analysis, mathematical aspects of non-locality were studied by using the theory of dynamic systems. There the basic set of equations describing the behavior of continua was transformed to an abstract dynamic system consisting of differential operators acting on the perturbation field variables. Such functions should satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions and act as indicators of stability of a selected state of the body under consideration. Dynamic systems approach results in conditions for cases, when the differential operators have critical eigenvalues of zero real parts (dynamic stability or instability conditions). When the critical eigenvalues have non-trivial eigenspace, the way of loss of stability is classified as a typical (or generic) bifurcation. Our experiences show that material non-locality and the generic nature of bifurcation at instability are connected, and the basic functions of the non-trivial eigenspace can be used to determine internal length quantities of non-local mechanics. Fractional calculus is already successfully used in thermo-elasticity. In the paper, non-locality is introduced via fractional strain into the constitutive relations of various conventional types. Then, by defining dynamic systems, stability and bifurcation are studied for states of thermo-mechanical solids. Stability conditions and genericity conditions are presented for constitutive relations under consideration.

AB  - To elucidate the natural variability of Atlantic and Coastal water, a late-Holocene multi-proxy analysis is performed on a marine sediment core from the northern Norwegian margin. This includes planktic foraminiferal fauna and their preservation indicators, stable isotopes (O-18(c), C-13), sub-surface temperature (SSTMg/Ca) and salinity (SSS) records based on paired Mg/Ca and O-18(c) measurements of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and transfer function-derived sub-surface temperatures (SSTTransfer). The record shows a general cooling with subtle fluctuating palaeoceanographic conditions, here attributed to shifting North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) modes. Period I (ca. 3500-2900cal. yr BP) is strongly influenced by Coastal water and stratified water masses, possibly correlating to negative NAO conditions. During period II (ca. 2900-1600cal. yr BP), dominating warm Atlantic water might be linked to a positive NAO mode and the Roman Warm Period. A renewed influence of Coastal water is observed throughout period III (ca. 1600-900 cal. yr BP). Stable and colder SST values potentially correlate to the Dark Ages and are here attributed to negative NAO conditions. Within period IV (ca. 900-550 cal. yr BP), the core site experienced a stronger influence of Atlantic water which might be because of the positive NAO conditions correlating to the Medieval Warm Period'. Additionally, an inverse correlation in Atlantic water influence between the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean is observed throughout periods II, III and IV. This Atlantic oceanographic see-saw pattern is attributed to an opposite climatic response to changing NAO conditions arguing for a coupling between ocean and atmosphere.

AB  - The intercomparison of seven chemical mechanisms for their suitability for air quality policy formulation and assessment is described. Box modeling techniques were employed using 44 sets of background environmental conditions covering North America to constrain the chemical development of the longer lived species. The selected mechanisms were modified to enable an unbiased assessment of the adequacy of the parameterizations of photochemical ozone production from volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation in the presence of NOx. Photochemical ozone production rates responded differently to 30% NOx and VOC reductions with the different mechanisms, despite the striking similarities between the base-case ozone production rates. The 30% reductions in NOx and VOCs also produced changes in OH. The responses in OH to 30% reductions in NOx and VOCs appeared to be more sensitive to mechanism choice, compared with the responses in the photochemical ozone production rates. Although 30% NOx reductions generally led to decreases in OH, 30% reductions in VOCs led to increases in OH, irrespective of mechanism choice and background environmental conditions. The different mechanisms therefore gave different OH responses to NOx and VOC reductions and so would give different responses in terms of changes in the fate and behavior of air toxics, acidification and eutrophication, and fine particle formation compared with others, in response to ozone control strategies. Policymakers need to understand that there are likely to be inherent differences in the responses to ozone control strategies between different mechanisms, depending on background environmental conditions and the extents of NOx and VOC reductions under consideration.Implications: The purpose of this paper is to compare predicted ozone responses to NOx and VOC reductions with seven chemical mechanisms under North American conditions. The good agreement found between the tested mechanisms should provide some support for their application in the air quality models used for policymaking.

AB  - Different methodologies for evaluating aspects of model performance going beyond the pure agreement between measured and simulated data have been recently proposed. These indicators and criteria for the evaluation of, e.g., complexity and robustness can be used in conjunction with well-known metrics for the evaluation of model accuracy - such as root mean square error and modelling efficiency - to get a deeper knowledge about models structure and behaviour. The aim of this paper is to propose an indicator of model plasticity, defined as the aptitude of a model to change the sensitivity to its parameters while changing the conditions of application. Sensitivity was here analyzed using the Sobol' method for sensitivity analysis (SA). Concordance among parameters relevance (total order effect) estimated under different conditions allowed to quantify changes in the way models react to different environments. The concordance among the different SA results was related to the variability of a normalized agrometeorological indicator used to characterize the explored conditions. The plasticity indicator was tested using three different crop models (WARM, CropSyst, WOFOST: rice was simulated), 10 European locations, and 10 years for each location, for a total of 5,939,200 simulations and 300 SA experiments. Results indicated WOFOST as the most plastic, both within location, year, and using all the combinations location x year, whereas WARM showed to be the less plastic across the conditions explored. Previous studies carried out on the same models in northern Italy seem to suggest a direct relationship between model complexity and plasticity, whereas model accuracy seems to be unrelated to these features. This consideration underlines that, in case of availability of different models with a similar degree of accuracy, different choices should be performed for different modelling studies, characterized by different aims and conditions of application.

AB  - Geochemical data have been used as the most effective proxies for determining palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental conditions. In this article, we conduct a systematic review on a variety of geochemical data of sediments that are considered proxies for tracing palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental information. Comprehensive studies have been carried out on the palaeoproductivity, redox conditions, palaeoclimate, and the acquired data on the enrichment mechanism of organic matter have been summarized. The general mechanisms of the geochemical data regarded as the palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental archives include the characteristics of mineral composition, major and trace elements, and rare earth elements. The palaeoproductivity index, including the Ba and P, indicate that the organic-rich shale was deposited in a high-productivity water column. The trace elements revealed that the Longmaxi units recorded variable redox conditions from anoxic to aerobic. The elements V, U, Th, Ni, and Co together with the U/Th, V/Cr, Ni/Co, and V/(V + Ni) are essential indicators for defining the redox conditions. The NASC-normalized REE + Y distribution indicates that the Longmaxi Formation was slightly altered by detrital materials in reduced and acidic environments. The Sr/Cu and MgO/CaO all reveal that the palaeoclimate was gradually transformed from humid to dry heat. The Sr/Ba ratio implies that the water depth fluctuates frequently at the early stage of sedimentation. All geochemical data integrated with the sedimentary characteristics show that anoxic conditions, high palaeoproductivity, and relatively humid palaeoclimates contributed to the accumulation of organic-rich shale. We propose that jointly utilizing various geochemical and sedimentary indices can expand the outlook of the palaeoenvironment and provide a better understanding of the organic matter accumulation mechanisms.

AB  - Here, the Lower Permian, post-glacial fossiliferous Lontras black shales from the Parana Basin (southern Brazil) are studied using integrated palynological, geochemical and petrographic methods for the first time in order to decipher the prevalent palaeoenvironmental conditions during their sedimentation. These black shales were deposited in a restricted marine environment. Inorganic geochemical data (U/Th ratios, authigenic uranium, molybdenum), organic geochemical data (total organic carbon, biomarkers) and framboid pyrite size distributions point to predominantly anoxic/euxinic bottom-water conditions. Moreover, the presence of aryl isoprenoids and maleimide biomarkers indicates that euxinia in the water column was intermittently present in the photic zone. The onset of anoxic conditions was caused by elevated productivity in the basin, which was related to deglaciation, marine transgression and the increased delivery of terrestrial nutrients. The presence of a positive organic carbon isotope excursion indicates that the black shale deposition resulted from increased productivity and the expansion of anoxic and nitrogen- and phosphate-enriched waters into the shallow photic zone. The high values of delta N-15 (exceeding 9 parts per thousand) may be related to the deglaciation-driven sea-level rise and advection of denitrified water mass from the Panthalassic Ocean to the intracratonic Parana Basin. Prolonged periods of sea floor anoxia/euxinia excluded potential scavengers and bioturbators, thus enhancing the preservation of numerous fossil taxa, including fish, sponges, insects and their larval cases, and conodont apparatuses. The intermittent photic zone euxinia may also have contributed to the mass mortality of fish populations, the fossils of which are very well-preserved in these black shales.

AB  - The construction of a building may change the microclimate in the vicinity, and planning indicators in a master plan may directly affect the outdoor physical environmental quality in residential areas. An inappropriate plan for a site may accelerate wind and intensify vortexes over places on the pedestrian levels, which leads to an adverse outdoor environment. Therefore, the design of a cluster of buildings should not focus only on the buildings but also provide a good outdoor environment around the buildings. To tackle the problem of inadequate wind environment, the relationship between the building's floor area ratio and height was identified in this study as the main planning indicator to be examined on its effects on the outdoor wind environment. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was hence developed to simulate the wind conditions generated by some typical site layouts with different values for planning indicators under relevant weather conditions, which were typical of those in Hangzhou, China. The simulated wind conditions are assessed using the wind speed ratio over the whole area of the building cluster at the pedestrian level. The effects on the local wind condition due to the varying of the planning indicators are discussed whilst considering the potential construction costs. The indicators resulting in better external conditions are highlighted in the conclusion as the recommendation which could be used as a rule of thumb by architects and planners at the master planning stage. The study disproves the common belief in the practice that a lower floor area ratio means fewer buildings and therefore greater external comfort.

AB  - Hatcheries are commonly used to protect sea turtle eggs from poaching and predation; however, there is currently limited scientific evidence to support good hatchery management practices, particularly post-hatching. This study investigated the effects of retaining hatchlings in hatcheries after emergence and delaying nest excavations on the quality of green turtle Chelonia mydas hatchlings. In addition, the effect of artificial lighting on the sea-finding ability of green turtles was investigated to highlight the importance of hatchling release locations on hatchery beaches. Hatchling running speed, an indicator of vigour and predation exposure, progressively decreased when hatchlings were retained in the hatchery for 1, 3 and 6 hours following emergence. Similarly, body condition (mass:straight carapace length), an indicator of dehydration and/or energy consumption, decreased after being retained for 3 and 6 hours. It was estimated that hatchlings retained for 6 hours after emergence would become significantly dehydrated and double their exposure to beach slope predation. Residual hatchlings that were immediately excavated from emerged nests had similar running speed and body condition to naturally emerged siblings. However, residual hatchlings removed from nests 5 days later had significantly reduced running speed and body condition, resulting in estimates of double the exposure to predation in near-shore areas. The mean angle of hatchling dispersal varied at different sites along the Ma'Daerah beach in relation to proximity to artificial lighting. Important recommendations for post-hatching management of sea turtle hatcheries worldwide can be made from the results of this study. To maximize release of hatchlings in the best condition as is possible, hatchlings should be released immediately after emergence, including excavation of any residual hatchlings. In addition, the dispersal angles of hatchlings should be tested at each hatchery beach to determine suitable release sites for efficient dispersal.

AB  - 1. The system of Ellenberg indicator species is widely accepted and used to characterize climate, light and soil conditions in central Europe and beyond. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which Ellenberg indicator values can be used to characterize environmental conditions in ancient and recent woodlands.
   2. The study was based on data from 264 plots in ancient deciduous woodlands and adjacent 70-year-old recent woodlands located on the same soils in the Carpathian foothills. Vegetation data were related to information on light intensity and a range of soil variables.
   3. Despite a similar number of species on the plots in the ancient and recent woodlands, the correlations between the mean indicator values for light (mL), reaction (MR) and nitrogen (mN) and measured light intensity, soil pH and cation exchange capacity, respectively, were significantly lower in the recent woodlands than in the ancient woodlands.
   4. Due to a very slow and differentiated regeneration rate of the field layer, the species with the Lowest indicator values for reaction and nitrogen were significantly less abundant in the recent woodlands than in the ancient woodlands, while the species with higher values of these indicators were more frequent. The change of the reaction of many species to light conditions was the main reason for poor prediction of Light intensity in the recent woodlands by the mean indicator values for light.
   5. The mean Ellenberg indicator values for tight, reaction and nitrogen were relatively good predictors of the environmental conditions in the ancient woodlands, with stabilized species composition determined mainly by the environmental regime. They were, however, much weaker indicators in the recent woodlands. This implies that the mean indicator values for secondary woodlands should be interpreted with caution and verified by measurements of environmental variables. .

AB  - Within the MO.NA.CO Project the environmental effectiveness of GAEC cross-compliance Standard 3.1 'Ploughing in good soil moisture conditions' was evaluated, as well as the economic evaluation of the competitiveness gap for farmers which conform or do not conform to cross-compliance. The monitoring has been carried out at nine experimental farms with different pedoclimatic characteristics, where some indicators of soil structure degradation have been evaluated, such as bulk density, packing density and surface roughness of the seedbed, and the crop productive and qualitative parameters. In each monitoring farm two experimental plots have been set up: factual with soil tillage at proper water content (tilth), counterfactual with soil tillage at inadequate water content (no tilth). The monitoring did not exhibit univocal results for the different parameters, thus the effectiveness of the Standard 3.1 is 'contrasting' (class of merit B), and there was an evident practical problem to till the soil at optimum water content, even in controlled experimental condition. Bulk density was significantly lower in the factual treatment although in soils with very different textures (sandy-loam and clayey). Packing density (PD) showed a high susceptibility to compaction in soils with low PD and medium texture. The tortuosity index, indicating the roughness of the seedbed, was lower and generally significantly different in the factual treatment. Results showed that the ploughing done in excessive soil moisture conditions is more expensive due to the increased force of traction of the tractor, which causes an increase in slip of the tractor wheels, with a speed reduction and increase in the working times and fuel consumption. Moreover, the crop yield is also reduced considerably according to the cultivated species.

AB  - The yak is the primary herbivore grazing on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, an area characterized by extremely harsh conditions and a very short vegetation growing season. Herbage quantity and quality peak in summer when it is lush and green, but is dry and withered in winter when it is scarce and of poor quality. Traditionally, yaks graze only natural pasture all year without supplements and have adapted well to the extreme winter conditions. Grazing behaviour has been used as an indicator for grazing management decisions and, in this study, was measured in five 4 to 8 years old yak cows suckling calves during summer and winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The diurnal behavioural patterns were similar in the two seasons. Grazing time and jaw movements per hour increased at dawn (07:00), remained relatively steady and then decreased at dusk (19:00), whereas ruminations, mastications and boluses per hour exhibited an opposite trend and decreased at dawn, and then increased after dusk. Seasonally, with a decrease in herbage quality from summer to winter, yaks decreased grazing and ruminating times and walking distance (P < 0.05) and increased drinking and idling times (P < 0.05). Air temperature was the primary meteorological variable affecting yak behaviour and was correlated positively with grazing time, ruminating time, the rate of mastications while ruminating, boluses formed and mastications per bolus (P < 0.05). In addition, wind velocity and precipitation significantly influenced the grazing behaviour of yaks (P < 0.05). We concluded that both meteorological and forage conditions affected the grazing behaviour of yaks and that the general reduction in grazing activities in winter could have been a strategy to reduce exposure to the harsh conditions and, consequently, reduce energy expenditure for foraging and for thermoregulation.

AB  - An expanded Cenomanian-Turonian section along Oued Mellegue in north-western Tunisia provides a high-resolution record of the latest Cenomanian Oceanic Anoxic Event in an upper bathyal, pelagic to hemipelagic environment. A rapid >2 parts per thousand positive excursion in partial derivative(13)C starts at the base of the organic-rich Bahloul Formation, which represents the Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE) in Tunisia. The transition to a dysaerobic environment at the sea floor, as well as hostile conditions in the subsurface waters, was abrupt. Evolutionary turnover in planktonic foraminiferal faunas in the lowermost part of the CTBE, including the extinction of Rotalipora, is estimated to have lasted little more than 50 ka. Maximum anoxic conditions are expressed higher in the section, representing surface-water conditions in which only small globular planktonic foraminifera were thriving. Nannofossils do not show as major an evolutionary change as planktonic foraminifera, but assemblage diversity is very low within the CTBE sediments, which is attributed to a combination of hostile conditions and dissolution during deposition. A decrease in abundance of high productivity indicators among the nannofossils could be real, or the result of dissolution. Overall, calcareous microfossils do not show evidence for a major increase in primary productivity during the CTBE. Sediment accumulation rates immediately after the CTBE in the Oued Mellegue area were much lower than further to the south on the palaeoshelf. This is consistent with a major sea-level highstand during which elastic sediments were trapped on the shelf The sequence above the Bahloul Formation shows a gradual relaxation of hostile oceanic conditions, with diversification of planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil populations.

AB  - The Cambrian period marks an important point in Earth's history with profound changes in the ocean's biogeochemistry and the occurrence of the most significant evolutionary event in the history of life, the Cambrian explosion. The Cambrian explosion is described as a succession of complex cycles of extinctions and radiations. This study integrates biomarkers and their compound-specific stable carbon isotopes to investigate the palaeoenvironmental depositional conditions in middle Cambrian (Series 3) sedimentary rocks (Thorntonia Limestone, Inca Formation and Currant Bush Limestone) from two drillholes in the Undilla Sub-basin in the eastern Georgina Basin, central Australia. The occurrence of photic zone euxinia (PZE) was detected throughout these three formations by the identification of green sulfur bacteria Chlorobiaceae-derived biomarkers, including a series of 2,3,6-aryl isoprenoids and the intact biomarker isorenieratane. Pulses of enhanced PZE conditions were detected in two core intervals (90-110 mKB, Currant Bush Limestone and 170-200 mKB, Inca Formation) by an increase in the 2,3,6-aryl isoprenoids and C-19 biphenyl concentrations. These enhanced PZE conditions were followed by blooms of phytoplankton, as demonstrated by the increase in algal-derived biomarker (i.e. pristane, phytane and the C-19 n-alkane) concentrations and compound-specific isotopes. These observations confirm that palaeoenvironmental conditions were similar to those reported for the Permian/Triassic and Triassic/Jurassic mass extinction events. The sterane distributions varied across the three formations reflecting possible changes in the phytoplanktonic communities through time. Although a rise in atmospheric oxygen during the Cambrian has been previously associated with the rapid evolution of metazoans, the ecological challenges related to widespread anoxia must have had a major influence on the evolution of life in Cambrian oceans.

AB  - The opening of the Paleo-Tethys are reconstructed, including the depositional setting and redox conditions, based on an analysis of radiolarian fossils and the geochemistry of a Devonian siliceous succession in the Chiang Dao area of northern Thailand. The succession is subdivided into the following five rock types (in ascending stratigraphic order): black shale (Lower Devonian), siliceous shale (Middle Devonian), tuffaceous chert and tuff (Middle/Upper Devonian), and chert (Upper Devonian). The succession was deposited in continental margin and pelagic environments between the Sibumasu Block and the Indochina-North China blocks. The concentrations of terrestrial-derived elements (Al2O3, TiO2, Rb, and Zr) suggest that the succession (except for the chert) was supplied with terrigenous material and volcanic ash from the adjacent continent, deposited within a SiO2-rich environment. Geochemical indicators of redox conditions (total organic carbon and the Th/U ratio) reveal a gradual change from anoxic to oxic oceanic conditions between the black shale and chert. Taking into account the interpreted depositional setting and redox conditions, the initial Paleo-Tethys developed as a small, closed anoxic-suboxic oceanic basin during the Early to Middle Devonian, located close to the continental margin. Black shale and siliceous shale were deposited in the basin at this time. Opening of the Paleo-Tethys started around the Middle and Upper Devonian boundary, marked by voluminous volcanic activity. The tuffaceous chert was deposited under oxic conditions, suggesting that ash and pumice within the chert were derived from a continental source. After the Late Devonian, the Paleo-Tethys developed as a deep, broad ocean in which pelagic chert was deposited. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development of social relationships and functional independence. As such, interventions that target the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functional decline and restore functioning to pre-illness levels. In this entirely remote study, people with recent-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of PRIME (personalized real-time intervention for motivational enhancement), a mobile-based digital health intervention designed to improve motivation and quality of life. Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline, post-trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks, WL participants received PRIME, resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME, participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post-trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post-trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure). Our results suggest that PRIME has the potential to be an effective mobile-based intervention for improving aspects of mood and motivation in young people with SSDs.

AB  - Benthic and planktonic foraminifera, stable isotopes and other geochemical and sedimentological parameters have been investigated in a sediment core from Vestnesa Ridge (79 degrees N, NW Svalbard margin, 1300 m water depth) in order to reconstruct the palaeoceanographic and palaeoenvironmental evolution of the eastern Fram Strait during the last 14,000 years. Our multiproxy data and, in particular, our high-resolution benthic foraminiferal record allow a detailed reconstruction of the intermediate water flow in the eastern Fram Strait. During the Bolling-Allerod warm interstadials the high proportion of the benthic Atlantic species Cassidulina neoteretis suggests the presence of chilled Atlantic-derived water at the bottom of the Vestnesa Ridge, while the dominance of the polar planktonic species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (s) indicates cold polar surface conditions. During the Younger Dryas cold stadial the inflow of Atlantic-derived water was weakened and of lower temperature compared to the previous interval, as suggested by the increase in the glacio-marine indicator Cassidulina reniforme and the lower percentages of C. neoteretis. After 11,000 cal yr BP the abrupt increase in relative abundance of the benthic species Cibicides wuellerstorfi and Oridorsalis umbonatus, indicates a shift to interglacial conditions with deep convection and generation of cold intermediate water. Warm surface water conditions were finally established at about 10,300 cal yr BP, when Turborotalita quinqueloba became the dominant planktonic species. Generally warmer conditions than today were recorded in the middle Holocene, with a mild cooling at about 8200 cal yr BP and a more pronounced cool interval with an abrupt decrease in T. quinqueloba between 7000 and 6200 cal yr BP. Cold climatic conditions were established around 4100 cal yr BP when N. pachyderma (s) became again the dominant species and the polar benthic species Cribroelphidium excavatum appeared.

AB  - Natural organic matter (NOM) represents a range of heterogeneous hydrophobic and hydrophilic components naturally occurring in the water source and, due to the fact that they can act as precursors for the disinfection, by-products may have a considerable impact on drinking water quality. Coagulation-flocculation (C/F) is among the most applied processes for NOM removal from water sources (especially rivers). In this study, C/F efficiency for a river water supply was investigated in cold and warm conditions, by varying the coagulant dose and mixing conditions. In this study, polyhydroxy aluminum chloride PAX XL 60, and polyacrylamide FloPam AN 910 SEP were used as coagulant and flocculant, respectively. Multiple water quality indicators were determined, such as turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and residual aluminum concentration. Some unconventional parameters relevant for NOM removal were also considered, like absorbance at 254 nm (A254), at 280 nm (A280), and at 365 nm (A365), as well as the ratios A254/DOC, A254/280, and A254/A365. After coagulation-flocculation, turbidity was completely removed in all the studied conditions. The DOC content was reduced by up to 22.65% at a low temperature and by up to 31.81% at a high temperature. After the addition of polyelectrolyte in cold conditions, the efficiency in terms of A254 increased by up to 37.4%, while the specific absorbance decreased. The high molecular weight NOM increased after C/F, based on the A254/A365 ratio. Chemometric analysis was employed in order to determine the effect of the coagulant dose on the process efficiency. The optimum coagulation-flocculation conditions were corroborated by means of the principal component analysis.

AB  - Winter sea-ice conditions are considered important for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba survival and recruitment, yet few broad-scale longitudinal studies have examined the underlying relationships between winter conditions and krill recruitment. We used data from a 4 yr winter study of krill condition (lipid content), diet (stable isotopes and fatty acids), and length distributions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula to examine relationships among environmental variables (annual sea-ice cover, water column chlorophyll a [chl a], and upper mixed-layer water temperature), the condition and diet of krill, and recruitment success the following year. Diet indicators (lipid content, delta N-15, delta C-1(3), and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in post-larvae were consistent among years regardless of sea-ice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought.

AB  - The study assesses the reliability of the description of hydrothermal conditions in the territory of Kalmykia with the use of quantitative climate indicators based on air-temperature and precipitation data that are available in databases and are widely used in climate models. The present study considers the use of the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient, the precipitation-evaporation coefficient, the Thornthwaite aridity index, the Koppen method, and the Holdridge scheme. Quantitative climate indicators were estimated for 1966-2017 based on data on the average monthly air temperature and total monthly precipitation at Yashkul' weather station located in the Chernye Zemli strict nature reserve, which is the most arid part of the Republic. The estimated values of Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient for the considered period corresponded to natural zones of deserts in two cases, semideserts in 19, and steppes in 31. With the precipitation-evaporation coefficient, the climate conditions corresponded to semidesert in 45 cases and steppe in seven. The values obtained with Thornthwaite aridity index were inherent for deserts and hyperarid regions. According to the Holdridge scheme, the hydrothermal conditions matched steppe zones in 25 cases and deserts in 27. The reliability is highest for climate assessments produced with the involvement of Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient, which indicate humid warming in Kalmykia and are supported by material collected via the observation of plant communities that form on the ameliorated lands of Priergeninskaya Plain. The presence of humid warming is also supported by estimates based on the Koppen method, the Holdridge scheme, and, to a lesser degree, the precipitation-evaporation coefficient. The assessment involving the Thornthwaite aridity index points to an intensified climate aridization, which is not in line with the modern dynamics of climate conditions in Kalmykia and is thus not reliable.

AB  - I investigated local and regional differences in percent moss in the feces of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and reindeer or caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in northwestern Alaska, USA, and related fecal moss to forage availability, snow conditions, animal density, and terrain ruggedness on wintering areas. Reindeer are a partially domesticated form of Rangifer tarandus originating from Europe and Asia and differ physiologically and ecologically from caribou. Percent moss in feces of muskoxen differed locally among individual wintering areas. Because of the large local variation in moss content of muskox feces, regional differences between the 2 study areas were difficult to resolve. Percent of moss in the feces of reindeer-caribou did not differ between wintering areas within the same study area but did differ between study areas. On muskox wintering areas, fecal moss correlated negatively with graminoid cover and snow hardness and positively with moss cover and muskox density, but fecal moss did not correlate with snow depth or terrain ruggedness. On reindeer-caribou wintering areas, fecal moss correlated positively with moss availability but not with lichen cover or snow depth or hardness. Because muskox groups in Alaska are isolated from each other in winter, even groups wintering on neighboring hills may face different foraging availability and might, therefore, exhibit differences in growth or productivity. Reindeer-caribou are more mobile than muskoxen in winter, and fecal samples may not be representative of vegetative and snow conditions at the wintering area where I collected them. I conclude that managers can use fecal moss as an indicator of overgrazed ranges, severe snow conditions, or crowded conditions on muskox wintering areas, but that the association between fecal moss and range conditions has to be drawn with caution for the more mobile reindeer-caribou.

AB  - Pedunculate oak (Qercus robur L.) is one of the most important tree species in Croatia. As a dominant species, it covers about 10% of the forested area (about 210 000 ha), which accounts for about 12% of the total growing stock. This tree species is distributed in the lowland and floodplain area of the rivers Drava, Sava and Kupa and their tributaries. Forests of pedunculate oak are managed according to close-to-nature principles and with rotations of over 140 years. In the past 100 years, the management of pedunculate oak forests has been hindered by a serious management and ecological problem: the occurrence of tree dieback and decline. From the management point of view, the problem entails the increased quantity of dead or severely damaged trees, increased management costs and a disturbance in natural forest regeneration. From the ecological point of view, the problem centers around changed site conditions, which is unfavorable for both present and future growth of pedunculate oak trees. In the period from 1995 to 2007, an amount of 35% of the current pedunculate oak volume declined in Croatia, with mortality rising to 40% if the past several years are taken into account. Tree dieback incurs grave financial losses, which reach up to 40% of the potential market value of undamaged and healthy wood mass. The losses are further aggravated by increased costs of managing such forests and reduced non-timber forest functions. The mortality rate of pedunculate oak trees is an indicator of the instability of lowland forest ecosystems, especially when dieback occurs in optimal site conditions for the pedunculate oak (micro-elevations and micro-depressions). Individual, intensive and catastrophic tree dieback has been recorded. Salvage cuts are applied in the attempt to mitigate the effects of disturbances caused by tree dieback. These cuts are undertaken continuously, depending on tree dieback intensity, and are based on the assessment of tree condition. Tree condition is assessed on the basis of tree damage criterion, which comprises crown defoliation and leaf discoloration. These are indicators of lessened tree vitality, but have so far not proved adequate for the reduction of pedunculate oak tree dieback. In order to advance the current condition of forest ecosystems, additional indicators of decreased tree and stand vitality are being sought, and so are the indicators of their disturbed stability. Mortality rates that take into account the volume of dead tree mass are used for this purpose. The objective of this work is to establish spatial distribution of different mortality rates of pedunculate oak trees and assess their correlation with certain ecological factors.
   The research was carried out in three management units (MU) in the Forest Administration of Nova Gradiska. These include MU "Medustrugovi" in Stara Gradiska Forest Office, MU "Zelenika" in Novska Forest Office, and MU "Grede-Kamare" in Jasenovac Forest Office. "Medustrugovi" is situated in the area between the rivulets of Veliki and Mali Strug, the tributaries of the River Sava, "Zelenika" is situated along the Zagreb-Lipovac motorway and north of the rivulet Veliki Strug, and "Grede Kamare" is southeast of Novska between the Strug and the Sava.
   The data gathered involved marked damaged and dead pedunculate oak trees by compartments for the period from 1998-2007. The wood volume of these trees was calculated on the basis of tree diameter and local tariffs. Dead wood mass of every individual compartment was divided with the compartment area to obtain tree dieback per surface unit in the monitoring period (m(3)/ha). Based on the growing stock of pedunculate oak by compartments and wood volume of dead pedunculate oak trees per surface unit, the percentage share of dead wood mass was calculated.
   The wood volume of dead wood mass by compartments (m(3)/ha) was then divided by 10 to obtain the annual volume of dead wood mass of pedunculate oak per hectare. These values were juxtaposed with the current annual increment of pedunculate oak by compartments to obtain the percentage share of dead wood mass in relation to the current annual increment of the compartment.
   Based on the obtained values, every compartment was assigned a degree of wood mass mortality and a degree of increment decline. Wood mass mortality was classified into four degrees: I (0.1-10%, low mortality), II (10.1-25%, moderate mortality), III (25.1-50%, intensive mortality) and IV (50.1-100%, extreme mortality). Increment decline was also classified into four degrees, but with different percentages: I (0.1-25%, low), 11 (25.1-50%, moderate), III (51.1-100%, intensive) and IV (> 100%, extreme).
   Based on the degree of wood mass mortality and degree of increment decline of each single compartment, maps of wood mass mortality rate and of increment decline rate were constructed. In the Management Unit "Medustrugovi", the mortality rate of wood mass by compartments was relatively low. A total of 85 dieback-affected compartments over an area of 1302 ha were analyzed. In 98% of the compartments, low to moderate wood mass mortality rate was recorded (Fig. 2), but no intensive or extreme dieback was found. Rates of increment decline by compartments were unfavorable. Extreme decline was found in 6 compartments over an area of about 30 ha, intensive increment decline was recorded in 12 compartments, i.e., significant reduction in the increment was recorded in over 20% of the compartments (Fig. 3). Intensive and extreme increment decline was found in an area exceeding 260 ha. Compartments with the highest values of wood mass mortality did not manifest the most extreme values of increment decline. The map does not show any significant participation of the compartments with extreme increment decline, although the grouping of the compartments with intensive and extreme decline was observed, and so was their higher participation in the southern part of the management unit along the Strug watercourse.
   In relation to the three study areas, the lowest mortality of wood mass was recorded in the Management Unit of "Zelenika". The research included 50 compartments over an area of 1065 ha. Moderate wood mass mortality was found in 6 compartments and slight mortality in the remaining compartments. Intensive and extreme increment decline was recorded in 10% of the compartments comprising an area of over 100 ha (Fig. 6). The grouping of compartments with a certain degree of increment decline is observed. This refers particularly to degrees II and III of increment decline, which were recorded in the compartments situated in the eastern part of the Management Unit of Zelenika (Fig. 7).
   The highest participation of compartments and sub-compartments with intensive and extreme rates of wood mass mortality was recorded in the Management Unit of "Grede-Kamare". Of a total of 102 dieback-affected compartments and sub-compartments in an area of 1474 ha, wood mass mortality was extreme in 12 compartments and intensive in 30 compartments, in an area of over 570 ha. Moderate and low mortality of wood mass was found in 57% of the compartments (Fig. 8).
   An exceptionally unfavorable condition zoos recorded in relation to the degrees of increment decline. Extreme increment decline was found in over 55% of the compartments; in other words, every second compartment or sub-compartment in the Management Unit of "Grede-Kamare" was afflicted by disturbed stand growth and increment in an area of over 800 ha. Other degrees of increment decline had similar participation by compartments and sub-compartments (Fig. 9). The largest number of compartments and sub-compartments with extreme and intensive increment decline was recorded in the southeastern part of the management unit. They form larger units and are grouped in one part of the management unit in the map (Fig. 10).
   A comparison of increment decline rates by management units reveals the occurrence of intensive increment decline in a smaller number of compartments (10-15% of the compartments), and of extreme decline in fewer than 10% of the compartments in two management units. In one of the management units, extreme increment decline affected more than 50% of the compartments.
   Changes in the sites of pedunculate oak in the last 100 years have affected the stability of these forests and the vitality of trees, which has decreased considerably in recent times. Pedunculate oak trees of lessened vitality are permanently exposed to impact of a variety of adverse factors. This consequently leads to a gradual decline of trees, of which sonic die before the end of the rotation. Dieback of trees aged between 80 and 120 recorded in the Spacva forest area is an important indicator of disturbed growth and development of the most valuable forests in Croatia and a sign of general disturbances in the stability of lowland forests. Intensive tree mortality continues despite management procedures aimed at regulating the structure and quality of the stands. This phenomenon is particularly characterized by an uneven spatial distribution and intensity. In some areas of the pedunculate oak range in Croatia, dieback is the biggest management and ecological forestry problem, since management largely involves damaged and dead trees of pedunculate oak. As a result, the quality of the stands and total wood mass production are severely reduced. Since dead pedunculate oak trees are less exploitable and achieve lower market values, the consequences of tree dieback reflect unfavorably on the entire forestry sector.
   Monitoring the intensity and dynamics of tree dieback in stands is one of the ways to determine certain patterns of this phenomenon and improve the management with forests of disturbed stability. This requires more intensive and regular marking of damaged and dead trees. The most common indicators used for the marking of these trees are morphological features of the crown and biotic damage of the stem. However, these indicators are insufficient for achieving better stand vitality and reducing tree decline and dieback. Hence, spatial distribution of tree dieback by compartments and sub-compartments is one of the possible indicators that can be used in planning the management with stands of lessened vitality.
   Our research found chronic and continuous dieback of pedunculate oak trees, although dieback rates vary by years. Significant spatial differences were also found in the rates of wood mass mortality and increment decline, both among the management units and among their compartments and sub-compartments. Spatial grouping of compartments with intensive and extreme dieback shows correlation with site factors, which are considered the principal causes of dieback. Management with pedunculate oak forests with disturbed stability should be adjusted to the condition of individual ecosystems and to the trends that indicate their development. Presentations of spatial distribution of tree dieback can significantly contribute to this goal.

AB  - Satellite data are a relevant part of information, required for sustainable environmental management, assessment of the impact of economic activity of ecosystems, determination of risks, related to global climate changes, desertification processes, loss of landscape and biotic diversity. Aim. To substantiate the reasonability and prove the efficiency of using satellite data in the agroecologic monitoring system regarding the impact of climate changes on vegetation, processes of soil erosion degradation, and assessment of landscape diversity. Methods. The study was conducted in the territory of Ukraine. It involved the application of SWOT and Gap-analysis methodology, materials of NOAA satellite observations, Sentinel, different spatial resolution, methodological and regulatory provision of the Institute of Agroecology and Environmental Economics of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences regarding satellite monitoring of the structure of agrolandscapes, norms of establishing a network of testing agrarian grounds, list of vegetation state indicators, in particular, "Remote sensing of the Earth from space. Land data about controlling the condition of plantings and performance of agricultural crops. General requirements: DSTU 7307:2013", "Remote sensing of the Earth from space. Ground inspection of plantings. Classifier of objects and functions: SUC 01.1-37-907:2011", "Methodological recommendations on establishing the network of testing agrarian grounds in the system of monitoring of plantings using the materials of cosmic information". The investigation on the impact of climate changes on vegetation state was conducted on the territory of three natural-climatic zones which were geographically represented by Chernihiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia regions respectively. The determination of the threat of erosion degradation of arable lands and landscape diversity was performed on the territory of two administrative districts with high level of ploughness of agrolandscapes, intense agrarian production and manifestation of erosion degradation of lands. Results. Inadequacy of the traditional system of agroecological monitoring was determined. It was proven that it was reasonable to have comprehensive application of satellite data regarding climate warming within the natural climatic zones and its impact on vegetation according to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), erosion degradation of soils and landscape diversity. According to satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the correlation analysis was performed on the connection between the dynamics of the sum of effective temperatures and the sum of NDVI values for the vegetation period. There was positive impact of climate warming on vegetation state according to NDVI index in the zone of Polissia and Forest-Steppe. The correlation coefficients were R = 0.64 and R = 0.77 respectively. In the Steppe zone the correlation coefficient dropped down to R = 0.35 which demonstrated the elevated risk of droughts. Conclusions. Satellite data of Sentinel-1 were used to determine critical zones of erosion degradation of amble lands, requiring preservation and their inclusion to the natural fields, which had a positive impact on the optimization of agrolandscape diversity.

AB  - Background: Poland must fulfill its obligations regarding increasing the share in the production of energy from renewable sources. By 2020, this share for Poland is to amount to a minimum of 15% of green energy consumption in final gross energy consumption. Poland has significant biomass potential that can be used for biogas production. Biogas can be produced in biogas installations installed in landfills, sewage treatment plants or agricultural biogas plants. Literature sources state that in studies of environmental effects concerning the operation of agricultural biogas plants, it is the logistics of the feedstock load that causes the greatest environmental burdens as well as that the distance to which the feedstock is transported significantly affects the growth of global warming potential. In this publication for the first time for Polish conditions will be presented the results of the analysis of logistics aspects and their impact on the ecological impact indicators of four agricultural biogas plants differing in the way the feedstock is provided.
   Methods: The assessment of ecological impact indicators was carried out using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology based on ISO 14040-44 and using the LCIA Impact 2002+ method. In this method 15 impact categories are distinguished to which damage categories: Human health, Ecosystem quality, Climate change and Resources are assigned. Primary data obtained in the tested biogas plants and selected secondary data obtained from the Ecoinvent database v. 3.4 were processed using the SimaPro Ph.D. v. 8.3.0 calculation program. All results are analyzed relative to the functional unit defined as producing 1000 MWh of electricity. The analyzed four agricultural biogas plants are representative examples for particular types of agricultural biogas plants.
   Results: The results of the calculations show that the greatest environmental effects are related to the stage of providing the raw material in biogas installations, mainly due to the long-distance transport of substrates with the use of heavy transportation equipment. The results of the variant analysis show that transporting slurry with a pipeline would allow for 10-fold reduction of environmental damage in relation to BAU, i.e. transport by means of a farm tractor with a barrel.
   Conclusions: The logistics aspects of the operation of selected agricultural biogas plants differing in the way the feedstock is provided are one of the main factors affecting their ecological efficiency. The transport of raw materials, both as to the length of the transport route and the means of transport used, impact on the ecological impact indicators of agricultural biogas plants.
   The obtained positive environmental effects from the production of electricity from biogas are often significantly reduced by inadequate transport of raw materials or their transport over long distances.
   Further work is required to convince the biogas plants operators on the need of proper logistics solutions. Preferably if based on the results of the presented analyzes, they should consider submitting a logistics management system for the flow of raw materials in a biogas plant, to the certification for example in the ISCC system and REDcert.

AB  - The factors governing deposition of silica, organic carbon, and phosphate-rich sediments in high-productivity marine settings are complex. Many fundamental questions regarding seafloor oxygen levels at the time of deposition remain unclear for both modern and ancient examples. This study explores the macrobenthic paleontologic evidence for bottom-water conditions, especially seafloor oxygen levels, across a Cretaceous high-productivity tract in Israel. The lithologic composition, bed thicknesses, macrofaunal content, ichnofabric and bioclastic fabric of a paleohigh, paleolow, and three paleointermediate sections of the Upper Campanian Mishash Formation of southern Israel were described and sampled to establish a regional paleoecologic-paleoceanographic reconstruction.
   Both fine- and coarse-scaled (order of magnitude larger) cyclicity was recognized. Fossil-rich beds (often capped by or containing coarse phosphorites) are stratigraphically positioned at the top boundaries of the fine-scale cycles, which have a thickness of between 1-9 m and contain, in addition, organic-rich carbonates, porcelanites and cherts. Going up-cycle, there is an increase in both grain size and intensity of shell packing, consistent with an increase in bottom water energies or a relative shallowing-up cycle. The up-cycle trend of increasing bioturbation and faunal diversity and abundance observed within the Mishash small cycles reflects an increase in bottom oxygen levels or increase in the duration of individual aerated events associated with variations in upwelling intensity, or both.
   The geographic proximity to the center of the high productivity cell, as well as the nature of the topographic barriers, is represented in two end member basins. The fossiliferous Qazra sub-basin demonstrates the variability of the system moving from laminated barren layers to densely packed ones, whereas the Zin sub-basin (albeit laminated layers) is burrowed and bioturbated, making for the only solid evidence of past macrobenthic life in this setting that lacks shelly intervals.
   The macrofaunal analysis indicates a higher degree and longer duration of seafloor oxygen and energy events than previously recognized from sedimentology/geochemistry alone. Specifically, the macrofaunal remains suggest that seafloor oxygen levels were dysaerobic to fully aerobic. Also, water-energy levels were higher than previously recognized, showing an intensity of seafloor disturbance similar to that of the above storm wave base.
   This new, detailed examination of high-productivity deposits thus reveals the highly dynamic and spatially heterogeneous nature of the Mishash upwelling system. Contrary to thinking of such settings as "dead zones", there is abundant body and trace fossil evidence throughout the record for variable oxygen and variable water energy levels.
   Both the ecologic and the taphonomic utility of macrobenthos are displayed as paleo-seafloor indicators of upwelling regions. Combining all the biogenic constituents observed along the facies tract with taphonomic and the more typical sedimentologic information provides a better tool for reconstruction of the past environment in high-productivity settings.

AB  - The Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) method described in Poff et al. (2010) was applied to streams and small rivers in a large central region of the Potomac River basin in the U.S.A. The area, which is topographically complex, has karst geology, is increasingly urban and has few flow-altering impoundments, allows a test of the flexibility and applicability of the ELOHA method's four steps: build a hydrological foundation, calculate flow alteration, classify streams and develop flow alteration-ecology (FA-E) relationships. A hydrological foundation of baseline (undisturbed) and current (existing) hydrographs was simulated for 747 catchments using the Chesapeake Bay Program Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality Online Object Oriented Meta-Model (WOOOMM) routing module. The outlet of each catchment was associated with one, and sometimes two or more, stream macroinvertebrate sampling sites. Pairing each catchment's simulated current flow with its own simulated baseline flow produced estimates of flow alteration that reflect the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors controlling streamflow in individual catchments. Flow metrics from the baseline and current simulations were compared with observed values from gauged streams in undisturbed and disturbed catchments. The model may have failed to simulate streamflow well in small urbanised catchments on or near karst geology, but observed data were insufficient to fully evaluate model behaviour in these units. Elsewhere, simulated and observed values of 13 of the 15 tested flow metrics generally agreed well. A stream hydrological classification system to account for natural biological variability was not feasible in the study area for two reasons. First, the natural landscape features that most strongly govern undisturbed streamflows (catchment size and karst geology) do not greatly influence undisturbed macroinvertebrate communities. Second, the study area's complex topography ensures that many streams crossed physiographic boundaries or flowed through karst geology before reaching the macroinvertebrate sampling sites. Stream macroinvertebrates responded strongly to alteration in the duration and frequency of both high and low flow events, rise rate, flashiness and magnitude of high flow events. They did not respond to the alteration in middle- and low-magnitude flow metrics, fall rate or extreme low flow frequency. Flow alteration-ecological relationships were developed for combinations of six flow metrics and seven macroinvertebrate metrics using quantile regression and conditional probability methods. Of the seven macroinvertebrate metrics, % scrapers, % clingers and the Chessie BIBI were most affected by flow alteration. Degraded habitat and water quality conditions modify and, if strong enough, conceal the flow alteration-ecological relationships. Water quality and habitat improvements can potentially ameliorate the impacts of flow alteration. Resource managers need to view each stream system holistically and consider all anthropogenic stressors before the impact of existing or future flow alteration can be determined. Overall, the ELOHA approach appears to have worked well in a large river basin with complex topography, karst geology, few flow-altering dams, many urban areas and macroinvertebrates as the ecological response variables.

AB  - Neonates, especially preterm and sick infants, face difficulty controlling their body temperature. Thus, they are nursed inside incubators in order to improve their hygrothermal condition and monitor their body temperature as well as other vital signs. The complex processes of heat and mass transfer between the neonates and the surrounding air and surfaces are the key concerns essential to their growth and survival. Several methods are used in order to better understand the physical phenomena of dry and latent heat losses from neonates and the body-environment interaction occurring during transient clinical processes and in thermoneutrality, which is the optimum thermal environment for neonates nursed inside incubators. These methods can be classified into three main categories: bioheat modeling, computational fluid dynamics and experimental studies. The objective of these methods is to analyze the effect of different ambient conditions, such as air temperature and humidity, incubator wall temperatures and air flow, on the dry heat losses by convection, conduction and radiation and on latent heat losses due to skin evaporation and respiratory process. The main indicators are the metabolic heat generation, skin and core body temperatures. Moreover, based on these methods, different techniques are proposed to enhance the incubator hygrothermal conditions. All these issues are reviewed in this paper and some future recommendations are drawn.

AB  - For more than three decades, foot and musculoskeletal conditions have been documented among both Asian [Elephas maximus] and African [Loxodonta africana] elephants in zoos. Although environmental factors have been hypothesized to play a contributing role in the development of foot and musculoskeletal pathology, there is a paucity of evidence-based research assessing risk. We investigated the associations between foot and musculoskeletal health conditions with demographic characteristics, space, flooring, exercise, enrichment, and body condition for elephants housed in North American zoos during 2012. Clinical examinations and medical records were used to assess health indicators and provide scores to quantitate conditions. Using multivariable regression models, associations were found between foot health and age [P value = 0.076; Odds Ratio = 1.018], time spent on hard substrates [P value = 0.022; Odds Ratio = 1.014], space experienced during the night [P value = 0.041; Odds Ratio = 1.008], and percent of time spent in indoor/outdoor exhibits during the day [P value < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 1.003]. Similarly, the main risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders included time on hard substrate [P value = 0.002; Odds Ratio = 1.050] and space experienced in indoor/outdoor exhibits [P value = 0.039; Odds Ratio = 1.037]. These results suggest that facility and management changes that decrease time spent on hard substrates will improve elephant welfare through better foot and musculoskeletal health.

AB  - Challenges to the reclamation of pyritic mine tailings arise from in situ acid generation that severely constrains the growth of natural revegetation. While acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities are well-studied under highly acidic conditions, fewer studies document the dynamics of microbial communities that generate acid from pyritic material under less acidic conditions that can allow establishment and support of plant growth. This research characterizes the taxonomic composition dynamics of microbial communities present during a 6-year compost-assisted phytostabilization field study in extremely acidic pyritic mine tailings. A complementary microcosm experiment was performed to identify successional community populations that enable the acidification process across a pH gradient. Taxonomic profiles of the microbial populations in both the field study and microcosms reveal shifts in microbial communities that play pivotal roles in facilitating acidification during the transition between moderately and highly acidic conditions. The potential co-occurrence of organoheterotrophic and lithoautotrophic energy metabolisms during acid generation suggests the importance of both groups in facilitating acidification. Taken together, this research suggests that key microbial populations associated with pH transitions could be used as bioindicators for either sustained future plant growth or for acid generation conditions that inhibit further plant growth.

AB  - Behavioural sensitization to psychostimulants may develop context-dependency in certain circumstances. Animals given a stimulant repeatedly in a test cage but not in other environments may show enhanced drug-induced behaviour in the test cage. Conditioning mechanisms have been claimed to be responsible for these phenomena. However, several recent findings are not properly accounted for by conditioning. In addition, growing evidence supports the hypothesis that behavioural sensitization reflects neural changes induced by repeated exposure to psychostimulants (the pharmacological hypothesis). However, the pharmacological hypothesis itself fails to account for environmental influences. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis on the role of environment that is complementary to the pharmacological hypothesis. According to our hypothesis, environment does not have a causal role in the development of sensitization, but it modifies the mode of expression of the sensitized behaviour. Sensitization primarily reflects a neuroadaptive change induced by repeated exposure of the neural system to psychostimulants. However, psychostimulants are known to induce different behaviours in different environments. Therefore, repeated administration of a psychostimulant in different environments would result in augmentation of different behaviours. Our hypothesis potentially accommodates various previous observations. We briefly review the literature and present our hypothesis. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Despite recent modelling approaches integrating the effects of niche-based processes and dispersal-based processes on local plant species composition, their relative importance is still not clear. We test whether the predictability of local species composition from environmental conditions is influenced by dispersal traits. We analyzed a large database with co-occurrence data, using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA) to identify the major environmental determinants of species composition. The percentage of explained variance in occurrence was quantified for individual species with CCA. Effects of life-history traits on the predictability of occurrence patterns were tested by means of regression analysis, using a generalized linear models approach. The results reveal close correlations between species composition and environmental conditions, implying that the predictability of the set of species that might occur in a given environmental setting ("habitat species pool") is high. The habitat species pool, however, reflects the potential species composition, and not the actual local situation. At the level of individual species, a large proportion (>90%) of the variation in occurrence remained unexplained. Predictability of species occurrence patterns was increased by a greater capacity for long-distance dispersal, greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seed bank. The results indicate that the predictability of species composition from environmental conditions is reduced by a few orders of magnitude by dispersal limitation and that poor dispersers are underrepresented.

AB  - A comprehensive study of undisturbed, mostly silty clay samples, taken from large-diameter surface cores collected in the North Atlantic and its bordering seas, shows that measurement of the Atterberg limits, water content, specific gravity of grains and grain-size distribution can provide the basis for predicting many seabed geotechnical and geophysical properties which can lead to a quick assessment of environmental conditions. Thus, the sediment compression curve can be reconstructed, acoustic properties assessed, electrical and thermal resistivities deduced and an indication of the shearing forces, which have affected the sediment, inferred.

AB  - Expatriate is one of the potential sources of knowledge for firms to increase their capability in creating innovation. Currently, Indonesia has a relatively small number of expatriates but the figure tends to increase overtime. This country has experienced a changing nature of expatriation that brings consequences to several conditions for the achievement of successful knowledge transfer (KT) from expatriates to local employee in Indonesian local firms. This paper proposes a new concept namely Knowledge Transfer Readiness (KTR) which is beneficial in helping the firms to deal with the changing nature. Combining grounded research and multiple case studies to apply this concept to the Indonesian local firms, it is argued that not all of the elements in KTR's dimensions must be fulfilled in excellent conditions. Weak elements from the source's side can be surmounted by fulfilling excellent condition of recipient's side, and vice versa. Nevertheless, there are elements that must be fulfilled in excellent condition of both sides, or becomes absolute requirements solely for the expatriates. The fulfillment of KTR's elements influences the relationship qualities between expatriates and local employees to achieve Knowledge Transfer Quality (KTQ). The KTQ includes the amount and the accuracy of knowledge and depth of understanding, so it can be a new option of qualitative indicator to measure the success of KT.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to better understand the conditions that can lead to high and low opportunity entrepreneurship in countries with oil rents. Additionally, the study aims to find out the differences between countries with oil rents and countries without oil rents. Design/methodology/approach A configurational analysis based on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was performed for a sample of 46 countries with oil rents and a sample of 20 countries without oil rents, using Country data from the World Bank World Development Indicators, World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators, KOF Swiss Economic Institute, and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Findings The results show that control of corruption is important to achieve high levels of opportunity entrepreneurship in countries with oil rents and countries without oil rents alike. It is highlighted that the abundance of oil resources in a given country is not a curse, if some conditions are met. Multiple configurations that lead to high levels of opportunity entrepreneurship in countries with oil rents are presented. The study shows that none of the antecedent conditions is necessary per se, it is the combination of conditions that leads to the outcome of interest. The study indicates that either high control of corruption or low taxes should occur, no matter the combination of conditions, to achieve high levels of opportunity entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The relation between control of corruption and entrepreneurship is complex and, in spite of the insights that were gathered herein, much is still to be explored. The coverage rate of the solutions shows that there are countries with high levels of opportunity entrepreneurship that do not fit in any of the obtained configurations. The sample size is also a limitation. Furthermore, to compute the set membership thresholds, the anchors were based on the percentiles, given the lack of theoretical basis to do so. Thus, other methods should also be used in the future, if possible with a larger data sample. Practical implications - The obtained results have implications for policy makers, authorities and potential entrepreneurs. In countries that are oil producers, policy makers aiming to promote opportunity entrepreneurship should take into account that it is the combination of conditions that is important, and not each condition by itself. They should consider that several solutions are possible. Authorities aiming to promote anti-corruption reforms, can leverage the findings of this study to demand for more resources to institute practices and structures to better control corruption, and should articulate among themselves the actions to carry on to improve the level of opportunity entrepreneurship in their country. Potential entrepreneurs can use the findings of this study to ask for anticorruption reforms and tax reforms, and they should use their entrepreneurial talent to try to speed up the change. Originality/value By overlapping streams of research in entrepreneurship, institutions and oil curse, this study makes several contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. Different from extant literature, the study uses a configurational approach and identifies the combinations of conditions that lead to high and low opportunity entrepreneurship in countries with oil rents. The non-linearity of the configurations is highlighted.
   Furthermore, for the first time, the study includes a panel without oil rents in the analysis, which enabled a comparison with the other set of countries and provides new insights about the importance of control of corruption to achieve high levels of opportunity entrepreneurship.

AB  - The debate on whether institutions or geography prevail in driving economic growth has been rife (e.g., Sachs 2003 vs. Rodrik et al. 2004). Most of the empirical analyses delving into this debate have focused on world countries, whose geographical and institutional conditions differ widely. Subnational analyses considering groups of countries with, in principle, more similar institutional and geographical conditions have been limited and tended to highlight that geography is more important than institutions at subnational level. This paper aims to address whether this is the case by investigating how differences in institutional and first-nature' geographical conditions have affected economic growth in Europe's regions in the period 1995-2009. In the analysis we use a newly developed dataset including regional quality of government indicators and geographical characteristics and employ two-stage least squares (2SLS) and instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) estimation techniques with a number of regional historical variables as instruments. Our results indicate that at a regional level in Europe institutions rule. Regional institutional conditions - and, particularly, government effectiveness and the fight against corruption - play an important role in shaping regional economic growth prospects. This does not imply, however, that geography is irrelevant. There is evidence of geographical factors affecting regional growth, although their impact is dwarfed by the overriding influence of institutions.

AB  - Individual tree detection algorithms can provide accurate measurements of individual tree locations, crown diameters (from aerial photography and light detection and ranging (lidar) data), and tree heights (from lidar data). However, to be useful for forest management goals relating to timber harvest, carbon accounting, and ecological processes, there is a need to assess the performance of these image-based tree detection algorithms across a full range of canopy structure conditions. We evaluated the performance of two fundamentally different automated tree detection and measurement algorithms (spatial wavelet analysis (SWA) and variable window filters (VWF)) across a full range of canopy conditions in a mixed-species, structurally diverse conifer forest in northern Idaho, USA. Each algorithm performed well in low canopy cover conditions (< 50% canopy cover), detecting over 80% of all trees with measurements, and producing tree height and crown diameter estimates that are well correlated with field measurements. However, increasing tree canopy cover significantly decreased the accuracy of both SWA and VWF tree measurements. Neither SWA or VWF produced tree measurements within 25% of field-based measurements in high canopy cover (i. e., canopy cover > 50%) conditions. The results presented herein suggest that future algorithm development is required to improve individual tree detection in structurally complex forests. Furthermore, tree detection algorithms such as SWA and VWF may produce more accurate results when used in conjunction with higher density lidar data.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities leading to chemical contamination of soil and global climate change may increase the level of stress for plants. Recent decades studies (mainly two-factors) have reported that the ecotoxicity of soil contaminants could be modified by climate factors. To date, little is known about: the combined climatechemical stress on plants; the interaction of chemicals with high soil moisture conditions; the impact of soil properties on the combined climate-chemical stress and questions regarding the response of organisms to combined effect of all key factors influencing the ecotoxicity of chemicals under field conditions remain unanswered. Our study sought to fill the knowledge gap on the multifactorial interaction of four main factors encounter in polluted areas (soil chemical contamination: heavy metal (Zn); temperature: 10, 23, 35 degrees C, moisture: 55, 80%WHC; soil properties). The assessment of combined effect of multiple stressors based on the multiple ANCOVA model (n = 108; adjusted R-2 = 0.68) and calculated indicators showed: 1) all studied factors significantly interacted and influenced the phytotoxic effect of Zn; 2) Zn modified the plant response to temperature stress depending on moisture conditions and soil properties. This study improves methods for assessing the hazardous effects of soil chemical contamination in the real environment.

AB  - The production of charcoal for metallurgical applications requires careful selection of the wood and control of the pyrolysis conditions to ensure acceptable charcoal quality. The main properties of charcoal to be considered are density, mechanical strength, and reactivity. In this study, charcoal was produced from two types of wood commonly used in the industry, Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus) and Picea abies (spruce), in a pilot scale pyrolysis fixed bed reactor at three temperatures (500, 650 and 800 degrees C) and two solid residence times (0 and 90 min). The yields, composition, apparent density, true density, porosity, carbon structural ordering, friability, compressive strength and CO2 reactivity of the resulting charcoals were analyzed. A new method to test compressive strength was applied to a charcoal bed. Our results show that the nature of the wood has a much greater impact on these values than the pyrolysis operating conditions. Wood apparent density is not a good indicator of the mechanical behavior of charcoal. Despite its higher density, eucalyptus charcoal showed lower mechanical stability than spruce charcoal independently of the pyrolysis conditions. When the final pyrolysis temperature was increased, the mechanical strength, porosity of the charcoal increased and CO2 reactivity decreased. The impact of solid residence time during pyrolysis on the charcoal properties was negligible except for CO2 reactivity, which decreased with an increase in residence time.

AB  - Based on a two-dimensional tidal current mathematical model, this study used the oil particle method to establish an oil spill model in the Quanzhou Bay area to simulate the oil film drift path and degree of impact after the oil spill under various tidal conditions, i.e., the maximum flood, spring tide, maximum ebb and low tide in a tidal cycle under conditions of calm wind, the prevailing northeasterly wind in winter and the prevailing southwesterly wind in summer. The simulation results indicate that the drift trajectory of oil film in the Quanzhou Bay area was primarily influenced by the position of the oil spill point, wind conditions and tide when the oil spill occurred: marine areas of approximately 40-117 km(2), 18-117 km(2), and 51-159 km(2) were affected by the oil film in 12 hours in a NE wind-driven current in winter, a SW wind-driven current in summer, and calm wind conditions, respectively. This study provides the scope and degree of influence of possible oil spill accidents in the Quanzhou Bay area and the time intervals between when an oil spill occurs and when sensitive targets become affected. This work offers scientific support for decision making and environmental damage assessment for oil spill emergencies, as well as useful exploration criteria for the accurate simulation of oil spill diffusion at sea.

AB  - Jarosite occurs within altered tephra from the saline-alkaline paleolake deposits of Pliocene-Pleistocene Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Zeolites (mainly phillipsite), authigenic K-feldspar, and Mg/Fe-smectites dominate the mineral assemblage, indicating saline-alkaline diagenetic conditions (pH > 9). As jarosite is ordinarily an indicator of acidic conditions on Earth and Mars, its association with such undisputed high-pH indicators is unexpected. Of 55 altered tephra samples collected from the paleolake basin and margin deposits, eleven contained jarosite detectable by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) (> 0.15%). Mossbauer spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Reflectance (FTIR), Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses confirm the presence and nature of the jarosite. This paper documents this occurrence and presents mechanisms that could produce this unusual and contradictory mineral assemblage. We favor a mechanism by which jarosite formed recently, perhaps as modern ground and meteoric water interacted with and oxidized paleolacustrine pyrite, providing local and temporary acidic conditions. However, local groundwater (at modern springs) has a pH > 9. In recent studies of Mars, the presence of jarosite or other Fe or Mg sulfates is often used to indicate dominantly acidic conditions. Regardless, the current study shows that jarosite can form in sediments dominated by alkaline minerals and solutions. Its coexistence with Mg/Fe smectites in particular makes it relevant to recent observations of Martian paleolakes.

AB  - We determined if callose formation in 1-cm-long root apices of European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) seedlings is affected by naturally occurring high concentrations of aluminum (Al) under laboratory conditions and by low base saturation (BS) of soils under forest field conditions. Under controlled conditions in the laboratory, seedlings were treated with simulated soil solutions in the presence or absence (control) of Al. One day after exposing seedlings to a simulated soil solution containing 168 mu M Al, callose formation in the root apices had increased significantly. After 7 days, callose concentration in root apices was significantly correlated with the concentration of free Al3+ ions recovered in the simulated soil solution and with the concentration of Al in fine roots. At four field sites in southern Switzerland, seedlings were grown for five months in either A-horizon soil with a BS above 17% or in a B-horizon soil with a BS below 5%. Callose concentrations were significantly higher in root apices in the B horizon than in the A horizon. Callose concentrations in root apices were negatively correlated with Ca/Al molar ratio in fine roots. We conclude that callose in the root apices of European chestnut could be a useful physiological parameter for assessing Al toxicity under both laboratory and field conditions.

AB  - A collection composed of 170 kidney stones, 89 dental deposits, and 120 gallstones of patients from the Omsk region is examined using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The analysis of the experimental data demonstrates that kidney stones contain 36 elements, dental deposits involve 14 elements, and gallstones include 13 elements. The elemental composition of saliva and bile samples is determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The inference is made that the obtained data on the microelemental composition of pathogenic minerals can serve as an indicator of ecological conditions of the region.

AB  - The neutral red assay (NRA) was evaluated as an indicator of stress response in mussels that were held under various culture situations. The NRA measures retention time of neutral red dye in the hemocyte organelle, the lysosome, which can be correlated to the condition of a mussel under stressful circumstances. Shelf life and standard meat yield also provide an indication of mussel condition. The objectives of this study are to compare and evaluate mussel stress response in relation to: (1) seasonal and environmental changes and (2) postharvest handling. Neutral red retention (NRR) levels and shelf life were reduced in late summer mussels (postspawning) compared with early summer mussels (prespawning), and increased in autumn/early winter mussels, indicating a seasonal pattern of stress response associated with reproduction. Harvested mussels exhibited a decrease in NRR during extended air exposure, especially when held at air temperatures above and below air temperatures comparable to ambient water temperatures. The results demonstrated that NRA was a useful, sensitive index of physiological stress response in mussels subjected to various culture practices and conditions. The implication of this work for mussels growers is that reduced air exposure following harvest and reduced handling during certain seasons will result in less stressed mussels and hence a better quality product.

AB  - In many mutualisms, benefits in the form of food are exchanged for services such as transport or protection. In the marine cleaning mutualism, a variety of 'client' reef fishes offer 'cleaner' fish Labroides dimidiatus access to food in the form of their ectoparasites, where parasite removal supposedly protects the clients. Yet, the health benefits individual clients obtain in the long term from repeated ectoparasite removal remain relatively unknown. Here, we tested whether long-term reduced access to cleaning services alters indicators of health status such as body condition, immunity and the steroids cortisol and testosterone in four client damselfish species Pomacentrus amboinensis, Amblyglyphidodon curacao, Acanthochromis polyacanthus and Dischistodus perspicillatus. To do so, we took advantage of a long-term experimental project in which several small reefs around Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) have been maintained cleaner-free since the year 2000, while control reefs had their cleaner presence continuously monitored. We found that the four damselfish species from reef sites without cleaners for 13 years had lower body condition than fish from reefs with cleaners. However, immunity measurements and cortisol and testosterone levels did not differ between experimental groups. Our findings suggest that clients use the energetic benefits derived from long-term access to cleaning services to selectively increase body condition, rather than altering hormonal or immune system functions.

AB  - As animal welfare has become a major societal concern since the last decades, identifying the factors affecting it, is of first importance. Many studies have been conducted, mostly centred on one particular environmental factor. However, animal welfare is multifactorial, and evaluating the management as a whole seems more appropriate. In this particular study, we aimed to identify environmental parameters impacting riding school horses' welfare. We focused here on four reliable welfare indicators (presence of wounds, stereotypic/abnormal repetitive behaviours, ear position and depressed-like posture) and recorded sixteen intrinsic (e.g. sex, age, type) and extrinsic (housing, feeding, social and working conditions) factors of impact. Using logistic regression models, we could identify and classify the management parameter according to their impact on the different welfare indicators and we were able to identify characteristics of good and bad management practices. Besides confirming the importance of feeding and housing conditions, our study is the very first to show that working conditions in developed countries have a crucial impact on several aspects of equines' welfare, and that horses might be less resilient to inappropriate living conditions than ponies. This study leads to the identification of characteristics of "good" and "bad" management practices as a whole, based on scientific evidences on a large sample of horses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to assess a hybrid desiccant air conditioning system to provide cooling, heating, and water demand for hot and humid regions using multi-response optimization from the energy, economic, and environmental (3E) perspective. A solar heating system was used to provide the thermal energy required to regenerate the desiccant material. A thermal energy storage unit packed with phase change materials was considered to enhance the solar contribution during periods of low solar radiation. Furthermore, exhaust air of the regeneration process was used to harvest the moisture content of the air to produce fresh water. Using response surface methodology (RSM), a series of novel correlations were achieved for predicting resource consumption, provided thermal comfort, economic, and environmental indicators over the system's lifespan. The results of the dynamic evaluation reveal that the proposed optimum system achieves a higher solar fraction while using a smaller solar collector area. Moisture harvesting is also capable of producing 70% higher water than the system's consumption. The findings show a significant improvement in all 3E indicators compared to reference systems. Moreover, overall results indicate that dynamic and 3E approaches should be employed to achieve the foremost design for desiccant air conditioning systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To tolerate harsh climatic conditions, olive tree Chetoui has developed some anatomic, physiologic and biochemical mechanisms The aim of this study was to determine the indicators of stress in leaves, stems and roots growing under various climatic conditions. To protect against stress conditions this cultivar increased cuticle thickness, protective structures and building parenchyma tissues of leaves, woods and roots from the North to the South. The volatile compounds, extracted from northern and southern Chetoui leaves and roots, were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Great changes in volatiles were illustrated in the studied organs, by enrichment in phenolics and fatty acids for leaves and in hydrocarbons for roots of southern Chetoui. Also, a reduction in terpenes, alcohols and carbonylic compounds was noted in both southern samples Moreover, minerals of all organs of Chetoui, varied in content and allocation, but their levels are the highest in leaves. The changes in volatiles might be affected by changes in the mineral elements uptake or accumulation under environment stress. A significant correlation was noted between phenolic compounds and sodium, nitrogen, and calcium contents. However, terpenoids was highly correlated with phosphorus content for all organs and studied areas. The detection of new volatiles, anatomical and mineral changes seem to be efficient indicators of adaptation of Chetoui to environment stress conditions.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll (Chl) is emphasized as an indicator for photosynthesis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). SPAD greenness meters are used to predict extractable Chl, but few studies have evaluated relationships between flag leaf greenness and Chl among wheat genotypes. Sixteen spring wheat genotypes with similar development patterns were studied in eight environments (2 years, 2 irrigation treatments and 2 sowing times) to investigate the precision of the SPAD-502 meter to predict Chl content/concentration. Relationships of Chl with SPAD greenness generally best fit linear and quadratic models. Relationships of SPAD greenness with Chl concentration were weak and inconsistent. Strongest associations were observed with Chl(a) content (highest R-2 = 0.71 under late sowing), whereas associations with Chl(b) content were weak (highest R-2 = 0.46) or insignificant. Relationships between SPAD greenness and total Chl content ranged from low (R-2 = 0.24, p = 0.054) to moderate (R-2 = 0.64,p < 0.001) under rainfed conventional-sowing and late-sowing conditions in the second year, respectively. SPAD greenness can be used to diagnose spring wheat genotypes differing in flag leaf Chl(a) and total Chl content under warm Mediterranean conditions, but may not always applicable in cooler Mediterranean conditions, where genetic variability, especially in Chl(b), was not expressed adequately.

AB  - Enzymes representing a variety of metabolic pathways were examined in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected from a metal-contaminated region (Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada) to determine which were most closely related to fish condition factor, pyloric caeca weight, and visceral lipid accumulation, as well to seek a better understanding of the influence of metal contamination on the physiology and biometrics of perch. Compared to laboratory fish, wild perch were under important energy restrictions. The condition factor of wild fish was correlated with indicators of aerobic metabolism (citrate synthase, cytochrome C oxidase), protein anabolism (nucleoside diphosphokinase), and indicators of lipid accumulation (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, visceral lipid index). Pyloric caeca weights were well correlated with indicators of protein anabolism, but only when both seasons were examined together, possibly indicating a lag in the response of enzymes to changes in diet. The addition of contaminant stress to existing energy restrictions led to changes in the relationships between enzymes and biometrics, reducing the predictive power of the models for perch in contaminated lakes. The present study broadens our knowledge of the impact of metal contamination on energy accumulation and tissue metabolic capacities in wild perch. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2148-2156.

AB  - To alleviate the effects of increasingly severe environmental conditions and meet the increasing demand for organic agricultural products, this paper studied tomato grafting under low nitrogen conditions in an effort to enhance yield and improve fruit quality by enhancing nitrogen metabolism. In this study, we screened for two tomato genotypes, a high nitrogen use efficiency genotype ('TMS-150') and a low nitrogen use efficiency genotype ('0301111'), using rootstocks from 25 tomato genotypes and studied the effects of tomato grafting on plant yield, fruit quality, nitrogen content, activities of key nitrogen metabolism enzymes, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) under different nitrogen fertilizer conditions. The results showed that the yield of the tomato plants, the activities of key enzymes during nitrogen metabolism, the contents of different forms of nitrogen, and the efficiency of nitrogen use were lower at low nitrogen fertilization levels and higher at higher nitrogen fertilization levels, while the measured indicators were the highest under the N40 nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Grafting tomatoes with high-NUE tomato seedlings as the rootstock resulted in significant increases in the nitrogen content and the activity of key enzymes, enhanced the NUE of tomato plants, increased tomato yield, and improved fruit quality compared to those of the seedlings grafted with low-NUE rootstock. Our results indicate that tomato plants grafted with high-NUE rootstock presented enhanced absorption and utilization of nitrogen and increased plant yield by promoting nitrogen metabolism at different nitrogen levels.

AB  - Antarctic lichens have been used as indicators of climate change for decades, but only a few species have been studied. We assessed the photosynthetic performance of the fruticose lichen Cladonia borealis under natural and laboratory conditions using the PAM fluorescence system. Compared to that of sun-adapted Usnea sp., the photosynthetic performance of C. borealis exhibits shade-adapted lichen features, and its chlorophyll fluorescence does not occur during dry days without rain. To understand its desiccation-rehydration responses, we measured changes in the PSII photochemistry in C. borealis under the average light intensity of dawn light and daylight and the desiccating conditions of its natural microclimate. Interestingly, samples under daylight and rapid-desiccation conditions showed a delayed reduction in Fv'/Fm' and rETRmax, and an increase in Y(II) and Y(NPQ) levels. These results suggest that the photoprotective mechanism of C. borealis depends on sunlight and becomes more efficient with improved desiccation tolerance. Amplicon sequencing revealed that the major photobiont of C. borealis was Asterochloris irregularis, which has not been reported in Antarctica before. Collectively, these results from both field and laboratory could provide a better understanding of specific ecophysiological responses of shade-adapted lichens in the Antarctic region.

AB  - The degree of soil compaction is intensified by its inadequate management, compaction being variable depending on soil type since even under identical management conditions, different types have different abilities to withstand load. The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility to compaction of different classes of soils under no-tillage (NT) croping system compared to the original condition. Thus, i) soils with the same source material have distinct resistance to compression with increased NT adoption time; ii) the most sensitive indicators of this change are the ratios mass: volume and volume: volume and; iii) there is a relationship between resistance and compaction susceptibility with the amount and type of oxide. Soil samples were collected in areas under NT and under natural condition in order to assess the impact imposed by the NT on the attributes density and porosity, precompression stress and compressibility index and relate them to the oxide type of, and content in, the soils under study. The results show that the density and macroporosity were those most affected by the NT agricultural use, regardless of soil type, that is, its dynamic is related more to soil use and less to mineralogical characteristics. The soil resistance and compaction susceptibility were higher in soil developed in basalt, followed by those developed in sandstone and granite. Both the organic matter content and type and concentration of iron oxides were related to the soil resistance and susceptibility to compaction.

AB  - Degradation analysis is critical to reliability assessment and operational management of complex systems. Two types of assumptions are often adopted for degradation analysis: (1) single degradation indicator and (2) constant external factors. However, modern complex systems are generally characterized as multiple functional and suffered from multiple failure modes due to dynamic operating conditions. In this paper, Bayesian degradation analysis of complex systems with multiple degradation indicators under dynamic conditions is investigated. Three practical engineering-driven issues are addressed: (1) to model various combinations of degradation indicators, a generalized multivariate hybrid degradation process model is proposed, which subsumes both monotonic and non-monotonic degradation processes models as special cases, (2) to study effects of external factors, two types of dynamic covariates are incorporated jointly, which include both environmental conditions and operating profiles, and (3) to facilitate degradation based reliability analysis, a serial of Bayesian strategy is constructed, which covers parameter estimation, factor-related degradation prediction, and unit-specific remaining useful life assessment. Finally, degradation analysis of a type of heavy machine tools is presented to demonstrate the application and performance of the proposed method. A comparison of the proposed model with a traditional model is studied as well in the example. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Megacities are facing serious water pollution problems due to urbanization, rapid population growth and economic development. Water is an essential resource for human activities and socio-economic development and water quality in urban settings has important implications for human and environmental health. Urbanization and lack of sewerage has left the water in Jakarta, Indonesia in a heavily polluted condition. Rigorous assessment of urban water quality is necessary to understand the factors controlling water quality conditions. We use trend analysis to assess the current water quality conditions in Jakarta, focusing on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). In most monitoring stations analyzed, BOD and TSS concentrations have decreased over time, but from large starting concentrations. DO in most monitoring stations has increased. Although Jakarta's water quality has shown some improvement, it remains heavily impaired. The average value of BOD is low in upper stream stations compared to middle and lower stream stations. BOD and TSS trends of some water quality stations in middle and lower streams show increasing trends. Cluster analysis results suggest three groups for BOD and TSS, and four groups for DO. Understanding water quality conditions and factors that control water quality suggest strategies for improving water quality given current trends in climate, population growth and urban development. Results from this study suggest research directions and management strategies to address water quality challenges.

AB  - The ecomorphological aspects of murine rodent dentition were analyzed by comparing the relationship between fossils and their extant counterparts. Another aspect explored is the broad correlation of species richness vs rainfall and temperature data of an area. Integration of these results has provided a broad picture of the monsoonal conditions (rainfall, temperature and vegetation) prevailing during the Late Middle Miocene to Late Miocene (13-6.4 Ma) and Pliocene (similar to 5-1.8 Ma) times in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. Terminal Pleistocene Kurnool Cave murine fauna also provides some clues regarding the past climatic conditions in this part of Andhra Pradesh. The results indicate that the Late Miocene possibly had monsoonal conditions quite different from that of the present day, as none of the extant taxa cluster with the Late Miocene taxa. The northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent received rainfall between 1000 and 2000 mm in the Early Pliocene (5-4 Ma) and that in the Late Pliocene was between 2000 and 4000 mm. Late Pliocene diversity of murine rodents reflects the existence of a diverse spectrum of ecological niches, mainly open grassland/savanna conditions interspersed with dry/wet deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. Terminal Pleistocene around Kurnool Caves (Andhra Pradesh) was relatively drier compared to the Pliocene with rainfall ranging between 600 and 1000 mm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Loading, transport, unloading, lairage and stunning are the principle ante-mortem events that generate negative responses associated with stress in pigs. For this reason, it is important to verify the condition of animals throughout the supply chain in order to ensure their welfare and obtain, at the end of the slaughtering process, high-quality carcases and meat. Several studies have identified the indicators and samples that need to be taken into account to properly measure and evaluate the responses that these animals emit to the stressors involved. However, these procedures must be carried out quickly and by non-invasive means so as not to impede the flow of animals through the operations of loading, transport, unloading and lairage. Therefore, the objective of this review article is to analyse the stressful events that pigs experience during these events and discuss the use of the infrared thermography (IRT) as an alternative tool for measuring stress based on temperature changes on the surface of pigs' skin. We argue that infrared thermography can be used as a strategy to improve animal welfare during loading, transport, unloading and lairage by preventing fatigue and deaths, and decreasing negative impacts on meat quality, such as pale, soft and exudative (PSE), or dark, firm and dry (DFD) conditions.

AB  - The focus of this study is the reconstruction of Holocene limnic conditions of playa lakes in central Spain using inorganic components of their sediments. It is demonstrated that the mineralogical sediment characters provide valuable paleoenvironmental information: If dolomites originate from authigenic precipitation or early diagenetic dolomitization, the Mg-Ca-ratio of dolomites, derived from the position of dolomite's major X-ray diffraction line, turns out to be an indicator for the reconstruction of paleosalinity. In contrast, the concentrations of carbonates and sulphatic evaporites and their changing proportion to siliciclastic sediments point to changing depositional environments. The comparison of investigations from different playa lakes and drainage basin systems shows that the interpretation of mineralogical sediment features always has to consider the petrographic, hydrologic, and geomorphic features of the catchment. As for the lacustrine sediments investigated there are no data available yet, a preliminary chronological Framework is derived by comparison with results from neighbouring areas. Based on this the hypothesis is put forward that during the so-called Little Ice Age subhumid environmental conditions occurred over the central part of the Iberian Peninsula, while today climatic conditions are dry-subhumid to subarid. Also for times older than the Subatlantic distinct changes of environmental conditions are noticed, but various hiatuses in the sediments make correlation difficult.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates are a major link in food webs in temporary ponds and useful indicators of wetlands'ecological integrity. We investigated the available trophic resources and the physicochemical quality of 14 wetlands frequented by glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), a resident species with an increasing population in Numidia, northeast Algeria. Sampling of temporary ponds was carried out in winter and early spring, prior to the Glossy Ibis' breeding period. Analyses indicated that the studied waterbodies contained a rich and diversified aquatic community, dominated mainly by insects and molluscs and characterized by a spatio-temporal change in composition and abundance, reflecting a spatial heterogeneity and a temporal niche partitioning of various members of the aquatic community. Furthermore, the density of Glossy Ibis in foraging areas changed seasonally and declined significantly with the distance to the nearest roost. In the context of climate change and human encroachment, the close dependence of Glossy Ibis and other waders on a matrix of secure roosts and temporary ponds during the nonbreeding season puts them in jeopardy unless these imperilled but generally unprotected habitats are actively managed.

AB  - Several hypotheses, including habitat degradation and variation in fluvial geomorphology, have been posed to explain extreme spatial and temporal variation in Clinch River mollusk assemblages. We examined associations between mollusk assemblage metrics (richness, abundance, recruitment) and physical habitat (geomorphology, streambed composition, fish habitat, and riparian condition) at 10 sites selected to represent the range of current assemblage condition in the Clinch River. We compared similar geomorphological units among reaches, employing semi-quantitative and quantitative protocols to characterize mollusk assemblages and a mix of visual assessments and empirical measurements to characterize physical habitat. We found little to no evidence that current assemblage condition was associated with 54 analyzed habitat metrics. When compared to other sites in the Upper Tennessee River Basin (UTRB) that once supported or currently support mollusk assemblages, Clinch River sites were more similar to each other, representing a narrower range of conditions than observed across the larger geographic extent of the UTRB. A post-hoc analysis suggested stream size and average boundary shear stress at bankfull stage may have historically limited species richness in the UTRB (p < 0.001). Associations between mollusk assemblages and physical habitat in the UTRB and Clinch River currently appear obscured by other factors limiting richness, abundance, and recruitment.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of species distribution and abundance has been at the core of ecology. In general, these patterns are determined by species dispersion as well as by abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Similarly, host-parasite relations and the structure of parasite assemblages are also shaped by environmental conditions and landscape composition. Herein, we assessed the influence of environmental variables and parasite species dispersion on the structure of helminth parasites communities in the frog Leptodactylus podicipinus. We sampled 10 ponds and recorded area, depth, altitude, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, and extent of soil, water, and vegetation cover as well as the distances between the ponds. We collected 121 frogs and found 9 helminth taxa; 2 of them were core species (prevalence higher than 50%), which contributed to the relatively high similarity observed among the ponds. Most of the helminths showed some variation in the frequencies of occurrence among communities from different ponds. The change in species composition among ponds was explained by the environmental variables but not by the distance between the ponds. Moreover, the results indicated that local processes (variation in environmental conditions) were more important than the regional processes (species distribution) in determining the structure of parasite communities. The variation in helminth communities among ponds in response to moderate differences in pond environmental characteristics points to the potential of helminth species as indicators of environmental conditions.

AB  - Anthrax outbreaks in white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, are frequent in west Texas, USA, particularly across the Edwards Plateau. However, the outbreak severity varies among years. We summarize the outbreak history in white-tailed deer at a ranch north of Del Rio, Texas, from 2001 to 2010 and compare mortality rates to remotely sensed vegetation indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data. It has long been posited that the occurrence of mid- to high-latitude epizootics is associated with hot, dry summer conditions preceded by a wet spring, with cases occurring after summer rain events. Here we employed vegetation green-up indices as a proxy for such environmental conditions. Annual trajectories of vegetation indices identified a clear pattern of early green springs with dry summers in severe outbreak years. In contrast, later, less intense spring green-up with greener summers were associated with enzootic mortality years, when few cases occurred. There was a statistically significant difference in the annual timing and intensity of spring green-up from vegetation indices for epizootic and enzootic years. Years with epizootics have early, intense spring conditions, whereas enzootic years have low-intensity green-up. These results suggest that early green-up signatures may be useful in identifying epizootic climatic conditions ahead of the summer anthrax period. Such analyses are required to ultimately develop an early warning system for wildlife managers and veterinary public health officials.

AB  - An in situ methodology based on covalently bonded redox indicators has been developed for determining when sulfate-reducing conditions exist in environmental samples. Three immobilized redox indicators [thionine (Thi, formal potential at pH 7 (E-7(o)') equals 52 mV), cresyl violet (CV, E-7(o)' = -81 mV), and phenosafranine (PSaf, E-7(o)' = -267 mV)] were tested for their response to sulfide in synthetic solutions and under sulfate-reducing conditions in wastewater slurries. The byproduct of the sulfate-reducing process, sulfide, was found to Couple Well to CV in the concentration range of 1-100 mu M total Sulfide ([S(-11)]) and the pH range of 6-8. Thi, the indicator with the highest formal potential, reacts rapidly with sulfide at levels well below 1 mu M while PSaf, the indicator with the lowest Formal potential, does not couple to sulfide at levels in excess of 100 mu M [S(-11)]. The degree of reduction of the indicators (i.e., the fraction of cresyl violet oxidized) in contact with a given level of sulfide can be modeled qualitatively with an equilibrium expression for [S(-11)]-indicator based on the Nernst equation assuming that rhombic sulfur is the product of sulfide oxidation. In a groundwater sample with dechlorinating microbes, reduction of Thi and partial reduction of CV correlated with dechlorination of TCE to cis-DCE. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The residual strength of components can be abruptly reduced due to multiple site damage (MSD). In general, the fatigue and fracture performance of MSD contains a significant number of uncertainties. Major uncertainties can be characterized by initial flaw, material variability and crack growth rates, among other factors. To cope with uncertain random variables, some probabilistic methods can be considered. However, these seldom obtain efficient and reliable results because of the complexities included in computations of fatigue and fracture mechanics, and probabilistic approaches. To overcome these difficulties in the life-cycle reliability analysis of MSD, the Gaussian process (GP) response surface model has been assembled with one of the recent multiple crack analysis tools, XFEM, in this study. The assembled GP-XFEM method represents a convenient way to obtain the response surface and sensitivity factors of multiple crack propagation in a structure (or a component) under a complex environment with computational efficiency. The accuracy and advantages of the proposed method were verified by a number of experimental results and numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many ski resorts worldwide are going through deteriorating snow cover conditions due to anthropogenic warming trends. As the natural and the artificially supported, i.e., technical, snow reliability of ski resorts diminish, the industry approaches a deadlock. For this reason, impact assessment studies have become vital for understanding vulnerability of ski tourism. This study considers three resorts at one of the rapidly emerging ski destinations, Northeast Turkey, for snow reliability analyses. Initially one global circulation model is dynamically downscaled by using the regional climate model RegCM4.4 for 1971-2000 and 2021-2050 periods along the RCP4.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway. Next, the projected climate outputs are converted into indicators of natural snow reliability, snowmaking capacity, and wind conditions. The results show an overall decline in the frequencies of naturally snow reliable days and snowmaking capacities between the two periods. Despite the decrease, only the lower altitudes of one ski resort would face the risk of losing natural snow reliability and snowmaking could still compensate for forming the base layer before the critical New Year's week. On the other hand, adverse high wind conditions improve as to reduce the number of lift closure days at all resorts. Overall, this particular region seems to be relatively resilient against climate change.

AB  - Korean peninsula weather is rapidly becoming subtropical due to global warming. In summer 2018, South Korea experienced the highest temperatures since the meteorological observations recorded in 1907. Heat stress has a negative effect on Holstein cows, the most popular breed of dairy cattle in South Korea, which is susceptible to heat. To examine physiological changes in dairy cows under heat stress conditions, we analyzed the profiles circulating microRNAs isolated from whole blood samples collected under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions using small RNA sequencing. We compared the expression profiles in lactating cows under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions to understand the regulation of biological processes in heat-stressed cows. Moreover, we measured several heat stress indicators, such as rectal temperature, milk yield, and average daily gain. All these assessments showed that pregnant cows were more susceptible to heat stress than non-pregnant cows. In addition, we found the differential expression of 11 miRNAs (bta-miR-19a, bta-miR-19b, bta-miR-30a-5p, and several from the bta-miR-2284 family) in both pregnant and non-pregnant cows under heat stress conditions. In target gene prediction and gene set enrichment analysis, these miRNAs were found to be associated with the cytoskeleton, cell junction, vasculogenesis, cell proliferation, ATP synthesis, oxidative stress, and immune responses involved in heat response. These miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers for heat stress.

AB  - Late Quaternary paleoceanographic changes at the Lomonosov Ridge, central Arctic Ocean, were reconstructed from a multicore and gravity core recovered during the 2014 SWERUS-C3 Expedition. Ostracode assemblages dated by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) indicate changing sea-ice conditions and warm Atlantic Water (AW) inflow to the Arctic Ocean from similar to 50 ka to present. Key taxa used as environmental indicators include Acetabulastoma arcticum (perennial sea ice), Polycope spp. (variable sea-ice margins, high surface productivity), Krithe hunti (Arctic Ocean deep water), and Rabilimis mirabilis (water mass change/AWinflow). Results indicate periodic seasonally sea-ice-free conditions during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (similar to 57-29 ka), rapid deglacial changes in water mass conditions (15-11 ka), seasonally sea-ice-free conditions during the early Holocene (similar to 10-7 ka) and perennial sea ice during the late Holocene. Comparisons with faunal records from other cores from the Mendeleev and Lomonosov ridges suggest generally similar patterns, although sea-ice cover during the Last Glacial Maximum may have been less extensive at the new Lomonosov Ridge core site (similar to 85.15 degrees N, 152 degrees E) than farther north and towards Greenland. The new data provide evidence for abrupt, large-scale shifts in ostracode species depth and geographical distributions during rapid climatic transitions.

AB  - Despite the increasing production and use of nanoparticles (NPs), there is a lack of knowledge about their environmental fate and ecotoxicity. Studies in environmentally relevant conditions are necessary to better assess these parameters, but such studies are rather rare. The present work represents first time that studies on engineered NPs using environmentally relevant exposure methods have been reviewed. These exposure methods differ from standardized protocols and can be classified into three groups: experimental trophic chains that allow study of the trophic route, multi-species exposures under laboratory conditions that allow for complex but controlled exposure and outdoor exposures that are more similar to environmentally realistic conditions. The majority of studies of micro- or mesocosms have focused on NP partitioning and bioaccumulation. The other major parameter that has been studied is NP ecotoxicity, which has been assessed in single species, in single species via the trophic route, and at the community level. The induction of biochemical defense systems, immunomodulation, effects on growth and reproduction, behavioral alterations and mortality have been used as indicators of major toxicity, depending on the species studied. The major effects of NPs on both microbial and algal communities include modifications of community compositions and diversities, decreased biomass and changes in community activities.

AB  - In healthcare management, the volume of patient data generated from various medical devices used for patient monitoring. Increasing healthcare data is persisted in distributed database available in cloud, for sharing among medical experts. Cloud provides most excellent methods to explore the organized and unorganized data prepared from healthcare management systems. By analyzing the healthcare data, the health conditions and the treatment methods are predicted for future treatment. Yet, the existing design could not sustain both analysis and procedure for huge quantity of multi-organized healthcare data. In this paper, it is aimed to provide a cognitive technology for efficient monitoring and transmission of medical data in a healthcare industry. To do that, a Cognitive Data Transmission Method (CDTM) is proposed for monitor, record and transmit the data patient's health related data. A highest priority is assigned in data transmission, when the health condition is critical, which can be identified from the data-packet information. The cognitive nature is obtained using Simulated Annealing method. Finally, a stochastic prophesy representation is intended to predict the future health condition of the most related patients based on their present health conditions. Performance assessment of the planned procedure is recognized through general model in the cloud surroundings, that ensures 98% accurateness of prediction and sustain 99% of CPU and bandwidth consumption to decrease the analysis time (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) policy and strategy recommend the use of a 'Defence MODified' version of the Health and Safety Executive Management Standards Indicator Tool to help managers identify risks of work-related stress among Defence personnel. The Defence MODified Tool ('Stress Indicator Survey') asks personnel to rate their perceptions of eight working conditions known to be significantly associated with work-related stress. MOD psychologists are developing a Defence norm group against which future survey scores can be compared. This article describes the use of the Stress Indicator Survey in MOD and gives an overview of findings from 2016 to 2018.
   Method MOD psychologists conducted 27 Stress Indicator Surveys in 2016-2018. Data were collated from 6227 personnel for the Defence norm group and comparisons were conducted between Service personnel and MOD civil servants, and between Services (Royal Navy/Royal Marines (RN/RM), Army and Royal Air Force (RAF)).
   Results Service personnel had significantly more favourable perceptions than MOD civil servants of most working conditions. The RN/RM had significantly more favourable perceptions than either the Army or the RAF of all working conditions. These findings indicate differential risks of work-related stress in different groups of personnel.
   Discussion Possible explanations for the observed differences in risk of work-related stress are discussed, including the nature of military life and planned changes to Defence civilian headcount. Examples of managerial actions to improve working conditions based on individual survey findings are given.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Large airtanker use is widespread in wildfire suppression in the United States. The current approach to nationally dispatching the fleet of federal contract airtankers relies on filling requests for airtankers to achieve suppression objectives identified by fire managers at the incident level. In general, demand is met if resources are available, and the dispatch model assumes that this use is both necessary and effective. However, proof of effectiveness under specific conditions of use in complex environments has not been empirically established. We geospatially intersected historical drop data from the federal contract large airtanker fleet with operational and environmental factors to provide a post hoc assessment of conditions of use for the 2010-12 fire seasons in the conterminous United States. Our findings confirm previous results demonstrating extensive use in extended attack. Additionally, we show that use is generally within guidelines for operational application (aircraft speed and height above ground level) and often outside of environmental guidelines suggestive of conditions conducive for most effective use, including drop timing with respect to response phase (initial attack v. extended attack), terrain, fuels and time of day. Finally, our results suggest that proximity to human populations plays a role in whether airtankers are dispatched, suggesting that prioritisation of community protection is an important consideration. This work advances efforts to understand the economic effectiveness of aviation use in federal fire suppression.

AB  - The sedimentary environments, morphology and formation of carbonate cement in the late glacial glaciofluvial outwash and beach deposits in northern Estonia are discussed. Cementation is observed in well-drained, highly porous carbonaceous debris-rich gravel and sand-forming, resistant ledges in otherwise unconsolidated sediments. The cemented units occur as laterally continuous layers or as isolated lenticular patches with thicknesses from a few centimetres to 3 m. The cement is found in two main morphologies: (1) cement crusts or coatings around detrital grains and (2) massive cement almost entirely filling interparticle pores and intraparticle voids. It is exclusively composed of low-Mg calcite with angular equant to slightly elongated rhombohedral and scalenohedral or prismatic crystals, which indicate precipitation from meteoric or connate fresh surface (glacial lake) water and/or near-surface groundwater under low to moderate supersaturation and flow conditions. The absence of organic structures within the cement suggests that cementation is essentially inorganic. The cement exhibits both meteoric vadose and phreatic features and most probably occurred close to the vadose-phreatic interface, where the conditions were transitional and/or fluctuating. Cementation has mainly taken place by CO2-degassing in response to fluctuations in groundwater level and flow conditions, controlled by the Baltic Ice Lake water level, and seasonal cold and/or dry climate conditions.

AB  - Insight into the pathways of biodegradation and external factors controlling their activity is essential in adequate environmental risk assessment of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon pollution. This study focuses on biodegradation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) in microcosms containing sediment sourced from the European rivers Ebro, Elbe and Danube. Biodegradation was studied under different redox conditions. Reductive dechlorination of 1,2-DCA was observed with Ebro and Danube sediment with chloroethane, or ethene, respectively, as the major dechlorination products. Different reductively dehalogenating micro-organisms (Dehalococcoides spp., Dehalobacter spp., Desulfitobacterium spp. and Sulfurospirillum spp.) were detected by 16S ribosomal RNA gene-targeted PCR and sequence analyses of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries showed that only 2-5 bacterial orders were represented in the microcosms. With Ebro and Danube sediment, indications for anaerobic oxidation of 1,2-DCA were obtained under denitrifying or iron-reducing conditions. No biodegradation of 1,2-DCA was observed in microcosms with Ebro sediment under the different tested redox conditions. This research shows that 1,2-DCA biodegradation capacity was present in different river sediments, but not in the water phase of the river systems and that biodegradation potential with associated microbial communities in river sediments varies with the geochemical properties of the sediments.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was described for otolith length, width and area for two groups of larval and juvenile Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus. The larvae and juveniles (age range: 20-120 days; standard length, L-S, range: 14-35 mm) were separated into the two distinct groups a priori on the basis of their growth indices estimated from residuals of a L-S-at-age model; slow growers had residuals < 8% of the average size at age and fast growers had residuals > 8%. Some indication supporting the fluctuating asymmetry methodology was found when unsigned normalized FA2 index was used for otolith area. That conclusion was not, however, supported by the other method used in this work, i.e. between-group ANCOVA analysis of individual unsigned and not normalized FA1 indices plotted against trait size. These inconsistent results are most probably a consequence of error introduced during FA index normalization (accounting for trait size effect on absolute FA). Although it is concluded here that FA analysis of sagittal otoliths was not effective in describing differences in the natural variability of growth and condition of larval Atlantic menhaden, the possible species- and otolith type-related differences should be considered in the future research on FA.

LA  - English
AB  - The physical dynamics of the northern Benguela upwelling system between July 1981 and August 1987 were investigated by applying standardized Principal Components Analysis to a time-series of 235 mean, weekly sea surface temperature satellite images of the region. The first three principal components accounted for 87% of the total variance in the standardized input images and were the only components retained for interpretation. Principal Component I (PC I) represents the mean spatial structure of the system in terms of relative SST gradients, PC II represents the balance in dominance between inshore-offshore v, longshore SST gradients and PC III highlights patterns associated with the warming of the central Namibian region (19-23 degreesS) in conjunction with the maintenance of cooler conditions to the north and/or south. These results are interpreted within the context of previous findings on the behaviour of the system, and their relevance to clupeoid recruitment is discussed. Strong negative loadings on PC II indicated conditions which would promote the longshore "retention" of clupeoid eggs and larvae and "concentration" of planktonic food across thermoclines and thermal fronts, whereas strong positive loadings on PC III indicated conditions which would promote onshore retention and concentration. Conditions promoting onshore retention would, on occasion, have also been reflected by positive loadings on PC II whenever there was a uniform contraction of the offshore upwelling front, as a result of reduced, but similar, levels of upwelling along the entire coast.

AB  - Altered freshwater inflows have affected circulation, salinity, and water quality patterns of Florida Bay, in turn altering the structure and function of this estuary. Changes in water quality and salinity and associated loss of dense turtle grass and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in Florida Bay have created a condition in the bay where sediments and nutrients have been regularly disturbed, frequently causing large and dense phytoplankton blooms. These algal and cyanobacterial blooms in turn often cause further loss of more recently established SAV, exacerbating the conditions causing the blooms. Chlorophyll a (CHLA) was selected as an indicator of water quality because it is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass, with concentrations reflecting the integrated effect of many of the water quality factors that may be altered by restoration activities. Overall, we assessed the CHLA indicator as being (1) relevant and reflecting the state of the Florida Bay ecosystem, (2) sensitive to ecosystem drivers (stressors, especially nutrient loading), (3) feasible to monitor, and (4) scientifically defensible. Distinct zones within the bay were defined according to statistical and consensual information. Threshold levels of CHLA for each zone were defined using historical data and scientific consensus. A presentation template of condition of the bay using these thresholds is shown as an example of an outreach product. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fly infestation remains a universal problem for dairy cattle herds, affecting the animals' health and welfare status. Pre-weaned dairy calves are significantly challenged by the direct and indirect consequences of severe fly infestation, heat-stress and their interaction, which contribute to a stressful and fatiguing environment. Among several physiological, behavioral, clinical and biochemical traits, serum cortisol (SC) and creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as feed consumption can be used as valid indicators of potential stressful and fatiguing conditions and, therefore, can be efficiently used for stress analysis studies. Hence, the objective of the study was to assess the fly-repellency effect of deltamethrin on pre-weaned dairy calves exposed to heat stress conditions, as well as its association with SC, CK concentrations and feed consumption. Two commercial dairy cattle herds of the Holstein breed in Central Macedonia (Greece) were involved in the study during summer months and under heat stress conditions. Deltamethrin administration resulted in (i) a decreased fly population (100% Musca domestica) landing on pre-weaned dairy calves, (ii) a reduced SC (stress indicator) and CK (fatigue indicator) concentration, and (iii) an increased consumption of feedstuff in deltamethrin treated animals compared to the untreated ones.

AB  - In shallow lakes, algal biomass is a fundamental indicator of eutrophication status. However, the vertical movement of phytoplankton within the water column can complicate the determination of total phytoplankton biomass using remotely sensed data of surface conditions. In this study, we develop, validate, and apply a new approach to use remotely sensed reflectance to estimate the variability of total algal biomass in shallow eutrophic lakes. Using the baseline normalized difference bloom index together with hydrological and bathymetric data, we determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the total algal biomass in Lake Chaohu, a large shallow lake in eastern China under the nonalgae bloom conditions. Over an eleven-year period (2003-2013), the total phytoplankton biomass was highly variable, more than doubling between 2006 and 2007, from 19.95t to 39.50t. The seasonal decomposition of biomass dynamics indicated the highest biomass production occurred in June, while the lowest occurred in April. The estimates of total phytoplankton biomass were both consistent with in situ measurements and consistent for observations made on the same day and on consecutive days. The improved stability and reliability of total biomass estimations provided more complete information about lake conditions with respect to surface concentrations. This has implications for both management and modeling.

AB  - The bacterium Escherichia coli is commonly associated with the presence of faecal contamination in environmental samples, and is therefore subject to statutory surveillance. This is normally done using a culture-based methodology, which can be slow and laborious. Nucleic acid amplification for the detection of E. coli DNA sequences is a significantly more rapid approach, suited for applications in the field such as a point of sample analysis, and to provide an early warning of contamination. An existing, high integrity qPCR method to detect the E. coli ybbW gene, which requires almost an hour to detect low quantities of the target, was compared with a novel, isothermal RPA method, targeting the same sequence but achieving the result within a few minutes. The RPA technique demonstrated equivalent inclusivity and selectivity, and was able to detect DNA extracted from 100% of 99 E. coli strains, and exclude 100% of 30 non-target bacterial species. The limit of detection of the RPA assay was at least 100 target sequence copies. The high speed and simple, isothermal amplification chemistry may indicate that RPA is a more suitable methodology for on-site E. coli monitoring than an existing qPCR technique.

AB  - Time Temperature Integrators (TTI) are simple devices to monitor temperature exposure history and relate it to food shelf life behaviour. Four colorimetric enzyme reaction systems are proposed as the basis for TTI use and results for their kinetic characterisation under isothermal conditions are presented. Nonisothermal experiments have shown that the proposed system response reflected accurately the dynamic nature of the environment temperature. The reliability of the proposed TTI systems was demonstrated by a case study on chilled fish shelf life prediction after storage temperature abuse.

AB  - An investigation of Pinus mugo T u r r a pollen vitality was carried out as a verification phase of the Tatra natural environment monitoring project (MONTAN). The germination capacity and the length of pollen tubes were chosen as the indicators of pollen vitality. The male flower samples were taken from different localities on the Eastern Tatras territory.
   Obtained results did not confirm statistically important differences among localities. By comparing the germination in 1993 and 1994 a remarkable decrease was noted. Individual health condition has seemed to be an important factor for pollen germination.

AB  - There was made the mathematical modeling of river waters pollution dissemination, for example at dumping of oil from the railway bridge across Rioni River (Western Georgia). The information about the quantity of oil, which reached the river outlet, was taken as starting and boundary conditions for modelling of oil dissemination and transformation in the Black Sea waters. The study of the dissemination of oil pollution at possible disastrous oil spill from tankers in the open sea near Kulevi oil terminal was also conducted. For modelling the river pollution the analytical solution of no steady-state diffusion equation in three-dimensional case was used. The study of sea pollution was made on the base of statistic simulation method (Monte Carlo method) - the computer tracing of transfer and transformation of oil portions comparatively coarse particles intwo-dimensional case, the calculation of probabilistic characteristics of these processes. The data were provided about the spatio-temporal evolution of river and sea waters oil pollution. The features and the differences of ecological consequences of oil dumping in winter and summer conditions were marked. The results of the studies were included in the projects on assessment of environment influence of Tengiz oil railway transit over the territory of Georgia and functioning of Kulevi sea oil terminal.

AB  - The study of particulate organic matter (OM) in Arctic Ocean sediments from the late Cretaceous to the Eocene (IODP Expedition 302) has revealed detailed information about the aquatic/marine OM fluxes, biological sources, preservation and export of terrestrial material. Here, we present detailed data from maceral analysis, vitrinite reflectance measurements and organic geochemistry.
   During the Campanian/Paleocene, fluxes of land-derived OM are indicated by reworked and oxidized macerals (vitrinite, inertinite) and terrigenous liptinite (cutinite, sporinite). In the early Eocene, drastic environmental changes are indicated by peaks in aquatic OM (up to 40-45%, lamalginite, telalginite, liptodetrinite, dinoflagellate cysts) and amorphous OM (up to 50% bituminite). These events of increased aquatic OM flux, similar to conditions favoring black shale deposition, correlate with the global delta C-13 events 'Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum' (PETM) and 'Elmo event'. Freshwater discharge and proximity of the source area are documented by freshwater algae material (Pediastrum, Botryococcus) and immature land-plant material (corphuminite, textinite). We consider that erosion of coal-bearing sediments during transgression time lead to humic acids release as a source for bituminite deposited in the early Eocene black shales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a key leaf trait, which conditions the assessment of carbon balance and the adaptation of the species to their environment. LMA decreases exponentially within the canopy at a lower rate coefficient (k(LMA)) than the extinction coefficient (k(PAR)) Of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); consequently the canopy is not fully optimized for the carbon balance. A new algorithm to simulate LMA in forest canopies is developed. The algorithm is based on a relationship between LMA of leaves at a given canopy depth and PAR, that they absorb, during leaf growth. The LMA sub-model is then tested against independent experimental data to demonstrate its validity to assess (i) the LMA vertical distribution inside the canopy, (ii) its evolution during the season and (iii) the variability observed between sites, years and species. Then, the LMA sub-model is coupled with a process-based model simulating carbon, water and energy balances in forest ecosystem. The coupled model is applied to a sensitive analysis for a case study in a beech forest. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A significant challenge in the assessment of forest management outcomes is the limited ability to compare forest conditions quantitatively across ecological zones. We propose an approach for comparing different forest types through the use of reference forests. We tested our idea by drawing a sample of 42 forests from the Midwest USA, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Bolivia, Uganda, and Nepal. We grouped these forests by shared characteristics and selected a reference forest to serve as a baseline for each forest type. We developed an index of disturbances using ratios of several forest measurements to assess differences between each study forest and its reference forest. None of the study forests was known to have been impacted by major natural disturbances during the past 50 years. Therefore, the disturbances in these forests appear to be largely related to human activities. The forests most similar to their reference forests have had limited human interventions. Our results indicate the potential of this approach to compare different forest conditions across biomes. We argue that development of this approach could facilitate analyses of forest management institutions, promote reliable indicators to compare management outcomes, and contribute to improved policies for conservation.

AB  - Recent large-scale development of oil and gas from low-permeability unconventional formations (e.g., shales, tight sands, and coal seams) has raised concern about potential environmental impacts. If left improperly sealed, legacy oil and gas wells colocated with that new development represent a potential pathway for unwanted migration of fluids (brine, drilling and stimulation fluids, oil, and gas). Uncertainty in the number, location, and abandonment state of legacy wells hinders environmental assessment of exploration and production activity. The objective of this study is to apply publicly available information on Pennsylvania oil and gas wells to better understand their potential to serve as pathways for unwanted fluid migration. This study presents a synthesis of historical reports and digital well records to provide insights into spatial and temporal trends in oil and gas development. Areas with a higher density of wells abandoned prior to the mid-20th century, when more modem well-sealing requirements took effect in Pennsylvania, and areas where conventional oil and gas production penetrated to or through intervals that may be affected by new Marcellus shale development are identified. This information may help to address questions of environmental risk related to new extraction activities.

AB  - Armox 500T is a special type of armor steel possessing superior mechanical properties suitable for use in vehicles and buildings need for first priority protection. Since these products are large-scale, a welding groove needs to be created before joining which can be done by milling operations. This study aims to address this point by questioning the impact of clean environments, namely, dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), and LN2-based cryogenic cooling on the machining performance measures during milling. The novelty of this paper is the investigation of the effects of different cutting environments on the milling performance of Armox 500T armor steel. The results from this study showed that cryogenic medium has an impressive impact on controlling the temperatures at tool-chip interface which directly reduces flank wear development. In addition, cryogenic and MQL-assisted machining is much better than dry environment in achieving improved surface properties, chip shape, and energy consumptions. Cryogenic cooling seems as the best option for hard milling pursued by MQL and dry environments, respectively, from the sustainability and machinability point of view.

AB  - The reconciliation of national development plans with global priority to mitigate environmental change remains an intractable policy controversy. In Africa, its resolution requires integrating local knowledge into impact assessments without compromising the scientific integrity of the assessment process. This requires better understanding of the communication pathways involved in progressing from frame construction to political action on various environmental issues. The impacts of environmental factors on human health are a common concern in Africa, and it is examined here as a platform for negotiating controversies surrounding the arrogation of global support for local assessments of vulnerability and mitigation. The study focused on the particularities of projected impacts of climate change, and specifically on considerations of the health sector within the context of multivalent international agreements to conduct and use environmental assessments. The analysis addresses limitations of cross-scale communication nodes that are embedded in boundary institutions such as the Country Study Program which is hosted by industrialized nations. The translation of rhetoric into action frames through dynamic vulnerability assessments and critical frame reflection can equally engage indigenous and aided capacity for adapting to environmental change.

AB  - As an independent ecosystem or part of the habitat next to the watercourse, mill ditches are usually of minor importance. They are not considered in the routine monitoring of water bodies in accordance with the WFD, and they are hardly to be noticed in the water ecology and nature conservation assessment. The random sampling survey of a naturally developed mills' ditch at the Wesenitz river (Saxony, Germany) showed that a remarkable fauna and flora could be established over the years and under the conditions of active hydropower use.

AB  - Terrestrial arthropod fauna have been suggested as a key indicator of ecological integrity in forest systems. Because phenotypic identification is expert-limited, a shift towards DNA metabarcoding could improve scalability and democratize the use of forest floor arthropods for biomonitoring applications. The objective of this study was to establish the level of field sampling and DNA extraction replication needed for arthropod biodiversity assessments from soil. Processing 15 individually collected soil samples recovered significantly higher median richness (488-614 sequence variants) than pooling the same number of samples (165-191 sequence variants) prior to DNA extraction, and we found no significant richness differences when using 1 or 3 pooled DNA extractions. Beta diversity was robust to changes in methodological regimes. Though our ability to identify taxa to species rank was limited, we were able to use arthropod COI metabarcodes from forest soil to assess richness, distinguish among sites, and recover site indicators based on unnamed exact sequence variants. Our results highlight the need to continue DNA barcoding local taxa during COI metabarcoding studies to help build reference databases. All together, these sampling considerations support the use of soil arthropod COI metabarcoding as a scalable method for biomonitoring.

TI  - An electromechanical impedance model of a piezoceramic transducer-structure in the presence of thick adhesive bonding
T2  - SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
LA  - English
AB  - In the past few decades, piezoceramic (PZT) transducers have been used extensively in the vibration and noise control of engineering structures. However, in the last decade, PZT transducers have also been used in electromechanical impedance (EMI) based methods of structural health monitoring (SHM). In the EMI methods, the PZT transducers are either surface bonded using adhesive or wrapped with a protective cover and then bonded or embedded inside the host structure. They are then subjected to excitation in the desired frequency ranges to predict the electromechanical (EM) admittance signatures. These EM signatures serve as an indicator of the health/integrity of the structure. The existing PZT-structure interaction methods consider both the PZT transducer and the adhesive layer to be negligible in mass and are thus ignored. However, for wrapped PZT, the presence of thick adhesive significantly reduces the magnitude of the EM signature. This paper presents the formulation of a three-dimensional (3D) interaction model of a PZT-structure which considers the mass of both the PZT transducers and the adhesive. The model is generic in nature compared to the existing interaction models. The model is verified experimentally and is expected to be applicable to the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of most engineering structures.

AB  - Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter, pulsed electric fields induce phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, intracellular calcium redistribution, and apoptosis in Jurkat T-lymphoblasts, without causing immediately apparent physical damage to the cells. Intracellular calcium mobilization occurs within milliseconds of pulse exposure, and membrane phospholipid translocation is observed within minutes. Pulsed cells maintain cytoplasmic membrane integrity, blocking propidium iodide and Trypan blue. Indicators of apoptosis-caspase activation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential-appear in nanoelectropulsed cells at later times. Although a theoretical framework has been established, specific mechanisms through which external nanosecond pulsed electric fields trigger intracellular responses in actively growing cells have not yet been experimentally characterized. This report focuses on the membrane phospholipid rearrangement that appears after ultrashort pulse exposure. We present evidence that the minimum field strength required for PS externalization in actively metabolizing Jurkat cells with 7-ns pulses produces transmembrane potentials associated with increased membrane conductance when pulse widths are microseconds rather than nanoseconds. We also show that nanoelectropulse trains delivered at repetition rates from 2 to 2000 Hz have similar effects, that nanoelectropulse-induced PS externalization does not require calcium in the external medium, and that the pulse regimens used in these experiments do not cause significant intra- or extracellular Joule heating.

AB  - Key issues in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive are classification of lakes using biological quality parameters and type-specific reference conditions. This work is one of three studies considering different metrics of phytoplankton in the classification of ecological status. Phytoplankton was studied in a total of 55 Finnish boreal lakes, including 32 reference lakes. We tested the suitability of taxonomic composition and abundance of phytoplankton groups for biological classification. We also preliminarily determined the type-specific taxa for the studied lakes. The type-specific taxa for reference conditions are coincidently the indicator species/taxa for high ecological status. Interestingly, some taxa type-specific for impacted oligo-humic lakes proved to be the type-specific taxa for humic reference lakes. The pressure of human impact was observed not only as increase of biomass but also as changes in the species composition. The phytoplankton composition indicated the ecological status of impacted lakes moderately well. There was some variation in the indications given by different algal groups, probably due to the preliminary class boundaries used. However, the preliminary combination of indicative parameters to estimate the ecological status of the studied impacted lakes was in general in accordance with earlier classification of water quality in Finnish lakes.

AB  - The digestive tracts of tilapia reared in commercial fish ponds with animal manure and/or municipal wastewater generally were contaminated with the fecal indicators E. coli and enterococci to levels greater than those    in the environmental water.       When the indicator densitites in the water were sufficiently high, the liver and muscle tissue also became contaminated, albeit to much lower levels. Thermotolerant aeromonas were recovered from the environmental water and fish tissues at levels 2-4 logs higher than those of the fecal indicators. Accumulation of the indicators in the tissues of the naturally contaminated (pond) fish generally was greater than that in the artificially contaminated fish.
   The indicator levels in the tissues did not appreciably decrease when the pond-reared fish were maintained for 5-8 days under starvation conditions in tanks containing water which was not exchanged. However, the E. coli and virus levels in the tissues of experimentally contaminated tilapia were appreciably and significantly reduced under the same conditions.    The results point out the limited value of conventional ''purification'' methods as applied to tilapia reared in fecally fertilized waters and of data obtained from studies with experimental animals.   Since fish are cooked prior to consumption, the major public health concern could be the risk of Aeromonas wound infections among individuals who handle and process fish.

AB  - Land snails Helix aspersa and pine needles Pinus nigra, known as biomonitors of air pollution, are often used to assess contamination by organic pollutants. In this regard, a sampling campaign was conducted for the first time in Lebanon from June to December 2019, in five different regions in northern Lebanon. For this, snails and pine needles samples were collected monthly. The extraction of pollutants was based on QuEChERS followed by a pre-concentration step of volatile compounds using solid-phase microextraction. Results showed that for Pinus nigra, a high concentration of pollution was observed during the first four months of the analysis followed by a noticeable decrease at the end of the study, while for Helix aspersa, an increasing of pollution concentration was observed during the sampling period. Moreover, results showed that Akkar and Tripoli could be regarded as a highly contaminated areas by pollutants whereas Batroun and Bcharre had the lowest concentration. Furthermore, meteorological data analysis proved the effect of climatic conditions on the bioaccumulation of pollutants by the chosen biomonitors. This is the first time that a comparison between two different biomonitors is conducted while such comparison is highly required for a better environmental biomonitoring assessment.

AB  - Amorpha fruticosa L. is a kenophyte of North American origin, ergaziophyte. Currently, this species has naturalized over large areas and has become the background on the coastal waters of the Dnieper reservoirs of hydropower stations. It is necessary to clarify the reasons for the distribution of A. fruticosa populations in different parts of the Middle Dnieper coast under conditions of artificial regulation of its water yield. It has been proven that the high buoyancy of A. fruticosa fruits provides the possibility of its active dispersal along river beds in a natural way under conditions of fluctuations in the level of surface water yield at the time of spring floods. The main and determining factor in the active dissemination of the species on the coast of the Kanev and Kremenchug reservoirs is the frequent variability of the maximum water surface level. The narrow altitudinal span of distribution of this species on the coast in the lower parts and, accordingly, wider span in the upper parts of the reservoirs are determined by the corresponding indicators of water level differences. The possibility of artificial regulation of the water surface level with knowledge of the characteristics of hydrochory of this invasive species makes it possible to influence its distribution in the territory near the reservoirs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of cultivation of soapwort (S. officinalis L.) in its single-flowered and double-flowered (var. flore pleno hort.) forms in the soil and climatic conditions of the Primorsky region (Russia); to study the effects of S. officinalis L. vegetation time on the composition and micellar properties of saponin-containing root extracts for their use as highly effective natural surfactants. The dynamics of saponin accumulation in the root as a function of cultivation time was studied. The values of surface tension and critical micelle concentration indicators of saponins and water root extracts were established for both S. officinalis L. forms and different vegetation times. The effect of various technological factors on the micellar parameters of root saponins for both S. officinalis L. types was investigated. It was found that better saponin parameters of double-flowered form of S. officinalis L. allow recommending it as a high-potential source of natural surfactants, comparable to commercial Quillaja saponins in its micellar parameters. The identified correlation between changes in the hemolytic activity of root extracts of S. officinalis L. and its vegetative stage allows expanding the sphere of their application.

AB  - The paper presents a comparative analysis of thermo-sustainability indicators (TSIs) and performance of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) with different working fluids. The objective of the study is to determine the sustainability of the ORCs using R245fa, R1234yf, and R1234ze refrigerants. The ORC configurations include the ORC-basic (ORCB), ORC-internal heat exchanger (ORCIHE), ORC-turbine bleeding (ORCTB), and ORC-turbine bleeding/regeneration (ORCTBR). The TSI evaluated comprise overall exergy efficiency (OEF), exergy waste ratio (EWR), and environmental effect factor (EEF) in addition to exergetic sustainability index (ESI). The results indicate that the OEF obtained using R245fa fluctuated between 30.26 <= OEF <= 38.82 with 8.56% efficiency difference between ORCB and ORCTBR at evaporator pressure (EVP) of 2 and 3 MPa. The ESI values were maximum with R245fa while EEF values of 1.5 and 1.58 were obtained at same EVP range. Additionally, the ORCTBR and ORCTB had the least environmental impact and were ecologically stable with R245fa than R1234yf, and R1234ze. In conclusion, the performance of the ORCs is dependent on the following: working fluid, system configuration and operating conditions. Thus optimum conditions for each working fluid for a particular system configuration is central to achieving environmental stability. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The coast of Oman harbours a set of mostly halophytic plant communities. The NE coastline from Muscat to Ras al-Hadd, comprising about 200 km, was chosen for a detailed analysis of the vegetation by means of edaphic parameters, a semi-quantitative transect technique and releves based on the Braun-Blanquet method. Additionally, the relationship between photosynthetic pathway types and environmental factors was examined. Thus, complementary data on vegetation, environmental conditions and ecophysiology were comparatively evaluated. The main differentiating environmental factors causing the observed spatial patterns are salinity, water content and soil type. Sheltered lagoons are characterized by patchy mangrove vegetation with Avicennia marina. The supralittoral zone around lagoons exhibits extremely high salt contents and is home to the Halopeplis perfoliata community. Sand dunes are dominated by a Cyperus con glomeratus community, which is followed by a Heliotropium-Limonium community further onshore. The coastal plains outside the salt influence merge into open xeromorphic scrubland with Acacia species. Phytosociologically, the communities belong to the classes Avicennio-Sonneratietea, Halopeplido-Suaedetea and Acacietea tortilis. Altogether, 68 species were counted as contributing to the vegetation. Twenty of them are C-4 species growing mainly on particularly dry and salty sites.

AB  - Farming management and certification are essential for organic agriculture development to make sure that farming practices are compliant with organic regulations. To improve the efficiency of organic certification and farm management, a risk-based indicator system of organic crop production was established according to literature review and Chinese organic regulations. Three dimensions, 11 themes, and 25 indicators were selected and the weights of which were determined through Analytic Hierarchy Process. The highest weight was assigned to the production dimension (0.59), followed by management (0.24) and environment (0.17). The three highest risk themes in the sequence were plant protection, detection and soil fertility management with a weight of 0.17, 0.15 and 0.12, respectively. At the indicator level, pesticide detection rate, nutrient satisfaction rate, the proportion of non-chemical treatment, the severity of crop diseases, pests and weeds, and the quality of soil environment ranked top five according to the weight of their risk. Chemicals application including pesticides and fertilizers was the main concern in organic production and certification. The results will provide producers, inspectors, and certifiers useful references to reduce the risk of non-compliance, and increase the integrity and credibility during organic production and certification.

KW  - LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - The objective of this work is to propose methodologies in order to assess the sustainability of agri-food sectors by investigating the environmental impacts together with the social and economic performances of the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) South West duck "foie gras" sector in connection with its territorial anchorage. Environmental impacts were assessed through Life Cycle Assessment. The results provide a detailed overview of the main contributors to the environmental impacts for each stage, from rearing and overfeeding that play a major role in the global balance, down to final consumption. A new method is also proposed to assess the social, economic and territorial performances of an agri-food sector, relying on four major categories: i) dignity and welfare of workers, ii) territory and local life, iii) loyalty and integrity of commercial practices, iv) and wealth creation. For each category a set of indicators is defined and assessed. This method aims at pointing out margins for progress to describe the sector in terms of its social and economic performances. When applied to the "foie gras" sector, this approach has shown that this sector performs well but has highlighted some concerns regarding precarious work and possible improvement concerning the involvement in local life.

AB  - Soil resilience has recently been introduced into soil science to address sustainability of the soil resource and to combat sail degradation. The concept of soil resilience and its relationship to soil quality have not been well defined or well developed, The main objectives of this paper are to clarify the concept: of soil resilience and its relationship to soil quality and to present a framework for its assessment. A review of the literature on the assessment and quantification of soil resilience is presented and discussed, The concept of soil resilience in combination with resistance is presented as an important component of soil quality, a key element of sustainability. Factors that affect soil resilience and resistance are soil type and vegetation, climate, land use, scale, and disturbance regime. Maintenance of recovery mechanisms after a disturbance is critical for system recovery. Three approaches for assessing soil resilience are presented: (i) directly measuring recovery after a disturbance, (ii) quantifying the integrity of recovery mechanisms after a disturbance, and (iii) measuring properties that serve as indicators of those recovery mechanisms. Research is needed in the development of indicators or quantitative measures of the ability of soils to recover from specific disturbances.

AB  - The major aim of the study was to identify the relationships of photosynthetic pigments with elemental contents of plants exposed to various ambient air conditions. Lolium multiflorum L. plants were exposed at five sites varying in environmental characteristics, including potential air pollution levels. The effect of air pollution by trace elements on plants was examined. Selected trace elements (Pb, Cd, As, Ni, Cr), some macro-elements as well as chlorophyll content were measured after each of four series. The graphical visualization revealed groups of sites with similar response of elements and chlorophyll contents. Sites located outside the city were grouped into one, and two urban sites were grouped into another. The trace element contents were relatively low and, excluding Ni and As, did not reach toxic levels in dry mass of leaves. However, some relations could be noted, which indicates the sensitivity of the photosynthetic process even at low levels of trace elements in ambient air. Chlorophyll b was found to be more sensitive to most of the analyzed trace elements than chlorophyll a. The results revealed chlorophylls, K and Na as indicators of plant stress caused by trace elements present in ambient air, even at relatively low levels.

AB  - Both environmental fluctuations and physical characteristics of amphibians (e.g., body size, sex, or age class) affect their growth. Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark-recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of P. cinereus across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.

AB  - Understanding the influence of climate variability and fire characteristics in shaping postfire vegetation recovery will help to predict future ecosystem trajectories in boreal forests. In this study, I asked: (1) which remotely-sensed vegetation index (VI) is a good proxy for vegetation recovery? and (2) what are the relative influences of climate and fire in controlling postfire vegetation recovery in a Siberian larch forest, a globally important but poorly understood ecosystem type? Analysis showed that the shortwave infrared (SWIR) VI is a good indicator of postfire vegetation recovery in boreal larch forests. A boosted regression tree analysis showed that postfire recovery was collectively controlled by processes that controlled seed availability, as well as by site conditions and climate variability. Fire severity and its spatial variability played a dominant role in determining vegetation recovery, indicating seed availability as the primary mechanism affecting postfire forest resilience. Environmental and immediate postfire climatic conditions appear to be less important, but interact strongly with fire severity to influence postfire recovery. If future warming and fire regimes manifest as expected in this region, seed limitation and climate-induced regeneration failure will become more prevalent and severe, which may cause forests to shift to alternative stable states.

AB  - This paper describes macrozoobenthos diversity in the vicinity of the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone between 15 degrees and 23 degrees S in offshore waters of the Namib biogeographic province in a comprehensive zoogeographical context. At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs' shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions.

AB  - Landings in the blue crab. Portunus trituberculatus, fishery in Korean waters of the Yellow Sea have declined substantially from 11,000 t in the 1980s to 2,300 t in 2004. Blue crab habitat quality in the Yellow Sea has been degraded by anthropogenic activities including sand mining, land reclamation, and coastal pollution. Various traditional management measures have been implemented, including closed seasons during spawning and size limits, but these measures alone have been unsuccessful to conserve blue crab stocks. Consequently, a total allowable catch and a stock-rebuilding program using an ecosystem-based management approach were implemented in 2003 and 2006, respectively to rebuild blue crab stocks and restore habitats. This program involved assessment of both blue crab stock status and trammel-net fishery impacts at an ecosystem-level using an ecosystem-based fisheries assessment method (Zhang et al., 2009, 2010), which considered fishery data from catch and effort time-series, crab population biology, and ecosystem characteristics, including habitats and environmental conditions. Recent (2008) management status indices have shown significant positive change compared to conditions in 2000 with respect to sustainability of the stock and fishery and with regards to biodiversity and ecosystem habitat quality.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the presence of heavy metal in sediments of a fragmented riparian area, as an indicator of environmental pollution in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Eleven sampling points, including four different land uses were established: Pond, Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Settlement. Sediment samples were taken during the seasons of spring, summer and autumn 2010, and winter 2011. The technique of ICP-MS was used to determine Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn data analysis was performed with Minitab (R). Land use has an effect on the accumulation of Cu, Zn and Cd, with the agricultural area containing the highest concentrations. The season was a significant factor for concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb, emphasizing spring 2010 and autumn 2010, respectively. Significant correlations were found between Cu-Zn (r = 0.746), Pb-Cu (r = 0.635) and Cd-Zn (r = 0.720). The normal limits of Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb in sediments established by the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines were exceeded. By using other scientific and technical sources, maximum levels of Cu, Cd and Pb were defined with a condition of high pollution. This condition is attributed to the land use change dynamics, to wastewater discharges, and urban, agricultural and livestock wastes. Thus, a further environmental assessment is recomended for the study area.

AB  - Radiocarbon-dated pollen, rhizopod, chironomid and total organic carbon (TOC) records from Nikolay Lake (73degrees20'N, 124degrees 12' E) and a pollen record from a nearby peat sequence are used for a detailed environmental reconstruction of the Holocene in the Lena Delta area. Shrubby Alnus fruticosa and Betula exilis tundra existed during 10,300-4800 cal. yr BP and gradually disappeared after that time. Climate reconstructions based on the pollen and chironomid records suggest that the climate during ca. 10,300-9200 cal. yr BP was up to 2-3 degreesC warmer than the present day. Pollen-based reconstructions show that the climate was relatively warm during 9200-6000 cal. yr BP and rather unstable between ca. 5800-3700 cal. yr BP. Both the qualitative interpretation of pollen data and the results of quantitative reconstruction indicate that climate and vegetation became similar to modem-day conditions after ca. 3600 cal. yr BP. The chironomid-based temperature reconstruction suggests a relatively warm period between ca. 2300 and 1400 cal. yr BP, which corresponds to the slightly warmer climate conditions reconstructed from the pollen. Modem chironomid and rhizopod assemblages were established after ca. 1400 cal. yr BP. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of the spatial distribution of trees and foliage on understory conditions was examined in six tall old-growth forests along the Pacific Coast: two sites each in Washington, Oregon, and California. Detailed field measurements of crown parameters were collected on over 9000 trees encompassing over 14.5 ha in the stands. Crown parameters were used to construct a spatially explicit model useful in analyzing the variability of crown distributions in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. Sapwood measurements of over 400 trees in combination with published equations and 240 hemispherical photos were used to assess leaf area and understory light levels, respectively. Shrub and herb cover was used as a biological indicator of growing conditions in the understory. Although leaf area is often assumed to be correlated with the amount of light penetrating the canopy, this is not the case in tall, old-growth forests. The semivariance of the horizontal distribution of canopy volume was strongly correlated with shrub cover and understory light levels and was an overall predictor of canopy structure. This variability gives rise to potentially higher understory light levels and shrub cover values when compared with a forest lacking this vertical heterogeneity and may allow the stand to support a higher volume of foliage.

AB  - A high bituminous shale horizon from the Gurha mine in the Bikaner sub-basin of the Rajasthan District, NW India, was studied using a collection of geochemical and petrological techniques. This study investigated the nature and environmental conditions of the organic matter and its relation to the unconventional oil-shale resources of the bituminous shale. The analyzed shales have high total organic carbon and total sulfur contents, suggesting that these shale sediments were deposited in a paralic environment under reducing conditions. The dominant presence of organic matter derived from phytoplankton algae suggests warm climatic marine environment, with little connection to freshwater enhancing the growth of algae and other microorganisms. The analyzed bituminous shales have high aquatic-derived alginite organic matters, with low Pr/Ph, Pr/n-C-17, and Ph/n-C-18 ratios. It is classified as Type II oil-prone kerogen, consistent with high hydrogen index value. Considering the maturity indicators of geochemical T-max (<430 <degrees>C) and vitrinite reflectance values less than 0.40%VRo, the analyzed bituminous shale sediments are in an immature stage of the oil window. Therefore, the oil-prone kerogen Type II in the analyzed bituminous shales has not been cracked by thermal alteration to release oil; thus, unconventional heating is recommended for commercial oil generation.

AB  - The distributions of species of Fabaceae are strongly related to the soil. Their presence can alter restrictive conditions and favour the establishment of other species. However, it is still not known how the relationship between species of Fabaceae and edaphic factors interact in structuring woody Chaco vegetation. In this context, we aimed to test the hypothesis that restrictive edaphic conditions can explain the difference in floristic patterns of two types of vegetation through their species representativeness of Fabaceae. We analysed floristic consistency between wooded and forested Chaco to address how spatial and environment components might explain differences between them along with the effects of the interaction between Fabaceae and the soil. We observed that the association between environmental and spatial variables was more important than any individual factor in explaining the structuring of the communities. Both the percentage of species of Fabaceae present and the soil influence the structure of the two types of vegetation. Species of Fabaceae have greater potential as indicators in the wooded Chaco. Therefore, we suggest the interaction between soil types and species of Fabaceae plays a role during the structuring of the communities through the establishment of these species in more restrictive soils.

AB  - Sustainable management of water resources calls for integration of ideas and approaches and revolves around assessment of causal-effect relationships as tools towards defining informed mitigation options and planning. The current paper presents a new holistic approach developed within the Globaqua Coordination Project that combines indicator-based well-established and tested concepts towards developing informed Programmes of Measures and River basin management plans: a. The DPSIR framework that has been engaged as central instrument to address the Water Framework Directive requirements and the concepts embedded in the Integrated Water Resource Management; b. The Ecosystem Services Approach emphasizing on the links between ecosystem services, changes in ecosystems and human well-being, c. Scenario assessment for valuation of future conditions to ensure the sustainability in the use of water resources. The implementation of the new combined framework in two river basins, Ebro in Spain and Evrotas in Greece, stressed the need for revised options targeting elimination of water pollution, measures to ensure water supply that covers the demand even under conditions of climate change and increased water stress and the need for improved valuation of environmental and resource use costs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a model for assessing the ecological value of a dam reservoir. Various evaluable characteristics ("elements") that influence the ecology of the target area around the dam were grouped into three classes: (1) physical elements, such as altitude, slope, and aspect; (2) vegetation elements, such as forest physiognomy, vegetation type, age class, diameter at breast height (DBH) class, and density; and (3) habitat elements, such as ecological conditions, vegetation conservation classification, and frequency of wildlife appearances. The evaluation standard was quantified considering the ecological function of each element. The developed assessment model was applied to the Yeongju Dam in the Nakdong River basin in Korea. This study assumed that the ecological condition before the dam construction was 100 %. The results of this study showed that the physical, vegetation, and habitat elements were downgraded to 82.8, 95.5, and 90.7 %, respectively, after the construction of the dam. The overall ecological value was estimated to be 90.0 % and thus decreased by 10.0 % due to dam construction. Additionally, by combining the results for the evaluation elements, an ecologically healthy area was selected. The results of this study should prove useful for quantifying ecological impact and for establishing an ecological restoration plan for dam reservoirs.

AB  - Deadwood was identified as an important indicator for habitat condition and biodiversity in forests. The assessment of downed trees is therefore part of sustainable forest management and ecological monitoring. However, manual quantification of deadwood in forests is challenging, time consuming, and considered cost-inefficient. Full-waveform airborne laser scanning (FWF-ALS) can be used to support the assessment process. The amplitude and width of the backscattered pulses contain information on the properties of the surface. We used these observations for the identification of downed trees in a Natura2000 forest site. A high density FWF-ALS data set was acquired under leaf-off conditions. Echo width and type (i.e., first, intermediate, and last) information as well as normalized echo heights were used to filter the point cloud and derive a digital height model (DHM). This DHM depicts downed stems as line-like features. Image processing was applied to derive and refine regions representing fallen trees. Terrestrial reference data consisting of locations and dimensions of downed trees, as well as state of decay were used for evaluation. Direct identification of downed trees in FWF-ALS point clouds was possible (completeness 75%, correctness 90%), but it was influenced by factors such as dimension, state of decay, vegetation density, and penetration of the laser.

AB  - Seagrass meadows support a range of ecosystem functions in coastal lagoons, from habitat and shelter of invertebrates and fishes to stabilizing sediments, serving at the same time as important ecological quality status indicators due to their sensitivity to water quality parameters. Seagrass meadows are recognized as one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth. Those in mesotidal mid-latitude lagoons with low flushing times primary production are greatly affected by turbidity. Here, we investigate the physical controls of turbidity in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, by simulating its response to varying conditions of tidal and river forcing. A 2-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model developed and calibrated for this coastal lagoon was forced with tide at the inlet, wind and river inflow. The tidal flow was found to be the main driver of changes in turbidity with river-borne plumes assuming some relevance during extreme events. The turbidity response for scenarios of increasing storm-driven events and mean sea level was compared between two existent seagrass patches and the differences in the turbidity conditions put in context of their relevant physical mechanisms. A difference in response was shown to exist between the two patches, mainly attributable to the tide which resuspends the spatially-varying sediments deposited seasonally by river inflow.

AB  - Background: Globally, and in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, extreme fires have become more common in recent years. Such fires pose societal and ecological threats and have inter alia been attributed to climate change and modification of fuels due to alien plant invasions. Understanding the flammability of different types of indigenous and invasive alien vegetation is essential to develop fire risk prevention and mitigation strategies. We assessed the flammability of 30 species of indigenous and invasive alien plants commonly occurring in coastal fynbos and thicket shrublands in relation to varying fire weather conditions.
   Methods: Fresh plant shoots were sampled and burnt experimentally across diverse fire weather conditions to measure flammability in relation to fire weather conditions, live fuel moisture, fuel load and vegetation grouping (fynbos, thicket and invasive alien plants). Flammability measures considered were: burn intensity, completeness of burn, time-to-ignition, and the likelihood of spontaneous ignition. We also investigated whether the drying of plant shoots (simulating drought conditions) differentially affected the flammability of vegetation groups.
   Results: Fire weather conditions enhanced all measures of flammability, whereas live fuel moisture reduced burn intensity and completeness of burn. Live fuel moisture was not significantly correlated with fire weather, suggesting that the mechanism through which fire weather enhances flammability is not live fuel moisture. It furthermore implies that the importance of live fuel moisture for flammability of evergreen shrublands rests on inter-specific and inter-vegetation type differences in fuel moisture, rather than short-term intra-specific fluctuation in live fuel moisture in response to weather conditions. Fuel load significantly increased burn intensity, while reducing ignitability. Although fire weather, live fuel moisture, and fuel load had significant effects on flammability measures, vegetation and species differences accounted for most of the variation. Flammability was generally highest in invasive alien plants, intermediate in fynbos, and lowest in thicket. Fynbos ignited rapidly and burnt completely, whereas thicket was slow to ignite and burnt incompletely. Invasive alien plants were slow to ignite, but burnt with the highest intensity, potentially due to volatile organic composition. The drying of samples resulted in increases in all measures of flammability that were comparable among vegetation groups. Flammability, and by implication fire risk, should thus not increase disproportionately in one vegetation group compared to another under drought conditions-unless the production of dead fuels is disproportionate among vegetation groups. Thus, we suggest that the dead:live fuel ratio is a potentially useful indicator of flammability of evergreen shrublands and that proxies for this ratio need to be investigated for incorporation into fire danger indices.

AB  - Assessment of the ecosystem productivity in relation to the amount of water used for such kind of processes have already been investigated for the different ecosystem types by many researchers. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) parameter shows seasonal variation due to changing weather conditions, which determine processes of photosynthesis, respiration and evapotranspiration, and because of biological factors variability.
   The analysis of the WUE dynamics in the forest ecosystem in Tuczno research station over the hydrological year 2012 were presented in the paper. WUE was calculated based on the daily CO2 and H2O fluxes measured by means of the eddy covariance system (EC) installed over the forest canopy. The fluxes were quality checked in relation to the wind direction, friction velocity values and stationary. The data series used in this investigation were not gap-filled.
   By using the net value of both fluxes, a good indicator which describe the behavior of the ecosystem as the whole, was obtained. Among a number of weather condition factors, that affect the value of the tested indicator (WUE), mainly photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and the air temperature were evaluated. Separate analysis has been done for daily courses of both CO2 and H2O fluxes, as well as for WUE for each month of the analyzed period.
   The highest values of H2O fluxes (F-H) were observed in May and June (0.25 and 0.3 kg.m(-2).s(-1)) and the lowest in the period from September to December (0.02-0.05 kg-m(-2).s(-1)). The daily courses of water vapor fluxes revealed dependence to the measured PPFD fluxes, which determines in turn the intensity of the evapotranspiration process.
   The time courses of the daily 30-min average carbon dioxide fluxes (F-C) were also highly variable in each month, similarly to the variances of the F-H fluxes. The lowest values of the net F-C were measured in the period from October to December (net CO2 fluxes did not exceed 0.55g.m(-2).s(-1)), while in the period from April to July the net ecosystem productivity was the biggest (1.5-2.0 g.m(-2)s(-1)).
   WUE reached its minimum in May (7 g ([CO2]).kg(-1) ([H2O])), what indicates that the evapotranspiration of the ecosystem was the least effective from the point of view of CO2 absorption from the atmosphere (the ecosystem had a high productivity but it lost a great amount of water at the same time). In contrary, higher WUE values were observed in the colder period of the year, when the amount of available radiant energy was limited. WUE reached its peak in September (nearly 45 g of([CO2]) . kg([H2O])(-1)) which reveals, that in autumn the decline of evapotranspiration rates were higher than rates of the net CO2 exchange decrease. It also highlights the high adaptability of Scots pine (main species in studied forest ecosystem -99%), to described conditions.
   The designated water use efficiency (WUE) parameter, may be used as a good indicator of the current condition of the ecosystem.

AB  - Mangrove sediment acts as a natural accumulator of potentially toxic metals (PTMs). Here, we have investigated the efficiency of mangrove species, e.g., Sonneratia caseolaris and Avicennia officinalis phytoremediation potential in a globally significant vulnerable river. The lower pH and anoxic conditions facilitate the elevated accumulation of PTMs in river Hooghly. The presence of PTMs in fine sediment fraction in greater proportion indicates a larger role of fine-grained silt and clay particles in the accumulation process. The estimated sediment quality indices indicate no significant change in the last 30 years. However, the ecotoxicological indices suggest a low level of ecological risks but can turn toxic because of the gradual accumulation of metals. The accumulations of PTMs in mangroves are regulated by the metal bio-availability. The result emphasizes mangrove pneumatophores, as a greater accumulator of PTMs than mangrove leaves. Higher translocation factors also indicate the applicability of mangroves as a phytoremediator of contaminated sediment.

AB  - Rainfed perennial streams have a highly disturbed ecosystem. Seasonal drying and wetting are stressful for the spawning and breeding activities of aquatic faunas in those stretches. In this work, an integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling study is carried out to estimate the ecological flow requirement in Bhogdoi river, India, a southern tributary of Brahmaputra river. Escalating anthropogenic activities continuously deteriorating the flow scenarios and degrading the aquatic health in the study area. The consequence of hydrological alterations is addressed in terms of the environmental flow regimes derived from FDCA (flow duration curve analysis) and FDC (flow duration curve) shifting method. Flow rates under different environmental management scenarios are evaluated and based on the analysis it is found that under the existing basin condition a minimum flow of 13.42-18 cumec is required for the river ecosystem. The flow depth and the current speed corresponding to the observed maximum flow and the ecological flow rates are computed from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic routing model. The model is calibrated and validated with the measured data. This eco-hydrological approach will be helpful to undertake the conservation and restoration strategies in the study site.

AB  - We present an open source web application and ecosystem services model, People in Ecosystems/Watershed Integration (PEWI). PEWI integrates ecological models within an intuitive interface, allowing users to rapidly and dynamically evaluate how changes to agricultural land cover, use, and management affect ecosystem service outcomes. Users create and evaluate land-use and management scenarios in a virtual watershed across years and variable weather conditions using spatially explicit environmental patterns and dynamic feedback on 16 ecosystem service indicators. Indicators include agricultural production (i.e., crop and livestock) and environmental outcomes (i.e., water quality, habitat provision for biodiversity, soil quality, and carbon management). We based initial indicator equations on literature review, empirical data, existing models, and expert consultation, and finalized equations using a combination of testing, sensitivity analysis, and expert review. Model results allow users to explore nuanced tradeoffs and co-benefits between types and levels of agricultural products and other ecosystem services generated in a watershed. PEWI's niche as an ecological model is as a tool for engaging broad public audiences in understanding the science and management of landscapes and watersheds.

AB  - Elevational gradients can serve as powerful tools for testing ecological relationships between species richness versus environmental variables. Although the patterns be usually from positive to humped-shaped, elevational gradients may run in a negative way with the species richness decreasing in relation to the altitude. The floristic gradient may vary according species biology, site and, scale for analyses. Therefore, elevational gradient can be useful for detecting points for biological conservation and may be analized by using sensitive species as approach for others species including banner-species. Along an elevational gradient in a harsh semiarid environment we are showing a negative relationship between bryophyte species richness and increasing elevation. The observed floristic gradient reflects environmental constraints related to light requirements and low humidity as environmental conditions become more severe at higher altitudes, where anthropogenic activities such as farming dramatically alter the vegetation covering. The diversity of bryophytes in terms of their light requirements makes them excellent bioindicators of environmental quality. We provide data that will be useful for conservation planning and management, and report species with rare distributions in Brazil and others not yet recorded as occurring in dry forests.

AB  - Continental Portugal and its two archipelagos (Azores Islands and Madeira Islands) present a very interesting and diverse seaweed community. Its great diversity results for example from different environmental conditions such as the latitudinal gradients that affect the continental Portugal coastal shoreline in unique ways. The first Portuguese phycological studies published date from the end of the 18th century and seaweeds have been harvested to be used as fertilizer since at least the 14th century. However, Portuguese seaweeds are still a natural and valuable resource that is relatively under explored or studied, particularly regarding its economic potential. Although Portugal was one of the world's main agar producers in the past, the sustainability of its seaweed exploitation was overlooked. Contemporary awareness of this valuable resource might bring together role players such as researchers and industries towards innovative and sustainable practices (such as to make use of non-indigenous species that have been registered in the country). Nowadays, almost all Portuguese higher education institutions currently have research groups dedicated to studies related to seaweeds (ranging from ecological and environmental assessment studies to seaweed aquaculture, uses and applications). This work addresses the diversity of Portuguese seaweeds and its main economic aspects.

AB  - We analysed the influence of environmental stress (mainly deforestation of catchment due to windstorm) on taxonomic structure as well as composition of functional groups (FG) based on zonation preferences and feeding types of caddisfly species in 11 streams (12 sites) with various environmental conditions situated in the High Tatra Mts, Slovakia. Using Spearman correlation, we confirmed an expected positive association between taxonomic and functional groups richness (Ri), diversity (Shannon - Wiener Index) (Di) and equitability (Eq), but not with habitat diversity (HQA indices). By testing measured physiographical, physico-chemical and hydromorphological factors using CCA analysis we found that stream order and temperature best explained the functional and taxonomic structure of caddisfly assemblages. The occurrence of Rhyacophila glareosa decreased with increasing daily mean water temperature positively correlated with deforestation, whereas R. tristis (dominating at sites most affected by erosion) showed the opposite pattern. Composition of functional groups based on zonation preferences and feeding types distinguished well near natural sites from impacted ones, dominated by crenal/rhithral predators, and explained more of the overall variance of the species-environment relationships than taxonomic composition of caddisfly assemblages.

AB  - We evaluated ants as bioindicators of environmental impacts caused by arsenic residuals in the soil. We tested the hypotheses that the presence of arsenic in the soil affects: (1) estimates of resources and habitat condition for arboreal and epigaeic ants; (2) species richness of arboreal and epigaeic ants and (3) arboreal and epigaeic ant species composition. Ants were sampled at an inactivated raticide factory in Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Brasil, which used arsenic as one of its main byproducts. The following environmental variables were measured: bioavailable arsenic concentration in the soil, the number and density of tree species, plant cover and leaf litter depth. The species richness of arboreal ants decreased with increased bioavailable arsenic concentration whilst epigaeic ants increased with arsenic. Arboreal ants were positively related to the number of tree species, which in turn were negatively affected by arsenic. We verified which ants are good bioindicators of arsenic. Independent verification of the influence of arsenic on background environmental variables was fundamental in defining responses of ant communities, as well as in identifying the most effective pathways for the recovery of biological communities in degraded areas.

AB  - Among the many new engineered nanomaterials, nanosilver is one of the highest priority cases for environmental risk assessment. Recent analysis of field samples from water treatment facilities suggests that silver is converted to silver sulfide, whose very low solubility may limit the bioavailability and adverse impact of silver in the environment. The present study demonstrates that silver nanoparticles react with dissolved sulfide species (H(2)S, HS(-)) under relevant but controlled laboratory conditions to produce silver sulfide nanostructures similar to those observed in the field. The reaction is tracked by time-resolved sulfide depletion measurements to yield quantitative reaction rates and stoichiometries. The reaction requires dissolved oxygen, and it is sensitive to pH and natural organic matter. Focused-ion-beam analysis of surface films reveals an irregular coarse-grained sulfide phase that allows deep (>1 mu m) conversion of silver surfaces without passivation. At high sulfide concentrations, nanosilver oxysulfidation occurs by a direct particle-fluid reaction. At low sulfide concentration, quantitative kinetic analysis suggests a mechanistic switch to an oxidative dissolution/precipitation mechanism, in which the biologically active Ag(+) ion is generated as an intermediate. The environmental transformation pathways for nanosilver will vary depending on the media-specific competing rates of oxidative dissolution and direct oxysulfidation.

AB  - Levels of total Hg were determined in the muscle tissue of Helicolenus dactylopterus (mean = 0.29 ug.g-1 +/- 0.025 S.E.; range = 0.04-1.10 ug.g-1) and Pontinus kuhlii (mean = 0.16 ug.g-1 +/- 0.092 S.E.; range = 0.05-0.50 ug.g-1) caught in the Azores between August 1989 and May 1990.  Mercury concentrations were related to sex, length, weight, age, growth and condition of both fish species.  There were highly significant positive correlations between Hg levels and these variables.  In P.kuhlii a significant sex-related difference in Hg levels was found; the rate of Hg accumulation is significantly faster in females than in males and mean Hg levels were higher in females.  Relationships describing Hg vs size and age dependence were determined for both species and sexes and patterns and rates of Hg accumulation were discussed in relation to a number of biological and ecological factors with influence on it.  A comparison of Hg content of Azorean and Mediterranean populations of H.dactylopterus was conducted and its suitability as an indicator in pollutant monitoring of benthic compartment of marine ecosystems is discussed.

AB  - Generally, the determination of the wear in the mechanical systems is done by checking the critical components in periodic maintenance or by monitoring the secondary indicators such as vibration, noise, and temperature. These indicators can only be recognized after the wear reaches a certain level. In this study, an approach has been carried out on the use of the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method. In this study, EMI measurements were carried out depending on the different test samples, representing a different amount of wear level and wear location of the AISI 1040 steel block. The test samples were worn out in a controlled laboratory environment. The impedance measurements were taken before and after wear tests for each sample. Different measurements were made, and damage metrics were calculated and compared with the reference measurement made; the amount of the wear could be monitored primarily using the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) method without dismantling the system. The location of wear could be determined by Correlation Coefficient Deviation (CCD) technique. In this study, it has been demonstrated that it could be possible to monitor the progress of wear in sensitive mechanical systems periodically without disturbing the integrity of the machine system.

AB  - Risk has always been an inherent part of everyday life, but quantified assessment of risk is now an important part of several different aspects of materials and engineering applications. Risk is taken into account as an integral part of the design of many constructions in limit state design through the use of partial safety factors to achieve a target reliability, depending on the consequences of failure and the uncertainties of the input data and design relationships. Risk is also increasingly being used as a basis for decisions on inspection, maintenance, and life extension of engineering structures and infrastructure. As part of the effective management of projects, assessments of the financial risks both for the client and for the contractor are essential requirements. Environmental risk assessments are obligatory for major projects before decisions to proceed can be taken. The current status of the application of risk analysis methods to avoidance of failure by plastic collapse, fracture, buckling, fatigue, creep, and corrosion is reviewed, and applications in a range of industries are considered, The application of risk analysis to the use of new materials, methods of construction, and life extension is then briefly explored. Finally, the importance of a proper understanding of both risk analysis and materials behaviour for students on degree courses is stressed.

AB  - This article is devoted to the topical today biological corrosion problem of steel under the conditions of production, transportation and refining. The characteristics of corrosion caused by the vital activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria were analyzed. The article seeks to examine the effectiveness of new ammonium salts based on aminoethylethanolamine as reagents possessing inhibitory and antibacterial properties. The main content of the research is the analysis of the synthesis of new compounds based on ammonium aminoethylethanolamine and benzyl chloride. The optimal conditions of the synthesis were determined on the basis of the effect of temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of the final product output. The considerable attention was devoted to testing obtained new metal ammonium salts as acid corrosion inhibitors, including determining the corrosion rate and the degree of protection. The comparison of the results of the evaluation of the inhibitory properties of synthesized salts is presented using the rate indicator of corrosion "Monicor-2M" and gravimetric method. The results of the evaluation of bactericidal activity of the synthesized compounds were obtained with the determining the degree of suppression of sulfate-reducing bacteria SRB culture using isolated from natural sources and identified as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. The results showed a high level of protective action of synthesized salts and their possible use in the oil industry.

AB  - The impact of temperature on cephalopod growth has become a productive area of study. Current knowledge of squid growth owes much to earlier laboratory studies on octopuses and cuttlefishes that revealed rapid temperature-sensitive growth. Advances in laboratory culture of squids eventually revealed the dramatic extent to which rising water temperature accelerates growth rates. This led to proposal and testing of a working hypothesis, the Forsythe Hypothesis, that during periods of gradually warming temperature, monthly cohorts of squids experience warmer conditions and grow faster, and perhaps larger, than older, earlier-hatched cohorts. The advent of statolith increment analysis for determining age in field-caught squids has provided a powerful tool in ground-truthing this hypothesis in nature. This hypothesis, now termed here the Forsythe Effect, has been laboratory and field-tested over the past 10 years and been strongly supported. Food availability and inherent species-specific physiological limits must also be accounted for in predicting growth. Gaps still exist in our precise understanding of the temperature-induced changes in form and duration of squid growth. Acute and chronic ocean-scale seawater-temperature change events will compel us to look to squids as 'bioindicators' of environmental condition and to statoliths as the 'archives' of this information.

TI  - The Effects of Scallop Dredge Fishing Practices on Physical, Behavioral, and Physiological Stress in Discarded Yellowtail Flounder, Windowpane, and Fourspot Flounder
T2  - MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - The Atlantic sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus dredge fishery is one of the most lucrative commercial fishing industries in the northeastern United States, and fish bycatch can comprise up to similar to 42% of the total catch. Benthic species, such as flatfish, are particularly susceptible to unintended capture in scallop dredge gear, and mitigating bycatch and associated mortality has been mandated a priority for fisheries management. Based on this management need, the present study evaluated the physical, physiological, and behavioral stress responses of Yellowtail Flounder Limanda ferruginea, Windowpane Scophthalmus aquosus, and Fourspot Flounder Paralichthys oblongus to capture in the scallop dredge fishery. More specifically, we used generalized additive models and linear regression models to assess the influence of various fishing practices, environmental conditions, and biological factors on injury condition, physiological parameters, and reflex indicators. Although these flatfish species appeared to be physically resilient to capture based on an observable injury assessment, dredge capture and handling factors proved stressful, with the degree of immediate mortality, physiological disturbances, and reflex impairment varying by species. While multiple factors influenced the degree of stress in these species, based on our results the reduction of tow duration and limiting air exposure/sorting duration would likely be the most effective strategies to mitigate the impact of scallop dredge fishing on these flatfish species.

AB  - Both surface wind and bed absorption can greatly impact the pollutant dispersion processes, however, the two factors are not jointly considered in existing models due to the intricacy of analyzing the simultaneous influence of surface wind shear and bottom bed absorption. In this work, a multi-scale approach is employed to formulate the environmental dispersion process with both factors considered jointly within wetland flows. By adopting this method, the effect of wind and bed absorption on vertical concentration distribution and longitudinal concentration distribution are discussed. To visualize the results, the flow velocity contours under different wind conditions (i.e. upstream wind and downstream wind), the pollution concentration distributions versus time and spatial position, and the spatial contaminant cloud contours are presented. Moreover, numerical experiments of the interested scenarios are presented to verify the accuracy of the analytical method. The comparison shows that the results of the proposed multi-scale method agrees well with the dataset generated numerically. Finally, the multi-scale method in this work is compared to the Aris? concentration moment method in the literature by setting the bed absorption rate to zero. The comparison shows that the present model can reduce the substantial integration processes and derive accurate spatial concentration profiles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluation of the physiological performance of plants as an environmental response is crucial to understand the ecological succession in plant communities and to implement strategies that increase plant survival and growth for restoration efforts and commercial plantations; however, evaluating plant physiology often requires complex and expensive technical equipment not normally accessible to all researchers and non-specialized people. In the present study, we explored the relationship of the visual condition of the needles with an indicator of their photosynthetic capacity related to chlorophyll content in Abies religiosa. A visual stress index was developed to evaluate the response to environmental stress in seedlings of A. religiosa during a reforestation effort, and the correlation between leaf chlorophyll content and different categories of the stress index. The replicability of the index was also tested to determine its applicability by non-specialized people. A high correlation was detected between the index and chlorophyll concentration (r(2) = 0.76; P < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant agreement on the index among several observers (W = 0.95; P < 0.0001). Overall, the stress index is related the physiological condition of the plants and can be adopted by people, after training, to make evaluations of the physiological status of A. religiosa seedlings.

AB  - Echinoderms associated with coral communities in the Easter Pacific compose a conspicuous assemblage that alters their ecosystem structure and composition. The environmental conditions in the transitional region of Central Mexican Pacific (CMP) present high variability associated with climatic seasons and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In order to understand it, a research was held during four years (2011-2014) throughout the CMP region with seven conspicuous echinoderm indicator species. Echinoderms diversity, distribution, and density were measured, and also their relation with benthic coverage, depth, rugosity, and temperature. The echinoderm assemblages changed in density and diversity among localities and regions over the years. Their presence was positive related with the occurrence of algal turf and corals, but absent in the presence of coral rubble and fleshy macro-algae. Also, during the negative phase of ENSO/2011, the increase of algal turf favored the abundance of echinoids. Subsequent to ENSO, their density decreased but the richness of the echinoderm assemblage remained stable, suggesting that coral communities in the study area possess a strong resilience, where local abiotic and biotic factors maintain a dynamic balance in echinoderm populations.

AB  - Environmental factors are used by plants as spatio-temporal indicators of favorable conditions for seed germination. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of light and temperature on seed germination of 30 taxa of Cactaceae occurring in northeastern Brazil and to evaluate whether fluctuations in temperature are capable of altering light sensitivity. The seeds were tested for germination under two light conditions (12 h photoperiod and continuous darkness) and 10 temperature treatments: eight constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 degrees C) and two alternating temperatures (30/20 degrees C and 35/25 degrees C). The species studied showed two photoblastic responses. All cacti from the Cactoideae subfamily (22 taxa) were classified as positive photoblastic (i.e., no germination in darkness), regardless of the temperature treatment used. Likewise, temperature fluctuation did not alter the seed sensitivity to light. On the other hand, the species of the Opuntioideae (five taxa) and Pereskioideae (three taxa) subfamilies are indifferent to light (i.e., germinated both in the presence and absence of light). The cacti from the areas of Caatinga and Cerrado showed an optimal germination temperature of 30 degrees C, while the species from Atlantic Forest and Restinga areas showed an optimal germination temperature of 25 degrees C.

AB  - Terrestrial ecotoxicological tests are powerful tools for assessing the ecological risks that pesticides pose to soil invertebrates, but they are rarely used to evaluate seed dressing pesticides. This study investigated the effects of seed dressing pesticides on survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida (Collembola), using standardized ecotoxicological tests (after ISO guidelines with few adaptations for tropical conditions). Commercial formulations of five seed dressing pesticides were tested individually in Tropical Artificial Soil (TAS): the insecticides imidacloprid, fipronil, thiametoxam, and the fungicides captan and carboxin+thiram. Thiametoxam, captan, and carboxin+thiram were only lethal to F. candida at the highest concentration tested (1000 mg of active ingredient kg(-1) of dry soil). Imidacloprid and fipronil were lethal at lower concentrations (100 and 10 mg a.i. kg(-1) soil d.w, respectively), however, these concentrations were much higher than those predicted (PEC) for soil. Imidacloprid and fipronil were the most toxic pesticides in both tests, reducing significantly collembolan reproduction (EC20=0.02 and 0.12 mg a.i. kg(-1) soil d.w, respectively). Further studies under more realistic conditions are needed, since imidacloprid and fipronil reduced collembolan reproduction at concentrations below or close to their respective PECs.

AB  - This paper calculates steady state management decisions that, if followed indefinitely, provide an adaptive strategy that maximizes the value from timber and carbon sequestration when risk is present. By including carbon offsets directly in the objective function of a Markov decision process (MDP) model, we find long-term trade-offs exist between economic and ecological outcomes. An economic supply schedule is provided, which shows an exponential increase in the cost of sequestration. Moderate carbon prices effectively sequester additional CO2 from the atmosphere while having a positive impact on ecological indicators such as size and species diversity. In contrast, high carbon prices promote more of a monoculture in order to maximize expected forest value in the long run from carbon sequestration. This study finds evidence that the optimal adaptive decisions are sensitive to the magnitude of carbon prices, and consequently, so too are ecological outcomes. While some governments acknowledge the influence carbon markets have on the ecological integrity of the forest, fluctuations in carbon prices within a cap-and-trade market likely influence the optimal decision making of the forest manager, and thus, the ecological landscape of the forest itself.

AB  - The relationship of water quality and fish assemblages has been poorly documented in European reservoirs, despite being important for water management and ecological monitoring. We sampled the fish assemblages of 14 Spanish reservoirs by boat electrofishing in the littoral and multi-mesh gillnets in the limnetic zone. Simultaneously, we assembled eight physical descriptors and we measured 20 water quality features of the reservoirs. Multivariate analysis (ordination methods and generalised additive models) showed that altitude and trophic state (indicated by chlorophyll or nutrient concentrations) independently explained most of the variation of fish assemblages in these reservoirs. The most eutrophic reservoirs were dominated by common carp (Cyprinus carpio) whereas oligotrophic reservoirs presented other fish species intolerant to pollution rather native (such as brown trout, Salmo trutta). The absolute and relative abundance of common carp was strongly related to the trophic state of the reservoir and 40% of its variation was explained by total phosphorous concentration. Despite clear changes in species composition, there was no significant effect of water quality on overall fish richness or Shannon's diversity, suggesting that for such low richness assemblages species composition is a better indicator of cultural eutrophication of reservoirs than fish diversity.

AB  - Many aspects of cellular function or physiology can be used to indicate the level of damage resulting from the application of potentially deleterious agents such as drugs, solvents or even light. The dose required to reach a specific biological endpoint will necessarily depend on the characteristics of the damage induced by the agent. By using multiple biological probes, it is possible to get a more complete description of the type of damage induced. Photodamage was induced in rat basophilic leukemia cells by either 254-nm UVC light exposure or rose bengal photosensitization. Damage was measured by three quantitative assays employing fluorescent probes: calcein, to measure nonspecific esterase activity, propidium iodide (PI), to measure loss of plasma membrane integrity, rhodamine 123 (R123) to measure mitochondrial depolarization, and the incorporation of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), to measure the progress of cell replication. BrdU incorporation was found to be the most sensitive indicator for both forms of photodamage. For UVC photodamage, the BrdU assay was 330 times more sensitive than the other two assays. For rose bengal photosensitization, the BrdU assay was 48 or 62 times more sensitive than either the R123 or calcein/PI assays, respectively.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to present toxic effects of some heavy metals ( cadmium, lead and zinc) on lichen physiology. In the North of France, those metals are concentrated for example in industrial polluted soils near metallurgic plants and waste dumps. Our investigations were conducted on Diploschistes muscorum (Scop.) R. Sant, a terricolous lichen growing on previously quoted soils as well as on non-contaminated ones. Different stress parameters were investigated as potassium leakage-which is related to the loss of membrane integrity-and oxidative stress through following parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). It seems, therefore, that heavy metals induce oxidative stress in this lichen, in which we found membrane damage and enhancement of SOD activity and GSH concentrations. With regard to very high concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn, a resistance involving antioxidant mechanisms limits the expected damage. Those mechanisms involve GSH, SOD as well as secondary metabolites, which have this resistance property. This study is a first step of investigation to use-in the future physiological parameters as tool for environment assessment.

AB  - The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrates and various environmental factors (i.e., physicochemical properties of sediment and hydromorphological condition) in the typical inflow river sediments of the Taihu Basin in China. Pearson correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to investigate associations between environmental factors and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. The RDA results indicated that the environmental factors account for 58.6% of the spatial differentiation of benthic macroinvertebrate community. High density of Oligochaeta species, which were potential indicators of heavy metal pollution within sediments, was observed as the pollution-tolerant species in the study area, indicating that the benthic community was seriously polluted by heavy metals and nutrients. Moreover, the variation in benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and trait composition were mainly explained by physicochemical properties of sediment (e.g., Pb, temperature, and phosphate), whereas hydrological condition (e.g., turbidity) alterations played a less important role. Thus, the environmental factors are significantly correlated with the abundance and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrate by taking interacts of multi-environmental factors into account. These results provide scientific basis for water environment health management and pollution control in Taihu Basin river network area.

AB  - Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring is a non-destructive condition assessment method that exploits damage-related changes in the dynamic characteristics of a structure. The sensitivity of some commonly employed dynamic characteristics such as natural frequencies, to local damage of moderate severity might be lower than their sensitivity to environmental influences such as temperature. Modal strains are more sensitive to local damage, but the accurate dynamic monitoring of the very low strain levels that occur in civil engineering structures under ambient excitation became possible only recently. In this work, the influence of both temperature and damage on modal strains is experimentally investigated for a prestressed concreted beam in controlled laboratory conditions. Not only the modal strains themselves are considered, but also the neutral axis position under bending deformation, which relates directly to the bending stiffness. It is found that the induced temperature changes in the concrete beam do not have a measurable influence on the modal strains and neutral axis positions. The cracks that are induced in the beam by external loading in a progressive damage test do have a clear and local influence on the strain mode shapes and neutral axis positions, even at low damage levels.

AB  - The explanation of productivity differentials is very important to identify the economic conditions that create inefficiency and to improve managerial performance. In the literature two main approaches have been developed: one-stage approaches and two-stage approaches. Daraio and Simar (2005, J Prod Anal 24(1):93-121) propose a fully nonparametric methodology based on conditional FDH and conditional order-m frontiers without any convexity assumption on the technology. However, convexity has always been assumed in mainstream production theory and general equilibrium. In addition, in many empirical applications, the convexity assumption can be reasonable and sometimes natural. Lead by these considerations, in this paper we propose a unifying approach to introduce external-environmental variables in nonparametric frontier models for convex and nonconvex technologies. Extending earlier contributions by Daraio and Simar (2005, J Prod Anal 24(1):93-121) as well as Cazals et al. (2002, J Econometrics 106:1-25), we introduce a conditional DEA estimator, i.e., an estimator of production frontier of DEA type conditioned to some external-environmental variables which are neither inputs nor outputs under the control of the producer. A robust version of this conditional estimator is proposed too. These various measures of efficiency provide also indicators of convexity which we illustrate using simulated and real data.

AB  - Biometric features and physico-chemical conditions are responsible for many of the variables for metal concentrations in indigenous populations of mussels. In order to reduce variations and promote the utility of mussels as bioindicator organisms for environmental mercury concentration levels, individuals of approximately uniform biometric characteristics, selected from a culture of 1-year-old mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, Lmk., were transplanted to four locations in the Krka river estuary and nearby coastal area (Eastern Adriatic coast). Biometric parameters of mussels and their total and methylmercury content were analysed four times over a period of 270 days in 1988/89. It was found that total and methylmercury concentrations were significantly correlated with shell weight, wet weight and dry weight of mussels. The estimate of minimal methylmercury concentration in the water of the Krka River Estuary (approximately 20 pg/l), derived from the mussels data, is in a good agreement with recently determined concentration levels of methylmercury (between 50 and 100 pg/l) in waters of the same area. The accumulation efficiency for methylmercury is about 20-50 times higher than for total mercury. Only 1% of the total mercury content, and 20-50% of the methylmercury content in water Filtered by the mussels, is accumulated in the shellfish tissues.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate changes found in the gills and livers of Sciades herzbergii and Bagre bagre to verify damage associated with pollution in mangrove regions on the north coast of Brazil. Biological samples were collected in Curupu Bay (Brazil) in an environmental gradient, involving a control area (A1), a site with fish farming effluents (A2), a region with domestic sewage from an urban city (A3) and a more away site from the coast (A4). The greatest percentage of gill injuries were recorded for S. herzbergii, which live in area A2 in relation to the rest of the studied areas. Histopathological analysis showed an elevated number of hepatic alterations such as inflammatory responses, melanomacrophage centers, hyperplasia and cytoplasmic vacuolization (lipid cells) in S. herzbergii from area A2. It was also possible to identify a significant difference in the liver index (Iorg.) of fish, which live in area A2 compared to that of fish from to the other areas. Hepatosomatic index values (HSI) and condition factor (K) were similar in areas A1, A2 and A3, however differed in area A4. Fish from areas A3 and A2 had the largest number of liver abnormalities (fat nodes).

AB  - External-soil spray seeding (ESSS), a technique of spraying artificial soil materials onto bare slopes for vegetation cover construction, has been widely used to restore rock-cut slopes. However, studies on the effect of the practical application of this technique on different topographic aspects have been rarely performed. In this study, two topographic aspects, namely, north-facing versus south-facing, were investigated under two railway lines, and two local natural slopes (north-facing versus south-facing) were selected as references. Vegetation and soil conditions, which are paramount aspects of ecological restoration assessment, were characterized in terms of the richness and diversity indices, vegetation canopy cover, basic soil physico-chemical properties, and structural characteristics of these slopes. Results showed that (1) the topographic aspect significantly affected the vegetation restoration and artificial soil quality of rock-cut slopes restored by ESSS; (2) the ecological restoration effect of north facing slopes were better than that of south-facing slopes; and (3) the vegetation and soil conditions of natural slopes were better than those of rock-cut slopes. Therefore, additional scientific management measures should be implemented to promote the ecological restoration of rock-cut slopes, especially for south-facing slopes.

AB  - The widespread increase in the relative abundances of Cyclotella sensu lato taxa in Northern Hemisphere lakes suggests that these taxa are strong indicators of global change, yet the specific factors affecting the success of these species have been difficult to identify. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of temperature (7-10 degrees C or 11-15 degrees C), light (high or low) and nutrients (control or nitrogen plus phosphorus) on cell densities of various Cyclotella sensu lato taxa. We observed varying interactive effects of temperature, light and nutrients on Lindavia bodanica, Lindavia comensis, Lindavia ocellata and Discostella stelligera. For example, when nutrients were provided, Lindavia radiosa was more abundant under high light conditions, whereas L. ocellata was more abundant under low light conditions. The secondary objective was to determine whether different phytoplankton communities (one dominated by diatoms and the other by a mixed assemblage) altered the response of D. stelligera to abiotic factors. High temperature, light and nutrients only increased cell densities of D. stelligera when this species occurred in the diatom-dominated community. This study provides further ecological insight on Cyclotella species that serve as important indicators of environmental change.

AB  - Peat bogs are unique wetland ecosystems of high conservation value all over the world, yet data on the macroinvertebrates (including mayfly assemblages) in these habitats are still scarce. Over the course of one growing season, mayfly assemblages were sampled each month, along with other macroinvertebrates, in the largest and oldest Croatian peat bog and an adjacent stream. In total, ten mayfly species were recorded: two species in low abundance in the peat bog, and nine species in significantly higher abundance in the stream. Low species richness and abundance in the peat bog were most likely related to the harsh environmental conditions and mayfly habitat preferences. In comparison, due to the more favourable habitat conditions, higher species richness and abundance were observed in the nearby stream. Three of the recorded species, Caenis luctuosa from the peat bog, and Eurylophella karelica and Leptophlebia marginata from the stream are new records for the Croatian mayfly fauna. Typical Central European life cycle patterns were confirmed for several species (e.g. Baetis vernus, Nigrobaetis niger, Electrogena ujhelyii), while for several others (e.g. Habrophlebia fusca, Paraleptophlebia submarginata) some discrepancies were observed. Therefore, these results provide new and valuable information on the ecology of mayflies in peat bog habitats.

AB  - Excess fine sediments in streambeds are among the most pervasive causes of degradation in streams of the United States. Simple criteria for acceptable streambed fines are elusive because streambed fines and biotic tolerances vary widely in the absence of human disturbances. In response to the need for sediment benchmarks that are protective of minimum aquatic life uses under the Clean Water Act, we undertook a case study using surveys of sediment, physical habitat, and macroinvertebrates from New Mexico streams. Our approach uses weight of evidence to develop suggested benchmarks for protective levels of surficial bedded sediments <0.06mm (silt and finer) and <2.0mm (sand and finer). We grouped streams into three ecoregions that were expected to produce similar naturally occurring streambed textures and patterns of response to human disturbances. Within ecoregions, we employed stressor response models to estimate fine sediment percentages and bed stability that are tolerated by resident macroinvertebrates. We then compared individual stream sediment data with distributions among least-disturbed reference sites to determine deviation from natural conditions, accounting for natural variability across ecoregion, gradient, and drainage area. This approach for developing benchmark values could be applied more widely to provide a solid basis for developing bedded sediment criteria and other protective management strategies in other regions.

AB  - A major goal in marine ecology is the understanding of the interactions between the dynamics of the different ecosystem components, from physics to top predators. While fishermen are among the main top predators at sea, almost none of the existing studies on ecology from physics to top predators contemplate fishermen as part of the system. The present work focuses on the coastal processes in the Northern Humboldt Current System, which encompasses both an intense climatic variability and the largest mono-specific fishery of the world. From concomitant satellite, acoustic survey and Vessel Monitoring System data (similar to 90,000 fishing trips) for a ten-year period (2000-2009), we quantify the associations between the dynamics of the spatial behavior of fishermen, environmental conditions and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and spatial distribution. Using multivariate statistical analyses we show that environmental and anchovy conditions do significantly shape fishermen spatial behavior and present evidences that environmental fluctuations smoothed out along trophic levels. We propose a retrospective analysis of the study period in the light of the ecosystem scenarios evidenced and we finally discuss the potential use of fishermen spatial behavior as ecosystem indicator.

AB  - Determining the age composition of a population is important when conducting ecological, taxonomic and environmental assessments. Morphometric measurements of the head capsule, especially the length and width, are widely used in the identification of insect instars, but alternative ways for determining the age of insects can expand the options for the analysis of field and laboratory populations. This study evaluated the morphometry of the antennae, mandibles, mentum and ventromental plates to discriminate among the four larval instars of Chironomus sancticaroli Strixino & Strixino, 1981. The larvae were reared in the laboratory under constant temperature (25 degrees C) and photoperiod of 12/12 hours for 19 days, with a supply of food. Fifteen larvae were removed randomly every day, cleared in KOH, and slide-mounted, and had the antennae, mandibles, mentum and ventromental plates measured. The dimensions of the four structures studied allowed us to statistically distinguish each of the four larval instars. The data fit an exponential equation according to the Brooks-Dyar rule, which allows an estimate of the larval instar of specimens collected in the field, even when development takes place under different conditions. The duration of each instar was also obtained from our data, and showed an overlap of instars during development.

AB  - We examined ichthyoplankton sampled from 2 stations, 9 and 18 krn offshore of Newport, Oregon, USA, over a decade of cruises every 2 wk from 1996 to 2005. The 10 most dominant taxa comprised approximately 87.3 % of the total catch. Concentration of fish larvae was highest in January to March, whereas diversity peaked from March through May. Both overall diversity and density of larval fishes were relatively constant throughout the period of 1996 to 2003, with a dramatic decrease in these metrics since 2004, especially for winter-spawning (January-May) species. During cool years (1999-2002), the assemblage was dominated by northern or coastal taxa such as sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus, sanddabs Citharichthys spp., and smelts Osmeridae, whereas in warm years (2003-2005), southern or offshore taxa such as English sole Parophrys vetulus, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and rockfishes Sebastes spp. were more abundant. These changes were related to concurrent shifts in the zooplankton biomass and composition off Oregon during cold and warm environmental regimes. We have identified a small subset of fish whose larvae can be monitored as indicators of warm and cold phases in the northeast Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Multiple centers of authority in hybrid forms create conditions of radical openness where questions of value and fitness are in flux. Environmental accounting is suggested as a condition for steadying hybrid forms and opening up possibilities for institutional innovations. This paper advances a critical social science analysis of environmental accounting to help specify how, when, and in what ways strengthening accounting capacity advances hybrid governance. Social studies of accounting argue that accounting systems are contingent on institutions: rules and social conventions, not only data or science. Our practice-centered analysis of two cases of building environmental accounting tools to advance high profile institutional innovations in US agri-environmental governance finds that the systems of rules that structure and legitimize accounting protocols are not pregiven. The same radical openness that presents opportunities for hybridity also reinforces uncertainties in building accounting standards. We identify two major frictions: a) Conventions for determining technical consensus and b) Rules for determining levels of transaction costs. We conclude by identifying a need to think about hybrid forms critically. Although hybrid forms are an expression of creativity and collaboration, they are also performances of a certain contemporary political covenant that delegitimizes state-centered governance. The challenge ahead is to understand when and where hybrid arrangements add to socio-ecological regulation and where they undermine the possibility of more functional approaches through a performance of seriousness.

AB  - Effective ecological carrying capacity (ECC) is the precondition for implementing sustainable urbanization in China. However, different regions in a big country such as China have different ecological conditions and different development modes. Therefore, the evolution of ECC is different between different regions during the urbanization process in China. This study presents a comparative analysis on the evolution of ecological carrying capacity between provinces in the context of China. The ECC indicators in this study are classified into four dimensions, namely, water carrying capacity, land carrying capacity, environment carrying capacity and energy carrying capacity. Indicator data used for analysis are collected from 30 provinces in China. The entropy method is adopted to analyze the ECC performance during the years of 2006-2017. The ECC evolution is described into stable, fluctuated, declined and improved. This study shows that the evolution of ECC performance varies significantly between different provinces. The findings of this study help the Chinese government understand the different ECC evolution between provinces and provide policy-makers with valuable reference for formulating effective measures with considering different ecological conditions in different provinces, to improve the ECC performance across the country in China.

AB  - For decades, disruption of the bilateral symmetry of body structures has been related to underperformance and, hence, to fitness. In fish, this concept coupled with the claimed evidence for increased fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of pairs of hard structures, such as otoliths under conditions of stress, has led to the use of otolith FA (OFA) as a proxy for individual fitness and population success. Interpreting those significant differences in OFA in relation to stress-inducing environments and using them to identify suboptimal conditions for survival is especially appealing in the context of, for example, assessing climate change using historical otolith collections. Despite several works that give evidence to support the usefulness of OFA approach, we report on a number of unpublished and published datasets from a wide range of both, wild populations and experimental designs that show no correlation between OFA and any of the usual indicators of fitness or between OFA and expected stress gradients. Our results suggest that there may be a strong bias in the published literature towards positive relationships, despite the enormous importance of negative results for understanding the significance of OFA. These results might shed light on the interpretability of OFA in both laboratory and field studies.

AB  - Plants growing in environments with different atmospheric conditions may present changes in the morphometric parameters of their leaves. Microgramma squamulosa (Kaulf.) de la Sota is a neotropical epiphytic fern found in impacted environments. The aims of this study were to quantitatively compare structural characteristics of leaves in areas with different air quality conditions, and to identify morphometric parameters that are potential indicators of the effects of pollution on these plants. Fertile and sterile leaves growing on isolated trees were collected from an urban (Estancia Velha) and a rural (Novo Hamburgo) environment, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. For each leaf type, macroscopic and microscopic analyses were performed on 192 samples collected in each environment. The sterile and fertile leaves showed significantly greater thickness of the midrib and greater vascular bundle and leaf blade areas in the rural environment, which is characterized by less air pollution. The thickness of the hypodermis and the stomatal density of the fertile leaves were greater in the urban area, which is characterized by more air pollution. Based on the fact that significant changes were found in the parameters of both types of leaves, which could possibly be related to air pollutants, M. squamulosa may be a potential bioindicator.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) in 1988. The wetland component (EMAP-Wetlands) is designed to provide quantitative assessments of the current status and long-term trends in the ecological condition of wetland resources. EMAP-Wetlands will develop a wetland monitoring network and will identify and evaluate indicators that describe and quantify wetland condition. The EMAP-Wetlands network will represent a probability sample of the total wetland resource. The EMAP sample is based on a triangular grid of approximately 12,600 sample points in the conterminous U.S. The triangular grid adequately samples wetland resources that are common and uniformly distributed in a region, such as the prairie pothole wetlands of the Midwest. However, the design is flexible and allows the base grid density to be increased to adequately sample wetland resources, such as the coastal wetlands of the Gulf of Mexico, which are distributed linearly along the coast. The Gulf sample network required a 49-fold increase in base grid density. EMAP-Wetlands aggregates the 56 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) National Wetland Inventory (NWI) categories (Cowardin et al. 1979) into 12 functionally similar groups (Leibowitz et al. 1991). Both the EMAP sample design and aggregated wetland classes are suitable for global inventory and assessment of wetlands.

AB  - Aspidoscelis neotesselatus (Colorado Checkered Whiptail) is a hybrid-derived triploid parthenogenetic lizard with a natural range overlapping with six counties in southeastern Colorado, USA. It has also become established by anthropogenic causation in Grant County, Washington State, approximately 1,600 km northwest of its range in Colorado. Large parts of its natural range are within military reservations. Reduced genetic variation in all-female species makes them especially susceptible to environmental disturbances, such as military activities. At Fort Carson (FC), we estimated an abundance index via a catch-per-unit estimator, weekly survival using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models, and body condition and clutch size as indicators of population health across three low-impact training areas (TA; 45, 48, and 55). Abundance estimates varied across TAs from a low of 0.99 to a high of 6.12 females per hectare. Body condition only marginally varied by age class and TAs. Apparent monthly survival was relatively low in all areas and even lower at TA 55 than at TA 48 (0.638 versus 0.771); however, the uncertainty around those estimates was large. Results suggest that TA 48 supported a large fraction of reproductive females that were successful in producing eggs, providing further insight into where monitoring and conservation efforts should be concentrated within FC.

AB  - We studied the effects of water level in the Danube River on waterbird species abundance and species assemblages along 83 km from the border of Hungary and Slovakia. 651,622 birds of 62 species were counted between 1992 and 2009. The dominant species was Mallard Anas platyrhynchos contributing 436,198 individuals (66.9% of all observations). Throughout the year total numbers of individuals and species richness were negatively correlated with local water level registered on the same day throughout the year. Shannon diversity indices were generally positively correlated with water levels. During floods, dabbling ducks, especially the dominant Anas platyrhynchos, dispersed to peripheral waters, where they are less likely to be counted, and diving ducks (Bucephala clangula, Aythya fuligula and Mergus spp.) left the area entirely, because fast flowing, highly turbid waters reduced local feeding efficiency. Abundance of most waterbird species decreased with elevated water levels. High water levels remove distinctive microhabitats (gravel banks, paved riverbanks and shoals), and create unfavourable conditions of high water velocity and turbidity. Retention of high water levels as a result of damming of the Danube creates long-term conditions similar to natural flooding effects. In our opinion, further manipulation of Danube water levels is likely to reduce waterbird richness and abundance and should be subject to appropriate environmental impact assessment.

AB  - Buff er strips alongside watercourses are a widely accepted method of reducing nutrient and sediment run-off from agricultural land thereby improving water quality. Little attention, however, has been paid to the ecological status of these areas despite the fact that riparian habitats in good condition can provide multiple benefits. We investigated vegetation patterns and plant-environment relationships within three categories of riparian margins in northeast Scotland. The margins were categorized as unbuffered, buffered, or reference (target), the latter representing the best sites available within the catchments. Vascular plant and soil data were collected from 41 sites along the tributaries of two rivers during 2008 and 2009. Ellenberg indicator values revealed trends of decreasing light availability (P < 0.05) and decreasing pH (P < 0.01) from unbuffered sites to buffered sites to reference sites. Multivariate analysis showed that soil parameters and channel morphology, together with canopy cover and bryophyte abundance, were discriminatory in separating species assemblages. The presence of a tree canopy layer appears to be the key instigator of change in soil conditions and corresponding plant species assemblages. An understanding of the underlying processes is important if vegetation characteristics are to be used effectively as indicators of riparian and water quality and to aid the restoration of riparian habitats.

AB  - Polychaetes play a significant role in benthic communities' ecology; they dominate the infauna, recycle nutrients from the water column and are commonly used as biological indicators. Along the Gulf of Uraba (Colombian Caribbean), particularly for the zones of the Marirrio Bay and the Rionegro Cove, there are no reports about ecological aspects of polychaete species; only a few taxonomic studies have been conducted. In this research we evaluate the relationship between polychaete species associated with red mangrove roots, Rhizophora mangle, and some physicochemical variables of the water column; also, we made some notes about the spatial distributions of polychaetes species within the two study areas. We found that the environmental variables that best explain polychaetes community segregation are the dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity; temperature seems to have not a significant effect. In terms of spatial distribution, we found that Alitta succinea, Capitella cf. capitata and Ficopomatus miamiensis occupied the inner, middle and outer zones for both study area and seasons, while Stenoninereis sp. 1 (rainy and dry season) and the exotic polychaete Ficopomatus uschakovi (rainy season) were found just in Rionegro Cove. Finally, the species Nicolea modesta is registered by first time for the Gulf of Uraba, Colombian Caribbean.

AB  - The cultivation of coca (Erythroxylon coca) by smallholders represents the first step in the world's largest illegal agribusiness: cocaine. The literature on illicit crops generally considers the global and national factors that influence its expansion but little attention is paid to the local conditions where cultivation takes place. This study analyzes the economic, environmental, institutional and social factors associated with the existence of coca crops within municipalities in two different years (2001 and 2008). We do this from a regional perspective, by taking into account the particular factors that characterize the areas associated with coca municipalities and estimating the impacts of coca cultivation on natural ecosystems. For the proposed analysis we use Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to visualize and describe the local spatial distributions and clusters, implementing the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) for the year 2001 and 2008. Our results show that no individual factor is exclusively associated with the coca areas; in fact, a group of common factors characterizes these regions. The analysis indicates that the expansion of coca cultivation has produced a process of deforestation mainly affecting humid tropical forested ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ground Beetles (Carabidae) have been suggested to be used as indicators of ecological status under the effects of anthropogenic land use and land cover changes in highly biodiverse regions such as the Neotropics. In this study Ground Beetles' assemblages from a region in the Brazilian Amazon were investigated for evaluating their applicability as disturbance indicators. Differences in assemblages between ecosystems, discriminated by complimentary methodologies, demonstrate a sensitive reaction from the most pristine forests to increasingly disturbed systems. Besides capturing the influence of different prevailing conditions between ecosystems, Ground Beetles are easy to communicate and to link with the other components of the system, being effortless and routinely measurable using standard methodologies. This study represents a step forward in using Ground Beetles for the purposes of planning, management and public reporting on the ecological status of Neotropical ecosystems. Additionally, the methods depicted could support projections for trends of relevant ecosystem attributes under realistic social-ecological change scenarios, which can be used to guide effective conservation planning.

AB  - In Brazil, the introduction of a national urban mobility policy occurred only in 2012. In this context, the federal government has provided hundreds of millions in investment to improve mobility conditions in urban areas. The main financial institution responsible for analyzing and monitoring developments of this nature considers the following criteria for project assessment: cost, environmental licensing, compatibility, and functionality. However, a project's contribution to sustainable urban mobility is not taken into account. Thus, the work reported herein aimed to develop a method to assess the sustainability of urban mobility projects. This involved indicator selection, and the development of a tool based on sustainability indicators for project assessment. In addition, an Urban Mobility Project Sustainability Index (UMPSI) was proposed to summarize the assessment, which was tested in five urban mobility projects funded in the Curitiba Metropolitan Region (RMC), presented in a companion paper. Environmental, social, and economic aspects of project design and implementation are considered in the assessment. The proposed method consists of 17 sustainability indicators, grouped according to their connection with environmental, social, and economic aspects. Addition of the proposed method to the contracting and monitoring processes of future urban mobility projects supports the sustainable development of the urban landscape. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ecological risk assessments were conducted as part of the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement designed to evaluate costs and benefits of alternative approaches to oyster restoration in Chesapeake Bay, USA, including the intentional introduction of a non-native Asian oyster species. A relative risk model was used to evaluate alternatives involving both the native Eastern oyster and the non-native species. Effects of options were examined for a diverse set of ecological resources and conditions for the Bay including oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, blue crabs, fish, wildlife receptors, dissolved oxygen, and total suspended solids. A weight-of-evidence method based on available scientific evidence was also used to answer a set of questions developed by a science advisory panel. There was low risk that the Asian oyster would not provide ecosystem services similar to those afforded by the Eastern oyster; however, there is moderate to high risk that the Asian oyster would interact with and compete with the Eastern oyster. The potential for introduction and spread of diseases from the Asian oyster to other species in the Bay is considered negligible, but there is high risk that the Asian oyster would disperse outside of the Bay.

AB  - The Katalalixar National Reserve (KNR) lies in an isolated marine protected area of Magellan Sub-Antarctic channels, which represent an important area for marine biodiversity and macroalgal conservation. The present study is the first report of the species Lessonia spicata, "huiro negro", in the Magellan Sub-Antarctic channels. This finding has implications for macroalgal biogeography and conservation concerns in the Chilean coast. In the ecological assessments of the KNR in 2018 we found populations of L. spicata, specifically on rocky shores of Torpedo Island and Castillo Channel. The morphological identification and molecular phylogeny based on nuclear (ITS1) sequences revealed that these populations of Lessonia are within the lineage of L. spicata of central Chile. This report increases the species richness of kelps for the Magellan Sub-Antarctic Channels from two to three confirmed species (L. flavicans, L. searlesiana and L. spicata), and it also extends the southern distribution range of L. spicata. This species has high harvest demand and is moving towards southern Chile; thus, these populations should be considered as essential for macroalgal conservation in high latitudes of South America.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates were used to assess the impact of urbanization on stream quality across a gradient of watershed imperviousness in 43 southeastern Wisconsin streams. The percentage of watershed connected imperviousness was chosen as the urbanization indicator to examine impact of urban land uses on macroinvertebrate communities. Most urban land uses were negatively correlated with the Shannon diversity index, percent of pollution intolerant Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera individuals, and generic richness. Nonurban land uses were positively correlated with these same metrics. The Hilsenhoff biotic index indicated that stream quality declined with increased urbanization. Functional feeding group metrics varied across a gradient of urbanization, suggesting changes in stream quality. Proportions of collectors and gatherers increased, while proportions of filterers, scrapers, and shredders decreased with increased watershed imperviousness. This study demonstrated that urbanization severely degraded stream macroinvertebrate communities, hence stream quality. Good stream quality existed where imperviousness was less than 8 percent, but less favorable assessments were inevitable where imperviousness exceeded 12 to 20 percent. Levels of imperviousness between 8 and 12 percent represented a threshold where minor increases in urbanization were associated with sharp declines in stream quality.

AB  - The scope of this study is to reveale the nature and variability of shape asymmetry of leaf tip and base in Populus nigra L. under conditions of two types of industrial waste dumps: coal mine and overburden rock dumps. The coefficient of shape asymmetry of leaf tip ranges from 0.000 to 0.253 in the samplings of P. nigra (in ascending order): City Park -> coal mine waste dumps -> overburden rock dumps. The coefficient of tip shape asymmetry less than 0.050 is characteristic of most leaves of all analyzed samples. The coefficient of shape asymmetry of leaf base varies from 0.000 to 0.152. This value was statistically significantly higher in the leaves sampled in the overburden rock dumps. The asymmetry coefficient of base shape less than 0.015 is characteristic of most leaves of all analyzed samples. The shape asymmetry of leaf tip and base in P. nigra is fluctuating. Among three indices analyzed (overall shape pseudosymmetry index, and coefficients of shape asymmetry of leaf tip and base), the shape asymmetry coefficient of leaf base is the most informative indicator. It is most useful for differentiation of leaf blades sampled in less degraded ecosystems and those sampled in stressful ecosystems.

AB  - In this paper an integration of the agricultural economic model RAUMIS with the hydrological models GROWA98 and WEKU is presented. The focus lies on an area wide, regionally differentiated, consistent link-up between the indicator "nitrogen balance surplus" and nitrogen charges into surface waters. The model network is used to analyze the status quo situation in the year 1999 for two river catchments in Germany that feature very distinct natural and socio-economic conditions. Regarding agriculture, the study areas include regions with specializations in cash crops, in intensive livestock featuring high nitrogen surplus, and extensive livestock production on permanent grassland. Due to regionally varying hydrological conditions quite different shares of agricultural nitrogen surpluses ranging from 25 to 92% enter surface waters. Furthermore, impacts of alternative nitrogen reduction measures namely a limitation of livestock density and a tax on mineral nitrogen are quantified. Measures of the nitrogen reduction potential and costs in terms of agricultural income forgone are taken into account in the assessment. Results regarding the effects of restricting the livestock density or tax mineral nitrogen highlight that the mitigation of diffuse water pollution problems requires regionally tailored measures.

AB  - Vegetation cover is an important indicator of the hydrology, habitat suitability, and carbon storage of wetlands. The effective management of wetland vegetation requires a good understanding of how human activities affect vegetation cover. In this study, using China's Yellow River Delta as a case study, we examined the factors that have influenced the delta's vegetation cover since 1980. Based on structural equation modeling, we tested the impacts of seashore reclamation activities, including tidal embankment construction, port construction, and land reclamation, on vegetation cover. Other potentially important factors, such as population, road construction, precipitation, and rising sea levels, were incorporated into the analyses. Our results showed that seashore reclamation activities have had increasingly negative effects on vegetation cover over time. In contrast, ecological restoration projects and the development of ecotourism in the wetlands have improved vegetation cover. The impact of natural conditions in the delta (temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise) showed no consistent trend, but overall, seem to have had a positive effect. These findings have significant implications for conservation and the management of reclamation activities in the Yellow River Delta.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the environmental impact assessment into two different technologies for the production of solar power in Thailand. It considers mass and energy flows over the whole power generation process and compares two types of silicon solar cell; multicrystalline and amorphous. The process operations that make up the system are the solar cell array, inverter stations, transformer stations, a control center and substations. This study also examines the economic feasibility of such power stations, by analyzing their investment costs and the internal rate of return (IRR). After analyzing the results, 1 kWh of solar power generation was found to have an impact upon both human health and ecosystem quality, whilst resource depletion was unaffected. When the overall impact was compared against the non-renewable power generating technologies of natural gas, combined cycle and coal-fired power stations, solar energy was found to have an appreciably lower environmental impact, with the multicrystalline plant having the lowest impact of all. However, the economic analysis revealed that, despite their low environmental cost, under the present market conditions both solar power technologies are not financially viable.

AB  - Insects are excellent indicator species for documenting changes in ecosystems and biodiversity, and south Florida is a recognized "hotspot" for hundreds of rare and endemic taxa. The capacity of native invertebrate species to adapt to changing ecological factors may be the dynamic that either strengthens their fitness or drives their extirpation or extinction. Variable life strategies may evolve that enable those taxa to persist, in spite of, or in response to, unstable or stochastic features in their changing ecosystems. Florida insects are subject to many extremes: drought, flooding, hurricanes, and high-wind tropical storms, as well as urban threats such as pesticide use and fragmented remnant habitats. The Atala, Eumaeus atala (Poey) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), which was once believed to be extinct, is still considered to be an insect of conservation concern in southeast Florida for those reasons. In this study, environmental chambers were programmed to simulate the widely varying climatic conditions found in southeast Miami, Florida, to understand the ranges in the life history and development of the Atala. Results indicated that pupal and adult male polyphenism and variations in development time are determined by seasonal changes in temperature, humidity, and photoperiod; these factors may indicate stressadaptive responses increasing pupal survival and male mating success.

AB  - Uzuncayir Dam Lake is one of the most important water bodies in Tunceli. It is polluted by domestic wastewaters together with natural contamination and pesticides, which have had cumulatively negative effects. This study analyzes the effects of pollution by using the fish species, Capoeta umbla as a sentinel species, with a biomarker approach. The approach comprehends a general biomarker of individual fish health, the condition factor and specific biomarkers of contaminant exposure such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The general water physico-chemical parameters were measured at each sampling sites during each fish-sampling period. Strong seasonal and locational variations were observed among selected markers.
   In conclusion, the multibiomarker approach used in the present study clearly revealed differences in the fish health among reference and potentially contaminated sites. The study shows that changes of biomarkers such as acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P450 1A1 might be useful for the assessment of environmental contamination in the Uzuncayir Dam Lake (Tunceli, Turkey).

AB  - Water quality condition and trend are important indicators of the impact of land use on the environment, as degraded water quality causes unwelcome changes to ecosystem composition and health. These concerns extend to the sea, where discharges of nutrients, sediments and toxicants above natural levels are unwelcome, particularly when they drain to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and other coastal waters of Queensland. Sugarcane is grown in 26 major river catchments in Queensland, most in environmentally sensitive areas. This puts pressure on the Queensland Sugar Industry to manage the land in ways that have minimum adverse off-site impacts. Sugar researchers including CRC Sugar have been associated with water quality studies in North Queensland. These include investigations and reviews to assess the role of groundwater as a pathway for nitrate loss from canelands in the Herbert Catchment, to find causes of oxygen depletion in water (including irrigation runoff) from Ingham to Mackay, to use residues of superseded pesticides as indicators of sediment loss to the sea, and to assemble information on water quality pressure and status in sugar catchments. Key findings, plus information on input pressures are described in this paper, and areas of concern and opportunities discussed.

AB  - Global climate change is expected to affect precipitation patterns over Southeastern South America, increasing the number and intensity of heavy rainfalls. We aimed to identify short-term effects of very heavy rainfall events (VHREs) on abiotic and biological indicators of water quality in Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (RFL; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Our hypothesis is that VHREs alter water parameters reducing the overall quality of lagoon. A before-and-after effect design was applied by compiling mean weekly data of four abiotic and three biological indicators for 1st and 2nd weeks before and 1st and 2nd weeks after VHRE. One extreme and 15 VHREs were detected from 2018 to 2019, directly interfering on the stormwater input into RFL. Particular water conditions after VHREs were mainly related to increased Escherichia coli density and decreased dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton abundance. Moreover, shifts in relative contribution of phytoplanktonic groups were significantly detected. We successfully identified short-term effects of VHREs on biological and hydrological indicators of water quality in RFL, which have partially supported our hypothesis. Predictions of increased rainfall intensity and frequency of extreme events may lead to harsher and unpredictable changes in ecosystem functioning and lagoon conditions that may impair aquatic biodiversity and fisheries.

AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric nitrogen have increased over the last century, but the monitoring of nitrous oxide concentrations is only recent. Can trees from temperate regions be used to infer past changes in nitrogen cycles? To consider this question, we investigate nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) ring series from pine and beech trees near Montreal, and beech specimens of Georgian Bay Islands. The delta N-15 values show coherent intertree and interspecies trends, independent of the sapwood-heartwood transition zones, implying that these results reflect local environmental conditions. At both sites, short-term isotopic fluctuations correlate directly with precipitation and inversely with temperature. Long-term isotope decreases of 1.5 to 2 parts per thousand suggest progressive changes in soil nitrogen after 1951. In Georgian Bay, an additional important change is inferred on the basis of a 15 parts per thousand increase initiated after 1971. At both sites, long-term series correlate with a proxy for NOx emissions. We propose that the contrasted long-term delta N-15 changes of Montreal and Georgian Bay reflect deposition of NOx emissions from cars and coal-power plants, with higher proportions from coal burning in Georgian Bay. This research suggests that tree-ring delta N-15 series may record both, regional climatic conditions and anthropogenic perturbations of N cycles.

AB  - The experimental measurement of fracture toughness and crack driving force are the main steps for the application of fracture mechanics methods in structural integrity assessment Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD), defined as the opening of a defect at its crack front upon loading a test specimen or structure, is one of the most important crack driving force parameters. However, due to its subsurface nature direct measurement of CTOD is very cumbersome. CTOD is commonly measured using single or double clip gauge techniques and applying a plastic hinge model. However, clip gauge CTOD calculations merely provide information related to the center of the defect For the case of a finite-length surface breaking defect, where CTOD is variable along the defect front, exact knowledge of CTOD over the entire front is not possible by the clip gauge measurement techniques. In the present paper a novel technique is proposed based on full field three-dimensional profile measurement of the notched surface by means of stereoscopic Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) to measure the CTOD over the entire crack front The proposed method is verified by measurement of silicone replicas cast inside the notch in addition to a supporting Finite Element (FE) investigation.

AB  - Water consumed directly by the construction industry is known to be of little importance. However, water consumed in the manufacture of goods and services required by construction may be significant in the context of a building's life cycle water requirements and the national water budget. This paper evaluates the significance of water embodied in the construction of individual buildings. To do this, an input-output-based hybrid embodied water analysis was undertaken on 17 Australian non-residential case studies. It was found that there is a considerable amount of water embodied in construction. The highest value was 20.1 kilolitres (kL)/m(2) gross floor area (GFA), representing many times the enclosed volume of the building, and many years worth of operational water. The water required by the main construction process is minimal. However, the water embodied in building materials is considerable. These findings suggest that the selection of elements and materials has a great impact on a building's embodied water. This research allows the construction industry to evaluate design and construction in broad environmental terms to select options that might be cost neutral or possibly cost positive while retaining their environmental integrity. The research suggests policies focused on operational water consumption alone are inadequate.

AB  - Periodic oscillations between El Nino and La Nina conditions in the Pacific Basin affect oceanographic and meteorological phenomena globally, with impacts on the abundance and distribution of marine species. However, El Nino effects on estuarine hydrology and tidal wetland processes have seldom been examined rigorously. We used detailed wetland elevation and local inundation data from 10 tidal wetlands located along the Pacific coast of the United States to assess changes in flooding during the 2015-2016 El Nino and to determine decadal-scale relationships between estuarine sea-level anomalies and Pacific Basin climate indices for this region. During the 2015-2016 El Nino all sites experienced significant increases in high-tide water levels exceeding those predicted by astronomical tides, and increased flooding frequency during at least one of the El Nino subperiods relative to pre-El Nino conditions. The magnitude of positive sea-level anomalies varied by site (4-15cm), with local hot spots of high water in southern Oregon, northern California, and Pt. Mugu lagoon in the Southern California Bight. Furthermore, over the last three decades of historic tide records, there were positive relationships between high-tide sea-level anomalies and equatorial Pacific Basin sea surface temperature anomalies across the region, and negative relationships with the Northern Oscillation Index. Increases of 1 degrees C in equatorial sea surface temperature were associated with 3-5cm of increased high-tide flooding at the sites. Elevated estuarine flooding associated with future El Ninos could impact important tidal wetland processes and could be an additive stressor for wetlands facing accelerating sea-level rise.
   Periodic changes between El Nino and La Nina conditions in the Pacific Basin affect global weather and ocean patterns, causing changes in coastal waters that can impact plants and animals. However, few studies have focused on El Nino effects on tidal wetlands. This study identifies substantial changes to wetland flooding during the 2015-2016 El Nino event using detailed wetland elevation and local tide height data from 10 tidal wetlands located along the Pacific coast of the United States. During the 2015-2016 El Nino, all sites experienced significant increases in high-tide water levels exceeding those predicted by astronomical tides as well as increased flooding frequency during at least one part of the El Nino event. Flood height anomalies ranged from 4 to 15cm on average, with local hot spots of high water in southern Oregon, northern California, and Pt. Mugu lagoon in Southern California Bight. Tidal records show that over the last three decades, high-tide sea-level anomalies in coastal wetlands were related to two indicators of El Nino and La Nina conditions. Elevated estuarine flooding associated with future El Ninos could impact important tidal wetland ecosystems and could weaken their ability to keep pace with accelerating sea-level rise.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the condition of the Dasun estuary, Indonesia, from the influence of heavy metals Cr, Cd, and Pb that accumulated in sediments and beach morning glory vegetation (Ipomoea pes-ccuprae). The results showed that the metal concentrations of Cr, Cd, and Pb in the sediments were 3.39-5.29 mg/kg, 0.21-0.29 mg/ kg, and 5.36-6.87 mg/kg, respectively. The concentrations of metals that accumulated in the tissue of entire plants were 0.98-1.22 mg/kg (Cr), 0.31-0.40 mg/kg (Cd), and 0.94-1.23 mg/kg (Pb). Dasun estuary is still in the safe category for the living habitat, even though the concentration of Cd was relatively high and was estimated to originate from batik industry waste. The vegetation of Ipomoea pes-caprae was found to have a high ability to absorb Cd; thus, it can be used as a bioindicator for heavy metals in the environment.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are under threat from multiple stressors, which vary in distribution and intensity across temporal and spatial scales. Monitoring and assessment of these ecosystems have historically focussed on collection of physical and chemical information and increasingly include associated observations on biological condition. However, ecosystem assessment is often lacking because the scale and quality of biological observations frequently fail to match those available from physical and chemical measurements. The advent of high-performance computing, coupled with new earth observation platforms, has accelerated the adoption of molecular and remote sensing tools in ecosystem assessment. To assess how emerging science and tools can be applied to study multiple stressors on a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines, a workshop was held on 10-12 September 2014 at the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Australia. Here we introduce a conceptual framework for assessing multiple stressors across ecosystems using emerging sources of big data and critique a range of available big-data types that could support models for multiple stressors. We define big data as any set or series of data, which is either so large or complex, it becomes difficult to analyse using traditional data analysis methods.

AB  - The ecosystem resilience plays a key role in maintaining a steady flow of ecosystem services and enables quick and flexible responses to climate changes, and maintaining or restoring the ecosystem resilience of forests is a necessary societal adaptation to climate change; however, there is a great lack of spatially explicit ecosystem resilience assessments. Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.

AB  - Trace metals are components of releases to air emitted by copper and zinc production facilities in Canada. Six metals (copper, zinc, nickel, lead, cadmium, and arsenic) are examined as part of an overall environmental assessment of these releases. Estimates of metal deposition rates to soils and surface waters were derived from monitoring data in the vicinity of the production facilities and also through dispersion modelling studies. Fate and transport modelling of the metals deposited allowed an estimation of critical loads. Estimated annual deposition rates were compared with 25,h-percentile critical loads typically representative of effects on sensitive organisms tinder 25% of conditions in sandy soils or circumneutral to acidic lake waters. The results of the comparison suggest that there is a potential for adverse effects on aquatic and/or soil-dwelling organisms from exposure to steady-state concentrations of metals in the vicinity of copper and zinc production facilities. Approaches of particular significance in these assessments include probabilistic estimation of critical loads for metals, allowance for the speciation of metals defining the bioavailable fraction and limiting critical effect levels to the high end of natural background metal concentrations.

AB  - Environmental influences on carbon isotope fractionation in tree rings require further elucidation in order to use this parameter as a biological marker of climatic variations. DeltaC-13 values in tree-ring cellulose of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were analysed for the period from 1950 to 1990. A bioclimatic model of water balance was used to give the actual evapotranspirations as well as the soil water content on a daily basis. DeltaC-13 shows a significant decrease from -24-5 parts per thousand to -25 parts per thousand over this period. Internal CO2 concentration changes from 200 to 220 ppm in relation with the rise of atmospheric CO2. Beside a slight, non-significant inter-individual variation, a large year-to-year variation exists. The relative extractable soil water of July, combined with the value of deltaC-13 for the previous year, predicts as much as 70% of this variance. Air temperature or precipitation accounted for less variation. DeltaC-13 is strongly correlated with basal area increment, but appeared a more reliable indicator of water status at the stand level.

AB  - The quality of the environment plays a significant role in supporting regional development. Whenever a region is viewed as the space it occupies, a clean environment is one of the fundamental conditions of the region's competitiveness, including its environmental advantage. The environmental competitivenss can be analysed in terms of the natural conditions ocurring in a given region as well as their skillful transformation into social and economic effects, which will contribute to a more rapid development of this region.& para;& para;The main purpose of this study has been to identify the level of competitivenss and environmental competitiveness of regions (Polish provinces) by calculating values of the Perkal index, and to determine the correlation coefficients for the competitiveness and environmental competitiveness between the regions. The provinces in Poland distinguished by a positive and high value of the Perkal index are: mazowieckie, slaskie, wielkopolskie, followed subsequently by malopolskie, dolnoslaskie and pomorskie. The regions which possess the highest environmental competitive advantage are: lubuskie, pomorskie, zachodniopomorskie and warminsko-mazurskie. Negative correlation was determined between the indicators of competitiveness and environmental competitivenss achieved in our study. However, it is a weak correlation. Thus, there is no ground to worry that the economic development will lead to some considerable deterioration of the natural environment. On the contrary, positive effects of the growth in economy on the natural surroundings should not be neglected.

AB  - Smouldering ground fires have severe environmental implications. Their main effects are the release of large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere with loses of organic soil and its biota. Quantitative data on the behaviour of smouldering wildfires are very scarce and are needed to understand its ecological effects, to validate fuel consumption and smouldering propagation models and to develop danger-rating systems. We present, for the first time, a methodology for conducting smouldering experiments in field conditions. This method provides key data to investigate smouldering combustion dynamics, acquire fire behaviour metrics and obtain indicators for ecological effects of smouldering fires. It is to be applied in all types of undisturbed soils. The experimental protocol is based on a non-electric ignition source and the monitoring system relies on combining both point and surface specific temperature measurements. The methodology has been developed and applied by means of large series of replicate experiments in highly organic soils at the forest-grassland treeline of the Peruvian Andes. The soil tested exhibited weak ignition conditions. However, transition to oxidation phase was observed, with smouldering combustion during 9h at 15-cm depth and residence times at temperatures above dehydration of similar to 22h.

AB  - A vast body of literature suggests that the European Alpine Region is amongst the most sensitive socio-ecosystems to climate change impacts. Our model represents the winter tourism socio-ecosystem of Auronzo di Cadore, located in the Dolomites (Italy), which economic and environmental conditions are highly vulnerable to climate variations. This agent-based model includes eight types of agents corresponding to different winter tourist profiles based on their socio-economic background and activity targets. The model is calibrated with empirical data while results are authenticated through direct interaction of local stakeholders with the model. The model is then used for assessing three hypothetical and contrasted infrastructure-oriented adaptation strategies for the winter tourism industry, that have been previously discussed with local stakeholders, as possible alternatives to the "business-as-usual" situation. These strategies are tested against multiple future scenarios that include: (a) future weather conditions in terms of snow cover and temperature, (b) the future composition and total number of tourists and (c) the type of market competition. A set of socio-economic indicators, which are strongly coupled with relevant environmental consequences, are considered in order to draw conclusions on the robustness of the selected strategies.

AB  - Information on chromium (Cr) oxidation states is essential for the assessment of environmental and health risks associated with the overall life-cycle of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood products because of differences in toxicity between trivalent [Cr(III) and hexavalent [Cr(VI)] chromium compounds. Hypothetical Cr(VI)fixation products were investigated in CCA type C treated sawdust of aspen and red pine during or following preservative fixation by extraction with Cr(VI)-specific extractants. Cr(VI) was found only in alkaline extracts of treated wood, A major source of Cr(VI) was method-induced oxidation of fixed Cr(III) during alkaline extraction, as confirmed by demonstrated oxidation of Cr(III) from CrCl3 treated wood. Oxidation of nontoxic and immobile Cr(III) to toxic and mobile Cr(VI) was facilitated by the presence of wood at pH > 8.5. Thermodynamic equilibrium between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) is affected by pH, temperature, rates of dissolution of Cr(III) compounds, and oxygen availability. Results of this study recommend against alkaline extraction protocols for determination of Cr(VI) in treated wood. This Cr oxidation mechanism can act as a previously unrecognized route for generation of hazardous Cr(VI) if CCA treated wood is exposed to alkaline conditions during its production, use, or waste management.

AB  - A systematic process for assessing progress toward landscape sustainability goals is developed and tested. Application of the approach builds capacity and promotes continual improvements in management practices, thus enabling timely action to address changing conditions while progressing toward locally defined goals. We consider how the approach applies to agricultural landscapes, that is farm ecosystem interactions with the environment and human well-being. We present lessons learned from applying the assessment approach in two contrasting situations: large, high-input, commercial agriculture in northwestern Mexico and small, low-input family farms in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Applying the approach reveals five attributes required for success and the means to achieve those conditions. (1) Having a capable local champion for the project is critical. (2) Implementation of the approach must be in concert with local people and organizations as well as with regional and national policies and programs. (3) Identification and engagement of key stakeholders is essential. (4) Application of the approach is not meant to be a one-time effort but rather an ongoing and systematic process. (5) Engagement and buy-in from stakeholders including multiple agency levels is essential for allocation of necessary resources and logistic support in the continuing implementation of the approach.

AB  - Ecosystems affected by the formation of reservoirs are subjected to compulsory monitoring before, during and after the construction of the power plant. These monitoring programs generate large database that aim to satisfy environmental licensing conditions, as well as the management of water resources. In order to generate information that would facilitate the management of water resources, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of Tibagi river water located in Parana State, Brazil, before the construction of the Maua hydroelectric power plant (HPP). Data from four of the eight stations described in the Limnological Conditions Monitoring Program of the Tibagi river described in the HPP's Basic Environmental Plan were analyzed. The selected data comprises the period between December 2009 and April 2012, before the HPP installation. In general, the retained factors demonstrated the anthropogenic influence on the water resources. Even with a small variation in the composition of the factor 1 in the monitored stations, this factor was especially characterized by the variables: total phosphorus, total solids, and fecal coliforms. The presence of fecal coliforms in the factor's composition is a common indicator of pollution from untreated domestic sewage. The same applies to total phosphorus, which, as well as the total solids, can also be related to the inappropriate land use in the vicinity.

AB  - The lancet fluke, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, is perhaps the best-known example of parasite manipulation of host behavior, which is manifested by a radically changed behavior that leaves infected ants attached to vegetation at times when transmission to an herbivore host is optimal. Despite the publicity surrounding this parasite, curiously little is known about factors inducing and maintaining behavioral changes in its ant intermediate host. This study examined the importance of 3 environmental factors on the clinging behavior of red wood ants, Formica polyctena, infected with D. dendriticum. This behavior, hypothesized to involve cramping of the mandibular muscles in a state of tetany, was observed in naturally infected F. polyctena under controlled temperature, light, and humidity conditions. We found that low temperature significantly stimulated and maintained tetany in infected ants while light, humidity, ant size, and infection intensity had no influence on this behavior. Under none of the experimental conditions did uninfected ants attach to vegetation, demonstrating that tetany was induced by D. dendriticum. Temperature likely has a direct impact on the initiation of clinging behavior, but it may also serve as a simple but reliable indicator of the encounter rate between infected ants and ruminant definitive hosts. In addition, temperature-sensitive behavior manipulation may protect infected ants from exposure to temperatures in the upper thermal range of the host.

AB  - The condition of seagrass habitat and the marine environment on the Bermuda Platform, a mid-oceanic shallow water habitat in the northwest Atlantic, has been monitored since 2006. The overall oceanic climate of the Platform is subtropical; the Platform supports communities of tropical marine seagrasses, including Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Halodule sp., and Halophila decipiens. At the beginning of the study, the general condition of seagrass beds at 17 permanent offshore and nearshore sites indicated that 14 were healthy, complex, and thriving communities, and three represented offshore beds, which had declined precipitously prior to the initiation of study. Over the period of the study, seagrass beds declined at all 17 sites; three beds disappeared, and there was no recovery at the sites known to have declined prior to 2006. Over the same period, there was no apparent negative change in the water quality overlying the seagrass beds. Assessments of elemental content, stable isotopic composition, and leaf morphology indicated that grazing by the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is driving the decline of the seagrasses of Bermuda. Given the feeding behavior of these turtles on the Bermuda Platform, human intervention may be required to mitigate the decline of seagrass in Bermuda.

AB  - Unveiling past tipping points is a prerequisite for a better understanding of how individual species and entire ecosystems will respond to future climate change. Such knowledge is key for the implementation of biodiversity conservation. We identify the relationships between peatland vegetation and hydrological conditions over the past 2000 years using plant macrofossils, testate amoebae-based quantitative hydrological reconstructions and Sphagnum-moss functional traits from seven Polish peatland records. Using threshold indicator taxa analysis, we discovered that plant community composition strongly converged at a water level of ca 11.7 cm, indicating a community-level tipping point. We identified 45 plant taxa that showed either an increase or a decrease in their relative abundance between 8 and 17 cm of water-level depth. Our analysis of Sphagnum community traits further showed that Sphagnum functional diversity was remarkably stable over time despite Sphagnum species sensitivity to hydrological conditions. Our results suggest that past hydrological shifts did not influence major functions of the Sphagnum community, such as photosynthetic capacity, growth and productivity, owing to species replacement with a similar functional space. Although further studies including trait plasticity will be required, our findings suggest that the capacity of the Sphagnum community to gain carbon remained stable despite hydrological changes.

During the first occupancy periods of new and refurbished buildings, energy and indoor climate quality audits are important strategies to improve the buildings' energy use. In this context, this paper aims at showing the relations between the energy consumption and indoor environment quality (IEQ) parameters, obtained from the energy and IEQ audit in six representative modernised secondary schools - part of a larger R& D project untitled 3Es-geographically and climatically distributed in Portugal mainland.
   The monitoring period during the mid-season 2013 varied between schools, between two and three weeks. Air exchange rates, more specifically infiltration rates, were quantified aiming at determining the current airtightness condition of the refurbished schools. A subjective IEQ assessment was also performed, focusing on occupants' feedback, providing insight on the potential linkages between energy use and occupants' comfort.
   A reflection on the energy consumption indicators and the indoor conditions obtained in the classrooms was proposed, and some suggestions were anticipated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The nitric oxide (NO) free radical serves diverse functions in mammalian physiology, facilitating processes that range from vasodilation to neurotransmission to host-pathogen defense. Despite the fascinating biochemical utility of this small diatomic gas, NO and its derived oxidation or reduction products [reactive nitrogen species (RNSs) or reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs)] can be deleterious to cells and tissues under conditions of pathophysiology. Recent years have witnessed a tremendous and continuing scientific interest in RNI, both as targets for pharmacotherapy and as biomarkers for disease. Accordingly, methods have been developed to quantify RNI in real time under controlled experimental conditions. Such methods usually employ either electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin traps (see Chapter 45) or electrochemical sensors (Cserey and Gratzl, 2001). Nonetheless, the transient nature of NO and RNIs often precludes their routine assessment in animal experiments or human clinical studies where tissue must be archived and stored at a later time. To circumvent these limitations, methods have been invented to detect and quantify stably nitrated products of RNI reaction with ambient biomolecules. This chapter describes the theory and methodology for detection of lipid-phase tocopherol nitration products, especially 5-nitro-gamma-tocopherol (5-NO2-gamma T) by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD).

AB  - The Law of August 8, 2016 for "the Recovery of biodiversity, nature and landscapes" introduced the principle of compensation for ecological damage into French civil liability law. The definition of ecological damage given by the Law refers to the work of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment by distinguishing the ecosystem elements and their functions and services. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether the different ways of repairing ecological damage are in line with an ecosystem-based approach. For a very long time, legal doctrine has argued that reparation for ecological damage should be made "in kind". But restoration to return to the statu quo ante is not always possible and can sometimes prove dangerous for the ecosystems concerned. It appears that the most appropriate in-kind repair often consists simply in recreating the conditions that will allow new processes and new functions to be expressed. Where reparation in kind is impossible, to what extent are the various methods of assessment currently used by the courts compatible with an ecosystem-based approach? Finally, what are the recommendations that the scientific community can make to the judicial authorities to avoid mistakes being made on this point?

AB  - Freshwater cyanobacteria are hardly used as biological indicators of anthropogenic pressures, possibly for two main reasons: (a) their response to anthropogenic pressures is often poorly known; (b) reliably identifying cyanobacteria species is a challenge for technicians and researchers. We assessed the usefulness of cyanobacteria species as biological indicators of two human stressors: the high orthophosphate input from urban wastewaters; the high nitrate concentration produced by agricultural land use. We analysed variation in benthic cyanobacterial assemblages at 85 sites in South-Central Spain as a response to eight environmental variables: pH, conductivity, temperature, altitude, nitrate, orthophosphate, irrigation land use and non-irrigation land use.
   Results revealed that conductivity was the main environmental factor that contributed to differences between assemblages. Orthophosphate was more influential for community composition than nitrate. Changes in species composition related to human pressures suggested that some cyanobacteria species (e.g. Nostoc verrucosum, Phormidium autumnale, Plectonema tomasinianum, Rivularia haematites, Tolypothrix distorta) could be useful tools for the bioindication of anthropogenic pressures; while others species provide more information about natural physicochemical reference conditions (Nostoc caeruleum, Phormidium fonticola). Further research into cyanobacteria and macroalgae assemblages in different impacted scenarios could help improve macrophyte indices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental application and risk assessment of manufactured nanoparticles (MNPs) in soil greatly depend on our understanding of the interactions between MNPs and soil components. Because of the complexity of the soil system and the very early stage of MNP research in soil, our understanding of MNP behaviour in this system is very limited. This review summarizes the progress of research on MNPs and their implications for soils. Manufactured nanoparticles are applied deliberately for soil remediation and are also released unintentionally through various other pathways to soil. Their colloidal behaviour in the soil system is discussed by analysing the effect of dissolved organic matter, light irradiation, water chemistry conditions and biological processes. The methods currently used for modelling MNP leaching and transport are summarized and several requirements for model improvement are proposed. The current topics regarding the environmental risks of MNPs (such as identifying the toxicity of MNPs and their dissolved ions, evidence that MNPs may be taken up by soil organisms or the risks of other pollutants as affected by the presence of MNPs) are described. Future research directions are discussed and proposed.

AB  - Benthic foraminiferal assemblages can indicate the ecological status of coral-reef ecosystems. Their functional groups have been used to calculate the previously published FORAM Index (FI), which is based on total counts (living and dead) to indicate whether an environment is suitable to support prolific calcification by organisms that are dependent upon algal endosymbionts. Sediment was sampled from the Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha and the Abrolhos Archipelago and Parcel, which harbor important coral reef communities off the NE and E coasts of Brazil. Quantifying live specimens and taphonomic features of Amphistegina spp., along with the FI in 2005 and monitoring of the percentage of coral cover from 2002-2009, provided an assessment of coral reef health, which was mapped for both areas. Results indicated that FI was good (>4) in half of the sampled stations, but no living Amphistegina was found in the Abrolhos. Archipelago and Parcel, possibly indicating recently unfavorable conditions there. These findings suggest that palimpsest sediment can disguise FI so that, in some cases, the index fails to correlate with coral cover. A more realistic approach can be obtained by using the living counts of Amphistegina and their taphonomy to augment the ecological results from the FI.

AB  - Environmental diagnosis of supra-littoral and semi-intensive shrimp farm systems (SCS) in the northwestern part of Mexico had been developed for a 10-years period (1993 to 2003). The activities in the construction, operation and abandonment phases were evaluated by an environmental impact diagnosis analysis, causal diagrams, complex analysis systems, relevant environmental criteria analysis, and fuzzy logic impact assessment. The SCS, divided in Natural and Socioeconomic subsystems, showed important negative impact in the construction phase affecting the flora and fauna because of vegetation removal, but as positively was detected the employment because of the number of people hired. During the operation phase, positive impacts in the Socio-economic subsystem (SEC) were produced by high-educated employments offers, and increase of life quality. Opposite, the most important negative effect was caused by pollutant-enriched water discharges. In the abandonment phase, negative effects were identified by soil salinization, acidification, erosion increase, or the ecologic barriers role that ponds play. The combination of the methods applied in this work help to identify in an ordinal way the magnitude of the environmental impacts on shrimp cultures in any region and different conditions.

AB  - Scrippsiella trochoidea produces a calcareous walled cyst with spines during its life history. It has been recently reported that the calcareous wall can be decalcified under acidified conditions in coastal areas linked to hypoxia caused by bacterial activities. In this study, in order to determine whether the calcareous cysts can be a biological tool for indicating an in situ hypoxic environment, the morphology of S. trochoidea cysts in the surface sediments of Ise Bay, Japan, was examined in relation to dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom water. The surface sediments were collected from the inner to outer parts of the bay in May 2014 and June 2018. The living cysts of S. trochoidea were counted separately into two morphotypes: cyst with calcareous wall (calcareous walled-type cyst) and without the wall (naked-type cyst). The proportions (%) of naked-type cyst abundance in the total living cyst population showed an increasing tendency in the hypoxic environment of the inner and central parts of Ise Bay, but not in the normoxic environment at the mouth. This result supports the supposition that the naked-type cyst of S. trochoidea can be used as a biological indicator for the assessment of hypoxia in coastal areas.

AB  - With environmental conditions changing rapidly, there is a need to move beyond single-species models and consider how communities respond to environmental drivers. We present a modeling approach that allows estimation of multispecies synchrony in productivity, or its components, and the contribution of environmental covariates as synchronizing and desynchronizing agents. We apply the model to long-term breeding success data for five seabird species at a North Atlantic colony. Our Bayesian analysis reveals varying degrees of synchrony in overall productivity, with a common signal indicating a significant decline in productivity between 1986 and 2009. Productivity in seabirds reflects conditions in the marine ecosystem so the estimated synchronous component is a useful indicator of local marine environment health. For the two species for which we have most data, the environmental contribution to overall productivity synchrony is driven principally by effects operating at the chick stage rather than during incubation. Our results emphasize the importance of studying together species that coexist in a community. The framework, which accommodates interspecific clutch-size variation, is readily applicable to any species assemblage in any ecosystem where long-term productivity data are available.

AB  - Upland breeding bird communities were sampled from 225 points in 15 survey routes in the coastal region of western Lake Superior to examine relationships to human land use. Eighty-four species were detected and 50 were abundant enough to be included in data analysis. Monotonic quadratic regression models were constructed for these 50 species by using species counts as the dependent variable and the proportion of human conversion of the landscape (residential, agriculture, and commercial/industrial land uses) within each study area as the independent variable. Twenty-seven bird species had significant regressions (P < 0.05), 18 of which generally avoided areas developed by humans and 9 of which were attracted to development. Detrended correspondence analysis using counts of these 27 bird species was used to investigate multivariate, community responses to development. The first DCA axis was interpreted as a gradient from urban avoiding to urban exploiting bird species and was strongly correlated with land cover variables related to human development. Our results advance the idea that breeding bird communities can be used as indicators of ecological condition and can diagnose potential causes for changes in these conditions. Further, our study points out the usefulness of bird monitoring data in regional planning efforts that incorporate goals for maintaining native biological diversity.

AB  - Hypersaline ecosystems-aquatic environments where concentration of salt exceeds 35 g L-1-host microbial communities that are highly specialised to cope with these extreme conditions. However, our knowledge on the taxonomic diversity and functional metabolisms characterising microbial communities in the water columns of hypersaline ecosystems is still limited, and this may compromise the future preservation of these unique environments. DNA metabarcoding provides a reliable and affordable tool to investigate environmental dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, and its use in brine can be highly informative. Here, we make use of bacterial 16S metabarcoding techniques combined with hydrochemical analyses to investigate the microbial patterns (diversity and functions) from five hypersaline lakes located at Rottnest Island (WA). Our results indicate lake-driven microbial aquatic assemblages that are characterised by taxonomically and functionally moderately to extremely halophilic groups, with TDS (total dissolved solids) and alkalinity amongst the most influential parameters driving the community patterns. Overall, our findings suggest that DNA metabarcoding allows rapid but reliable ecological assessment of the hypersaline aquatic microbial communities at Rottnest Island. Further studies involving different hypersaline lakes across multiple seasons will help elucidate the full extent of the potential of this tool in brine.

AB  - Frequent pesticide-related impacts on ecosystems at concentrations considered environmentally safe indicate that the current risk assessment framework for registration of pesticides is not protective enough. Causes may include difficulties in assessing the effects of sequential pesticide pulses and their interaction with environmental stressors. By contrast to such realistic scenarios, risk assessment for registration of pesticides is typically based on tests of a single exposure period under benign laboratory conditions. Here, we investigated the toxicological sensitivity of Gammarus pulex, an ecologically relevant crustacean, from uncontaminated control streams and pesticide-contaminated agricultural streams by exposing them to pesticide contamination in the laboratory. Individuals from contaminated streams were 2.7-fold more sensitive to pesticide exposure than individuals from the reference streams. We revealed that this increase in sensitivity was the result of a synergistic interaction of sequential pesticide exposure and temperature stress. Such multiple stressor scenarios are typical for agricultural streams. We conclude that the interactive effects of sequential toxicant exposure and additional environmental stressors need to be considered in a realistic risk assessment framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents an integrated framework for the analysis of options of agricultural development and natural resource management at the ecosystem level. Pujiang County in Zhejiang Province, China, is used as a case-study area. The IMGLP model is applied to maximize regional agricultural economic surplus and labor market conditions in Pujiang. The consequences of four poverty reduction strategies (intensification of production, diversification toward livestock production, land expansion, and exit from agriculture) are determined for a set of regional poverty and biodiversity indicators. Diversification seems to be the most promising poverty reduction strategy, but requires an efficient use of animal manure in cropping systems to avoid environmental problems. Improved nutrient management in cropping systems is effective in reducing the regional nitrogen surplus, but less effective in increasing per capita income. The exit strategy is beneficial for reducing poverty and achieving biodiversity, but may have important social consequences that are not addressed in this study. Further reduction of rural poverty is hampered by labor constraints during the harvesting period for high-value crops such as vegetables and fruits. These constraints can be overcome by intensive research and development in the field of agricultural mechanization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Billions of dollars have been invested over the past 35 years in reducing pollutant emissions to coastal environments. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this investment is hampered by the lack of long-term consistent data. A rare opportunity exists in southern California to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions by analyzing long-term monitoring of effluent, sediment, benthos, and fish and comparing this trend data to periodic regional surveys of environmental condition. In this paper, we ask the question "have improvements in effluent quality in response to environmental regulation translated into improvements in the receiving environment?" Results indicate that management actions directed at reducing mass emissions from wastewater treatment plants (POTWs) have resulted in substantial improvement in aquatic communities. However, the magnitude and timing of response varies by indicator suggesting that use of multiple assessment endpoints is necessary to adequately interpret trends. Reductions in the effect of POTW effluent have allowed managers to shift resources to address other contaminant sources such as stormwater and resuspension of legacy pollutants.

AB  - The natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) are complex and have been difficult to implement. The complexity and difficulty in implementation arise both from the assessment procedures specified in agency NRDA guidance and from the limited ability of ecologists to quantify impacts of hazardous substances on natural resources. This paper explores the scientific aspects of NRDA implementation, and discusses conceptual and methodological relationships between NRDA and the much broader field of ecological risk assessment (ERA). We discuss three critical components of the NRDA assessment approach: measuring natural resource injuries and reductions in resource services; evaluating causality; and establishing baseline conditions. We identify (1) specific approaches drawn from ERA practice that could improve each of these components, and (2) research needs and institutional changes that may improve the ability of the NRDA process to achieve its stated objectives. We recommend the acceleration of the ongoing dialogue among NRDA practitioners from the Trustee and PRP communities as a first step toward resolving the procedural and technical deficiencies of the NRDA process.

AB  - Butterflies are important pollinators and indicators of environmental health. Habitat destruction and fragmentation caused by developmental activities and poor natural resource management are the main reasons for the drastic decline of butterfly populations throughout the world, and prompt the need for effective conservation management. We assessed the diversity, richness, seasonal distribution and conservation priorities of butterflies in an inner-city parkland habitat (University of Dhaka, Bangladesh) and investigated the biotic, and abiotic factors affecting butterfly diversity. A total of 93 species from 5 families were recorded from January to December 2014. Nymphalidae and Papilionidae were the most and least dominant families in terms of species number. Butterflies across families generally selected nectar plants randomly, although some showed preference towards herbs. Spatial interpolation of butterfly richness indicated that the most suitable area was around Curzon Hall, an area containing different types of vegetation. Precipitation was the only abiotic factor with a significant relationship with butterfly species richness. The establishment of green areas with complex structural vegetation will improve microclimatic conditions for butterflies, promoting healthier urban ecosystems, and the conservation of butterflies and other associated species in inner-city areas.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolous vulgaris L.) is generally known as a weak N-2 fixer compared with other legumes. The availability of genetic variation for N-2 fixation potential of common bean supports the idea that symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in common bean can be improved through breeding. To assess the potential N-2 fixation of selected common bean genotypes, 12 bean varieties including three Andean and nine Middle American were screened for SNF ability and related traits in controlled environments and field trials in Ontario, Canada. A non-nodulating mutant, R99, was used as the reference plant to estimate nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) through the natural N-15 abundance method. Significant variation was found among the bean genotypes for Ndfa and its related traits. Environmental and genotype by environmental effects significantly influenced Ndfa and its related traits. The three Andean bean genotypes were superior to Middle American genotypes for nodulation ability, while the Middle American genotypes were generally stronger nitrogen fixers in optimum soil moisture conditions. In general, nitrogen fixation was found to be significantly associated with seed yield and carbon isotope discrimination, an indicator of water use efficiency.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the health of a subtidal marine sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius, naturally exposed in a shipping terminal where polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had been spilled, as well as that of others sculpins after decontamination in the laboratory for 16 weeks. Reference samples were captured at a pristine site upcurrent from the contaminated terminal. Examination of field samples caught by scuba divers showed external and toxicopathic lesions in several tissues; decreased body condition and organ indices; and decreased hemoglobin and lymphocyte levels. No difference in the diversity of parasites was observed between reference and contaminated samples, but abundance was generally greater in fish from the latter site. Although the total number of species of parasites decreased in both groups of depurated sculpins, the abundance of infections on gill and gall bladder was significantly greater in fish from the polluted site. These results suggest that M. scorpius was affected adversely by PCBs and that its responses are ecologically significant as a bioindicator species in degraded habitats. Moreover, remediation might not mitigate the observed anomalies in fish inhabiting the impacted site.

AB  - The study compared the habitat conditions and species composition of phytocoenosis between beaver ponds in different age categories: 5-10 years, 11-15 years and older than 15 years. The survey was conducted on 11 beaver ponds located on various watercourses in northern Poland. Prior to flooding, an alder stand was present at all sites. The tree stand in all cases has decayed in at least 90%. At each beaver pond, six releves were done. Habitat conditions were determined using ecological indicators and estimating selected parameters in the area of each phytosociological survey. The obtained results indicate that the dry up of beaver ponds takes place 10-15 years after their formation. At this time the greatest changes in species composition occur. In beaver ponds aged 5-10 years, species of Lemnetea class dominate, in ponds aged 10-15 year - species of Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Phragmitetea classes, while in ones older than 15 years species - those of Phragmitetea and Artemisietea classes. The cover of the shrub layer increases significantly 10 years after the beaver pond was established. After 15 years, a new generation of trees taller than 5 meters is observed. Also in this age category, the highest cover of species from the class Querco-Fagetea (mean 5%) is observed, indicating the possibility of regeneration of the riparian forests.

AB  - Intergenerational changes in many biological traits are indicators of environmental conditions. One of such anthropometric measures is the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) which estimates nutritional status. Likewise, Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used as an anthropometric indicator of relative weight. The aim of this study was to reveal secular trends in MUAC and BMI, as biological indicators of changing living conditions, between 1966 and 2012 among Polish children from different socioeconomic groups. Total sample involved 64 393 schoolchildren aged 7-18 years, investigated in 4 Surveys (1966, 1978, 1988, 2012). Overall socioeconomic status (SES) was divided into two categories: lower and higher (including: urbanization, family size, parental education). Results showed that MUAC and BMI differed significantly with respect to the year of survey, sex and SES category. Both measures were higher within higher SES group compared to the lower one until 1988, while in 2012 convergence of these indicators in both SES categories was observed. Both the year of survey, sex, SES category and interactions between them had higher impact on MUAC than BMI (measured by effect size). Our findings revealed that long-term socioeconomic changes affect MUAC more noticeably than BMI. Therefore MUAC may be a more accurate screening tool.

AB  - Integrated catchment management represents an approach to managing the resources of a catchment by integrating environmental, economic, and social issues. It is aimed at deriving sustainable benefits for future generations, while protecting natural resources, particularly water, and minimizing possible adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences. Indicators of sustainable development, which summarize information for use in decision-making, are invaluable when trying to assess the diverse, interacting components of catchment processes and resource management actions. The Driving-Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) indicator framework is useful for Identifying and developing indicators of sustainable development for catchment management. Driving forces have been identified as the natural conditions occurring in a catchment and the, level of development and economic activity. Pressures include the natural and anthropogenic supply of water, water demand, and water pollution. State indicators can be split into those of quantity and those of quality. Impacts include those that affect the ecosystems directly and those that impact the use value of the resource. It core indicators are identified within each of the categories given in the framework, most major catchment-based management issues can be evaluated. This framework is applied to identify key issues in catchment management in South Africa, and develop a set of indicators for evaluating catchments throughout the country.

AB  - Diatoms have been sampled in several types of water bodies in the province of Overijssel for a period of five years. Samples from 333 sites were examined both in spring and autumn. Extensive analysis of physico-chemical variables was carried out.
   Data were processed by multivariate analysis for detecting correlations between species and environmental factors. Both ordination and clustering techniques were used. Statistical tests were performed to evaluate environmental relationships.
   The main factors in this study appear to be pH, nutrient pollution (saprobity and trophic degree) and alkalinity. Within the group of waters which is not influenced by extreme conditions of pH or pollution, there is a discrepancy between waters with low and high alkalinity.
   The present study confirms that diatoms are useful indicators of pollution and pH, as well documented by several authors. Diatoms are also suitable as biological indicators for alkalinity at least on a regional scale. This offers possibilities for the use of diatoms in monitoring studies, especially in waters that are still under relatively low environmental stress. It also offers opportunities for setting ecological standards, based on the characteristics of non-polluted water bodies. This aspect will be of interest to the water management policy in the province of Overijssel.

AB  - Plankton in rivers are good indicators of water quality and their study along the longitudinal axis allows for understanding the interactions between natural and anthropogenic variations and diversity at different spatial scales. We compared the taxonomic biodiversity of planktonic microcrustaceans in two sections of the Frades River Basin, Brazil. Water and microcrustaceans were sampled in August 2018, April 2019, July 2019, and October 2019 in the basin. We recorded 43 taxa as the regional diversity of microcrustaceans. Alpha diversity was statistically higher in the upper section of the basin. The analysis of indicator species showed that nine species were characteristic of the studied sections. The upper section was represented by Nicsmirnovius paggii, Acroperus tupinamba, Alonella dadayi, Alona guttata, and Microcyclops finitimus and characterized by higher dissolved oxygen, higher values of pH of water and lower nitrate and total coliforms concentrations. Diaphanosoma birgei, Alona sp., Grimaldina brazzai, and Ilyocryptus spinifer were characteristic of the lower sections of the basin, with the highest concentrations of nitrate and total coliforms. The microcrustaceans in the lower sections were limited by the gradient of environmental conditions, making local communities simpler (low species richness) and with few species probably adjusted to narrow ranges of environmental conditions.

AB  - Models that predict sunlight inactivation rates of bacteria are valuable tools for predicting the fate of pathogens in recreational waters and designing natural wastewater treatment systems to meet disinfection goals. We developed biological weighting function (BWF)-based numerical models to estimate the endogenous sunlight inactivation rates of E. coli and enterococci. BWF-based models allow the prediction of inactivation rates under a range of environmental conditions that shift the magnitude or spectral distribution of sunlight irradiance (e.g., different times, latitudes, water absorbances, depth). Separate models were developed for laboratory strain bacteria cultured in the laboratory and indigenous organisms concentrated directly from wastewater. Wastewater bacteria were found to be 5-7 times less susceptible to full-spectrum simulated sunlight than the laboratory bacteria, highlighting the importance of conducting experiments with bacteria sourced directly from wastewater. The inactivation rate models fit experimental data well and were successful in predicting the inactivation rates of wastewater E. coli and enterococci measured in clear marine water by researchers from a different laboratory. Additional research is recommended to develop strategies to account for the effects of elevated water pH on predicted inactivation rates.

AB  - Groundwater plays an important role in New Zealand water supplies and hence monitoring activities are conducted regularly. Most monitoring programmes aim to evaluate groundwater chemistry and almost completely overlook the microbial component in this ecosystem. In our present study, the bacterial community structure of groundwater in the Wairarapa Valley was examined using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and relationships between bacterial community structure and groundwater chemistry, aquifer confinement and groundwater usage were explored. In addition, the results from this study were compared with a previous T-RFLP survey of the same area in an attempt to detect changes in bacterial community structure over time. The data obtained suggested that bacterial community structure was related to groundwater chemistry, especially to redox conditions. Species composition showed minimal variation over time if groundwater chemistry remained unchanged. These findings reflect the potential of using bacterial communities as biological indicators to evaluate the health of groundwater ecosystems. We suggest that it is important to include this type of broad bacterial diversity assessment criteria into regular groundwater monitoring activities.

AB  - Gene expression biomarkers can enable rapid assessment of physiological conditions in situ, providing a valuable tool for reef managers interested in linking organism physiology with large-scale climatic conditions. Here, we assessed the ability of quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based gene expression biomarkers to evaluate (i) the immediate cellular stress response (CSR) of Porites astreoides to incremental thermal stress and (ii) the magnitude of CSR and cellular homeostasis response (CHR) during a natural bleaching event. Expression levels largely scaled with treatment temperature, with the strongest responses occurring in heat-shock proteins. This is the first demonstration of a tiered' CSR in a coral, where the magnitude of expression change is proportional to stress intensity. Analysis of a natural bleaching event revealed no signature of an acute CSR in normal or bleached corals, indicating that the bleaching stressor(s) had abated by the day of sampling. Another long-term stress CHR-based indicator assay was significantly elevated in bleached corals, although assay values overall were low, suggesting good prospects for recovery. This study represents the first step in linking variation in gene expression biomarkers to stress tolerance and bleaching thresholds in situ by quantifying the severity of ongoing thermal stress and its accumulated long-term impacts.

AB  - The use of diatoms as bioindicators to detect human-induced change is a globally accepted monitoring tool. DNA metabarcoding is an effective complementary tool to standard microscopic methods for species identification, providing reliable and timeous diatom assessments in a range of aquatic ecosystems. This study evaluated the suitability of the DNA metabarcoding approach for diatom monitoring in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa. Results obtained from the standard microscopic (morphological) and molecular methods were compared and indicated a low similarity in the vegetated (11%), unvegetated (12%) and epiphytic (12%) habitats at species level for the epipelic and epiphytic diatom communities. The difference between the methods was expected given the challenges pertaining to the incomplete molecular reference database, intragenomic variability, physiological differences (number of chloroplasts) and highly variable microphytobenthos biomass. While the molecular method was unable to identify the presence of all the dominant diatom species (routinely used as ecological indicators), the available molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) provided an effective complementary tool to determine the relevant community diversity estimates required for the application of the South African estuarine health index (EHI).

AB  - Most of the world's catches of sharks are incidentally taken by tuna fishing gear, constituting bycatches that increase the extinction risk of several species of shark. This not only alters ecosystem functions by removing top predators, but may also hinder the industry production itself due to cutoff measures set by authorities. This paper focuses on the female population abundance of a very important bycatch species, the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), and proposes a stochastic model for quantitative risk assessment under varying harvest regimes and control measures. The proposed model can be applied to any shortfin mako shark population by changing initial conditions and harvest parameters. The flexibility of the model makes it practicable to simulate hundreds of scenarios, analyse and compare the most relevant results such as the risk of extinction caused by a given harvest regime, median time to extinction, expected minimum biomass, risk of low harvest, and risk reduction caused by control measure; these outcomes are useful for rational decisions under uncertainty. We present an application example as a means to demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to drive management decisions for sustainable tuna harvest.

AB  - The ESCA (Ecological Status of Coralligenous Assemblages) index was developed to assess the ecological quality of coralligenous habitat using macroalgae as a biological indicator. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to human-induced pressures of macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates shaping the coralligenous habitat and to integrate their sensitivity into the ESCA index. Coralligenous assemblages were sampled at 15 locations of the NW Mediterranean Sea classified into three groups: i) marine protected areas; ii) low urbanized locations; and iii) highly urbanized locations. A sensitivity level value was assigned to each taxon/group on the basis of its abundance in each environmental condition, the data available in the literature and the results of an expert judgement survey. The index that includes the totality of the assemblages (named ESCA-TA), calculated using both macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates, detected the levels of human pressure more precisely than the index calculated with only macroalgae or with only invertebrates. The potential for assessing the ecological quality of marine coastal areas was thus increased with the ESCA-TA index thanks to the use of a higher variety of descriptors.

AB  - With its high level of species endemism, Mexico's Central Valley region is a priority zone for biodiversity conservation. The region comprises several protected natural areas, and Mexico's federal authorities are considering the creation of a "biological corridor" extending from the Mariposa Monarca Park to the Popocatepetl Park. However, the Central Valley landscape is severely affected by human pressures, particularly from mining, agricultural expansion and urban sprawl around large conurbations. These pressures are causing forest fragmentation and breaking up connectivity between natural ecosystems. This study analyses the reality of the biological corridor linking the protected natural areas of the Central Valley. First, forest fragmentation in this area was quantified using morphological indices derived from "landscape ecology" theory. A model of percolation was then applied to estimate connectivity between these natural ecosystems and to propose objectively defined boundaries for the biological corridor. Of particular interest in this study was the integration of different landscape indicators to show the actual condition of the "biological corridor" in Mexico's Central Valley. The study was thus able to identify several "hot-spots" crucial to the long-term sustainability of the corridor, which will demand proactive and well-targeted public policies.

AB  - Information on parasites of vertebrates living in terrestrial ecosystems as monitoring tools for heavy metal environmental pollution is scarce. The present study evaluates the potential suitability of the models Rattus rattus/Moniliformis moniliformis and Mus domesticus/Rodentolepis microstoma as promising bioindicator systems for cadmium and lead pollutions under natural conditions. The highest level of cadmium was found in one specimen of M. moniliformis (335.2 ng g(-1) wet weight) and the average concentration of Cd in the acanthocephalan was significantly higher than values found in R. rattus liver and kidney tissues. The maximum concentration of lead occurred in one specimen of R. microstoma (567.4 ng g(-1) wet weight) and the average concentration of Pb in the cestode was significantly higher than values found in M. domesticus liver, kidney and muscle tissues. The present results allow proposing both models as promising biomonitoring systems to evaluate environmental cadmium pollution (mainly R. rattus/M. moniliformis) and lead contamination (especially M. domesticus/R. microstoma) in terrestrial nonurban habitats.

AB  - Predicting the magnitude of enemy release in host-pathogen systems after introduction of novel disease resistance genes has become a central problem in ecology. Here, we develop a general quantitative framework for predicting changes in realized niche size and intrinsic population growth rate after introgression of disease resistance genes into wild host populations. We then apply this framework to a model host-pathogen system targeted by genetically modified and conventionally bred disease-resistant host lines (Trifolium repens lines expressing resistance to Clover yellow vein potyvirus) and show that, under a range of ecologically realistic conditions, the introduction of novel pathogen resistance genes into host populations can pose a quantifiable risk to associated nontarget native plant communities. In the host-pathogen system studied, we predict that pathogen release could result in an increase in the intrinsic rate of population growth of up to 15% and the expansion of host populations into some marginal environments. This approach has general applicability to the ecological risk assessment of all novel disease-resistant plant genotypes that target coevolutionary host-pathogen systems for improvement of agricultural productivity.

AB  - A significant problem for effect assessment of aquatic ecosystems arises from the large ranges of toxicity data, which can be found in different databases and literature. Here, ranges are given for the aquatic toxicity of 27 high production volume chemicals. Based on these illustrative examples and on the current literature on uncertainty in aquatic effect assessment, toxicity ranges are discussed for their possible causes (variation in experimental condition, species, endpoint, time) and ways to handle them (safety factors). Implications and recommendations on the procedure of risk analysis of chemical substances are drawn.
   Two main requirements for a comprehensive risk assessment are identified, which often play a minor role in current practice (as they are often neglected) as well as in scientific discussion (as they are means to be trivial). First, data quality must be checked critically before applying any result of a toxicity test. Secondly, experimental data should rake into account different species and acme as well as chronic data. If these aspects are considered in risk analysis, which is common practice in ecotoxicology but not always in the context of practical applications in risk engineering, a more comprehensive picture of the environmental toxicity of a chemical substance can be obtained.

AB  - Maritime Antarctica is one of the major terrestrial ecosystems dominated by lichens and mosses, which represent important ecological indicators. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the changes in associated communities of mosses-lichens diversity and coverage along a pedoenvironmental gradient on Half Moon Island, Maritime Antarctica. We focused on how patterns in associated communities of mosses-lichens species diversity (richness, species composition and beta diversity) and coverage are associated with soil properties using plant inventory data from 174 plots across 14 contrasting pedoenvironments. The results clearly show marked differences in soil properties along the pedoenvironmental gradient, which determine variations in species composition, richness and coverage. We presumed that these variations are common in Maritime Antarctica owing to varying periglacial processes, weathering degree, parent material and biological influence (especially by penguins and other birds). The community species richness and coverage along the pedoenvironmental gradient differ, nevertheless share common species present in most pedoenvironments, despite differences in coverage. We assume that most of the pedoenvironments are habitats to rare species that occur only under specific soil conditions, additionally promotes high beta-diversity between pedoenvironments and low species similarity.

AB  - This study is the first attempt at the European scale to make an inventory of ecosystem services (ESS) of a large lake. We analysed a set of ESS indicators against the annual mean values of environmental parameters for 2006-2013. According to principal component analysis, the trophic state- and hydrology-related factors explained about 70% of the environmental variability of the lake and showed strong relationships with some ESS. Among the provisioning ESS, the annual eel catch and the total fish catch were positively related to different eutrophication indicators while the catches of pike, bream, and burbot depended rather on hydrological factors. Reed harvesting efficiency was related to the lake's water level. The indicators of regulating, maintenance, and cultural ESS showed very high variability in different years, the latter depending on socio-economic conditions rather than environmental factors. We discovered numerous trade-offs between ESS benefitting from higher trophic state or regulated water level of the lake and the goals of good ecological status of the lake. Our analysis showed a clear need for rules prioritizing life supporting regulatory services against other ESS.

AB  - Flow cytometry was applied to assess the microbiological impact of treated sewage effluent discharge into a small brook carrying surface runoff water. Increases in dissolved organic carbon and soluble reactive phosphorous were accompanied by increases in counts of intact bacteria by up to eightfold. Effluent ingress furthermore resulted in a pronounced shift of bacterial clusters. Whereas brook water upstream of the discharge point was characterised by a bacterial cluster with low nucleic acid (LNA) content, downstream water showed a shift to bacteria with high nucleic acid (HNA) content. Changes in the LNA/HNA ratio were largely maintained along the course of the brook. Results suggest that the LNA/HNA ratio can under certain conditions serve as an indicator of anthropogenic nutrient impact. Measuring impact on this low trophic level might be more sensitive and straightforward than measuring macroindicators. More evidence will however be required to assess the usefulness of LNA/HNA measurements to assess the ecological nutrient status of natural waters and the impact of nutrient pollution.

AB  - This paper assesses residential environment induced preference heterogeneity regarding ecosystem services improvements of a river basin by comparing urban and rural residents' welfare estimates. In a choice experiment, the ecological improvements are described in terms of several observable ecological indicators set in an experimental design. Given the fact that economic and environmental conditions differ for urban and rural residents in China, the utility they derive from ecological restoration is hypothesized to differ. The urban and rural residents' survey data were modeled separately using mixed logit models. The results reveal that water quality and water quantity, measured by unit of level improvement and percentage improvement, respectively, hold the highest marginal utility values in all respondents' models. Urban and rural residents have the same preference regarding expanding soil erosion control areas and landscape improvement. However, they have statistically significant different utility for water quality, water quantity, forest coverage, ecotourism improvements, and reducing soil erosion intensity. Generally, urban residents express a higher implicit price for most of the ecological indicators. The findings imply that policy makers should take existing preference heterogeneity into account in designing ecosystem payment schemes and allocating resources.

AB  - Carabid beetles are frequently used as the environment condition indicators. Main purpose of this study was to test if community structure parameters of carabids indicate the stress intensity of heavy metal contamination in the soil of temperate forests. Three geographic regions in Europe differing in both degree of accumulation of heavy metals and its quality were chosen. In Olkusz (southern Poland) the main stressor was zinc, in Glogow (western Poland) - copper and in Clydach (Wales, UK) - nickel. We found strong division between assemblages from contaminated and reference sites (fig. 2). Indicator species from pollution preferring areas in one region can avoid polluted sites in the other region (tab. 2). Species preferring contaminated soils were significantly smaller than those that avoid such ecosystems (F=5.46, p<0.05). Generalized linear model indicated that species richness and biomass decreased in each stressor gradient of contaminated forests. Mean individual biomass and mean abundance of assemblages were significantly lower along zinc gradient only. Species with broader ecological range replace habitat specialists as a response to resource unpredictability Decreased species richness and biomass in polluted forests indicate degradation of habitat resources and forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring trace element that is also a by-product of anthropogenic activities and, in its methylated form, it is a neurotoxin that can have adverse effects on wildlife. The toxicity of Hg for humans, wildlife, and ecosystem health merits monitoring of its concentrations by various sampling means. Marine birds are widely used as indicators of ecosystem health, including biomonitoring of Hg in the Arctic. Since the mid-1970s, Hg concentrations in marine birds have been monitored across the Canadian North. Current Hg burdens in most northern marine bird species are below levels associated with health concerns, but several species have concentrations that are at or near levels associated with impaired reproduction. Arctic marine birds in Canada may be particularly at risk from increasing Hg levels associated with changing climatic conditions and long-term Hg deposition patterns. Research on marine birds should, therefore, continue to focus on spatial and temporal patterns of Hg contamination, assessing levels and biological effects in species that are experiencing high concentrations, and among species that are widely harvested due to the possible implications for human health.

AB  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied extensively for its unique self-assembling behavior for applications in the field of molecular electronics. The study of sequence-specific electronic properties of DNA is one such study which could potentially be utilized as a platform to understand its charge transfer mechanism useful for integration into DNA-based electronics. However, DNA charge transfer are significantly regulated by various environmental factors, such as pH fluctuations which influences the stability of the double helix structure and strongly attenuates its' electronic profile. Extreme pH conditions lead to aggravated structural and chemical changes leading to DNA damage, which could have profound biological consequences. In this work, pH influence on basidiomycetes DNAs integrated within an aluminium (Al)-indium tin oxide (ITO) Schottky junction was investigated. In general, the junction structure exhibited Ohmic behaviour at high acidic (pH 1 to 2) and basic (pH 13 to 14) environments, while behaving as a semiconductive Schottky-like junction at intermediate pH values. Furthermore, various solid-state parameters calculated for the DNA enable the gathering of information towards understanding the charge transfer mechanism in DNA molecules as a function of pH conditions, which could act as a potential indicator for various stages of DNA functionality.

AB  - There is growing empirical evidence around the world demonstrating regime shifts of marine ecosystems. But generalizable criteria to detect and define regime shifts are elusive because of: (i) an incomplete scientific understanding of processes underlying regime shifts; (ii) because the baseline state and conditions are ill defined, and; (iii) due to an inherent ambiguity in the concept of system identity. We surveyed marine scientists in Tasmania, Australia, and determined the effect of changing conditions (including type of climate impact, species loss, species composition, spatio-temporal extent, and human intervention) on their perception of marine regime shift. We find, there is an objective difficulty in detecting regime shifts that goes beyond scientific uncertainty and there is disagreement on which configurations of change indeed constitute a regime shift. Furthermore, this difference of opinion was not related to the degree of confidence that scientists indicated when identifying regime shifts. This lack of consensus and seemingly unrelated scientific confidence, may be attributable to value ambiguity around people s attitudes, cognitive biases, and baseline shift. When applying evidenced-based reference points in well-reasoned Ecosystem Based Management, there should be scientific consensus on the manifestation and extent of specific regime shifts, and recognition of value ambiguities influencing scientific perceptions.

AB  - Pharmaceutical wastewater has become an important source for emitting antibiotics into aquatic environments. However, this study aims to evaluate the potential of different advanced oxidation processes like ozonation, photolysis, and photo-catalysis for degrading a fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in real pharmaceutical wastewater. The raw wastewater contains a high concentration of organic content (COD: 603 mg/L, BOD: 116 mg/L) and significant concentration of CIP (7.91 mg/L). In ozonation, compared with the acidic and basic conditions, the degradation rate was faster under basic conditions and showed a competently degraded CIP (up to 98.7%) under the optimum pH 9 within 30 min, whereas photo-catalysis by using commercial anatase (TiO2) is considered to be the most effective technique for decreasing the concentration of CIP up to 100% within 30 min under the optimized TiO2 dose (1000 mg/L). The degradation rate was quicker and found to be several times faster than in direct photolysis. Furthermore, electrical energy per order was also calculated for all processes and was obvious by the results that photo-catalysis consume less energy of about 8.7 kWh/m(3), for almost complete deduction of CIP.

AB  - In the face of the current changes in land use and climate as well as habitat destruction, it is important to study herbaceous vegetation as an indicator of changes occurring in savanna ecosystems. We investigated the effects of climate, land use and habitat, both alone and in combination, on the diversity and occurrence of West African savanna herbaceous plant communities. Floristic data and environmental variables were sampled in Burkina Faso and subjected to ordination and indicator species analysis to explore the variation in nine vegetation types. Regression analyses showed that climate, land use, humidity gradient, soil fraction and vegetation structure discriminate herbaceous plant communities. Climate, habitat and their interaction had the greatest effect on the occurrence of these communities. Changes in species richness of the studied communities were mainly due to climate, land use and their interaction, which were more important for increasing rather than decreasing diversity. In all cases, climate conditions remained the most important environmental factor driving vegetation variation in West African savannas. Beside this, the effects of habitat degradation in interaction with land use and climatic conditions indicate land use to be a threat for the diversity of the herbaceous vegetation.

AB  - Lake Ludas has been under a strong anthropogenic influence for a very long time, so the history of fruitful scientific investigation was very often connected with the evaluation of a human impact and potential rehabilitation measures. Unfortunately, attempts to improve the lake's natural status remain more in the field of theoretical models than concrete practical solutions. Aiming to better understand the potential of different rehabilitation measures for Lake Ludas, we combined our ecological analyses (unpublished results) and the literature survey. The continuous massive cyanobacterial bloom and the formation of a thick sediment layer rich in different organic and inorganic pollutants represent two major challenges in the lake's rehabilitation. The unknown ecological role of invasive species that have already colonised Lake Ludas will make the attempts to improve conditions in the lake even more challenging. The reduction of nutrient load, changes in the intensity and directions of water circulation, as well as top sediment layer removal in the lake, are measures under consideration for several decades. But their combination, order of implementation and possibilities of successful execution are still under debate. However, there is no doubt that the restoration of a natural hydrological regime should be a key step in the rehabilitation of Lake Ludas.

AB  - A baseline study was conducted from November 2006 to October 2007 to investigate the status of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bio-indicators and their ecological linkages to physico-chemical characteristics of four wetland areas of Punjab namely, Balloki Headworks, Qadirabad Headworks, Rasul Headworks and Kalar Kahar Lake. The sampling points were marked on a map using GPS; Garmen 97. The hydrological parameters such as temperature, pH, LDO, salinity and TDS were recorded to get knowledge of the effect of season on the pond ecosystem. Macroinvertebrate sampling from the pelagic water was done using a dip net of mesh size approximately 0.6 mm, dragged in the water for 15 minutes. These were then preserved and identified up to the order level. The results revealed that Balloki area being under the effect of dry season and agricultural stress had more tolerant species. The presence of pollution sensitive ephemeroptera was justified by low TDS and high LDO at Rasul Headworks. The hydrology and fauna of Kalar Kahar Lake was exclusively different from the other sites. In this case pH, TDS, salinity were highest whereas LDO was the lowest. The relative abundance of sensitive to tolerant species was in accordance with the hydrological data.

AB  - The coastal zone of the disused industrial site of Bagnoli, has been studied since 1999 in order to highlight chemical and ecological features of pollution, mainly due to a steel plant. This further study was performed in order to check the foraminiferal response to changes in sediment grain-size and contaminant concentrations and to recognise the actual effects of the environmental stress determined by industrial pollution on the foraminiferal assemblages. This was attained by considering a wider area than in the previous studies so as to recognise the possible reference conditions. Very high contamination, mainly due to Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and PAHs, was recorded in the marine sediments close to the steel plant. Contaminant concentrations and sediment composition were recognised as important factors influencing the foraminiferal response by means of statistical analysis. The foraminiferal abnormality index (FAI) is positively correlated with heavy metals concentration, exceeding the natural threshold in front of the plant. Furthermore, increasing pollution levels correspond to the increase of pollution-tolerant species in the assemblage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The research paper covers the features of the socio-economic and environmental diagnostics of agricultural land use. Zoning is a kind of basis for the territorial record keeping of the natural conditions and resources, quantity, quality, as well as the production capacity of lands in the system of taxonomic units. It is a natural and historical basis for the placement of agricultural production, land valuation, the development of land use patterns, land management patterns and projects, farming and agriculture systems, etc. Natural zoning reflects the need for priority land use in the interests of the economy. It has an agrobioecological basis due to the peculiarities of agricultural production, the essence of which is the utilization of the solar energy by the plant organisms necessary to maintain the ecological stability of the territory. The authors used the methods of particle-size and chemical analysis, the methods of comparing indicators for zones with various types of agriculture and soils of the military sites under the influence of the man-made factors. The main socio-economic indicators characterizing the development of land use were analyzed. The concept of state policy forms in the valuation of unused lands of Krasnodar Krai was substantiated.

AB  - The Arabian Gulf is a shallow sea naturally exposed to extreme conditions of temperature and salinity due to its location, semi-enclosed nature, bathymetry and restricted circulation. Compared to open marine systems, the added stress imposed by pollutants is likely to have additional adverse consequences. Maintaining good marine environmental quality is crucial for several socio-economic reasons, one of the most important being that the region relies heavily on seawater as a source of freshwater through desalination. While regionally based marine monitoring programs employing chemical endpoints have been widely deployed, few have evaluated the potential biological effects of those contaminants detected. However, it is now widely recognized that an integrated approach using both chemical measurements and appropriate biological endpoints in key sentinel species is essential to the design and implementation of marine environmental programs. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies published so far in the Gulf on the biological effects of chemical contaminants using different biological endpoints and suggest potential areas requiring additional research.

AB  - Grassland plant communities, given their dual origin (both natural and anthropogenic), are considered as an indicator of the agro-ecological factors at work in a rural landscape. Vegetation classification and its ecological interpretation allow us to focus on the main factors, i.e. the moisture gradient and the gradient of intensity of management, on which the richness and the diversity of plant communities depend. The loss of plant richness and biodiversity observed is mainly due to the increasing dominance of competitive species (sensu Grime) characterizing plant communities, which occurs along both dynamic and nutrient gradients in grassland.
   Such consequences are of particular importance for biodiversity and wildlife conservation in central Normandy where, over the last decades, changing agricultural practices, resulting from the transformation of farm structures, have led to both intensification and land abandonment. In an attempt to schematize these issues, we focus on a multiscale approach, involving autecological and synecological levels. The conditions of species-rich and amenity grasslands conservation, at both the phytocenose and the vegetation landscape levels, are then emphasized.

AB  - Estimates of the contribution of anthropogenic and natural greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from the territory of Russia to global climate change under different scenarios of anthropogenic emissions in the 21st century are obtained. It is shown that the consideration of the changes in climate conditions can strongly affect the indicators of impacts of different greenhouse gas emissions on the climate system, especially over long time horizons. In making decisions, it is necessary to take into account that, with respect to the planning horizon, the role of natural flows of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the terrestrial ecosystems can change. Currently, in the Russian regions, CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems decelerate global warming, and their CH4 release into the atmosphere accelerate it. In this case, the general effect of natural fluxes of these greenhouse gases from the Russian regions under modern conditions foster deceleration of warming. The role of this effect decelerating warming will grow in the first half of the 21st century, and after reaching the maximum, which depends on the scenario of anthropogenic emissions, it will decrease by the end of the century under all scenarios of anthropogenic impacts considered due to the growth of natural emissions of CH4 and a decrease in the absorption of CO2 by the terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study the relationships between environmental factors and vegetation in order to find the most effective factors in the separation of the vegetation types in Poshtkou rangelands of Yazd province. Sampling of soil and vegetation were performed with randomized-systematic method. Vegetation data including density and cover percentage were estimated quantitatively within each quadrat, and using the two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and vegetation was classified into different groups. The topographic conditions were recorded in quadrat locations. Soil samples were taken in 0-30 and 30-60 cm depths in each quadrat. The measured soil variables included texture, lime, saturation moisture, gypsum, acidity (pH), electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, Mg(2+), Cl(-), CO(2)(-) SO(2)(-)). and soluble ions (Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+), Cl(-), CO(3)(2-), HCO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-)). Multivariate techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to analyse the collected data. The results showed that the vegetation distribution pattern was mainly related to soil characteristics such as salinity, texture, soluble potassium, gypsum, and lime. Totally, considering the habitat conditions, ecological needs and tolerance range each plant species has a significant relation with soil properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The analysis of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) provides useful information about local environmental conditions. The study of a core from Lake Banyoles (Girona, NE Iberia) enabled the reconstruction of ecological changes and assessment of human impact in a lakeshore environment during the Mid-Holocene. This work aims to fill the gap in knowledge about the ecological significance of NPP in lowland areas in NE Iberia, and provides descriptions and illustrations of new types documented.
   Deforestation induced by Early Neolithic communities caused the proliferation of lignicolous fungi in decaying wood and an increase in soil erosion. The input of allochthonous mud led to higher turbidity in the lake water, causing a succession in aquatic organisms, from cyanobacteria to green algae. In that context, a group of erosion-associated fungal spore types were recorded. Indicators of soil disturbance and coprophilous fungi were recorded from 5000 to 4200 cal BP, linked with local habitation during the Late Neolithic-Chalcolithic. The NPP analysis reflects the significant human impact that caused changing local environmental conditions, consistent with the signals based on pollen analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ability of bacteria to adapt to external osmotic changes is fundamental for their survival. Halotolerant microorganisms, such as Tistlia consotensis, have to cope with continuous fluctuations in the salinity of their natural environments which require effective adaptation strategies against salt stress. Changes of extracellular protein profiles from Tistlia consotensis in conditions of low and high salinities were monitored by proteogenomics using a bacterial draft genome. At low salinity, we detected greater amounts of the HpnM protein which is involved in the biosynthesis of hopanoids. This may represent a novel, and previously unreported, strategy by halotolerant microorganisms to prevent the entry of water into the cell under conditions of low salinity. At high salinity, proteins associated with osmosensing, exclusion of Na+ and transport of compatible solutes, such as glycine betaine or proline are abundant. We also found that, probably in response to the high salt concentration, T. consotensis activated the synthesis of flagella and triggered a chemotactic response neither of which were observed at the salt concentration which is optimal for growth. Our study demonstrates that the exoproteome is an appropriate indicator of adaptive response of T. consotensis to changes in salinity because it allowed the identification of key proteins within its osmoadaptive mechanism that had not previously been detected in its cell proteome.

AB  - Eelgrass (Zostera marina) forms a critical nearshore marine habitat in temperate coastal ecosystems. For three small estuaries in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, changes in eelgrass area coverage and shape index (over the period of 1932-2016) were assessed using historical aerial photographs and unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery. In addition, changes in eelgrass area and shape index were evaluated in relation to landscape-level coastal environmental indicators, namely shoreline activities and alterations and residential housing density. All three eelgrass meadows showed a deteriorating trend in eelgrass condition; on average, eelgrass area coverage decreased by 45.1%, while meadow complexity as indicated by the shape index increased by 66.3%. Shoreline activities (boats, docks, log booms, and armoring) and residential housing density increased markedly at all sites over the study period and were strongly correlated to eelgrass area coverage and shape index. Changes in these landscape-level indicators over this period corroborate the observed decline in eelgrass habitat condition, because they suggest an overall deterioration of coastal environmental health in the Salish Sea due to increased use of the coastal zone, as well as declines in water quality due to urbanization.

AB  - Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can influence contaminant exposure to benthic macroinvertebrates. In streams, hyporheic flows are subject to varying redox conditions, which influence biogeochemical cycling and metal speciation. Despite these relationships, little is known about how these interactions influence the ecological risk of contaminants. The present study investigated the effects of hyporheic flows and zinc (Zn)-contaminated sediments on the amphipod Hyalella azteca. Hyporheic flows were manipulated in laboratory streams during 10-d experiments. Zinc toxicity was evaluated in freshly spiked and aged sediments. Hyporheic flows altered sediment and porewater geochemistry, oxidizing the sediments and causing changes to redox-sensitive endpoints. Amphipod survival was lowest in the Zn sediment exposures with hyporheic flows. In freshly spiked sediments, porewater Zn drove mortality, whereas in aged sediments simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in excess of acid volatile sulfides (AVS) normalized by the fraction of organic carbon (fOC) [(SEM-AVS)/fOC] influenced amphipod responses. The results highlight the important role of hyporheic flows in determining Zn bioavailability to benthic organisms, information that can be important in ecological risk assessments.

AB  - States and other jurisdictions may protect coral reefs using biological water quality standards outlined by the United States Clean Water Act (CWA). Such protection will require long-term, regional monitoring of the resource using biological indicators and a probability-based sampling design. A 60-station survey targeting nearshore linear coral reef was conducted across southern Puerto Rico in December 2011 to document the status of reef inhabitants using a probabilistic, regional sampling design. The quantity, type and condition of stony corals, fish, gorgonians, and sponges were documented from each station, providing a robust representation of linear reef status and composition across the region. Fish represented 106 unique taxa and stony corals 32 unique taxa. Benthic organisms (stony corals, sponges, and gorgonians) averaged nearly 12 colonies per square meter, more than half of which were gorgonians. Assessment results can be used as a baseline to compare with future regional surveys to quantify change in reef condition over time (trend). Both temporal and spatial changes can be expected after large-scale disturbances like hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017. The indicators and probabilistic sampling design support the long-term regional monitoring envisioned by the Environmental Protection Agency to implement CWA protections in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.

AB  - For several years there has been an increased emphasis on the need for a systematic measurement system as the key means for organizations to assess their present condition and to plan appropriate actions for desirable improvements. The results in most cases have been of limited value to stakeholders, while in some cases the reported measurements of performance have been quite frustrating or misleading. If medical science practice is a useful metaphor for management practice, then there is a critical gap to bridge in our attempts to diagnose, with accuracy, the health and future prospects of our organizations. Managerial measurement systems, as diagnostic tools for current performance and required improvements, need careful examination so that we may use them to learn how to adapt organizations to new conditions in a continually changing environment. This need becomes urgent as more organizations use various assessment frameworks for business excellence. The purpose of this paper is to focus on certain central issues that management must consider in the design and operation of a reliable measurement system, to facilitate and expand the learning required. The two key assumptions that make such learning imperative involve the nature of organizations as living systems and the increasing rate Of significant environmental change that requires more frequent adaptation of measurement systems.

AB  - The Inuit of late 18th-century Labrador Lived in large communal houses, participated in long-distance trade networks, and maintained relatively elaborate economic and political organizations. For 25 yr archaeologists and ethnohistorians have debated the significance of these characteristics. Some propose that these practices are indicators of stress resulting from deteriorated environmental conditions, others see them as signs of economic success due, in part, to exploitation of Europeans visiting the coast. This paper examines the convergence of environment, history, and culture in late 18th-century Labrador The authors argue that the Inuit experienced generally stable and moderate climatic conditions at this time. They were able to live with a degree of security, even accumulate surpluses, as a result of their flexible social and economic structure and the natural resources available to them. During this same period, Europeans visited Labrador in growing numbers and Moravian missionaries established mission stations amongst the Inuit. The Europeans' presence presented the Inuit with economic opportunities, while also posing significant spiritual and social threats. The Inuit responded by amplifying and elaborating some of their cultural practices in order to secure economic advantages, but also as a form of social resistance. Paleoenvironmental, ethnohistorical, and archaeological data indicate that late 18th-century Labrador Inuit enjoyed economic success while experiencing profound social distress.

AB  - The potential effects of climate change on the distribution of benthic species commonly used in marine ecological quality assessment were investigated using a spatial modelling approach. In this work, the relevance of the ecological groups that macrofaunal molluscs are assigned according to their sensitivity or tolerance to environmental disturbance was examined under the scope of the RCP 8.5 severe emissions scenario. The effects of climate change were more profound on species that are indicative of a specific suite of climatic conditions regarding temperature and salinity. Significant loss of habitat suitability was observed for the tolerant species Corbula gibba and Abra prismatica whereas the sensitive species Moerella donacina was least affected. In contrast, an overall expansion of the distributional potential was observed for the sensitive species Flexopecten hyaline's as newly suitable habitats are formed. As hypothesised, the current ecological grouping that depicts the sensitivity of a benthic spades to an environmental stressor is irrelevant when assessing the effects of climate change. We propose a new standpoint of using benthic species as biotic tools based on their ecological niche requirements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - I dentifying the environmental hazards of jack-up drilling rig, which is used as an exploratory drilling and offshore service platform, yet has been under intense discussion. Risk assessment along with determining the likelihood of an event occurrence and the severity of its consequences can be a useful tool for identifying the priorities and making satisfactory managerial decisions. In this study, the environmental risks attributed to jack-ups in the offshore area of Iran around the South Pars gas field were studied, and finally a new mathematical model for the environmental risk assessment in this area was presented. Due to qualitative nature of some indefinite factors, fuzzy logic was applied in this model. Moreover, the model design was tailored to the ecological and environmental conditions of South Pars gas field, and several sources of risk were aggregated for the final environmental risk assessment of jack-up drilling rig. The results indicated that the total risk calculated for jack-up in transportation was tolerable and limited management measures were required. However, for the jack-up operation risks, the site was found to be faced with "unacceptable risk" or requiring extensive management measures.

AB  - Tipping points exist in social, ecological and climate systems and those systems are increasingly causally intertwined in the Anthropocene. Climate change and biosphere degradation have advanced to the point where we are already triggering damaging environmental tipping points, and to avoid worse ones ahead will require finding and triggering positive tipping points towards sustainability in coupled social, ecological and technological systems. To help with that I outline how tipping points can occur in continuous dynamical systems and in networks, the causal interactions that can occur between tipping events across different types and scales of system-including the conditions required to trigger tipping cascades, the potential for early warning signals of tipping points, and how they could inform deliberate tipping of positive change. In particular, the same methods that can provide early warning of damaging environmental tipping points can be used to detect when a socio-technical or socio-ecological system is most sensitive to being deliberately tipped in a desirable direction. I provide some example targets for such deliberate tipping of positive change. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - Sediment quality monitoring is widely used to quantify extent of river pollution, but requires knowledge of pre-disturbance conditions in the potentially altered landscape. This has long been identified as a critical aspect to develop for addressing concerns of river pollution in the Alberta Oil Sands Region. Here, we use analyses of sediment cores from eight floodplain lakes spanning a 67 river-km transect across the Athabasca Delta to define pre-1920 (pre-industrial) baseline concentrations for vanadium and five primary pollutants. We then evaluate if sediment metals concentrations have become enriched above baseline since onset of oil sands development and other industrial activities. Results demonstrate no enrichment of metals concentrations (except zinc at one lake) and absence of consistent temporal increases above pre-industrial baselines. Thus, natural processes continue to dominate metal deposition in floodplain lakes of the Athabasca Delta -- an important finding to inform stewardship decisions. The pre-1920 metals concentrations baselines offer a useful tool for ongoing sediment monitoring in aquatic ecosystems of the Athabasca Delta. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel whole cell-based biosensor was constructed using Daucus carota cell as a biological component, with in vivo beta-carotene as a reporter group. In this biosensor, the cells were immobilized using agarose gel, and change in in vivo beta-carotene, before and after exposure of cells to heavy metals was noted using spectrophotometer at lambda = 450 nm. Biosensor was found to operate at its optimum condition using cells from day-14 culture with density of 8 x 10(5) cells/cuvette, and immobilized with 0.5 % agarose at 45 degrees C. The performance of biosensor was affected by pH with the best response produced at pH 7.5. Pb and Cu tests showed that biosensor was able to detect the presence of both heavy metals within the range of 0.01 ppm- 10.00 ppm. The performance of biosensor decreased in stability test with prolonged storage of 40 days, with a stable performance obtained after 10 days of storage. The results showed that beta-carotene contain in naturally available cell D. carota responded well to the presence of heavy metals. It is a good indication that biosensor designed is a good candidate to be used for environmental toxicity assessment.

AB  - The contamination of the environment with anticancer drugs, which show recalcitrance to conventional wastewater treatment, has become a significant ecological threat. Fungi represent a promising non-conventional biological alternative for water conditioning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of five white-rot fungi (Fomes fomentarius (CB13), Hypholoma fasciculare (CB15), Phyllotopsis nidulans (CB14), Pleurotus ostreatus (BWPH) and Trametes versicolor (CB8)) in the removal of bleomycin and vincristine. The removal capacity was measured at 0, 4, 9, and 14 days of incubation using SPE-UPLC-MS. The enzymatic profiles of laccase, manganese, and lignin peroxidases and wide range of ecoand cytotoxicity, assays of the post-process samples were also conducted. We observed >94% vincristine elimination by F. fomentarius, H. fasciculare and T. versicolor after only 4 days. Bleomycin removal occurred after a minimum of 9 days and only when the drug was incubated with T. versicolor (36%) and H. fasciculare (25%). The removal of both cytostatics was associated with laccase production, and the loss of ecoand cytotoxicity, especially in regard to viability of Lemna minor and Daphnia magna, as well as fibroblasts morphology.

AB  - Bryophytes are promising indicators for detecting the impact of rapid global change. However, despite their great potential, they are still largely neglected, and their patterns across wide areas and environmental gradients are still poorly explored. Here we tested the capacity of bryophyte life-forms to respond to the main environmental and anthropogenic factors using an herbarium collection of high quality. The database consists of over 40,000 records referred to an Alpine area (Bolzano province, Northern Italy). The main aim of the work was to assess the relationship between bryophyte life-forms and different Corine Land Cover types which spans a wide elevational gradient and land uses. Results showed a broad match between similar land cover types and life-forms composition. For example, there was a positive relationship between plagiotropic forms and coniferous forests and between cushion-turf forms and natural grasslands. Anthropogenic habitats like vineyards and urban areas showed a high proportion of dendroid and thallose forms whereas plagiotropic species were under-represented. Our results indicate that patterns of bryophyte life-forms are predictable across land cover types and altitude thus providing a direct link between the organism and the environmental conditions.

AB  - For decades, the river health of the Yellow River source region (YRSR) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has been a focal issue owing to its unique geographic location and ecological functions. This study investigated the ecological status of the headwater streams, the main stem, and the tributaries of the Yellow River in the YRSR using the tolerance values of macroinvertebrates and those related to biotic indices. The macroinvertebrate assemblages of the headwater streams were characterized by lower biodiversity than the tributaries downstream, based on comparisons of taxonomical composition, functional feeding group composition, and the pollution-tolerant capacity of taxa. The headwater streams had a lower ratio (16%) of pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa than that of the tributaries downstream (30%). The biotic indices (family- and genus-level biotic indices) indicated that the ecological health of the headwater streams was comparably poorer than that of the downstream tributaries. The combined effect of vulnerable natural conditions and increasing human disturbance is likely the main cause of eco-environmental degradation in the Yellow River headwater streams.

AB  - The performance of three species of predatory ladybirds was compared in a flight mill and the effect of diet on their flight parameters was tested. The invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) outperformed Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in terms of flight distance, duration and velocity. Harmonia axyridis flew at least two times further, needed three times less breaks and flew two times faster than C. montrouzieri and A. bipunctata fed the same diet. Ladybirds reared on eggs of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) performed better than their counterparts reared on natural prey (aphids for H. axyridis and A. bipunctata, mealybugs for C. montrouzieri). The findings of this study indicate that comparative flight studies can be useful to identify candidate biocontrol agents with pronounced dispersal abilities and thus can yield significant evidence to be used in an environmental risk assessment. However, it also demonstrates that variability related to mass rearing conditions should not be ignored when standardizing a risk assessment procedure for candidate biocontrol agents.

AB  - An improved Costanza model was developed to assess the health of the Jinhe River Watershed ecosystem. The watershed is located at the center of the Huangtu Plateau in China and has suffered a severe disturbance in the last few decades. Three indicators including vigor, organization, and resilience were calculated respectively by merging ground-based observations with remotely sensed data on a watershed scale. Health indices of 12 topographic sub-watersheds were calculated using a modified Costanza formula. Health evaluated results indicated that sub-watersheds in the Huangtu mountain region were relatively healthy ecosystems with scores over 0.673. The sub-watersheds in the loess mountain and the loess gully regions, e.g., Jinghe, Heihe, and Honghe regions, scored moderately; their evaluated value ranged from 0.505 to 0.606. The two sub-watersheds in the loess gully region and all sub-watersheds in the loess hilly region scored the lowest, less than 0.50 and were considered unhealthy ecosystems. It can be argued that the loess hilly region and the loess gully regions should be in primary consideration for ecological protection and rehabilitation. This study provided a possible quantitative model for ecological planning and landscape management with respect to topographic conditions in this area.

AB  - Small rivers support high levels of biodiversity, being especially sensitive to the effects of global change. Temporal records of community composition in minimally impaired streams can be used to explore trends in biodiversity in response to climate change and natural temporal variation. We approached the comparison of two time periods (2003-2008 and 2016-2020) to study whether the composition of diatom assemblages changed over time in twenty-three streams of the mountain range of Picos de Europa (Northern Spain). The stream's water chemistry indicated significant decreases in N_NO3- and P_PO43- content over time. In these minimally disturbed streams, the specific diatom community was dominated by Achnanthidium pyrenaicum, Achnanthidium minutissimum and Cocconeis euglypta. PERMANOVA analyses did not identify significant changes in diatom assemblage composition between periods or river types. Diatom indices (e.g. IPS, NORTIdiat) indicated high or good ecological status and relatively high alpha diversity values were found in these mountain rivers during the studied years. Although diversity and evenness showed a significant decrease over time, the temporal stability of the river-type diatom reference community between the two periods should be considered as an indicator of biodiversity persistence of high importance when monitoring the ecological status following the reference condition approach.

AB  - Mangrove forest is a susceptive ecosystem which needs continuous monitoring to detect various threats such as human activities and natural disasters. Remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) are very effective tools to be used in monitoring mangrove ecosystem due to they can reach large areas and periodically. Application of remote sensing technology to monitor mangrove ecosystem in Sebatik Island had never been conducted before. This research is important to be carried out to reveal changes in condition of mangrove forest in Sebatik Island. Aims of this research were analyzing the correlation between Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and its canopy cover percentages, calculated the accuracy of land cover classification with different spatial resolution, and measuring the changes of mangrove covers from 2005 to 2016. Land cover classification in this research used supervised classification with Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The NDVI was used as mangrove density indicator and vegetation condition. Field data measurement was taken to count canopy cover. The accuracy of Landsat images classification was about 83% and the SPOT 6 images around of 90%. Mangrove forest in Sebatik Island had increased from 2005 to 2016 as high as 31.27%. The correlation between NDVI and canopy percent cover were categorized as high with their coeficient correlation r=0.82 (Landsat 8) and 0.85 (SPOT 6).

AB  - In spite of its pivotal role in future implementations of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management, current knowledge about tuna habitat preferences remains fragmented and heterogeneous, because it relies mainly on regional or local studies that have used a variety of approaches making them difficult to combine. Therefore in this study we analyse data from six tuna species in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans in order to provide a global, comparative perspective of habitat preferences. These data are longline catch per unit effort from 1958 to 2007 for albacore, Atlantic bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas. Both quotient analysis and Generalised Additive Models were used to determine habitat preference with respect to eight biotic and abiotic variables. Results confirmed that, compared to temperate tunas, tropical tunas prefer warm, anoxic, stratified waters. Atlantic and southern bluefin tuna prefer higher concentrations of chlorophyll than the rest. The two species also tolerate most extreme sea surface height anomalies and highest mixed layer depths. In general, Atlantic bluefin tuna tolerates the widest range of environmental conditions. An assessment of the most important variables determining fish habitat is also provided.

AB  - Parks and protected areas are integral strategies for biological diversity conservation, and their management often involves balancing visitor use with resource protection. Effectively balancing these objectives requires data about how use is distributed within areas of interest and how management strategies and environmental conditions interact to minimize negative impacts. This study examined which environmental and managerial factors most influenced the distribution of domestic pack stock animals, a common visitor use-related activity, when released to graze in high elevation meadows. Using a species distribution modelling approach, MaxEnt, managerial factors were found to be among the top contributors to models. Pack stock animals concentrated use near the locations where they were released as well as portable enclosure fencing confining the lead animal even though the remainder were allowed to roam freely. Elevation was the environmental factor contributing most, with animals remaining at similar elevations to the meadow even if moving into nearby understory. Results highlight the importance of release point and fence locations to overall pack stock animal distribution and rotational or strategic placement can be a tactic for mitigating impacts to sensitive habitats.

AB  - Molluscan diversity associated with sublittoral soft-bottoms was studied in Heraklion Bay as part of a longterm multidisciplinary research programme in the coastal environment of northern Crete (eastern Mediterranean). Quantitative benthic samples were collected in a pilot survey from a grid of 28 stations, followed by a seasonal sampling carried out over a seven-station transect located from 10 to 40 m depth. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated the presence of a clear zonation along the depth gradient for the molluscan fauna and three main associations were identified in bathymetric zones parallel to the coastline. The structure of the local molluscan communities revealed the existence of an extended transition zone (ecotone) between a shallow sandy association and a deeper muddy one and a functional pattern, based on the feeding guilds, was evident alon the environmental gradient. Application of graphical techniques, by using molluscan taxocoenosis, indicated a rather naturally disturbed habitat. Beta-diversity measures indicated different seasonal community adaptations to the prevailing environmental conditions. Results derived from this study revealed that beta-diversity may be a good descriptor for the assessment of the strength and breadth of sublittoral transition zones along environmental gradients.

AB  - History of variability of tropical cyclones (TC) in the North-Western Pacific is critical for understanding impacts of future climatic changes. Natural archives of paleo-typhoon variability can be used to assess how changes in the planetary climatic system during the Holocene could influence TC frequency and intensity in this part of Pacific. Extreme typhoon-related rains are the main cause of catastrophic floods on Sakhalin Island and deposits of these floods are evidence of paleo-typhoon. The paleo-typhoons that triggered extreme floods on Southern Sakhalin during the last 6.6 kyr are recorded in the sequence on the interfluvial surface in the northern Susunay Lowland (Naiba River basin). The sequence includes peat bog with numerous loam interlayers deposited during extreme floods inundating the bog. We reconstructed paleo-environmental conditions, including humidity and flood activity, based on analysis of diatoms. We found biological indicators that point to the past floods. The mineral content in the peat being one criteria indicative of the high frequency of floods. The peat bog developed in place of a lagoon that existed at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression. Peat accumulation began in the freshened lagoon coast similar to 6010 cal yr B.P. When sea level dropped, the lagoon turned into a coastal lake (similar to 5710-5040 cal yr B.P.). A swamp formed in place of the lake under varying moisture conditions. We identified and dated 25 extreme floods and assessed the paleoclimatic background of the events. A recent catastrophic flood from typhoon Phyllis (1981 CE) is considered as an analogue of the paleo-events. The frequency of extreme typhoons increased both during warm (wet and dry) phases and in cold dry phases of the climate fluctuations. We identified three periods of a high typhoon activity (4640-4360; 4030-3580; 1860-1380 cal yr B.P.), when super-typhoons came onto the island once every 30-90 years. A comparison between the extreme typhoons in the south of Sakhalin and in the Sea of Japan region show both synchronism and metachronism of the periods of typhoon activity. Instrumental measurements during 20th-21st centuries revealed considerable changes in super-typhoon tracks; a similar variability may be safely supposed in typhoon tracks in the past. To predict future tropical cyclone activity and the risk of floods under modern climatic instability it is necessary to understand factors influencing variability in the occurrence of strong typhoons and associated extreme floods events on a paleo-scale. This is especially important for areas with rapidly developing coastal economies and intensive use of gas and oil resources, such as Sakhalin Island.

AB  - Armillarioids, including the genera Armillaria, Desarmillaria and Guyanagaster, represent white-rot specific fungal saprotrophs with soilborne pathogenic potentials on woody hosts. They propagate in the soil by root-like rhizomorphs, connecting between susceptible root sections of their hosts, and often forming extended colonies in native forests. Pathogenic abilities of Armillaria and Desarmillaria genets can readily manifest in compromised hosts, or hosts with full vigour can be invaded by virulent mycelia when exposed to a larger number of newly formed genets. Armillaria root rot-related symptoms are indicators of ecological imbalances in native forests and plantations at the rhizosphere levels, often related to abiotic environmental threats, and most likely unfavourable changes in the microbiome compositions in the interactive zone of the roots. The less-studied biotic impacts that contribute to armillarioid host infection include fungi and insects, as well as forest conditions. On the other hand, negative biotic impactors, like bacterial communities, antagonistic fungi, nematodes and plant-derived substances may find applications in the environment-friendly, biological control of armillarioid root diseases, which can be used instead of, or in combination with the classical, but frequently problematic silvicultural and chemical control measures.

AB  - The population dynamics of marine fish stocks are influenced by both physical and biological conditions. Yet, such environmental impacts on stock dynamics, and hence stock production, are rarely included in applied fisheries management. To test the utility of taking ecosystem information into account in management decisions requires efficient tools. We propose a simulation framework for evaluating fisheries management schemes that use environmental information as part of the decision basis. A key feature is to link environmental signals to parameters in functions that define the population dynamics. This allows a direct incorporation of environmental drivers into models of population dynamic processes and emphasizes the need for a quantitative understanding of the influence of environmental drivers on such processes. The utility of the simulation framework is demonstrated through a worked example with different management scenarios, where decisions to increase or decrease the exploitation rely on environmental indicators only, or also on information on stock abundance. In this example, a management that was based on indicators only, without updated measures of the state of the stock itself, failed to respond adequately to changes in stock productivity.

AB  - As recently recognized exposure and effect assessment of soil contaminants on soil biota is necessary for decision-making related to ecosystem services and habitat protection, establishment of remediation procedures, or pollution monitoring programs. Therefore, biological approaches to soil monitoring, such as the measurement of biomarkers in soil bioindicator organisms, have recently received increasing attention. The aim of the present work was to assess the performance of a suite of cellular and biochemical biomarkers in native earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) sampled in heavy metal contaminated sites in view of the validation of this biomarker approach in soil monitoring and assessment. Besides well known and standardized biomarkers such as lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein tissue concentration and acetylcholinesterase activity, novel potential biomarkers such as changes in blood hemoglobin concentration and granulocyte morphometric alterations were analyzed. Both univariate and multivariate (PCA) statistical analysis applied to the data set revealed that the integrated multi-marker approach in native L. terrestris under field conditions produces a sensitive and cost-effective assessment of heavy metal soil pollution, which could be incorporated as a descriptor of environmental status in future soil biomonitoring programmes.

AB  - A study on the benthic ecosystem health was performed to assess the environmental quality of Montevideo coastal zone, in view of the construction of a new sanitation system. Data were compared to previous research undertaken 10 years ago, and biochemical composition of organic matter, heavy metals, organic matter, phytopigments, benthic diatoms, macrofauna community structure and a biotic index (AMBI) were used as proxies. Results indicate an environmental quality-gradient, with the worst conditions within the inner stations of Montevideo Bay and an improvement towards the adjacent coastal zone. Higher levels of chromium, lead, phaeopigments, organic biopolymers and poor benthic macrofauna and diatom communities, characterised the hypertrophic innermost portion of Montevideo Bay. Data indicated a clear deterioration of the adjacent coastal zone comparatively to that observed 10 years ago. The complementary use of approaches not applied before (benthic diatoms and organic biopolymers) with those formerly applied improve our assessment of the trophic status and the environmental health of the area.

AB  - We synthesise the results of the papers in this Special Issue, place them within the context of current trends in floodplain research, and outline promising new avenues that emerge from the contributions. The indication system presented complements existing approaches by focussing on a quantitative indication of environmental parameters. A promising research line that emerges is an extension of the systematic comparison of taxonomic groups with contrasting traits in terms of their performance as quantitative indicators for different environmental parameters. The studies show similarities and dissimilarities in the traits explaining the functional response of plants, molluscs, carabids, and syrphids to site conditions but trait databases and studies on additional taxa are required before broad generalisations can be made. The rigorous study design developed for the RIVA project, of which all contributions in this Special Issue are a part, not only was essential for an improvement of the understanding of species environment relationships and the role biological traits play for it, it also provides a baseline for assessing future change as part of long-term ecological monitoring of floodplains.

AB  - Increasingly, management agencies require that the remediation of eutrophic waters be addressed at the level of the whole ecosystem. One whole-system approach to quantify ecosystems is called ecological network analysis. Ascendency theory, the branch of the field that deals with the quantification of whole-system status, specifically addresses the definition of eutrophication. This definition has been applied to data taken over a gradient of eutrophication. Three separate areas were observed: a non-eutrophic area (with Zostera noltii meadows), an intermediate eutrophic area (Z. noltii absent and macroalgae abundant at times) and a strongly eutrophic area (where Enteromotpha spy. blooms occur with regularity). Pulse eutrophication was considered as the major driving force behind a gradual shift in primary producers from a community dominated by rooted macrophytes (Z. noltii) to a community dominated by green macroalgae. The measures associated with the intermediate eutrophic region turned out not to be intermediate to those at the gradient extremes. The most likely explanation appears to be the highly unstable nature of this area. Conditions along the spatial gradient are discussed as representing various stages in the temporal evolution of the system, and analysed in the framework of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, Bifurcation, Chaos, and Catastrophe theories.

AB  - Precision farming is being approached with hopes of discovering new decisions that could aid in managing and reducing the environmental impact of farming systems with increasing frequency. Analysis of the results obtained from a five-year research period has revealed no significant difference in the amount of produce received, irrespective of the fertilization technology (variable-rate fertilization (VRF) or conventional fertilization (CF)) used on spring wheat crops. However, in VRF, nitrogen fertilizer consumption was approximately 19% lower, and the fertilizer use efficiency was higher. The energy assessment of the fertilization technology indicated that the application of the VRF technology reduced the indirect energy inputs by 12.3%, which compared to CF, resulted in an approximately 9% higher energy efficiency and productivity. Meteorological conditions significantly affected not only the spring wheat yield, but also the nitrogen fertilizer consumption, efficiency, and energy indicators such as energy efficiency and productivity. The environmental assessment of these technologies also showed that nitrogen fertilizer accounted for about half of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, the evaluation of these results obtained over the entire five-year research period indicated that when VRF was used, GHG emissions were 9.4% lower than when CF was used.

AB  - Microbes and seagrass establish symbiotic relationships constituting a functional unit called the holobiont that reacts as a whole to environmental changes. Recent studies have shown that the seagrass microbial associated community varies according to host species, environmental conditions and the host's health status, suggesting that the microbial communities respond rapidly to environmental disturbances and changes. These changes, dynamics of which are still far from being clear, could represent a sensitive monitoring tool and ecological indicator to detect early stages of seagrass stress. In this review, the state of art on seagrass holobiont is discussed in this perspective, with the aim of disentangling the influence of different factors in shaping it. As an example, we expand on the widely studied Halophila stipulacea's associated microbial community, highlighting the changing and the constant components of the associated microbes, in different environmental conditions. These studies represent a pivotal contribution to understanding the holobiont's dynamics and variability pattern, and to the potential development of ecological/ecotoxicological indices. The influences of the host's physiological and environmental status in changing the seagrass holobiont, alongside the bioinformatic tools for data analysis, are key topics that need to be deepened, in order to use the seagrass-microbial interactions as a source of ecological information.

AB  - Daya Bay has been greatly influenced by a variety of human disturbances over the last three decades. Because no extremely useful single biotic index for the assessment of ecological status exists, several biotic indices (the AZTI's marine biotic index (AMBI), the multivariate AZTI's marine biotic index (M-AMBI), and the taxonomic diversity (TD) index) were applied to more accurately evaluate the current benthic ecological status of the bay. The results showed that the inner-bay was the most polluted region due to the presence of excess nutrients and pollution associated with anthropogenic activities, while other stations appeared to be in better ecological condition. Temporally, the lower dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom water might be the main factor leading to worse pollution in autumn. The performance of M-AMBI was better than that of the AMBI and TD indices, and the AMBI and TD indices complemented the M-AMBI in some respects. The results of this study support the use of the AMBI, M-AMBI and TD indices and indicate that these indices may be suitable for assessing the benthic ecological status of semi-enclosed bays under conditions of human disturbance.

AB  - Context: Fiddler crabs are important to the ecology of estuarine systems around the world, however, few studies have incorporated them as bioindicators. Urias estuary represents one of the most urbanized lagoons in the Gulf of California region and received discharges from different sources: shrimp farm, thermoelectric plant, fish processing plants, and untreated domestic and sewage wastes. Objective: Assess the effects on anthropogenic contamination on female fiddler crabs reproduction, survival and genetic stability. Methods: Exposition of wild crabs from a less impacted (reference) site to naturally contaminated sediments on under controlled laboratory conditions. Reproductive parameters, levels of DNA damage and mortality rates were measured, together with chemical analyses of sediments. Results: The most contaminated sediments corresponded to the site where fish processing plants were located and the integrated biomarker response analysis revealed that the most adverse effects were produced by exposure to sediments from this site; these crabs showed higher mortality (67%) and poorer ovarian development than those crabs exposed to sediments from other sites. Conclusions: Female crabs under pollution stress are able to trade-off reproduction for survival, and surviving animals were able to restore genetic stability possibly by activating DNA repair mechanisms. Multiple biomarker approach discriminates different coastal contamination scenarios.

AB  - From the environmental stress factors, salinity is one of the most important causes which affects the security of mankind. Impact of soils with excessive salinity on the productivity of different cultures is sometimes disastrous, which determines the identification and the creation of new genotypes of plants tolerant to osmotic stress conditions. From the viewpoint of stress concept, chlorine (Cl-) is viewed as being biologically aggressive osmolite, based on its small ionic diameter and its strong tendencies to attract water (high hydration capacity). High concentrations of these ions in apoplast lead to imbalances in hydric and ionic relationships. For these reasons, stress caused by salinity is also a dehydration stress and ionic stress. In present study, it was pursued the influence of saline solutions of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl on Cl- concentration and productivity, to 7 local populations of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) collected from areas with saline soils, in North-East of Romania and grown under greenhouse conditions, at the pots, analyzing the largest / lowest amount of chlorine in the leaves and the correlations between the chlorine content and the average number of pods / plants, the average number of grains / pods, the average weight of the grains / pods and the average yield / plant, indicators that define productivity.

AB  - Diatom assemblages from 33 core-tops, collected along a 2500 km transect of the northern Antarctic Peninsula and Pine Island Bay areas, were examined for their use as paleoenvironmental proxies. Environmental affinities of assemblages were interpreted within a broad geographical context and a wide range of ecological conditions. Four major assemblages were identified: three pelagic assemblages related to different sea-ice duration, SST, and other conditions affecting primary production, and one benthic and epiphytic-dominated assemblage typical of near-shore, shallow-water habitats. Chaetoceros resting spores are an important component of diatom assemblages. Their high concentrations may reflect increased primary production and are associated with low total assemblage diversities. The lowest diversities are observed at sites with increased resting spore percentages. Along the NW coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, sedimentation rates strongly influence total diatom concentrations. By contrast, relative abundances of Chaetoceros resting spores remain mostly unaffected by terrigenous flux and may serve as a reliable proxy for primary production. This broad sampling of Antarctic coastal environments fills a gap in our knowledge of phytoplankton communities in polar regions and helps establish the framework for reconstructing paleoenvironments from the paleorecord.

AB  - In some gonochoristic species, sex is influenced not only by genotype at conception but also by the environment that offspring experience during early ontogeny (termed environmental sex determination or ESD). ESD is thought to be adaptive when seasonal variations in environmental conditions provide a sex-specific fitness advantage. In vertebrates, temperature is the most common determinant of sex, and seasonal variation in temperature serves as a temporal cue of environmental quality such as length of the growing season. Some environments, however, lack strong seasonal temperature fluctuations and other cues, particularly photoperiod, may provide a more reliable indicator of the environment offspring enter. We tested this hypothesis by rearing the offspring of the California grunion (Leuresthes tenuis, Ayres), which experiences low seasonal temperature variation in nature, under common garden conditions at three temperature and two photoperiod treatments. Our experiments revealed that both temperature and photoperiod significantly affected sex ratios in L tenuis. More females were produced at cooler temperatures and longer day lengths, which is consistent with female-biased sex ratios early in the breeding season, and likely adaptive through increased female size and fecundity. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of photoperiod-dependent sex determination in a gonochoristic vertebrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth in the number of vehicles circulating has led to a proportional increase in polluting gas emissions. Bioenergy can be used to help meet these increasing energy demands and mitigate environmental impacts. This work verified the effect of the content of ethanol on the exergy and exergoenvironmental analyses of a spark-ignition engine. Different gasoline-ethanol mixtures were tested along with hydrous ethanol (4.6% water by volume). The thermodynamic data refer to wide-open throttle conditions and variable engine speeds. The life cycle assessment methodology quantified the environmental impacts associated with equipment and fuel using the Eco-indicator 99 method. Pollutants emitted during combustion were measured and included in the environmental assessment (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and dioxide). Hydrous ethanol at 1500 rpm presented the highest energy efficiency. The effects of the environmental impact rate of pollutant formation and exergy efficiency were significantly higher than the environmental impact rate of fuel. The lowest specific environmental impact of the product (brake power) was 24.39 mPt/MJ, obtained with the fuel blend with 50% ethanol at 2500 rpm. The combined evaluation of the exergoenvironmental factor and the relative difference in environmental impact indicated the optimization priorities and where improvements should be directed.

AB  - Lipid biomarkers in sediments, which are indicative of biological production, provide important information regarding the environmental conditions in and around lakes, and can be used as proxies to infer past environmental changes. In this study, lipid biomarkers in sediments from Lake Wanghu, along the middle reach of the Yangtze River in China, were used to track environmental variations over the past similar to 100years. Multiple variables, e.g., terrigenous/aquatic ratios of n-alkanes (TAR), in the lake sediments displayed three distinct periods, associated with changes in hydrologic conditions and human impacts. Prior to the 1950s, Lake Wanghu displayed a lower trophic state, with frequent water exchanges between the Yangtze River and Lake Wanghu during flooding events. During the 1950s-1980s, the lake trophic state increased slightly with the decreasing influence of the Yangtze River flow because of the Fuchi Floodgate, which caused a decline in terrigenous detritus inputs. However there was still relatively low algal abundance. Since the 1980s, especially the 2000s, sediments were characterized by a significant increase in the trophic state and considerable algal productivity. Generally, these changes were mainly a result of flooding impacts, human activities around the lake and fishery production, which showed good agreement with historical, written records.

AB  - Coliphages can indicate contamination of recreational waters and previous studies show that sunlight is important in altering densities of coliphages, other indicator microorganisms, and pathogens in aquatic environments. Here, we report on laboratory studies of light-induced inactivation of two coliphage groups-male-specific (F+) and somatic coliphage-under various conditions in phosphate-buffered water (PBW). Strains isolated from wastewater treatment facilities and laboratory strains (MS2 and phiX174 coliphages) were evaluated. Inactivation rates were determined in a series of irradiations using simulated solar radiation passed through light filters that blocked different parts of the ultraviolet spectral region. Inactivation rates and spectral irradiance from these experiments were then analyzed to develop biological weighting functions (BWFs) for the light-induced inactivation. BWFs were used to model the inactivation of coliphages over a range of conditions in aquatic environments that included two beach sites in Lake Michigan and one in Lake Erie. For example, modeled effects of sunlight attenuation, using UV absorption data from the three Great Lakes beach sites, inferred that direct photoinactivation rate constants, averaged over a one-meter water column in swimmable areas, were reduced 2- to 5-fold, compared to near surface rate constants.

AB  - Healthy seagrasses are considered a prime indicator of estuarine and coastal ecosystem function; however, as the only group of flowering plants recolonizing the sea, seagrasses are frequently exposed to anthropogenic heavy metal pollutants, which are associated with high levels of molecular damage. To determine whether biologically relevant concentrations of heavy metals cause systematic alterations in RNA expression patterns, we performed a gene expression study using transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq). We exposed the typical intertidal seagrass Zostera japonica to 0 and 50 mu M of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) under laboratory conditions. A total of 18,266 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 2001 co-expressed genes directly related by Cu, Pb, and Cd stress. We also examined the effects of short-term heavy metal Cu, Pb, and Cd pulses on the accumulation of metals in Z. japonica and showed metal concentrations were higher in the shoots than in roots. Twelve differentially expressed genes were further analyzed for expression differences using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Our data suggest that as coastal seawater pollution worsens, the sensitive genes identified in this study may be useful biomarkers of sublethal effects and provide fundamental information for Z. japonica resistant gene engineering.

AB  - Increasing oil development around Alaska and other Arctic regions elevates the risk for another oil spill. Dispersants are used to mitigate the impact of an oil spill by accelerating natural degradation processes, but the reduced hydrophobicity of dispersed oil may increase its bioavailability to marine organisms. There is limited research on the effect of dispersed oil on cold water species and ecosystems. Therefore, spiked exposure tests were conducted with bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus) in seawater with non-dispersed oil, Corexit 9500 and oil dispersed with different concentrations of Corexit 9500. After three weeks of exposure, acute and chronic physiological impacts were determined. The majority of physiological responses occurred during the first seven days of exposure, with mussels exhibiting significant cytochrome P450 activity, superoxide dismutase activity and heat shock protein levels. Mussels exposed to non-dispersed oil also experienced immune suppression, reduced transcription and higher levels of mortality. After 21 days, mussels in all treatments exhibited evidence of genetic damage, tissue loss and a continued stress response. Bay mussels are useful as indicators of ecosystem health and recovery, and this study was an important step in understanding how non-dispersed oil, dispersant and dispersed oil affect the physiology of this sentinel species in Arctic/subarctic conditions.

PFCAs show intensively resistance against chemical and biological degradation due to their strong C-F bond. The Sonoelectrochemical mineralization of the synthetic aqueous solution of the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on Ti/PbO2 anode was investigated using the response surface methodology based on a central composite design with three variables: current density, pH, and supporting electrolyte concentration.
   Methods: The defluorination ratio of PFOA was determined as an indicator of PFOA mineralization. Fluoride ion concentration was measured with an ion chromatograph unit. The Ti/PbO2 electrode was prepared using the electrochemical deposition method. The ultrasonic frequency was 20 kHz.
   Results: The optimum conditions for PFOA mineralization in synthetic solution were electrolyte concentration, pH, and current density of 94 mM, 2, and 83.64 mA/cm(2), respectively. The results indicated that the most effective factor for PFOA mineralization was current density. Furthermore, the PFOA defluorination efficiency significantly enhanced with increasing current density. Under optimum conditions, the maximum mineralization of PFOA was 95.48 % after 90 min of sonoelectrolysis.
   Conclusions: Sonoelectrolysis was found to be a more effective technique for mineralization of an environmentally persistent compound.

AB  - Practical methods for biomonitoring of natural systems are still under development. Bacteria are potentially useful indicators of water quality because of their species diversity and ability to rapidly respond to changing environmental conditions. In this study, bacterial populations from unpolluted and polluted stream sites in two watersheds were compared to determine their suitability for use as environmental indicators. Upper Three Runs Creek and Four Mile Creek headwaters have had little anthropogenic disturbance, as opposed to lower Four Mile Creek which received thermal, radioactive, and chemical perturbations. Chemical and physical measurements provided evidence that seepage from holding ponds polluted Four Mile Creek Polluted sites did not have altered total bacterial numbers but had decreased numbers of colony-forming units. Abundances of three bacterial species, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Pseudomonas putida, were determined by colony hybridization with species-specific rDNA probes. Contribution of A. calcoaceticus to the assemblage was higher at polluted sites, which indicated either tolerance of polluted conditions or the ability to utilize compounds existing at these sites to reach larger populations. No differences in B. cepacia populations were detected, and differences in P. putida populations could not be attributed solely to disturbance. The pollution of Four Mile Creek induced differences in bacterial populations that could be monitored using the described approach.

AB  - River systems globally are experiencing social-ecological changes that often impact Indigenous fishing practices, including climate change and resource developments. We explore the relationship between access to fish and well-being, and the determinants of access to fish amidst changing social-ecological conditions through interviews with 29 individuals across four Gwich'in First Nation communities in Canada's Northwest Territories. Our interviews show that socioeconomic and environmental barriers are making it harder to access fish and that this has negative implications for well-being. Despite these barriers, access to fish continues to make positive, diverse contributions to well-being in Gwich'in communities through socioeconomic factors such as sharing networks and adaptive practices that are often part of ecological monitoring and land-based education and facilitate access to fish. Increasing our understanding of the relationship between access to fish and well-being, and determinants of access to fish, can contribute to land-based programs, land-use planning, and decision-making in Gwich'in territory and other river systems.

AB  - Agroecosystems are on both the receiving and contributing ends of increasingly demanding climatic and environmental conditions. Maintaining productive systems under resource scarcity and multiplicative stresses requires precise monitoring and systems-scale planning. By incorporating ecological resilience into agroecosystems research we can gain valuable insight into agroecosystem identity, change, responsivity, and performance under stress, but only if we move away from resilience as a mere touchstone concept. Using the productivity, stability, resistance, and recovery of system processes as a basic framework for resilience monitoring, we propose quantitative research approaches to tackle the continuing lack of biophysical, field-scale indicators needed to lend insight into dynamic resilience variables and mechanisms. We emphasize the importance of considering productive functions, sources of system regulation and disturbance, and cross-scale interactions when applying resilience theory to agroecosystems. Agroecosystem resilience research requires understanding of multiple scales and speeds of influence both above and below the focal scale. When these considerations are addressed, resilience theory can add tangible value to agroecosystems research, both for the purposes of monitoring current systems and of planning future systems that can reconcile productivity and sustainability goals.

AB  - Earthworms Lumbricus rubellus were exposed to a range of increasing soil copper concentrations in a mesocosm experiment for 17, 40, 70, and 110 days, respectively, Neutral-red retention times were measured along with earthworm tissue copper residues and earthworm growth and survival, The neutral-red retention assay demonstrated a clear dose-response threshold preceding a copper exposure value where increased regulatory activity had resulted in the copper bioconcentration factor (BCF) decreasing from 1 to 0.5. Effects on earthworm growth and survival occurred only at soil copper concentrations where the earthworm BCFs were lowered to ca, 0.5, Thus, the position of the neutral-red threshold could potentially make it possible to differentiate between copper exposure and actual toxicity, In terms of field applicability it was demonstrated that natural and seasonal variations in climatic parameters had little or no effect on the neutral-red response, Neutral-red retention assay has a potential role in environmental risk assessment and routine monitoring, as it is likely to provide a sufficiently accurate warning of impending ecological damage at a level below that found to cause actual physiological damage to the earthworms.

AB  - Environmental changes alter the diversity and structure of communities. By shifting the range of species traits that will be successful under new conditions, environmental drivers can also dramatically impact ecosystem functioning and resilience. Above and belowground communities jointly regulate whole-ecosystem processes and responses to change, yet they are frequently studied separately. To determine whether these communities respond similarly to environmental changes, we measured taxonomic and trait-based responses of plant and soil microbial communities to four years of experimental warming and nitrogen deposition in a temperate grassland. Plant diversity responded strongly to N addition, whereas soil microbial communities responded primarily to warming, likely via an associated decrease in soil moisture. These above and belowground changes were associated with selection for more resource-conservative plant and microbe growth strategies, which reduced community functional diversity. Functional characteristics of plant and soil microbial communities were weakly correlated (P = 0.07) under control conditions, but not when above or belowground communities were altered by either global change driver. These results highlight the potential for global change drivers operating simultaneously to have asynchronous impacts on above and belowground components of ecosystems. Assessment of a single ecosystem component may therefore greatly underestimate the whole-system impact of global environmental changes.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are inevitably released into natural systems, particularly into aquatic environments, where they are oxidized and release Ag+, which is reduced back to AgNPs. Environmental freeze-thaw cycles or freezing may accelerate the dynamic transformation between AgNPs and Ag+. Herein, the significant morphological changes caused by freezing treatments were assessed by UV-vis spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, which revealed that reductive regeneration, particle fusion, and coalescence of the AgNPs occurred. In addition, a stable Ag isotope was used to track the AgNP redox reaction, which was round to be accelerated under freezing and freeze-thaw cycles relative to the reaction of particles stored at a normal temperature (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C). Furthermore, natural organic matter was found to stabilize the particle morphology. Ca2+ and Cl- intensified the morphological changes and redox reaction through Ca2+-induced particle coalescence and Cl--enhanced reduction of Ag+ during the freeze-thaw treatment. These physicochemical changes also occurred for an environmentally relevant concentration of AgNPs (50 ng L-1) in simulated environmental conditions and natural water samples after freeze-thaw cycles. Since the morphological changes and redox acceleration induced by environmental freezing conditions could dramatically influence the mobility, bioavailability, toxicity, and environmental fate of AgNPs, the freeze-thaw-induced effects should be considered'in the environmental risk assessment of AgNPs.

AB  - Freshly stacked bauxite residue in Central China has little vegetative growth probably as a result of its poor physical condition and chemical properties which deter plant establishment. Over the last 20 years, spontaneous plant colonization on the deposits has revealed that natural weathering processes may improve bauxite residue to the extent that it can support vegetation. Bauxite residue samples were collected from a chronosequence and analyzed to determine the effect of natural processes over time. The freshly stacked residue showed considerable physical degradation, having a high bulk density, low porosity, and poor aggregate stability. Through natural processes over a 20-year period, the texture changed from a silty loam to a sandy loam, porosity was enhanced (43.88 to 58.24 %), while improvements in both aggregate stability (43.32 to 93.20 %) and structural stability (1.33 to 5.46 %) of the stacked residue were observed. Plant growth had a positive effect on pH, exchangeable sodium percentage, soil organic carbon, water-stable aggregation, and structural stability, probably due to the presence of plant roots and associated microbial activity. It was concluded that natural processes of regeneration, stabilization, and attenuation have improved the hostile physical environment of bauxite residue allowing plant establishment to take place.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - The threat from high intensity hurricanes prompts the design of preventive methodologies for the spatial analysis of natural conditions that inhibit or magnify adverse changes and effects of hurricanes in natural and anthropic landscapes. Knowing hurricane behavior and effects based on records of similar past events allows for establishing possible change scenarios or extreme damage that could possibly occur in the future. For the present study, post-hurricane costal morphology of sandy-accumulative coasts was used as a direct geoindicator of modifying effects of hurricanes and their relation with hurricane intensity. Two stages were followed according to occurrence of the reference typical hurricane: pre-hurricane, in which territorial data of previous morphological and environmental conditions are analyzed; and post-hurricane, identifying geomorphological responses for relatively homogeneous territorial ranges. In both stages analogical and digital cartographic references were used that were produced by processing images obtained through videographic records taken immediately after the hurricane. The destructive potential of hurricanes in coastal environments is inferred from morpho-sedimentary evidence. Two impact zoning patterns were discerned by the inclusion of most relevant morphological features: proximal frontal and proximal associated. The territorial susceptibility for the hurricane Roxanne was expressed in 13 sectors with different intensity responses depending on relative terrain elevation, dynamic predisposition of geoforms, location in the transverse incidence profile, and biogenic fixation.

AB  - In both ecology and conservation, often a strong positive association is assumed between the diversity of plants as primary producers and that of animals, specifically primary consumers. Such a relationship has been observed at small spatial scales, and a begetting of diversity by diversity is expected under various scenarios of co-evolution and co-adaptation. But positive producer-consumer richness relationships may also arise from similar associations with past opportunities for diversification or contemporary environmental conditions, or from emerging properties of plant diversity such as vegetation complexity or productivity. Here we assess whether the producer-consumer richness relationship generalizes from plot to regional scale and provide a first global test of its strength for vascular plants and endothermic vertebrates. We find strong positive richness associations, but only limited congruence of the most diverse regions. The richness of both primary and higher-level consumers increases with plant richness at similar strength and rate. Environmental conditions emerge as much stronger predictors of consumer richness, and after accounting for environmental differences little variation is explained by plant diversity. We conclude that biotic interactions and strong local associations between plants and consumers only relatively weakly scale up to broad geographical scales and to functionally diverse taxa, for which environmental constraints on richness dominate.

AB  - Dangerous goods represent 50-90% of the cargo turnover in Ukrainian ports and, therefore, a serious pollutional threat to the environment. Ecological, chemical-analytical, toxicological and microbiological researches have been carried out between 1995 and 2002 in the ports of Illichevsk, Mariupol, Nikolaev and Odessa. The researches were aimed to investigate the overload of potassium chloride and sulfur in air, soil, water, silt and grounds of adjacent places. Furthermore, an epidemiological study of the consequences of emergency bromine flood from an autotank in the Kherson area was performed in April, 2002. It was shown that even at usual operational conditions, such as loading-unloading of bulk cargoes, an intensive pollution occurs, not only of e air but also of the port's territory after receipt of ecotoxicants in the harbor basin. Together with dynamic data of chemical analysis the growth conditions of the sea microflora is a sensitive parameter of pollution by dangerous goods. On the basis of the researches carried out, a working hypothesis resulted (accepted by the authors) regarding ecohygiene and ecotoxicology of dangerous goods. Thus, a necessity of transition to a chemical safety system and management of transportation risks has been confirmed including the separated, individually estimated decisions and also situative and/or preventive measurements.

AB  - A percentage of the waste generated in Puebla city is disposed of without control in the city ' s ravine system. Due to this, and to the presence of irregular human settlements, the ravines suffer degradation processes that put their continuity at risk, endangering the ecosystem services they provide to the city. That situation is shown in the condition of the El Conde and Malinalli ravines, which exemplify what happens in the urban system of ravines. The evaluation was done through the Margalef and Pielou indexes and a set of nine indicators that measure various components of the ravines. The results indicate that both ravines are diverse regarding the species category, from a medium to a high level. El Conde ravine presents a poor ecosystem status, which is the second lowest level on a five-level quality scale and is related to the impact generated by anthropic action, while Malinalli ravine exhibits an excellent quality level. The diversity of species, as an indicator of high ecological quality and criteria for the preservation of ecosystems, supports the proposal to recover and preserve both ravines, an urgent action in the case of El Conde due to the anthropic impact it is undergoing.

AB  - Watershed health assessment are intended to provide a better understanding and awareness that natural resources are truly living bodies and processes performing essential ecosystem services. Towards this, watershed health was assessed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), flow discharge, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The model was constructed based on the reliability (R-el), resilience (R-es) and vulnerability (V-ul) framework (RelResVul) for three watersheds viz. Foyle (United Kingdom), Xarrama (Portugal) and Shazand (Iran) with different climatic and hydrologic conditions. According to the framework, the scores of three individual indices i:e., R-el, R-es and V-ul and a watershed health assessment index were calculated using the geometric mean of three mentioned indices using data from 2001 to 2012. The comprehensive health index without considering TN and TP suggested that the watersheds scored medium (0.54 for Foyle and 0.53 for Xarrama), and low (0.37 for Shazand) health levels, respectively. The comprehensive health index also for both the Foyle (0.47) and Xarrama (0.49) watersheds was categorized in medium level considering TN and TP.

AB  - Restoration ecology is a scientific discipline which develops principles to guide the restoration of ecosystems based in ecological theory. The objective of this review is to synthetize the current situation and the perspective of the restoration ecology in Mexico and the challenge of this area of research given the environmental conditions in our country. A review of different indicators as scientific publications, meetings, institutions, researchers and the offer of academic programs was carried out. This review resulted in a total of 206 articles from which 78% were research articles (1995-2016), 18% opinions or methodological proposals and 4% were meta-analyses. In 82% of the publications, the first authors were working at a Mexican institution and from them, 57% were men and 43% women. The studies on forest ecosystems represented 71% and the principal topic was the recovery of woody species. The evaluation showed that some indicators increased whereas other stayed constant. The results showed that the academic offer was not enough; the need of a national scientific policy of restoration and long-term sources of funding is discussed.

AB  - A major question in fungal conservation is why many species are confined to old forests, and how they could be supported by contemporary landscape matrix. Specifically, forestry that retains large biological legacies across landscape could reduce old-forest dependencies to species that require unusual substrate conditions. We sampled polypores in 112 2 ha plots (both old and harvested stands) in a semi-natural forestry context in Estonia and modelled the habitat factors of species confined to old growth. The results confirmed that old-growth assemblages emerged mostly due to diverse and abundant substrate supply (notably downed CWD). Only 10 species (five spruce-dwellers) were confined to old growth; of these, only Fomitopsis rosea and Oxyporus corticola were additionally affected by forest connectivity. The forestry system studied appeared particularly favourable for the species inhabiting deciduous wood. To better address habitat degradation in conservation, expert lists of 'old-forest (indicator) fungi' should be replaced with evidence-based focal taxa.

AB  - The content and distribution of toxic elements in the rocks and soils of the Belebey plateau highlands, Ufa plateau and Zilair plateau were studied. The content of elements is determined by both natural and man-made factors. Natural accumulation is mainly related to the chemical composition of parent rocks. The parent rocks in Ufa plateau and Belebeyev plateau highlands are sedimentary with a big quantity of carbonates, and for the soils of the Zilair plateau - volcanic rocks. Man-made accumulation is characterized by a regression-accumulative type of distribution, which is manifested in an increased content in the humus-accumulative horizons and a sharp decrease in the lower ones. The accumulation of elements is associated with the extraction and processing of minerals, industrial emissions from enterprises, local wind and water transport of dust particles and aerosols from ash and slag dumps, and underground waste storage facilities. The amount of toxic elements in soils can also be determined by their belonging to various ecosystems (forest, arable land, meadow). The total chemical indicator in the research areas varies from strong to weak, and environmental conditions worsen in the areas: Belebey plateau highlands - Ufa plateau - Zilair plateau.

AB  - Chrysophyte algae produce a siliceous stage in their life cycle, through either asexual or sexual reproduction, known as a cyst. Cysts form in response to shifts in environmental conditions, population density, or predation pressure, and upon germination provide a seed source for future populations. Cysts are morphologically distinct for each species, and since their remains become part of the sediment or fossil record cysts are valuable tools in ecological and paleolimnological investigations. However, their value as biological indicators is limited because the vast majority of cyst morphotypes have not been linked to specific vegetative species. In the current work, an exquisitely preserved and morphologically complex cyst type is described from a 48 million year old early Eocene fossil site. This finding is remarkable since many of the cysts were still associated with components of the living vegetative cells that produced them, enabling the morphotype to be immediately linked to the synurophyte, Mallomonas ampla. Fusion of identifiable components of the living cell post cyst formation is unknown in modern investigations. The identification of the cyst structure for M. ampla could be valuable in determining cyst morphotypes for other species in the lineage.

AB  - The assessment of the habitat condition is the first step of conservation actions and several tools are available to assess wetlands. However, only a few tools are adapted to the priority habitat Mediterranean temporary ponds. Thus, our objectives were (i) to identify biological indicators associated with the different conservation status of Mediterranean temporary ponds and (ii) to create an efficient evaluation tool for non-experts using indicators of conservation status. A total of 87 ponds were sampled in southwest Portugal to assess the presence of plants, large branchiopods, amphibians, threatened voles and bats. Ponds with favourable conservation status showed higher species richness of plants, large branchiopods and amphibians. We identified eighteen indicators for favourable ponds: 15 plants, one large branchiopod and two amphibian taxa. We propose a new tool to assess the conservation status of Mediterranean temporary ponds based on the presence of these indicators. This tool is an alternative to other common, but time-consuming, methods and can be readily used by trained practitioners. The replication and adaptation of this tool to other regions and habitats enables the collection of comparable data and the geographical scaling-up of the assessments.

AB  - Gait analysis, as a common inspection method for human gait, can provide a series of kinematics, dynamics and other parameters through instrumental measurement. In recent years, gait analysis has been gradually applied to the diagnosis of diseases, the evaluation of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation progress, especially, gait phase abnormality can be used as a clinical diagnostic indicator of Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease, which usually show varying degrees of gait phase abnormality. This research proposed an inertial sensor based gait analysis method. Smoothed and filtered angular velocity signal was chosen as the input data of the 15-dimensional temporal characteristic feature. Hidden Markov Model and parameter adaptive model are used to segment gait phases. Experimental results show that the proposed model based on HMM and parameter adaptation achieves good recognition rate in gait phases segmentation compared to other classification models, and the recognition results of gait phase are consistent with ground truth. The proposed wearable device used for data collection can be embedded on the shoe, which can not only collect patients' gait data stably and reliably, ensuring the integrity and objectivity of gait data, but also collect data in daily scene and ambulatory outdoor environment.

AB  - During the last years, several reports described an apoptosis-like programmed cell death process in yeast in response to different environmental aggressions. Here, evidence is presented that hyperosmotic stress caused by high glucose or sorbitol concentrations in culture medium induces in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a cell death process accompanied by morphological and biochemical indicators of apoptotic programmed cell death, namely chromatin condensation along the nuclear envelope, mitochondrial swelling and reduction of cristae number, production of reactive oxygen species and DNA strand breaks, with maintenance of plasma membrane integrity. Disruption of AIF1 had no effect on cell survival, but lack of Yca1p drastically reduced metacaspase activation and decreased cell death indicating that this death process was associated to activation of this protease. Supporting the involvement of mitochondria and cytochrome c in caspase activation, the mutant strains cyc1 Delta cyc7 Delta and cyc3 Delta, both lacking mature cytochrome c, displayed a decrease in caspase activation associated to increased cell survival when exposed to hyperosmotic stress. These findings indicate that hyperosmotic stress triggers S. cerevisiae into an apoptosis-like programmed cell death that is mediated by a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway partially dependent on cytochrome c.

AB  - This article compares social participation networks in three wildlife protected areas in the Central Pacific of Costa Rica. These areas represent different management categories, which means different approaches to the use of natural resources. A mixed approach methodology was used to have a wider understanding of the socio-environmental processes in these areas. Analyses used included graph theory, social network analysis, and heat maps with attribute variables and global and positional network indicators. The elements of analysis included 40 civil society groups related to local development and environment conservation organized between 2009-2010 and 40 between 2019- 2020. The analysis units were the interactions among the groups. Results show that the more centralized the social networks and the less power of local and multisectoral groups, the greater the dissociation of the topics related to sustainability of wildlife protected areas and the more vulnerable to structural and external changes. It is concluded that, from the structural dimension, participation networks are influenced by the management categories, since they condition the access to their ecosystem services. From the functional dimension, the capability of participation networks to transform ecosystem services into development opportunities is irrespective of the management categories, although it is related to other social aspects.

AB  - As coastal population growth accelerates, intensive management practices increasingly alter urban shorelines, creating major conservation challenges. To evaluate key ecological impacts and identify indicators of coastal urbanization, we compared intertidal macroinvertebrate communities between urban beaches with intense maintenance regimes (sediment filling and grooming) and reference beaches lacking such maintenance in densely populated southern California. On urban beaches, intertidal communities were highly impacted with significantly reduced species richness, abundance, and biomass (effect sizes: 79%, 49%, 30%, respectively). Urban impacts affected macroinvertebrates across all intertidal zones, with greatest effects on upper intertidal wrack-associated taxa. On urban beaches altered intertidal communities were remarkably homogeneous across littoral cells in a biogeographically complex region. Functional diversity comparisons suggested degraded ecological functioning on urban beaches. No taxa flourished on urban beaches, but we identified several vulnerable indicator taxa. Our results suggest intense maintenance regimes on urban coasts are negatively impacting sandy beach ecosystems on a landscape scale. Beaches not subject to intense mechanized maintenance, can support high biodiversity, even near major urban centers.

AB  - In tropical countries rice has been identified as one of the crops that is particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of pesticide use. In addition to the physicochemical nature of the pesticide, tropical climatic conditions and agricultural practices play important roles in determining the fate and distribution of pesticides in the tropical paddy held ecosystem. The assessment of ecotoxicological effects of pesticides in the tropical paddy field ecosystem has been based primarily on acute lethality tests conducted on fish species commonly found in paddy fields. The effects of pesticides in the paddy field ecosystem on other nontarget organisms ranging from microalgae and cyanobacteria to paddy field crabs have also been investigated, although such studies are limited. As a means to promote a more judicious use of pesticides in the paddy field, the adoption of integrated pest management strategies have resulted in varying degrees of success. The most widely accepted form of control measure is the integration of multiresistant cultivars with reduced use of pesticides. Effective training of the paddy farmer has been identified as the key to successful implementation of integrated pest management strategies.

AB  - HUMAN activities have greatly increased the flux of many potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems(1). The development and implementation of effective remedial measures depend on our ability to predict the fate and effects of metals in these systems. Models based on sound physical-chemical and biological principles, such as the free-ion activity model(2-5), have shown great potential as predictive tools. This model has been effective in explaining the central role of the free-ion concentration (or activity) as a regulator of interactions (uptake, toxicity) between metals and aquatic organisms(2,3). It postulates that the biological effects of metals are best predicted by the activity of the free metal ion, rather than by total metal concentration. Because this model was developed in the laboratory under unnatural experimental conditions, it must be validated in field situations before being generally used in nature(3). We report here that Cd concentrations in an indigenous aquatic insect larva, Chaoborus punctipennis, are best described by the free-ion activity model, provided that competition for biological uptake sites between hydrogen ions and free cadmium ions, as well as cadmium complexation by natural organic matter, are explicitly taken into account. Our results suggest that the free-ion model would provide an effective theoretical framework for the use of animals as indicators of metal contamination in nature.

AB  - With the adoption of the damage tolerance design principle, the health monitoring system has become an integral part of the operation of engineering structures. For the system to work, a damage indicator that describes the structural integrity level should be established and monitored. The damage indicator is usually derived from structural responses. Many quantities have been proposed for damage indicator including natural frequency, mode shape, curvature, strain energy, and t-, F-, and z-statistics. In this paper, we propose a new damage indicator in the time and frequency domains derived from the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. We evaluate the method by using data obtained from a numerical simulation of a cracked beam. The beam deformation is nonlinear due to the contact between the crack faces during vibration. The proposed damage index is estimated in the domains for various observation points on the beam. Besides, the existence of the crack is also predicted by the widely used traditional method based on the change of the natural frequency and mode shape. A comparison is made between the present method and the existing ones. We conclude the present proposal is more sensitive to detect the crack.

AB  - The physical environment of the Canadian North is particularly sensitive to changes in climate because of a large concentration of cryospheric elements including both seasonal and multiyear forms of freshwater and sea ice, permafrost, snow, glaciers, and small ice caps. Because the cryosphere responds directly to changes in air temperature and precipitation, it is a primary indicator of the effects of climate variability and change. This article reviews the major changes that have occurred in the recent historical record of these cryospheric components at high latitudes in Canada. Some changes have been less pronounced in the Canadian North than elsewhere, such as changes in sea-ice coverage, whereas others have been potentially more significant, such as ablation of the extensive alpine and high-Arctic small glaciers and ice caps. Projections of future changes are also reviewed for each cryospheric component. Discussion about two other physical components of the North intrinsically linked to the cryosphere is also included, specifically: i) freshwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean via major river networks that are fed primarily by various forms of snow and ice, and ii) the related rise in sea level, which is strongly influenced by ablation of the cryosphere, and coastal stability, which also depends on the thermal integrity of coastal permafrost.

AB  - The choice of spatial and temporal scale used in environmental assessments may influence the observed results. One method of assessing the impact of stream habitat alterations involves the comparison of response variables among treatment categories (i.e., impacted and unimpacted sites). The influence of spatial resolution on patterns of response variables among treatment categories in assessments of stream channelization and other types of habitat alterations has not been evaluated. We examined how patterns of 10 community response variables among channel types and our interpretations of channelization impacts on fish and macroinvertebrate communities differed among three spatial resolutions in a warmwater stream in Mississippi and Alabama. Four fish and three macroinvertebrate community response variables exhibited different patterns among channel types at different spatial resolutions. Our interpretations of the impacts of channelization on fish and macroinvertebrate communities differed among spatial resolutions. Channelization had a negative influence on fish communities either with or without evidence of potential community recovery in one channel type. Channelization impacts on macroinvertebrate communities ranged from a negative influence to no effect. Our results suggest that spatial resolution can influence the observed results and interpretations derived from assessments of stream habitat alterations.

AB  - This study aimed at pointing out the environmental importance of road construction in a semi-arid high mountainous area on soil erosion and some important soil properties throughout the forest road. In total 60 soil samples in both forest and open area were collected from topsoil (0-20 cm) of a cut slope, fill slope, and control points along with a forest road route. The soil properties were determined in the laboratory and the soil loss amounts were determined by way of an Allgemeine Boden Abtrags Gleichung (ABAG) simulation model.
   As a result, the road construction phase significantly changed (p<0.001) the soil erosion trend. Annual soil loss amounts (t/ha/yr.) determined cut slope > fill slope > control in both forest and open areas. Consequently, road construction efforts significantly affected topsoil loss and some soil properties such as organic matter, available water-holding capacity, and bulk density. According to the created scenario, under the same slope (68.72%) and slope length (3.26 m) conditions, the highest soil loss trend was in cut slope, which was significantly different (p<0.001) from fill slope and control in forested and open areas.

AB  - The distribution and density of pelagic megafauna (marine mammals, seabirds, elasmobranches, and sea turtles) are important indicators of marine biodiversity, reflecting the condition of the underlying ecosystems. A dedicated aerial survey was conducted in the tropical Southwest Indian Ocean to map their distribution, the taxonomic diversity, and to estimate their densities to serve as a baseline for the area. This large survey across three ecological sub-regions revealed contrasting spatial distributions: maps of taxonomic richness of marine mammals and seabirds revealed different "hotspots" in the area. Densities were estimated for eight cetacean taxa with small and large Delphininae, or small Globicephalinae dominating, and for seven seabird taxa, with terns and noddies dominating. At the community level, the Southwest Indian Ocean megafauna was structured by the marine environment with strong differences between the Mozambique Channel and the Mascarene Islands, or between shelf and slope/oceanic habitats. Our results illustrate how multi-taxa aerial surveys are relevant and cost-effective monitoring tools for marine megafauna, allowing a community-wide approach.

AB  - This study analyses the plant colonization of the stone embankments along the Tiber River (the Lungotevere) in relation to changes of lithotype (travertine, tuff, cement), inclination (80 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees), stone size, and exposure. The surveys of plant communities were carried out according to the phytosociological method and considering the variability of the ecological conditions. The vegetation data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis (cluster analysis) in order to highlight the affinity among the various groups of sampling areas. The ecological features of the vegetation, according to Ellenberg indicator values, were considered for the ecological interpretation. Results showed that many environmental factors interact in giving rise to a differential plant cover and species richness, but that some are more relevant than others, such as the lithotype nature, especially in relation to the differential stone porosity. Also, changes in inclination of the walls cause variations in plant colonization, especially in the case of travertine and less in the case of tuff, as a consequence of the differing porosity of these materials. The study also confirms the subordinate role of exposure with respect to other factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000) defines macrophytes as one of the biological groups required for the ecological assessment of European surface waters. Several indices for macrophyte assessment have been proposed or are currently in use by different European states. As a first step towards performing an intercalibration of these indices a common dataset was developed. This dataset contains abundance data on 789 macrophyte species from 316 different lake sites in ten European countries. Various common species and genera were identified as indicators of reference and impacted conditions within the dataset. Cluster analysis of macrophyte data, supported by non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicated that clusters formed were more reflective of their source country rather than lake type. This might be caused by differences in regional climate, biogeography, monitoring techniques, or a combination of these factors. A total of six national indices were applied to assign quality classes to the lakes. However, this produced results that often differed by one or two quality classes for the same site. We foresee that a more precise intercalibration exercise is necessary, and it should be based on more detailed data considering both seasonality and the latitudinal differences within the area covered.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation has threatened the landscape continuity of Ray which was maintained from prehistoric times until recent decades. From 19th century that Tehran sprawl growth affected Ray's landscape as a satellite city of Tehran, Ray experienced rapid landscape fragmentation and underwent many changes. In order to cope with the threat, the process of changes from landscape fragmentation should be studied. For this purpose, integrated approach was applied to assess landscape fragmentation. Landscape fragmentation is analyzed based on physical and quantitative evaluation using landscape metrics and perceptual and quantitative evaluation through an in-depth interview with natives. The results have cleared an image of the structural changes and also great change of people's perception during the time. Based on the results, Ray's landscape is structurally fragmented, but native do not perceive it. This is while people perceive landscape functional fragmentation. This inconsistent perception of landscape has caused the native's dissatisfaction about their living place. With the prepared image of landscape fragmentation in the City of Ray, city managers, designers, and planners will be able to deal with rapid changes and preserve landscape continuity of Ray.

AB  - Paleoclimatic evolution of the last 140 ka (Marine Isotopic Stages MIS 1 to MIS 5) in the South Bay of Biscay has been studied by considering microfossil changes in sediment samples of deep core PP10-17. This core was retrieved at 2882 m water depth (mwd) in the Landas Plateau and is formed by 1792 cm of clay-silt continuously deposited sediment. For this study, a total of 114 samples have been examined, yielding approximately 60 thousands of specimens of foraminifers (181 benthic species, BF) and ostracods (70 spp.). Reconstruction of the benthic response is based on the main foraminifer and ostracod species by considering their oxic/anoxic character as well as other ecological features of the assemblages. Detailed quantification of microfossils (planktonic and benthic foraminifers, ostracods) together with grain size analyses and magnetic susceptibility of the sediments allow us to characterize many of the climatic events registered in this core. Based on a robust chronostratigraphy by correlation with reference core MD95-2002 and Greenland ice core records (GICC05modelext), we are able to characterize a detailed response of benthic environments to cooling/warming, oxygen-content and productivity cycles in the region. MIS 5 has been characterized by oscillations of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio (Oceanity index, OI; 60-90%); this index was higher (90-100%) and stable through the MIS 4 MIS 3 intervals. We found BF species indicators of different climatic-related events. Thus, MIS 5a, c, e interstadials are evidenced by Bulimina gibba and B. aculeata while the stadials MIS 5b, d are shown by the occurrence of Melonis pompilioides. Heinrich events, with massive iceberg discharges into the N Atlantic Ocean, are indicated by presence of Globobulimina affinis, particularly during the MIS 4 to MIS 2 interval. The beginning of MIS 4 is indicated by the appearance of new species of BF and an increase of Cassidulina laevigata. Krithe spp. and C. laevigata are good indicators of the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum, 19-23 ka) when the OI decreased. Other cooling periods (e.g. Younger Dryas, YD, around 12-13 ka) are shown as well by an increase of M. pompilioides, similar to that of the MIS 5d stadial. The Holocene (11.5 ka to present) is marked by an increase in the oceanity index, disappearance of cold-water indicators and the occurrence of Uvigerina peregrina. A shallow infaunal microhabitat of benthics foraminifers (Cibicides, Cassidulina, Uvigerina) and ostracods (Krithe, Argilloecia) has been linked to favorable bottom conditions, with oxic to slightly suboxic conditions (high diversity and equitability of assemblages) reflecting an active Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during many D/O interstadials. The opposite conditions were established for deep infaunal BF (Bulimina, Globobulimina) where the strong dysoxic bottom conditions are indicative of poor ventilation produced by a reduction or shutdown of the AMOC during Heinrich stadials.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the differences of the macroinvertebrate community in two neotropical ecoregions. In this regard were sampled in 12 low-order streams, biological samples (benthic macroinvertebrates), water samples to determine physical and chemical characteristics (pH, dissolved oxygen, altitude, water temperature, alkalinity, water hardness, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and was evaluated of the substrate in the riverbed. To compare attributes between the two ecoregions, was used the ANOVA and for the analysis of the structure and its relation with the physiographic parameters, the data were summarized by Principal Component Analysis. In addition, were classified the functional groups and indicator groups for each ecoregion. There were no differences between the ecoregions for attributes, however, the structure was different according to the PCA. Functional groups had different percentages for each ecoregion. The indicator taxa for Ecoregion 'A' were Baetidae, Aeshnidae, Coenagrionidae, Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae and for Ecoregion 'B', the indicator taxa were Leptohyphidae, Caenidae, Perlidae, Pleidae and Psephenidae. The presence of the sensible indicator taxa infers that Ecoregion 'B' shows better habitat condition, It is due to the structural difference in substrate types, alkalinity, dissolved oxigen and water temperature.

AB  - Lichens and mosses represent the macroscopic components of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). Their ability to exploit short periods of water availability and reversibly deactivate metabolism is crucial for their growth and survival. In this work we investigated photosynthesis reactivation, respectively after long (65-66 days) and short (15 days) dry periods, in lichen and moss species widespread in two Mediterranean environments (Portugal and Italy). Chlorophyll alpha fluorescence emission of the samples was investigated and the parameter Fv/Fm, an indicator of vitality of photosynthetic organisms, was used as a proxy for photosynthesis reactivation. The fruticose lichens Cladonia convoluta and C. rangiformis, and the moss Pleurochaete squarrosa, typical of Mediterranean environments, showed a significantly slower reactivation of photosynthetic activity when subjected to a longer period of drought. Conversely, the alien invasive moss Campylopus introfiexus was not affected by prolonged dry conditions. The study showed that drought duration influences the reactivation of photosynthetic activity in terricolous lichens and mosses forming biocrusts in re-hydration cycles. These results indicate the likelihood of a reduction in biocrust productivity as a consequence of climate change in Mediterranean drylands.

AB  - Though nutrients and silver often co-occur in aquatic ecosystems, the combined effects of these environmental stressors on aquatic plants are poorly understood. Such coexposures are important because nanosilver is increasingly released to the environment, and recent studies in aquatic systems indicate that nanosilver represents an environmental source of ionic silver (Ag+), which exerts relatively high acute toxicity to aquatic life. The primary objective of this study was to understand the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and N:P ratios on the toxicity of ionic silver to the model aquatic macrophyte Lemna gibba over 7-d study periods. L. gibba were more sensitive to silver (e.g., lower EC50 values) when N and P concentrations were higher. In addition, greater ionic silver toxicity occurred under higher P-availability (e.g., lower N:P ratios). L gibba frond number and fresh weight were also differentially affected across nutrient x silver treatment combinations. Such observations highlight the importance of considering site-specific nutrient conditions during the prospective and retrospective risk assessments and management of silver impacts to primary producers.

AB  - East African paleoenvironmental data increasingly inform an understanding of environmental dynamics. This understanding focuses less on habitat reconstructions at specific sites than on the regional trends, tempo, and amplitudes of climate and habitat change. Sole reliance on any one indicator, such as windblown dust or lake sediments, gives a bias toward strong aridity or high moisture as the driving force behind early human evolution. A synthesis of geological data instead offers a new paleoenvironmental framework in which alternating intervals of high and low climate variability provided the dynamic context in which East African Homo evolved. The Oldowan behavioral record presents further clues about how early Homo and Homo erectus responded to East African environmental change. Shifting conditions of natural selection, which were triggered by climatic variability, helped shape the adaptability of Oldowan hominins. Together, the behavioral and environmental evidence indicates the initial adaptive foundation for the dispersal of H. erectus and the persistence of Homo. In particular, overall dietary expansion made possible by the making and transport of stone tools compensated for increased locomotor and foraging costs and provided effective behavioral-ecological responses to resource instability during the early evolution of Homo.

AB  - Eutrophication caused by human sewage is a growing phenomenon along coasts. Mesozooplankton abundance, community structure, and environmental quality were compared at two sites in the inner Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE), Argentina, one receiving regional sewage discharge (Canal Vieja), and the other a non-impacted area (Bahia del Medio). Comparisons of mean abundance and multivariate analyses were performed to detect spatial and temporal variations in both environmental and biotic variables. Significantly higher amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus and lower oxygen and pH were recorded at Canal Vieja. Larvae of the detritivorous crab Neohelice granulata were more abundant at Canal Vieja, whereas the common estuarine copepod species Acartia tonsa was more abundant at Bahia del Medio, where the mesozooplankton community was typical for the estuary. Although mesozooplankton is likely to be adapted to the high organic matter content in the BBE, the environmental conditions at Canal Vieja appear to favour Neohelice granulata, and this species should be considered as a potential indicator of the impact of sewage in future monitoring programmes. Particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll a were not influenced by organic loading in this naturally eutrophic estuary.

AB  - Understanding the effects of land-use on threatened ecosystems is of special relevance for nature conservation. The aim of our study was to use Orthoptera as ecological indicators for succession in Central European steppe grasslands.
   Orthoptera showed a clear response to succession. Each successional stage harboured a unique assemblage. Species richness of habitat specialists was highest in the earliest seral stages. In contrast, density of all species peaked at the intermediate successional stage. Early successional stages are mostly likely to be preferred by specialized Orthoptera because they provide warm suitable oviposition sites (bare ground) and microclimatic conditions. The density peak in the mid-successional stage probably reflects a trade-off between favourable ambient temperatures for optimal development, sufficient food and shelter against predators.
   Although all successional stages of steppe grassland are relevant for conservation, early and mid-successional stages are the most important. Consequently, conservation management should aim at reintroduction of a traditional, low-intensive land use for abandoned steppe grasslands. As an optimal land use, we recommend traditional rough grazing with sheep and goats, which creates a heterogeneous habitat structure with bare ground, and avoids the accumulation of litter, favouring Orthoptera.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Habitat Use Patterns by Water Birds in an Urban Estuarine Ecosystem: Implications for Ecosystem Management and Restoration
T2  - HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
AB  - A quintessential urban estuary is the lower Passaic River in northeastern New Jersey, USA. This system is environmentally degraded and its ecosystem is functionally limited. Birds in this river are of particular interest for ecological assessment and environmental management because they are conspicuous, ecologically important, and their habitat requirements encompass the full range of ecosystems associated with the estuary. In this article, we present the results of a 1-year seasonal bird survey of the lower 6 miles of the Passaic River. We contrast our survey results with those from other waterways in the region that have stressor issues similar to the Passaic (i e, contaminants, pathogens, physical disturbance, etc), but which have substantially more wetlands habitat available for birds (i e, fewer habitat constraints). Our objective was to evaluate the influence of habitat availability or constraints on bird use in such systems. The results of our survey and comparison to conditions of other regional waterways demonstrate that the lack of wetland and associated shoreline habitat in the lower Passaic River is likely the primary constraint on bird use of the system. Future investigations of individual stressors in this region should identify the habitat constraints in the decision matrix for judging management options.

AB  - Resilience is not a new idea but there has been an upsurge in efforts to operationalize the concept within water management. This review begins with a synopsis of related themes around persistent and emerging pressures on freshwaters; environmental thresholds (or tipping points); 'safe' operating conditions; multiple stable states; regime shifts. A case is made for viewing and managing the resilience of water systems at nested scales. Indicators are needed to track evolving climate risks as well as to measure socio-ecological responses. Catchment properties can identify those river systems that are more or less likely to return to a pre-disturbance state; resilience further depends on institutional and social landscapes. Ideally, allied notions of resistance and reliability are applied alongside resilience to broaden the portfolio of adaptation measures. Water managers would also benefit from more consistent use of resilience terminology; incentives to build back better after catastrophes; strategic monitoring of incipient threats and tipping points; availability of long-term adaptation indicators; coordinated efforts to reduce non-climatic pressures on freshwaters (especially in headwaters); evidence-based, practical guidance on adaptation measures that build resilience.

AB  - In order to develop adequate adaptation measures for environmental vulnerability, we need detailed knowledge on the climatic performance of forest ecosystems. In this study, we aim to explore climate function variability of lowland beech forest distribution at a landscape scale. We also construct the response profiles of these forests near their xeric limit under wet continental climatic conditions. We studied distribution responses using presence-absence forest records and 18 bioclimatic variables. We performed exploratory factor analysis and frequency estimation to evaluate climate function distribution responses. We found that temperature adjusted precipitation measures during summer were the most important, followed by winter rainfall indices. The relative Drought Response Range (rDRR) in the response profile presented the climate limitation function of the distribution. According to our results, higher level of climate function variability is associated with lower level of rDRR, presenting an ecological trade-off. Our results suggest that distribution functions of the rDRR, especially the Ombrothermic index, can be used as landscape indicators of drought stress. Consequently, rDRR could be a useful measure to assess regional climatic vulnerability of forest occurrence and distribution patterns.

AB  - In 1992, world leaders at the historical UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) recognized that the exploitation of resources in coastal oceans was becoming increasingly unsustainable, resulting in an international effort to assess, recover, and manage goods and services of large marine ecosystems (LMEs). More than $3 billion in support to 110 economically developing nations have been dedicated to operationalizing a five-module approach supporting LME assessment and management practices. An important component of this effort focuses on the effects of climate change on fisheries biomass yields of LMEs, using satellite remote sensing and in situ sampling of key indicators of changing ecological conditions. Warming appears to be reducing primary productivity in the lower latitudes, where stratification of the water column has intensified. Fishery biomass yields in the Subpolar LMEs of the Northeast Atlantic are also increasing as zooplankton levels increase with warming. During the current period of climate warming, it is especially important for space agency programmes in Asia, Europe, and the United States to continue to provide satellite-borne radiometry data to the global networks of LME assessment scientists.

AB  - Pluriannual data on the phytoplankton spatial and seasonal distribution in the lagoon of Venice (North-western Adriatic Sea, Italy) were presented and analysed to suggest a possible tool for the transitional ecosystem water quality assessment. In order to meet the European Water Framework Directive 2000/60, data of phytoplankton distribution were processed together with environmental parameters to verify whether such a community may give indications of the water quality. Some evidence in this direction appeared to be provided by diatom biomass and cell abundance. The starting hypothesis was that the occurrence of opportunistic species (small cells with a high growth rate) is related to the worst environmental conditions, and the conservative species (large cells with a slow growth rate) to the best water quality areas. The method was validated in other Italian transitional systems (Sacca di Goro, Lesina Lagoon, Orbetello Lagoon, Marano-Grado Lagoon, Mar Piccolo of Taranto). The overall results seem to give quite a good description of the environmental status, but they also highlighted the limits of the phytoplankton community as an indicator and, hence, the necessity to conduct regular sampling throughout the year.

AB  - For more than 20 years European research groups have examined the causes of novel forest decline. Monitoring networks have been established in order to survey the condition of trees and their long-term change. Interdisciplinary field projects and chamber experiments were started to improve the knowledge of cause effect relations.
   The Federal Forest Research Centre (FBVA) is responsible for the Austrian networks (Austrian Forest Inventory, Forest Damage Monitoring System, Bio-Indicator Grid). At the same time, the FBVA concentrates mainly on interdisciplinary research activities in the alpine area ("Zillertal Altitude Profile", "Achenkirch Altitude Profiles"). These projects are aimed at improving the knowledge of the "environmental situation" of the Alps and at describing regional and time-related variations of potential natural and anthropogenic stress factors to forest ecosystems. In cooperation with numerous university institutes and research centres, causal relationships between stressors and their effects on trees are described. The majority of the investigations refer to spruce as the principal Austrian tree species and the main investigation areas represent differently stressed Austrian forest areas.
   The contributions presented in this series of publications comprise mainly results from the project "Achenkirch Altitude Profiles" and refer to pollutants. The latter are described and assessed with respect to their impacts on forest ecosystems.

AB  - Tensegrities are cable-strut assemblies which find their stiffness and self-equilibrium states from the integrity between tension and compression. Low stiffness and coinciding natural frequencies are known issues. Their stiffness can be regulated and improved by changing the level of pre-stress. In vibration health monitoring, the first natural frequency is used as an indicator of better stiffness, but coinciding natural frequencies will be an obstacle in measuring and analysing the correct resonance. In this paper, the above two issues have been considered for modular tensegrity structures. The finite element model used considers not only the axial vibration of the components, but also the transversal vibration where non-linear Euler-Bernoulli beam elements are used for simulations. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem, with a multi-objective criterion combination. The optimum self-stress of the tensegrity structures can be chosen such that their lowest natural frequency is high, and separated from others. Two approaches are used to find the optimal self-stress vector: scaling from a base module or considering all modules at once. Both approaches give the same optimum solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The determinant factors for macroinvertebrate assemblages in river ecosystems are varied and are unique and specific to the type of macroinvertebrate family. This study aims to assess the determinant factors for macroinvertebrate assemblages in a recreational river. The study was conducted on the Ulu Bendul River, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. A total of ten sampling stations were selected. The research methodology included (1) water quality measurement, (2) habitat characterization, and (3) macroinvertebrate identification and distribution analysis. The statistical analysis used in this study was canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to represent the relationship between the environmental factors and macroinvertebrate assemblages in the recreational river. This study found that most of the families of macroinvertebrates were very dependent on the temperature, DO, NH3-N, type of riverbed, etc. All of these factors are important for the survival of the particular type of macroinvertebrate, plus they are also important for selecting egg-laying areas and providing suitable conditions for the larvae to grow. This study advises that improved landscape design for watershed management be implemented in order to enhance water quality and physical habitats, and hence the protection and recovery of the macroinvertebrate biodiversity.

AB  - The emergence of renewable energy infrastructures calls for a better understanding of their impact on biodiversity. The aim of the present study was to investigate in a mountain region the impact of a wind turbine on plant communities in their vicinity. A field survey was conducted in a wind farm situated in the Southern Romanian Carpathians, five years after the turbines were installed. We tested for the effects of the presence of the turbine and the distance to the turbine on plant species richness, on five plant ecological indicators and on the quality of the pastures. Overall, 33 plant species belonging to 16 families were recorded, and among them 21 were recorded in both the presence and the absence of wind turbine. The presence of a turbine did not affect the structure of the plant community, as the majority of the plots exhibited similar plant species richness and composition. Finally, the values of the ecological indicators and the pasture quality were not altered by the presence of the turbine. Such analyses could be extended over longer time periods so as to capture potential long-term effects and by integrating other environmental factors such as microclimatic conditions or soil properties.

AB  - Application of public health insecticides for mosquito control has increased dramatically with the recent outbreaks in the continental United States of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Mosquito control is often controversial because of the potential impacts on health and the environment due to the chemicals used. The emphasis in this review is to examine the transport, fate, and potential effects of the active ingredients in selected public health insecticides used for mosquito control. Due to the many potential entry points for insecticides, especially in urban areas where use is less monitored and application may be in greater amounts per unit area, this review suggests that a potential focus might be on the prevalence and quantification of the cumulative concentrations of these insecticides in natural systems. Often concentrations resulting from a single application are unlikely to cause mortality, but multiple applications may result in concentrations of environmental concern. Minimizing entrance to waterways and public water supply sources can be achieved by applying insecticides during prime meteorological conditions where drift and volatilization are minimized, using vegetated buffer zones in agricultural areas to prevent runoff, and avoiding application to impervious surfaces in urban areas.

AB  - Upscaling of sample data on indicators of decomposition to the landscape scale is often necessary for extensive ecological assessments. The amount of such data is mostly scarce even with high sampling efforts. Moreover, environmental conditions are very heterogeneous in high mountain regions. Therefore, the aim was to find a suitable technique for spatial modeling under these circumstances.
   A method combining decision tree analysis and the construction of fuzzy membership functions is introduced for a GIS-based mapping of decomposition indicating parameters. It is compared with an approach solely based on decision trees. Within a case study in the Italian Alps the spatial distribution of humus forms, classified by the occurrence of an OH (humified residues) horizon, is examined. There appears to be a strong relationship with elevation and a minor correlation with slope exposition.
   The fuzzy logic-based approach proves to be suitable for modeling the spatial distribution of indicators of decomposition. Mapping fuzzy values allows for the representation of small-scale variability and uncertainty of data due to a relatively low sample size in a very heterogeneous environment.

AB  - The current research examines some of the basic morphological hematological indicators (erythrocyte count, leukocyte count, hemoglobin, differential blood formula) in adult, fertile species within a population of the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus, inhabiting two heavily polluted rivers in Bulgaria. One of the two rivers is Sazliika River, which is polluted with nitrates, phosphates, biological oxygen demand in five days and insoluble substances, and the other one is Topolnica River, polluted with heavy metals. The paper explores the use of these indicators as biological markers for the quality of the environment in the two rivers. Statistically significant differences were found between the examined parameters in the two rivers and the control group. The living in toxic conditions resulted in a single type change in the blood toxicology (increased erythrocyte count and amount of hemoglobin). The changes in the differential blood formula differ considerably - the samples from Sazliika exhibit adaptive characteristics (neutrophilia, monocytosis and lymphopenia in general leukocytosis), whereas the samples from Topolnica showed lymphopenia accompanied with neutropenia and monocytosisin general leukocytosis. This is an evidence of the degenerative effects of toxicity.

AB  - Recent research suggests anthropogenic disturbance may disproportionately advantage non-indigenous species (NIS), aiding their establishment within impacted environments. This study used novel laboratory- and field-based toxicity testing to determine whether non-indigenous and native bryozoans (common within marine epibenthic communities worldwide) displayed differential tolerance to the common marine pollutant copper (Cu). In laboratory assays on adult colonies, NIS showed remarkable tolerance to Cu, with strong post-exposure recovery and growth. In contrast, native species displayed negative growth and reduced feeding efficiency across most exposure levels. Field transplant experiments supported laboratory findings, with NIS growing faster under Cu conditions. In field-based larval assays, NIS showed strong recruitment and growth in the presence of Cu relative to the native species. We suggest that strong selective pressures exerted by the toxic antifouling paints used on transport vectors (vessels), combined with metal contamination in estuarine environments, may result in metal tolerant NIS advantaged by anthropogenically modified selection regimes.

AB  - The persistence of an island of remnant vegetation within a tailings retention system provided an opportunity to conduct a pilot study to develop hypothesis concerning the impacts of acid spray and radiation on arid zone flora and fauna. Ecological changes were investigated by comparing species abundance and condition on both the study island and remote control areas. Hopbush (Dodonaea viscosa), geckos and a common ant species, Iridomyrmex rufoniger sp. B were abundant in control regions but absent from the study region, whereas densities of colonising plant species, Helen beetles and scorpions were unusually high at the impacted site. These disparities are probably attributable to acid spray at the impacted site and hence are potentially useful bioindicators of these impacts. Dragon and skink populations were apparently unaffected by the polluted ecosystem, although Ctenophorus nuchalis proved to be a significant bioaccumulator of radionuclides. Bioaccumulation of the radionuclides, U-238, Th-230, Pb-210 and particularly Po-210 were significantly greater than that reported elsewhere in the literature. Further radionuclide monitoring of herbivorous dragon species, possibly concentrating upon Po-210 levels, was the suggested outcome of this pilot study.

AB  - Nineteen loads of commercial feeder cattle (BW 376 +/- 39 kg, mean +/- SD) transported for 18 +/- 4.5 h in summer and winter seasons were used to collect data on internal temperature and humidity conditions in the deck and belly compartment of pot-bellied trailers and their relationship with shrink, cortisol, and morbidity. Measurements of temperature or humidity at ceiling or animal level did not vary with transportation factors. Temperature and humidity ratio was greater at animal-level than ambient conditions during non-highway travel and stationary periods (P < 0.01). During the 3 time periods evaluated within journeys, there was a larger difference between animal-level and ambient conditions during the winter than during the summer (P < 0.01); however, this difference was not associated with other transport factors (P > 0.05). Evening loads (1700 and 2100 h) experienced more shrink in the summer than in the winter (11.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.5% of BW; P = 0.03). A 1 degrees C increase in difference between average animal-level temperature in transit and the mean ambient temperature during the 10 d before transport was associated with a 0.11 +/- 0.03% of BW increase in shrink (P < 0.01) and 0.006 +/- 0.002 ng/mL increase in post-transport cortisol concentration (P = 0.05). Animal-level temperature-humidity index (THI) events (consecutive observations of THI greater than 78 degrees F) were more likely to last for longer than 1 h when the trailer was stationary vs. traveling (mean = 1.8, confidence level 95% = 1.33, 2.52). During THI events at animal level, the disagreement with ambient temperature regarding THI classification was lower when the vehicle was traveling vs. stationary (95.5 +/- 0.01% vs. 99.7 +/- 0.002% of THI event in disagreement; P < 0.01) and was greatest in events less than 1 h (99.8 +/- 0.0% vs. 91.7 +/- 0.03% of THI event in disagreement; P < 0.01). The average magnitude of the difference during these events was 11.4 +/- 7.6 degrees F and was not affected by transportation factors (P > 0.05). Despite association between indicators of calf welfare and microclimate, all cattle arrived in good condition and there was 0.96% treatment rate within the first 30 d after arrival. Management and auditing decisions related to transportation of feeder cattle should consider the relationship between animal-level and ambient conditions and conditions before transportation. Under the commercial conditions of the current study, the transportation process did not appear to cause distress according to the dimensions of animal welfare that were assessed.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the ecological integrity of a large river, which receives agricultural and urban effluents and is used to water public supply. The fish species Astyanax bifasciatas was used as bioindicator during winter and spring 2012, and summer 2013 at the Middle Iguacu River basin in Parana state, Brazil. Water chemical and physical measures and ecotoxicological tests were carried out as well biochemical and genetic biomarkers in sampled fish in each period. The studied area was divided in three sample points; SP1, located where the water is collected to public supply; SP2, located in an urbanized area, and SP3, located at an urbanized area with the discharge of the sewage treatment. Although water chemical and physical analyzes were range of the Brazilian law to hydric bodies, anticholinesterasic effects were found in winter, oxidative stress in summer and spring. The higher genotoxic effect was in winter to all sample points. The temporal variation in biomarkers and the detection of caffeine in the water call attention to the water quality in this river mainly to be used to public supply. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the differences between fish resources and fish availability in freshwater fish species in 2 different sectors of the Lower Danube river, the Braila sector and the Galati sector. The analysed indicators describing the status of the freshwater fish community in the 2 different sectors of the Danube river are: (1a) total capture (t/year); (1b) total capture per unit area (t/year x km); (2) total number of fish species (number of species/year); (3) number of valuable fish species (number of species/year); (4) number of ruling fish species (number of species/year); (5) abundance of feeding groups (%/guild), and (6) abundance of flow preference guilds (%/guild). The qualitative aspects of fish captures salient in the last 4 indicators highlight certain similarities and some differences between the 2 sectors. The total number of fish species captured annually was higher in the Braila sector (the maximum was 20 species) but the number of valuable, respectively ruling, fish species was the same in the 2 sectors. There were 8 ruling fish species which dominated the capture (relative biomass > 10%): carp, goldfish, common bream, bighead carp, wells catfish, barbel, vimba, northern pike.

AB  - The situation of water sector in the Gaza Strip-is characterized by many parties as humanitarian crisis-where the underling groundwater, the only water resource, is used extensively to supply water for domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors. The major part of the groundwater is grossly exploited and contaminated with high levels of pollutants, e.g. chloride (Cl) concentrations range between 600-2000 mg/l and nitrate (NO3) concentrations range between 50 and 200 mg/l, these levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) and Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) guidelines for drinking water. In response to this water crisis, the PWA put a comprehensive plan to construct three short-term low-volume (STLV) seawater desalination plants to provide Gaza Strip by a total of 13 million cubic meters per year of freshwater. The regional short-term low-volume (SLTV) seawater desalination plant is considered as an urgent solution to mitigate the suffering from water crisis in the southern region of the Gaza Strip. Currently, the plant provides the water sector by 2.2 million cubic meters of freshwater per year. The plant will be upgraded to provide about 7.3 million cubic meters of freshwater per year for domestic uses. However, as a product from the reverse osmosis process, huge amount of brine, nearly 8.92 million cubic meters per year, with salinity reaches to 75,000 mg/L will be redirected to seawater. This paper employs the powerful of numerical modelling to suggest proper mitigation measures in order to minimize the negative environmental impacts of brine disposal on the marine ecosystems. This study uses the model of CORMIX v 9.0 to simulate the dispersion and dilution behavior of discharged brine through eight disposal systems classified under four classes of configurations: single port outfall, alternating multi port diffuser, unidirectional multi port diffuser and staged multi port diffuser. The sensitivity of change in the ambient conditions over the four seasons of the year plays a significant role in enhancing or inhibiting the process of brine mixing, dilution and dispersion. Taking salinity variations as an indicator, the simulation results of discharged brine via various outfalls configurations into the marine environment over the four annual seasons show that the fanned-out unidirectional multi port outfall of option (7) is the optimal design configuration, where discharging the produced brine from the regional STLV plant via option (7) can meet the disposal standard at RMZ in the worst ambient condition of autumn at low astronomical tide (LAT) by reducing the brine's excess salinity at the edge of mixing zone to less than 1.25% (488 mg/L) above seawater salinity.

AB  - Assessments of hurricane-induced environmental impacts are important to coastal management and risk analysis of ecosystems. In this study, a previously-developed remote sensing model for non-hurricane conditions by Wang et al. [Wang, H. Q. Hladik, C. M., Milla, K., Huang, W. R., Edmiston, L, Harwell, M. A., & Schalles, J. F. (in press). Detecting and mapping water quality indicators in Apalachicola Bay, Florida using MODIS Terra 250-m imagery. International Journal of Remote Sensing] has been substantially enhanced to investigate the impact of Hurricane Frances on total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA. The remote sensing model uses 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to map TSS concentrations in the Bay. Eleven additional satellite imageries of MODIS were used in the model improvement and calibration. TSS concentration computation in the present model has been substantially improved by using a two-step process: firstly producing atmospheric correction intercept by an approach of in-water reflectance regression, and then building the regression model (R-2 = 0.8534, n = 25) between 250-m MODIS reflectance and observed TSS concentrations, which includes an extreme high TSS concentration data of 208 mg/L for severe storm or hurricane condition. Also, we carried out the validation of model (RMSE = 5.5 mg/L, n = 21). MODIS-derived TSS maps show substantial increases of TSS concentrations in the Bay during the passage of Hurricane Frances (the average TSS and maximum concentration about 54.3 mg/L and 165 mg/L in the Bay respectively) compared to under no-storm or -hurricane condition ( the average TSS and maximum concentration were approximately 24-27 mg/L and 58-64 mg/L. In comparison to those before and 5-days after the passage of the hurricane, the average TSS concentration in the Bay was twice higher while the maximum TSS concentration increased almost three times during the hurricane. This indicates that strong winds during the hurricane have caused strong sediment re-suspension. The spatial variations of TSS concentrations were analyzed by applying the hydrodynamic characteristics of wind-induced flow and tidal currents as described by Huang [Huang, W., Jones, K., & Wu, T. (2002). Modeling surface wind effects on subtidal salinity in Apalachicola Bay. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 55(1), 33-46; Huang, W., Sun, H. Nnaji, S., & Jones, K (2002). Tidal hydrodynamics in a multiple inlet estuary: Apalachicola Bay. International Journal of Coastal Research, 18 (4), 674-684], which show westward currents in the Bay under westward wind condition. Therefore, the southwestward wind (about 50 degrees from the north) during the hurricane induced southwestward currents and transport that resulted in the high TSS concentrations near West Pass in the Bay and the Gulf. Within the Bay, TSS concentrations were generally higher in the southern portion of the Bay, which was due mainly to transport by the combination of southwestward wind and southward residual flow from the Apalachicola River.

AB  - Redox state and salinity are fundamental properties of watermasses, and in modern environments, detailed analysis of spatial variability in redox and salinity is possible through direct measurement. Watermass reconstruction is difficult in deep-time systems, however, because the sedimentary record of ancient watermasses is often incomplete or difficult to access on spatial scales large enough to permit basin-scale reconstruction. During the Middle Devonian to Early Mississippian periods, the Appalachian Basin of eastern North America was characterized by a variably restricted watermass, leading to extensive deposition of organic-rich black shale associated with the regional development of bottom-water anoxia. Watermass reconstruction during deposition of these units has previously been attempted, but only on small spatial scales, with most studies focused on trace element proxies applied to individual study sections. Here, we focus instead on a broader geographic reconstruction of watermasses in the Lower Mississippian (Tournaisian) Sunbury Shale and present a new geochemical dataset that spans five drill cores across a basin transect from northeastern Ohio to southern Kentucky (USA). Iron speciation and trace metal abundances reveal a strong paleoredox gradient that can be related to water depth and basin hydrography. In the northeastern-most core of Ohio, iron speciation reveals largely ambiguous redox conditions; however, oxic conditions are potentially indicated by very low total organic carbon and trace metal contents. These oxygenated conditions were likely related to proximity to the Catskill deltaic wedge complex that fed freshwater into the basin and lowered the position of the regional pycnocline. In contrast, in central and southern Ohio, paleoredox indicators reveal the development of ferruginous conditions associated with rapid deepening to the south into the central axis of the Appalachian Basin. Further to the south in Kentucky, our data reveal dominantly euxinic conditions, which developed as environments shoaled towards the basin-bounding Cumberland Sill. We also investigated paleosalinity across the Appalachian Basin using strontium/barium (Sr/Ba) ratios. Our data reveal a subtle paleosalinity gradient from low-brackish (i.e., close to freshwater) conditions close to the Catskill Delta complex to increasingly brackish conditions to the southwest. This trend was disrupted by large paleosalinity variation across a shallow mixing zone in the southwestern-most core. Lastly, strong enrichments of redox-sensitive trace metals in both ferruginous and euxinic environments are parsimoniously attributed to the operation of an iron-manganese particulate shuttle that continuously supplied oxide-sensitive metals to the Appalachian Basin. Ultimately, this study is among the first to present detailed watermass reconstruction in an ancient epeiric sea using both redox and salinity proxies applied over a large lateral transect. We suggest that a similar approach may be useful in other deep-time systems of geobiological, paleoclimatic, and paleoceanographic significance. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The formation of newly created plantations assumes the possibility of expanding their species composition and biological diversity of forest vegetation. The introduction has long been recognized as a successful tool for replenishing the local flora with promising species. Stability of species in new conditions is directly related to their physiological characteristics. The practice of introducing representatives of the genus larch confirms wide biological possibilities, high stability and productivity of plantations created from them. The indicators of seasonal changes of the storage compound content in the tissues of one-year shoots are an important characteristic of the physiological state of woody plants as native representatives of the genus larch and its exotics. The goal of research is to identify the interspecific and individual phenotypic variability of various species of larch under the conditions of introduction according to the indices of their physiological state. The object of the study is the collection of larch plantations in the territory of the dendrological complex "Yavleika" in the Sergachskiy interdistrict forestry of the Nizhny Novgorod region. We investigate the presence of starch (staining reaction to Lugol's solution) and fats (Sudan III reaction) in the tissues of one-year shoots of three species of larch. The content of these components is assessed in terms of the developed scales. The primary sampling unit in the histochemical experiment is a one-time fixation of the amount of the analyzed matter in the shoot's recording tissue. Visual reading of values is performed on temporary preparations of transverse sections from the middle part of the annual increment. Sections after staining and fixation are analyzed using a micrometer "Mikmed-2". Common methods are used for the statistical and variance analyses. We have determined the degree of genotypic conditioning of characteristics of the physiological state of plants, the influence of environmental factors on the formation of phenotypic differences between them. The species of a genus larch essentially differ in ability to form lipoid stocks in one-year shoots of different phenological phases. The highest content of fats in March was observed in Sukachev's larch (18.33 points) and Dahurian larch (17.50 points), Siberian larch had the less indicator (7.84 points). During the period of active shoot growth (in the end of May), the content of fats in their tissues decreased in the studied species, the differences between them were equalized. Considered species of the genus larch differ significantly by the ability to form starch stocks in one-year shoots in different phenological phases. The highest content of starch (in the end of May) was characteristic of Dahurian larch, the lowest - for Sukachev's larch. The ranges of values of the test characters in different species of larch are not the same and vary according to the phenological phases. Phenotypic differences in the studied indicators are determined both by species and by external factors. The environmental effect on the formation of stocks of fat-like substances and starch depends on the phenological state of plants.

AB  - A lake-wide bloom of the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella, discovered in Albert Falls Dam in October 2006, exposed a significant ecological change indicative of reduced water quality in this historically mesotrophic reservoir. The spatial distribution of the bloom was examined synoptically in October 2006 and January 2007; these surveys revealed generally higher dinoflagellate densities in inshore reaches of the lake, and especially in the discharge plume of the inflowing Mgeni River. Ceratium totally dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, accounting almost completely for coincident chlorophyll levels, which generally increased with depth to generate a 'deep' chlorophyll maximum. Vertical oxygen profiles during the bloom differed substantially from corresponding profiles during non-bloom conditions historically typical in this reservoir. Direct count data and ordination analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling exposed marked changes in zooplankton community structure compared to seasonally congruent non-bloom conditions in other years. Changes included the effective replacement of Moina by Bosmina, substantial reductions in Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia, and smaller but definite increases in abundance especially of calanoid copepods, as well as cyclopoid copepods and of Chaoborus, although not all of these differences were apparent in both survey months. These compositional changes are attributable to intrinsic differences in feeding biology among taxa and their associated susceptibility to the altered food environment, which was commensurate with Ceratium's emergence. In addition, chydorid cladocerans appeared as a new (but spatially restricted) eutrophic bio-indicator component of the zooplankton, and the species diversity of cyclopoid copepods was enriched.
   The historical incidence of Ceratium in the lake since 1995 coincided with low NO3-N:TP values (used here as an N:P ratio proxy), particularly of inflow waters, and with broadly coincident values in the open lake. Ceratium was present but sparse in 1995, at average N:P ratios around 5.5. It disappeared in 1996 when the ratio increased radically to >10, and reappeared in 2004 after an erratic decline of the ratio to < 5 in the lake. The decline in N:P ratio of inflow waters since 1996 was clearly associated with a consistent rise in TP levels in inflows, most plausibly attributable to inputs of (Howick) wastewater treatment (WWT) plant origin. The appearance of Ceratium blooms is accordingly related to progressive elevations in mean annual P concentrations in inflows from similar to 40 mu g/l in 1995 to 120 mu g/l in 2007 (broadly mirrored in annual I'll loadings), suggesting that improved operational efficiency (and capacity) of the WWT plant offers a plausible prospect for mitigation and reversal.

AB  - Background
   Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health-related information from patients using either their telephone's touch-tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes.
   Search methods
   We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised, cluster-and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies.
   Main results We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.
   For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).
   For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening.
   Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data.
   The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use.
   Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse ormanaging illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers.
   Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions.
   Authors' conclusions ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests.
   The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective.

AB  - Early Toarcian (Early Jurassic; -183 Ma) climate and carbon cycle perturbations were accompanied by widespread accumulation of bituminous sediments, formed during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE). On the northwestern Tethyan shelf, organic carbon accumulation was particularly widespread in hydrodynamically restricted regions of the European Epicontinental Basin System (EEBS) where it peaked during the formation of euxinic waters extending into the photic zone. In the adjacent northeastern West Tethys shelf (NE-WTS), an area proximal to the deeper and better ventilated NW Tethys, deposition of strata enriched in organic matter was restricted to depressions of limited spatial extent. While numerous works have addressed the bituminous strata from the EEBS, evolution of environmental conditions and drivers of organic matter accumulation in areas proximal to the open Tethys have received much less attention.
   Here, we investigated a stratigraphically well-constrained, exceptionally organic matter-rich sediment succession from the NE-WTS deposited during the T-OAE. Organic and isotope geochemical investigations provided in-sights into the evolution and dynamics of environmental conditions during the T-OAE in a setting proximal to the Tethys.
   The sedimentary rocks sampled for this study originated from a surface outcrop that experienced weathering related alteration of its mineral constituents. In particular, sulfides (mainly pyrite) were significantly altered. resulting in a near-quantitative loss of sulfur. In contrast, kerogen as well as bitumen fractions have not been significantly affected by weathering processes and carry a robust paleoenvironmental signal.
   The new data show that organic carbon accumulation occurred as a direct response to changing environmental conditions that also led to the early Toarcian carbon cycle perturbation. Increase in organic carbon burial occurred in a stepwise manner, following multiple injections of C-12-enriched carbon into the Earth's ocean-atmosphere system. High algal productivity and the subsequent organic matter decomposition by sulfate reducing bacteria led to an expansion of H2S-rich waters into the photic zone, which promoted the growth of Chlorobiaceae. A steady increase in nitrogen isotope values testified to intensified denitrification in an expanded oxygen minimum zone. The resulting decline in the availability of bio-utilizable nitrogen in combination with harsh environmental conditions promoted the proliferation of cyanobacteria as indicated by increasing abundances of 2 alpha methyl hopanes. Formation of euxinic waters in the NE-WTS was not associated with a freshwater driven salinity stratification. Organic geochemical salinity indicators (methylated chromanes) attest to normal marine salinity, supporting a strong influence of Tethyan water masses.
   This study enhances our knowledge on the environmental response towards the early Toarcian climate and carbon cycle perturbations in a setting proximal to the Tethys. We demonstrate that photic zone euxinia was a common and particularly widespread feature of the T-OAE and has not been confined to the hydrodynamically restricted EEBS.

AB  - The present state of deoxygenation in the northern limits of the shallow oxygen minimum zone off Mexico is examined in order to detect its effects on larval fish habitats and consider the sensitivity of fish larvae to decreased dissolved oxygen. A series of cruises between 2000 and 2017 indicated a significant vertical expansion of low oxygen waters. The upper limit of suboxic conditions (<4.4 mu mol/kg) has risen similar to 100 m at 19.5 degrees N off Cabo Corrientes and similar to 50 m at 25 degrees N in the mouth of the Gulf of California. The larval habitat distribution was related to the geographic variability of dissolved oxygen and water masses between these two latitudes. One recurrent larval habitat, with Bregmaceros bathymaster larvae as the indicator species, extended throughout the water column off Cabo Corrientes from Subtropical Subsurface Water (suboxic conditions) to the surface (220 mu mol/kg). The second recurrent habitat was located between the oxycline (>44 mu mol/kg) and the surface in association with the Gulf of California Water, with Benthosema panamense as the indicator species. During the warm El Nino event of 2015-2016, a tropical larval fish habitat (Auxis spp.) associated with Tropical Surface Water appeared to change the larval habitat distributions. These results indicate that some species are resilient to changes of dissolved oxygen and temperature generated by El Nino events and by continuing deoxygenation, although other species with more limited environmental windows could be affected by deoxygenation, probably leading to a change of the pelagic ecosystem over time.
   Plain Language Summary Dissolved oxygen in the ocean is crucial for the biological cycles of all organisms. There are vast zones in the ocean where the oxygen has dropped to levels that only a few, very well adapted, organisms can live. Dissolved oxygen measurements in the past two decades in the Mexican Pacific have shown that the concentrations have decreased, and water layers with nearly no oxygen are now closer to the surface, potentially impacting larval fish species that are not adapted to extremely low oxygen concentrations. Nevertheless, there is a set of fish larvae that is well adapted to low dissolved oxygen concentrations, principally small forage fish, which have a permanent presence in the poorly oxygenated waters, while some larvae of species with fisheries interest, like small tunids, only live in the well-oxygenated surface layer and are more abundant in warm years. The loss of oxygen in the Mexican Pacific has not had an effect on the small forage fish larvae but can affect those larvae of fish of commercial interest, with less adaptation to low oxygen concentrations.

AB  - Coastal lagoons support intense human activity. Dredging or closing the inlets to regulate water exchanges in order to manage fisheries or improve navigation, prevent floods, reduce pollution or prevent dystrophic crises are among the most frequent management actions.
   Increased social concerns about the Mar Menor have arisen during the last decades due to the speed and magnitude of changes in its water conditions, including eutrophication and the siltation of some of the channels connecting it to the Mediterranean. In response, the idea of opening the inlets in order to increase water exchange and renovation in the lagoon has gradually convinced managers and the public as being a potential solution.
   However, changing the morphology of the inlets does not only involve reducing or diluting nutrients or pollutants or facilitate fish movements, but may also affect the physical-chemical parameters governing the ecosystem, as temperature, that regulates metabolic activity and physiological performance of individuals and hence the biogeographical limits in the distribution of species, or salinity that is considered the key factor that determines species composition in brackish waters.
   In this framework, using a 3D model, we analyse the effect of different scenarios of dredging (up to 1.5 m more than the present depth of the two shallower inlets) on the spatio-temporal patterns in salinity and temperature in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. We also check the ability of a geomorphological index (the openness parameter) to predict the observed changes.
   The magnitude and spatial extent of the impacts are proportional to the magnitude of the dredging activities, but they also depend on the season of the year and on the location of the dredged channels in relation to the main circulatory paths. On average, the salinity ratio can decrease by up to 3.45% with respect to the undisturbed scenario in the most extensive dredging simulation and the yearly average temperature can increase by up to 8.24% in the case of simple maintenance activities. All scenarios show a trend towards a smoothing out of extreme values in environmental conditions and the loss of spatio-temporal heterogeneity at basin scale. Even the most moderate actions can be of biological relevance at a local scale, and may have consequences for the whole lagoon affecting the possibilities of colonization or reproduction by some species and the ecosystem homeostatic regulation capacity. The openness parameter is seen to act as a good indicator of potential impacts of geomorphological alterations of the channels on lagoon salinity and temperature. Coastal lagoons are complex biological systems, and this kind of measure has to be suitably assessed in terms of the induced gain or loss for the functioning of the entire ecosystem.

AB  - The study examined the possibility of using the phytoindication technique to describe habitat preferences of red deer in a relatively homogeneous area. Two alternative hypotheses were tested. Hypothesis 1 suggests that the relationship between red deer and vegetation is due to a trophic factor, so preferences for individual plant species cause vegetation to influence the distribution of animal numbers. Hypothesis 2 suggests that environmental factors influence vegetation, structuring and determining the productive level of the community as a whole. Therefore, environmental factors, rather than individual plant species, cause vegetation-animal interactions. The research was conducted on Biryuchiy Island Spit, where the Azov-Sivash National Nature Park is located. The geobotanical surveys were performed in three types of ecosystems: sandy steppe (vegetation class Festucetea vaginatae), saline meadows (vegetation class Festuco-Puccinellietea), and artificial forest plantation (vegetation class Robinietea). 250 releves were recorded according to the Brown-Blanquet approach. The number of fecal pellets and the number of groups of pellets of red deer was recorded together with geobotanical surveys in the same sample plots. The pellet groups counted in the field were converted to deer densities in specific vegetation classes taking into account the number of pellet groups on the site and the decay rate of the fecal pellets. The vegetation types were distinguished by the number of deer fecal pellets per unit area. The highest number of fecal pellets was found for the plant class Festucetea vaginatae, somewhat fewer fecal pellets were in the plant class Robinietea, and the lowest number was in the plant class Festuco-Puccinellietea. A geometric distribution model is adequate for explaining the experimental data on the number of fecal pellets. A total of 59 species of flowering plants were found. Based on the species composition and projective cover of species, the ecological regimes of ecotopes were identified by phytoindication. The correspondence analysis of the vegetation revealed two ordination axes. The ordination axis 1 (CA1) was able to explain 11.3% of community inertia, and the ordination axis 2 (CA2) was able to explain 5.2% of community inertia. The maximum excretory activity of animals was recorded for the central part of the ordination space, indicating the presence of an optimum zone in the gradient of environmental factors that structure plant communities. The forward selection procedure allowed the Nutrients Availability variable to be selected as the most important variable to explain variation in the plant community structure. The number of deer fecal pellets exhibited different patterns of response in the Nutrients Availability gradient. The response within the plant class Festucetea vaginatae could best be explained by Model III from the list of HOF-models. The response of the excretory activity of deer within the class Festuco-Puccinellietea could best be fitted by the model IV, which represents a symmetric Gaussian curve. The response of excretory activity in the Robinietea vegetation class was asymmetrical bimodal. The ecological properties of the red deer ecological niche in both the drier and less mineralized part of the range of ecological conditions and the wetter and more mineralized part should be assessed in the context of the prospects for future studies.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to test the protectiveness of the bioavailability-normalization procedure, with its associated hazardous concentrations for x% of the species (HCx), that is currently implemented to derive environmental threshold concentrations for nickel (Ni) in European environmental legislative frameworks. We exposed a natural plankton-dominated community to 3 constant Ni concentrations, that is, a control with no Ni added (background Ni of 1.2-4 mu g/L) and the bioavailability-normalized HC5 and HC50 of 24 and 97 mu g dissolved Ni/L, respectively, during a 56-d microcosm experiment under high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) conditions (DOC of 14 mg/L at test initiation). The effects of the bioavailability-normalized HC5 and HC50 values were evaluated at the levels of community structure (community composition and plankton group abundances), community functioning (measured as indirect physicochemical proxies for overnight respiration and carbon fluxes), and individual species abundances. The bioavailability-normalized HC50 treatment had clear effects (defined as effects occurring on at least 2 consecutive sampling days) on both the structure and functioning of the investigated aquatic community. Through its effect on community functioning (i.e., reduced pH and DOC), Ni also influenced its own bioavailability. Clear direct effects of Ni were observed for only 3 species (the Cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. 1 and the rotifers Asplanchna/Testidunela sp. and Trichocerca group similis). Most other effects occurring in the plankton community in the HC50 treatment were indirect and likely driven by the direct effect of Ni on the Cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. 1, which was the dominant phytoplankton species in the control microcosms. In contrast, the bioavailability-normalized HC5 did not induce clear effects on community structure and functioning endpoints: these were only affected on individual sampling days. Clear (direct) effects were observed for only 2 plankton species (the rotifer Trichocerca group similis and the Cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. 1), but their abundances recovered to control levels at the end of the study. In addition, a few species (1 phytoplankton and 3 zooplankton species) were affected in the HC5 treatment only on the last sampling day. It is uncertain whether these species would have shown clear effects over a longer exposure duration. Thus, our study shows that the bioavailability-normalized HC5 of Ni at high DOC induced clear effects on a few individual species. However, the overall conclusion is that the bioavailability-normalized HC5 of Ni as derived through the procedure that is currently implemented in European legislative frameworks protects against clear effects on community structure and function.

KW  - CHANGES IN MICROCLIMATE AND SOIL MEDIUM
AB  - The peatland of Borkovicka blata in the Tabor district is a suitable model study site. There are natural reserves, natural therapeutic source, areas after devastation bark deep harvesting, after surface milling cutting, areas cultivated into meadows, forests and reclaimed after harvesting into meadows, forests and arable land. There are also pyrite fen bogs, areas excessively cut and those with properly finished cutting and preserved peatland character. This is an area of occurrence of quality artesian water with spring flowings and artificial wells. During eight years at this site the effect of the use of felled areas reclaimed into forest, for grasslands and arable land on the changes in some meteorological indicators, hydrosphere, physics, chemistry and soil microbiology. The reserve and derelict land served as a comparative area after exploitation of peat. This contribution gives summaries of some results (except monitoring atmosphere). The results show the disturbance of temperature conditions (of air and soil) on areas after industrial exploitation of peat. Maximum and minimum values show an extension of temperature amplitude compared with original situation. Diurnal and nocturnal temperature amplitude extended. From practical standpoint the reduction in minimum ground air temperatures on felled areas in spring and autumn months is significant. In April reduction is 2.55 degrees C, in May 1.66 degrees C, in September 1.62 degrees C and in October 2.40 degrees C. Soil porosity was most stable in the reserve, followed by area after lodging, forest, meadow and arable land. In the reserve maximum capillary water capacity (MKVK) under reduction in minimum water capacity (MVK). On reclaimed areas porosity decreased due to the effect of MKVK and MVK (the most markedly on the arable land). An increase in the reduced value of bulk density weight corresponds to the development of porosity on reclaimed areas where the ash percentage increased as well. The value of soil reaction did not show any significant changes. On arable land C-ox and C-h values decreased, the highest C-f was found in the reserve. The highest quantity of N-t and N-NH4 was in the reserve, the most N-NO3 was on reclaimed areas. P2O5 and K2O contents increased on reclaimed areas, the most and to the greatest depth in arable land. Raised K2O content reaches greater depths (GO cm) compared with P2O5 (30 cm). Vegetation cover, fertilization and intensive management supported the development of biological activity of soil. Decomposition of cellulose increased also basal respiration. Potential respiration shows a lack of easy-available organic substances (increase after alcohol adding). Physiological groups of microarganisms were evaluated as well. Generally speaking, initial values of biological activity of natural peatland sites are low, reclamation activities and they increase by utilization with time. The greatest stability of sire conditions on forest reclamation was manifested in reclaimed areas. Significant changes in arable land take place during reclamation.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to highlight the problem of using the potential of local territory in the processes of promoting local uniqueness as a consumer product. This study aimed at analysis and appraisal of the recreational resources of Kaniv for the organization of recreational activities in the planning strategies of the city as a recreational and tourist center. The study of the entire set of recreational resources of the city resulted in a constructive analysis and evaluation of the recreational benefits of the city's resources. In the course of the survey, the directions of recreational environmental management in the city were determined in accordance with the programme of development of small Ukrainian cities. The analysis and assessment of the territory's resources was conducted using integrated methodologies of studying recreational assets that take into account the evaluation methods of medical geography, recreology etc. Our study found that geomorphological, climatic, water, biotic, and landscape recreational natural resources are significant for the organization of recreational activity in the city and which, according to the estimation of recreational favourability, are highly conducive and convenient for both winter and summer recreation. A number of indicators of natural resources are of high value for the treatment and prevention of a wide range of diseases, including problems with respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous systems. The development of recreation and tourism in the city is also influenced by the existing historical and cultural resources, which include a whole set of archaeological, architectural and historical monuments, ethnographic features and crafts, museums and exhibitions, places and areas of significant events, places of life and creativity for prominent personalities, heroes and figures, etc. The socioeconomic resources and infrastructure of the city have a significant impact on the functioning of the recreational affairs, such as the state of the existing and prospective territorial organization, transport accessibility and level of its development, the public service and its condition (food establishments, residence, etc.). Nowadays, Kaniv is characterized by partly lower indicators of socio-economic development, business activity and, at the same time, enjoys a powerful natural, recreational and tourist, historical and cultural potential. Development of recreational and tourist activity in the city should be considered as a tool for increasing economic indicators (employment, business activity and growth of its financial indicators) and improvement of demographic indicators (reduction of labour migration, etc.), etc. The natural and cultural heritage of Kaniv is a source of socio-economic and human development through the integration of cultural monuments into the national tourist network. This can be achieved through the creation of new museum programmes, the development of a network of establishments based on authentic cuisine, traditional interiors, etc. It can further be promoted through creation of a network of ecological trails and routes which give access to the area's unique natural ecosystems. Recreation and tourist activity can also be encouraged through popularization of environmental affairs, creation of programmes for development of the resort business, programmes of family recreation, development of different types of water, hiking, educational (culture, events, research, etc.
   ) and eco-tourism, and the development of programmes and events in the field of sport fishing and hunting.

KW  - air pollution
KW  - ecological offences
KW  - criminal liability
KW  - administrative liability
AB  - Provisions of the criminal and administrative laws of the Russian Federation on liability for air pollution are analyzed in the article using the formal-legal method. It is noted that these provisions contain shortcomings of both sectoral (related to criminal or administrative law separately) and intersectoral (affecting the two mentioned branches of law) nature. Among the sectoral shortcomings, the authors single out, above all, the excessive generalization of the wording of the disposition of Article 251 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, in accordance with which criminal liability should follow any air pollution in violation of the pollutants emission rules, regardless of the amount of such pollution and the scale of damage. In addition, the authors stress that only the actual infliction of harm is criminal in accordance with Article 251 of the RF Criminal Code (the accomplished fact of air pollution). At the same time, Article 247 of Chapter 26 of the RF Criminal Code (Violation of the Rules for Dealing with Environmentally Hazardous Substances and Waste) shows a different, more appropriate (in the authors' opinion) approach to establishing responsibility for an environmental crime: liability is provided for both real harm and the threat of causing harm. The authors state that fixing liability for creating the threat of harm in Article 251 of the RF Criminal Code would strengthen the precautionary significance of this provision. At the intersectoral level, the authors note that the dispositions of articles that establish liability for air pollution (Article 251 of the RF Criminal Code and Article 8.21 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation) are confusingly similar: there are no clear criteria in the laws to classify an environmental offense that caused harm to atmospheric air as an administrative or a criminal offense, unless an offense is associated with harm to human health or life. The consequence of this confusion is the inconsistency of judicial practice, the analysis of which showed that actions that resemble in composition can be classified both as criminal and administrative offenses; the former in practice are of an insignificant number (1-2 sentences under Article 251 of the RF Criminal Code per year). Attention is drawn to the measures of punishments imposed for the commission of such offenses - the fine under Article 8.21 of the RF Code of Administrative Offenses may be multiple times more than the fine under Article 251 of the RF Criminal Code. At the same time, the authors note that fines under the RF Code of Administrative Offenses are imposed, first of all, on legal entities, while fines imposed on individuals are generally consistent with "criminal" ones. Based on the conducted research, the authors propose to clarify at the legislative level the quality of atmospheric air indicators, which are necessary for assessing the conditions of the environment, disclosing the harm fact and determining its characteristics. Taking into account such indicators, it is advisable to form a methodology for assessing real harm (including social harm) from air pollution using an ecosystem approach, and it is this methodology that should underlie the differentiation of liability for the commission of any environmental offense.

AB  - Western Atlantic-Caribbean region preserves the longest (some 50 million years) and most diverse fossil record of the mammalian order Sirenia in the world. Sirenians are aquatic herbivores; in marine waters, they eat mainly seagrasses (Hydrocharitaceae and Potamogetonaceae). Though the fossil record of seagrasses and other marine macrophytes is meager, we can use it together with that of sirenians to frame interesting hypotheses about marine plant evolution, and speculate about the nature and dynamics of the Caribbean seagrass ecosystem during the ages when (unlike today) it was dominated by diverse large mammalian herbivores. In this synthesis, I define the aquatic megaherbivore adaptive zone, and identify those of its ecological dimensions that are likely to have been most critical in feeding-niche partitioning among fossil sirenians. Possible morphological indicators of such partitioning are specified for each of these dimensions, using data on functional anatomy and ecology of living sirenians. Faunal lists of Caribbean sirenians (including unpublished taxonomic and morphological data) show what suites of species have occurred sympatrically at different times during the Cenozoic. Based on cranial morphology, I suggest how these herbivores most probably partitioned their resources. This makes it possible to follow the history of individual feeding niches within the sirenian guild through geological time, and, in turn, to speculatively reconstruct gross aspects of Caribbean seagrass communities and their changes through time. Eocene Caribbean sirenian faunas included prorastomids, protosirenids, and early dugongids. These were diverse in both locomotor and feeding adaptations, ranging from amphibious to fully aquatic forms and from selective browsers to incipiently indiscriminate grazers. Eocene Caribbean seagrass communities were already essentially modern in aspect, but included a greater diversity of species with mid-sized to large rhizomes. Oligocene faunas comprised as many as six apparently sympatric species. These included only dugongids, but were differentiated into halitheriines (generalized feeders on seagrass leaves and smaller rhizomes, or specialists on leaves) and dugongines (specialists on larger rhizomes). Miocene faunas of marine sirenians continued the Oligocene pattern. In freshwater habitats of South America, trichechids appeared in the record and adapted to an increase in abundance of fibrous, abrasive aquatic grasses (Gramineae). Pliocene marine sirenian faunas in the Caribbean consist only of dugongine dugongids, plus a trichechid species which evidently extended its range to North America. The dugongines most specialized for eating large rhizomes apparently died out during this epoch. Pleistocene and Recent faunas comprise only trichechids (manatees). Large-tusked dugongines probably acted as "keystone species", disrupting climax seagrass communities and thereby increasing their productivity and diversity (including sirenian diversity). Under these conditions (which prevailed up to about 2-3 Ma), most primary productivity was presumably consumed by herbivores, in contrast to the detritus-based seagrass ecosystems of today, which include few if any large herbivores. Pliocene oceanographic changes following closure of the Central American Seaway probably led to the collapse of this diverse system, causing extinction of several large, "climax" seagrass species and producing the florally and faunally depauperate seagrass communities of the present-day Caribbean.
   The resulting "vacuum" in marine sirenian niches may have enabled manatees to spread from South America into the Caribbean and North America, as well as West Africa. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is largely based on the establishment of environmental targets and associated proxies to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES), a full suite of ecological indicators for all the ecosystem components is not currently available for ongoing assessment and regular update of GES targets. This is because effective indicators and management actions aimed at preserving/rebuilding marine biodiversity should be found from the knowledge of the spatial distribution of target species and extension of critical habitats as well as their overlapping with human activities, pressure and impacts. In this regard, the spatial distributions of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba and the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea) were investigated by means of a generalized additive model (GAM) and a Random Forest (RF) based on sighting data collected during standardized vessel based surveys carried out from 2009 to 2015. Eight predictive variables were considered, taking into account both the local physiographic features and human activities existing in the investigated area, suggesting an innovative approach to habitat modeling. In particular, the explanatory variables depth, distance from industrial areas and distance from the coast proved to significantly influence the distribution of both dolphin species. In addition, the distribution of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus were also significantly shaped by the distance from the navy exercise areas and the fishing areas, respectively. On the contrary, the slope and the distance from the main commercial routes never provided any significant influence. The reliability of GAM and RF models in predicting the spatial distribution of both dolphins was tested by applying the Youden Index method to the ROC curves. The RF model allowed the projection of the expected presence/absence pattern of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus to produce the preference habitat versus non habitat map. In particular, the RF model predicted that the striped dolphin is widely present in the central and deeper part of the Gulf of Taranto. In contrast, the common bottlenose dolphin seems to be mainly distributed along the coasts in both the eastern and western sector of the basin. A clear overlapping of the preference habitats estimated for S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus is shown north of Punta Alice and in front of Policoro as well as offshore from Ugento in the eastern and western parts of the investigated area, respectively. Finally, the critical habitats of S. coeruleoalba and T. truncatus are the outcome of both the influence of environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressures presently occurring in the Gulf of Taranto, basically indicating the need for conservation measures, especially considering that the area is expected to be considered for hydrocarbon prospecting. These results contribute to setting up a baseline reference for future assessment of environmental marine disturbances using cetaceans, which are considered a key group in the MSFD, as an ecological indicator.

AB  - Worldwide, the role of farmlands for biodiversity conservation and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services has been widely acknowledged. In the European Union (EU), societal demands to include environmental conservation concerns within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have resulted in the recognition of the importance of maintaining High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf).
   HNVf constitute complex social-ecological systems, which owe their nature conservation value to the maintenance of specific, mostly low-intensity farming systems, supporting high levels of species and habitats dependent on agricultural practices. Even though HNVf assessment in space and time is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of Rural Development Programmes, the diversity of rural landscapes across EU, the scarcity of data on farming systems, and the lack of common methodological guidelines has hampered the implementation of HNVf mapping and monitoring across Europe. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and test methodological approaches that may support HNVf assessment across the EU.
   The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) which is mandatory for all EU Member States constitutes a system for the management and control of CAP payments to farmers. Essentially, IACS comprises high-resolution, spatially explicit information on the type and intensity of agricultural land-use. Even though such data exhibits high thematic, spatial and temporal resolution, IACS has seldom been used, due to significant access restrictions. Here, the potential to use IACS data to support the assessment of HNVf was evaluated within the German Federal State of Lower Saxony by implementing a recently developed methodological framework. Sets of indicators known to be essential for identifying potential HNVf and underlying farming systems (expressing landscape structure and composition, farming systems, and crop diversity), were derived from IACS. Spatial patterns of indicators were analyzed at two different scales to delineate the potential distribution of HNVf across Lower Saxony.
   Results highlighted that most regions in Lower Saxony were characterized by intensive farming practices including high livestock density, high share of intensive crops and low density of linear elements. Only 3% of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) of Lower Saxony potentially constituted HNVf, with the majority of HNVf coinciding with mosaics of arable and/or permanent crops and semi-natural features under less intensive farming practices. Semi-natural grasslands, partially under agri-environment scheme management contracts, covered roughly 1% of the UAA and were mostly intermingled with other farmland habitats in extensively managed agricultural landscapes.
   In the context of the EU-wide HNVf assessment, IACS constitutes an important source of data, characterized by a high spatial, thematic and temporal resolution of data collected annually. Whilst having the potential for use in HNVf assessment, some challenges remain, especially due to significant access restrictions. Nevertheless, IACS constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate the extent and condition of HNVf across the EU countryside. Making use of LACS data in such a way could provide a stepping-stone towards achieving a more effective balance between the management and control of CAP support payments and the growing societal demands related to the maintenance and enhancement of farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - The bridge is damaged under the long-term traffic load, climate and geological conditions, which may lead to serious traffic interruption and economic loss. This study presents an integrated measurement technique in conjunction with a multi-index correlative evaluation approach for structural condition assessment of bridges. Using a typical highway bridge in China as a case study, the concrete strength, thickness of bridge deck pavement, thickness of the bottom plate of the hollow plate, crack development, cover thickness of steel bars etc. were systematically monitored. Most importantly, a series of static load tests were conducted and the results were analysed using a developed multi-index correlative evaluation model to assess the current structural capacity of the bridge. The results show that comprehensive measurements and the multi-index correlative evaluation approach provide an effective means for structural health monitoring of bridges, and can provide theoretical basis for the highway bridge monitoring under similar complicated environmental conditions.

AB  - In order to study the extraction process and antioxidative activity of Inonotus obliquus polyphenols (IOP), the optimal extraction process was determined by orthogonal experiment optimization. The clearance rate of DPPH and hydroxyl radicals were used as indicators to evaluate the antioxidant activity of IOP. The results showed that the optimum extraction conditions were as follows: ethanol concentration of 50%, solid-liquid ratio of 1:20, temperature of 60 degrees C, and 90 min. Under these conditions, the extraction yield of IOP was 2.84%. The antioxidant capacity of extracts appeared to be IOP dose-dependent, while it also presented stronger ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-MS) analysis indicated that the major identified polyphenol compounds extracted at the optimal conditions were ten compounds (procyanidin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, astilbin, tangeretin, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and catechin 7-xyloside). These findings indicate that I. obliquus polyphenols have the potential to be developed as a natural antioxidant and have a good application prospect.

AB  - Tuff gives the Una River its distinct type of flow, unique in the world. In the clear blue water of the Una River, tuff has formed many dams with overflows and waterfalls. Its universality and uniqueness was recognized by a Roman legionary who was so overwhelmed when he reached the river that he said Una, meaning one and only in Latin. Tuff waterfalls on the Una were a decisive and indicatory factor in the 2008 assignation of the upper basin of the Una as a national park of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This article discusses the genesis and evolution of tuff cascades occurring in physical-geographic conditions determined by specific elements, the most important of which are the carbonate geological base, water temperature, pH value, water clarity, presence of tuff forming plants in the river water, etc.. Because of that, all physical-geographic conditions in the Una basin must have a strict natural development regime with strict protection measures for the individual elements and the total complex.

AB  - This paper focuses on the study of heavy metals' remobilisation possibilities and changes of distribution coefficients leading to remobilisation in a stream as a result of changing conditions caused by urban drainage. The paper also reports consequent changes of bioaccumulation coefficient for different species of the benthic community, which seems to be the best indicator of aquatic community quality in small urban streams. The paper presents results obtained during field monitoring as well as results obtained during laboratory experiment. The field monitoring identified in the study area (the Botic Creek) three heavy metals (Cu, Zn and Pb), which are the main sources of toxicological risk in this area. Based on the monitoring, these elements were used for laboratory experiment, where their behaviour during changing conditions was studied. The experiment shows that changing conditions in the stream, caused by urban drainage, significantly impact the fate of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems and that these elements have different preferences to bind to a particular geochemical fraction of sediment, which consequently means different bioavailability.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) reflects small, random deviations from symmetry in otherwise bilaterally symmetrical characteristics and has been used to detect harmful conditions such as environmental and genomic stress in growing animals and humans. Teeth are often used for measuring FA, especially in humans. The aim of the present study was to measure FA in teeth as a possible stress indicator in laboratory rats. Rats housed individually or on a grid floor were compared to rats housed on bedding with or without environmental enrichment. FA of leg traits had been found to increase by housing on a grid floor or individually as compared to housing on bedding and socially. In this study dental FA was found not to be influenced by housing conditions, probably because wear may influence FA of the teeth independent of housing conditions. Incisors in rodents grow continuously throughout life, whereas this growth stops in adult humans. The conclusion of this study is that FA measurements of teeth do not appear suitable as parameters to evaluate stress in rats.

AB  - The expediency of transportation on the TRANS-Siberian railway is not in doubt for any of our contemporaries now, and its importance for development of Siberia and the Far East is quite obvious. However, this attitude to this transport artery was not formed immediately. Let us recall at least the fact that the Tomsk merchant class insisted that the road passed through Aleksandrovsk (now Novosibirsk). The decision of Tsar Alexander III on construction of the railway played crucial role. The built road contributed to the development of the cities through which it was laid. The situation with the decision on organization of the free movement from the mainland to Sakhalin seems to us similar to the one that was in front of laying of the line across Siberia. The issue will have to be addressed sooner or later. The laying of the highway to the island will give a powerful impetus to the social and economic development of the territories adjacent to the road and railway, which will pass through the bridge. In this article, we research specifics of climatic and hydrological factors that determine choice of type of hydraulic structures in the Nevelskogo Strait.
   The relevance of the research is dictated by the need for comprehensive review of the conditions that determine the choice of the Tatar Strait crossing line by the bridge. After taking into account the influence of geological and geomorphological factors, we turn our attention to climatic, weather and hydrological processes that will have a permanent impact on construction and operation.
   The aim of the research is to link together and analyze the data that characterize features of atmospheric and hydrosphere processes in narrow part of the Tatar Strait and conduct scientific research that will complement for engineering research and help identify based on simulation safest opening for construction of hydro-technical utilities that will connect opposite banks.
   Materials and methods. The materials for the study were cartographic materials, data of remote sensing of the Earth, information on climatic and weather conditions, data of hydrological, meteorological, Oceanographic observations, information obtained as a result of research works and engineering surveys in which the authors participated, as well as information from literary sources. Mapping in the geographic information environment allowed creating thematic maps reflecting the dynamics of hydrometeorological processes. The obtained information was used in construction of models of water circulation, formation and degradation of ice cover in the Nevelskoy Strait with the use of geoinformation technologies. The authors took a direct part in research of the leading line "Novy" in 2001. As result of the research of the features of hydrometeorological conditions within the water area of the Nevelskogo Strait and its coasts, based on satellite monitoring data, observations at nearby weather stations, as well as confirmed by information obtained during engineering surveys, it was found that in area of the Nevelskoy Strait, adverse natural phenomena should be taken into account when choosing technical design solutions for selecting type of bridge or tunnel construction from mainland to Sakhalin. The spatial and temporal distribution of radiance in the area is due to astronomical reasons, decrease in duration of the sunshine in De-Kastri and Pogibi compared to Nikolaevsk-on-Amur is associated with frequent fogs that occur during atmospheric processes on border of land and sea. Extreme values of air temperature in Pogibi were registered at the Pogibi weather station - maximum of 27,3 degrees C and a minimum of -44,0 degrees C. Index of continentality is very high (amplitude - 71,3 degrees C), which can be explained by the influence of air masses removal from mainland in winter period. The important indicator for projecting - duration of frost-free period-ranges in Pogibi from 88 to 186 days (average - 137). Daily precipitation totals during warm period reached maximum values of 88 mm in October, 81 mm in August, and 78 mm in July. Snow cover in Pogibi lasts from 153 to 216 days. Winds of >= 30 m/s occur annually in spring and autumn, sometimes exceeding 40 m/s. Fogs in described area are observed throughout year. Snowstorms in strait and on its coastal are very common. Any increase in wind in winter is accompanied by blizzard transfer of snow. Thunderstorms occur 4-5 times a year. Dust storms are rare. Horizontal water circulation in the Northern part of strait is anticyclical in winter, and cyclonic circulation is active from May to September. In general, in spring water movement speed on surface is 2-7 cm/s and in summer it decreases to 1-4 cm/s. Changes in sea level in the Tatar Strait are in the range of 3,2-4,0 m. Duration of ice period at time moderate types of winters is 201 days. Collar ice in Pogibi in late March - early April averages 160 cm and varies from 119 to 190 cm depending on type of winter. Due to the strong tidal currents, the solid ice cover in channel of the middle part of strait is formed very rarely and on short time. The result of the increased ice cover dynamics is multiple layers of young ice up to 30 cm thick. Coastals in southern part of Strait are resistant to abrasion processes and practically do not collapse. The area enclosed between liding lines Lazarev cape - cape Pogibi in the North and cape South - cape Tyk - in the South has the most favorable conditions for the construction of bridge.
   Climatic and hydrological conditions throughout have relative similarity, which allowed us distinguish it when zoning as independent unit. The performed research allows us give an advantage to leading line "Novy" (cape Nevelskogo - cape Lakh).

AB  - The determination of the function of cells in zero-gravity conditions is a subject of interest in many different research fields. Due to their metabolic unicity, the characterization of the behaviour of erythrocytes maintained in prolonged microgravity conditions is of particular importance. Here, we used a 3D-clinostat to assess the microgravity-induced modifications of the structure and function of these cells, by investigating how they translate these peculiar mechanical stimuli into modifications, with potential clinical interest, of the biochemical pathways and the aging processes. We compared the erythrocyte's structural parameters and selected metabolic indicators that are characteristic of the aging in microgravity and standard static incubation conditions. The results suggest that, at first, human erythrocytes react to external stimuli by adapting their metabolic patterns and the rate of consumption of the cell resources. On longer timeframes, the cells translate even small differences in the environment mechanical solicitations into structural and morphologic features, leading to distinctive morphological patterns of aging.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to monitor the effect of the length of environmental exposure of faeces on the content of nitrogen and diaminopimelic acid. We used samples of the droppings of wild red deer and examined them for the content of N and DAPA upon exposure to field conditions for 0-7 days during the growing season and for 0-30 days in winter, and after a year of storage in dried and frozen state. In relation to nitrogen level, there were no differences between the samples of fresh droppings and those after different lengths of exposure to ambient conditions before analysis and no differences between fresh and stored samples. As to DAPA level, there were no differences between the samples of fresh droppings and those after exposure. Nitrogen and DAPA levels in the droppings were stable and can be measured in both fresh samples and samples that have been exposed to ambient conditions for one week in summer or one month in winter.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations shape biofilm formation in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) and therefore distributed water quality. Yet the comprehensive performance in response to complex environmental conditions remains unclear. We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.

AB  - Dominant species play key roles in shaping community structure, but their behavior is far from uniform. We speculated that recognition of different behaviors (determined objectively) would be an indicator of the condition of plant communities. We developed a species dominance index (SDI) to identify dominant species and compare their behavior across multiple spatial scales. The SDI is based on three attributes (mean cover, mean species suppression, and tendency toward high cover), and it identifies up to 38 dominants within 74 Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Dichotomizing each of the attributes in a 2x2x2 matrix produced seven dominant behaviors, or forms, all of which occurred in Great Lakes wetlands. Species showed different dominant forms among locations and aggregation scales. Showing predominantly "monotype" form, invasive Typha was the taxon that was most often dominant in the samples. By quantitatively measuring dominance and describing dominance form, SDI can add insight into community change and is a useful addition to indicators of community condition.

AB  - A 40-day trial was performed to evaluate the effect of short-term natural fresh food (FF) supplementation 20 days prior to ablation in Litopenaeus vannamei broodstock raised under biofloc conditions. Changes in biochemical composition and fatty acids profile were used as indicators of nutritional condition. Females that received FF supplementation (FLOC + FF) achieved better eggs production, spawned more promptly, and presented higher levels of HUFA in eggs as compared to those that did not received FF (FLOC). Proximate analysis of biofloc and microorganisms assessment showed a higher crude protein and lipid content in the FLOC + FF treatment (26.3 and 0.7 %) compared to FLOC treatment (18.4 and 0.3 %) and also demonstrated a higher concentration of filamentous cyanobacteria and nematodes. The better outcomes obtained in females that received short-term FF supplementation justified the FF use in L. vannamei broodstock.

AB  - From a Middle Weichselian sediment sequence in the opencast brown coal mine of Reichwalde (eastern Germany), a similar to 40cm thick thermokarst gyttja deposit has been sampled. The AMS C-14 dates, although at the limit of detection, indicate an early Middle Weichselian age of the gyttja. Pollen, botanical, and zoological (e.g. chironomids) macroremains have been analyzed. Botanical and chironomid taxa indicate warm climatic conditions in the bottom part of the sequence. For this lower part the botanical data suggest a minimum mean July temperature of 12-14 degrees C. Following this, a cooling is indicated, coinciding with an increased clastic deposition in the lake. A return to permafrost conditions is reconstructed for the upper part of the sequence. The combined evidence strongly suggests a degradation of permafrost due to increased warming in response to a D/O event as a forcing factor for the thermokarst lake formation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An infilled wetland located behind coastal dunes in north-east Northland is used to reconstruct a local history of environmental change spanning early Holocene (c. 7000 yr BP) to modem time. Proxy indicators (sediment texture, diatoms and pollen) provide evidence for a transition from marginal marine- to brackish- to freshwater-conditions in the wetland. Radiocarbon ages constrain the chronology of this succession to 7880-7430 cal. yr BP for the early period of marine conditions, 3570-3210 cal. yr BP for the latter brackish phase and 1060-800 cal. yr BP for the change to freshwater conditions. Within this succession, the diatom record preserves a strong brackish signal at core depths above the limit of the modem tidal range. This is presented as preliminary evidence for a mid-Holocene sea level highstand for northern New Zealand of approximately 1.2 m above present mean sea level.

AB  - Within the current concern about the inequalities in the settlement process of migrants in cities, this paper uses a quantitative methodological approach that addresses the characteristics of their dwellings and types of habitat or urban environments to analyze the socio-housing conditions of those coming from neighboring countries and Peru who are currently living in the city of Buenos Aires. To this end, this research uses data released by the 2010 National Population and Housing Census, develops statistical indicators that take account of relevant issues and implements a typological model that classifies the spatial units that make up the city into different types of habitat according to construction periods and the production of housing spaces. It is observed that an important number of regional migrants in Buenos Aires are affected by housing deficit and/or should resort to informal means of land access, thus revealing an urban structure that segregates certain social groups and a process marked by the violation of the rights of a large segment of the population.

AB  - The comparative accumulation and depuration processes for several microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and MS-2 coliphage) by the striped venus, Chamelea gallina, under controlled laboratory conditions were studied.  Microorganisms accumulated rapidly in bivalves during the first 6 h, with accumulation rates between 3.2 to 360.5 organisms/h depending on the type of microorganism.  The relative patterns and rates of elimination of the microorganisms suggest that they are eliminated from shellfish in two different ways.  One is of a mechanical nature that results in microbial elimination during the first 12 h.  The other elimination mechanism depends upon the microbial species and their accumulated number.  All microorganisms tested were eliminated completely by the molluscs after 3 d of depuration, except MS-2 bacteriophages.  Results indicate that MS-2 coliphages may be a more reliable indicator of the microbial depuration efficiency by the shellfish under laboratory conditions than E. coli.

AB  - The metazoan parasitic fauna of Pygocentrus nattereri collected in different phases of hydrologic cycle of Piranha lake was studied during the year of 2007. The study area is located in gas pipeline Coari-Manaus construction zone, near the municipality of Manacapuru-Am. The relationship between condition factor and parasite occurrence and the viability of use the parasitic fauna as an environmental bio-indicator were verified. The following Monogenoidea were collected: Amphithecium microphalum, Amphitecium brachycirrum, Amphitecium calycinum, Amphithecium catalaoensis, Amphithecium junki, Pithanothecium amazonensis e Rhinoxenus piranhus, as well as the nematode Procamallanus inopinatus, the copepod Miracetyma sp. and the isopod Anphira branchialis. There was not significant correlation between the parasite occurrence and the condition factor. There were significant variances in the parasitic index according to the different periods of hydrologic cycle and P. nattereri has achieved the conditions described in the literature to be select a fish-host and his parasite fauna as biomonitor.

AB  - In Lake Neuchatel (Switzerland), total phosphorus concentrations in the water have decreased from 45 mg/m(3) in 1982 to 13 mg/m(3) in 1999. The response of oligochaete and chironomid communities to this improvement was studied at a depth of 40 m in 1992, 1997, and 2000. As expected, total biomass of zoobenthos decreased between 1992 et 2000. But the percentage of individuals belonging to species indicative of oligotrophic conditions (Stylodrilus heringianus, Spirosperma velutinus and Micropsectra) decreased from 33% in 1992 to 20% in 2000 instead of increasing to 48%, as predicted from the decrease of phosphorus concentrations. In the same time, the abundance of species indicative of mesotrophic conditions (Potamothrix vejdovskyi and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri mostly) increased whereas that of species indicative of eutrophic conditions (Potamothrix hammoniensis and Tubifex tubifex) was unchanged. These anomalous responses could indicate either a restoration going astray for natural reasons or the presence in the sediment of pollutants (such as pesticides), inhibiting the reproduction of the less tolerant species.

AB  - The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity identified the ferric sulphate mineral jarosite and possible relicts of gypsum at the Meridiani Planum landing site(1). On Earth, jarosite has been found to form in acid mine drainage environments, during the oxidation of sulphide minerals(2), and during alteration of volcanic rocks by acidic, sulphur-rich fluids near volcanic vents(3). Jarosite formation is thus thought to require a wet, oxidizing and acidic environment. But jarosite on Earth only persists over geologically relevant time periods in arid environments because it rapidly decomposes to produce ferric oxyhydroxides in more humid climates(4). Here we present equilibrium thermodynamic reaction-path simulations that constrain the range of possible conditions under which such aqueous alteration phases are likely to have formed on Mars. These calculations simulate the chemical weathering of basalt at relevant martian conditions. We conclude that the presence of jarosite combined with residual basalt at Meridiani Planum indicates that the alteration process did not proceed to completion, and that following jarosite formation, arid conditions must have prevailed.

AB  - Taphonomic aspects of dense deposits of Littoridina australis (d'Orbigny) and Littoridina parchappii (d'Orbigny), from a Holocene outcrop located at the Quequen Grande river, were used as paleobiological and paleoenvironmental indicators to reconstruct the evolution of the estuarine environment between circa 7,000 and 5,000 C-14 yr BP. Levels with dominance of Littoridina parchappii correspond to autochtonous fossil assemblages deposited under low energy estuarine conditions. On the other hand, most specimens of Littoridina australis were redeposited and represent transported assemblages. The differences shown by both species are probably related to the energy conditions of the environments where they lived. As Littoridina parchappii is part of a fossil population, it can be considered a good paleobiological and paleoenvironmental indicator whereas Littoridina australis, which basically belongs to a taphocoenosis, can be a useful tool to evaluate both paleoenvironmental and depositional conditions such as the relative energy and direction of the dominant currents.

AB  - The growth and survival of ten hardwood tree species, planted in abandoned fields in southern Quebec, over a range of soil and geological conditions, were analyzed in order to identify optimal site conditions for species growth. From a total of 23 experimental blocks, in which a total of 5750 seedlings was planted, we described six different soil types based on a cluster analysis of 12 soil variables. Factorial analysis linked species growth, in height and diameter, to gradients of soil nutrient richness and soil moisture. A statistical indicator of the degree of specificity of species toward soil variables was obtained by Kaiser's measure of sampling adequacy (Kaiser, 1970. Little jiffy, mark IV. Educational and Psychological Measurement 34, 111-117). After four growing seasons, heights of red ash, red oak and bur oak are markedly different among soil types, Best red ash growth occurred on the most nutrient-rich and humid soils, as opposed to red oak whose best growth occurred at the nutrient-poor and dry endpoints of the edaphic gradients. Bur oak differs from red oak in having good growth over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. Sugar maple growth was best on well drained and relatively nutrient-rich soils, but had high within-site variability. Yellow birch, with a low overall survival, attained its best growth in the most nutrient-poor, as well as above-average soil moisture conditions. The optimal edaphic conditions are weakly defined in the case of bitternut hickory and black walnut, the largest size of which was attained in below-average and in better-than-average soil nutrient conditions respectively. Silver maple performed equally well on the majority of soil types, but achieved exceptional growth on the wettest soil type. White ash and butternut growth also suggest a wide ecological amplitude, the first having good growth and the second having slow growth on all soil types. A synthesis of the experimental results is presented as a decisional chart for silviculturalists. Soil texture, moisture and pH are ordered according to their potential for the optimal growth of species. Identified geological, geomorphologic and pedological site constraints on species growth must be considered in the species selection process, especially for species which attain their best growth in narrower segments of the edaphic gradients.

AB  - Producer gas from biomass gasification contains impurities like tars, particles, alkali salts, and sulfur/nitrogen compounds. As a result, a number of process steps are required to condition the producer gas before utilization as a syngas and further upgrading to final chemicals and fuels. Here, we study the concept of using molten carbonate electrolysis cells (MCEC) both to clean and to condition the composition of a raw syngas stream, from biomass gasification, for further upgrading into synthetic natural gas (SNG). A mathematical MCEC model is used to analyze the impact of operational parameters, such as current density, pressure and temperature, on the quality and amount of syngas produced. Internal rate of return (IRR) is evaluated as an economic indicator of the processes considered. Results indicate that, depending on process configuration, the production of SNG can be boosted by approximately 50-60% without the need of an additional carbon source, i.e., for the same biomass input as in standalone operation of the GoBi-Gas plant.

AB  - The ability to predict regular events can be adaptive for nonhuman animals living in an otherwise unpredictable environment. Animals may exhibit behavioral changes preceding a predictable event; such changes reflect anticipatory behavior. Anticipatory behavior is broadly defined as a goal-directed increase in activity preceding a predictable event and can be useful for assessing well being in animals in captivity. Anticipation may look different in different animals, however, necessitating methods to generate and study anticipatory behaviors across species. This article includes a proposed method for generating and describing anticipatory behavior in zoos using behavioral conditioning. The article also includes discussion of case studies of the proposed method with 2 animals at the San Francisco Zoo: a silverback gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a red panda (Ailurus fulgens). The study evidence supports anticipation in both animals. As behavioral conditioning can be used with many animals, the proposed method provides a practical approach for using anticipatory behavior to assess animal well being in zoos.

AB  - The temperature of body tissues is viewed as an indicator of tissue response in clinical applications since ancient times. The tissue temperature depends on various physical and physiological parameters like blood flow, metabolic heat generation, thermal conductivity of tissues, shape and size of organs etc. In this paper a finite element model has been proposed to study temperature distribution in skin and deep tissues of human limbs. The geometry of human limb is taken as elliptical tapered shape. It is assumed that outer surface of the limb is exposed to the environment. The appropriate boundary conditions have been framed based on physical conditions of the problem. The model has been developed for a three dimensional steady state case. Hexahedral circular sectoral elements are used to discretize the region. The results have been computed to obtain temperature profiles and study the relation of tissue temperature with the parameters like atmospheric temperature, rate of evaporation, thickness of tissues layers and shape of the limb.

AB  - The aim of the article is to illuminate the modern paradigm of the globalization economic environment, which shows the gradual end of the decade of "crisis-free" growth of the world economy and, accordingly, the nearing to the next global economic crisis; to cover the importance of attracting investment and implementing a specific national industrial policy as one of the key factors of development; to outline the problems of prevention, forecasting and analysis of risks arising in the investment sphere in the context of providing conditions for sustainable development of the Ukrainian economy. The subject of the study is: the monitoring of investment sector indicators that determine the potential of economic development and provide an analytical assessment of the risks posed in the investment sphere in the context of ensuring the conditions of sustainable development of the Ukrainian economy. Methodology. The article uses the complex approach with the application of methods of simulation and econometric modeling for analytical estimation of gross fixed capital formation as a key investment indicator in the current economic conditions of Ukraine. Results. The conducted study clearly demonstrates not only the presence but also the obvious deepening of the imbalance between the current state of attracting foreign investments and actual needs in technological and physical renewal of the production sphere. The consequence is a real threat of loss of potential for economic development. Some measures have been identified to improve the investment climate, and the key ones are the provision of state support for reforming the Ukrainian economy in terms of improving the investment climate and stimulating the innovative potential of entrepreneurial activity. The practical implications of this study are to identify the lack of innovation strategy, which deepens Ukraine's technological backwardness compared to developed countries in general, and the EU countries, in particular, and keeps the inefficient and destructive natural-production base of Ukrainian economy. Value/originality. This research was carried out within the framework of the implementation of a scientific paper of the Department of Theoretical and Applied Economics of National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (No. 0112U007817) on the topic: "Globalization of industrial capacity formation trends in the terms of post-industrial transformation".

AB  - Total 246 lines from southern China were subjected to treatments under natural conditions for 4 years and artificial aging under high temperature (45 degrees C) and high humidity (95% RH) for 5 days. Seed vigor measured by the germination rate (GR), normal seedling rate (NSR), full seedling length (FSL), seedling shoot length (SSL) and seedling root length (SRL). The significant decrease was observed in the five traits with high heritability and variation. Correlation coefficients among the five traits were highly significant (r>0.700) and significant correlation of these indicators between two treatments was also found with the highest r values of 0.405 for GR. Only seed protein content had weak significant positive correlation with FSL and SSL. According to the grading standard, there were five categories: high tolerance, tolerance, middle tolerance, sensitivity and high sensitivity. 12 lines with good tolerance level were identified, and will be utilized in future breeding programs to improve seed longevity in soybean.

AB  - In this article employment quality in the EU27 is investigated by means of a typological approach, based on several features of the employment conditions and relations characterising jobs. The analyses are drawing on data from the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey. Results of Latent Class Cluster Analyses show that it is empirically and theoretically possible to reduce a multitude of factors determining the quality of employment into five different types of jobs regarding their employment quality: SER-like jobs, instrumental jobs, precarious unsustainable jobs, precarious intensive jobs and portfolio jobs. These five types of jobs are strongly related with important covariates such as the socio-demographic profile of workers, organisation level features and indicators of the intrinsic nature of work tasks. Moreover, they are clearly distributed differently between countries within the EU27. The findings from this innovative approach towards the quality of employment are discussed in terms of the implications for the measurement of contemporary employment arrangements in Europe.

AB  - This study explores how plasticity in biochemical attributes, used as indicators of health and condition, enables the coral Acropora tenuis to respond to differing water quality regimes in inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef. Health attributes were monitored along a strong and weak water quality gradient, each with three reefs at increasing distances from a major river source. Attributes differed significantly only along the strong gradient; corals grew fastest, had the least dense skeletons, highest symbiont densities and highest lipid concentrations closest to the river mouth, where water quality was poorest. High nutrient and particulate loads were only detrimental to skeletal density, which decreased as linear extension increased, highlighting a trade-off. Our study underscores the importance of assessing multiple health attributes in coral reef monitoring. For example, autotrophic indices are poor indicators of coral health and condition, but improve when combined with attributes like lipid content and biomass.

AB  - When using mathematical models in work accident studies, rigorous improvement actions may be established in the plans for prevention and control of occupational risk factors. The research is applied to a cement production company. The objective is to identify the regression model that fits the best those factors that are related to the occurrence of occupational accidents. Among the techniques and tools used, they are the techniques of occupational safety and health management and those related to descriptive and multivariate statistic. The main result of this research is based on different mathematical models statistical analysis. This allows selecting the negative binomial regression model as the one that results in a smaller error margin. It identifies risks related to safety conditions, to environmental conditions and satisfaction with working conditions as variables with a significant influence on work accident. It corroborates the result obtained with diagnoses made to the preventive job process. The research culminates with a proposal of an action program for improvement of the variables related to this model and indicators that make a viable control.

AB  - The study of sedimentary pyrite morphological characteristics provides useful information on depositional environments and early diagenic processes and can be used as an indicator of redox conditions in ancient lake bottom waters. The results of this study in the Songliao basin in northeastern China show that euhedral crystals and framboids are the dominant pyrite forms in the mudstones of the first member of the Qingshankou Formation (K(2)qn(1)). The framboidal size distribution indicates that during the deposition of K(2)qn(1), redox conditions in the bottom water fluctuated from oxic-dysoxic to euxinic-anoxic to oxic-dysoxic. The presence of euxinic-anoxic bottom water suggests that an anoxic event developed in the Songliao ancient-lake and continued for 196 ka. The development of an anoxic bottom environment was the most important factor in hydrocarbon source rock formation in the Songliao Basin. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae were simulated for 5 years at low temperature (80 C) in order to study their early hydrocarbon generation processes. The samples were analyzed Icy gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the range of carbon numbers and relative concentrations of alkanes are different under different simulated conditions. Hypersaline condition favors the formation and maturity of saturates. Iron ion probably delays the evolutionary pathways from phytol to phytene to phyane, while may catalyse the release of high conecentrations of squalene and bicyclic terpanes. Meanwhile, common aromatic compounds have been formed during this low temperature simulation, and high abundant methyldibenzothiophenes were found in the hypersaline sample. The Formation pathways of methylnaphthalenes in the early evolution of algae were proposed tentatively. By mathematical cluster and I actor analyses oil sonic classical thermal maturity parameters. the converted relations between phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes and their inorganic environmental effects were discussed.

AB  - Resilient animals can cope with environmental disturbances in life with minimal loss of function. Resilience can be enhanced by optimizing early-life conditions. In poultry, eggshell temperature (EST) during incubation and early feeding are two early-life conditions that are found to alter neonatal chick quality as well as immune response in later life. However, whether these early-life conditions affect disease resilience of chickens at later ages has never been studied yet. Hence, we studied the effects of EST [(37.8 degrees C (control) or 36.7 degrees C (lower)] during late incubation (>= embryonic days 17-19.5) and feeding strategy after hatch [immediately (early feeding) or 51-54 h delayed (delayed feeding)] on later-life broiler resilience in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. At hatch, 960 broilers of both sexes from a 54-week-old Ross breeder flock were equally divided over 32 pens (eight replicate pens per treatment combination) and grown for 6 weeks. Necrotic enteritis was induced by a single inoculation of Eimeria spp. at d 21 and repeated Clostridium perfringens inoculation (3x/d) during d 21-25. Mortality and body weight (BW) gain were measured daily during d 21-35 as indicators of resilience. Additionally, disease morbidity was assessed (gut lesions, dysbacteriosis, shedding of oocysts, footpad dermatitis, and natural antibody levels in blood). Results showed a lack of interaction between EST and feeding strategy for the vast majority of the variables. A lower EST resulted in lower BW gain at d 5 and 8 post Eimeria inoculation (P = 0.02) and more Eimeria maxima oocysts in feces at d 8 post Eimeria inoculation compared to control EST (P < 0.01). Early feeding tended to lower mortality compared to delayed feeding (P = 0.06), but BW gain was not affected by feeding strategy. Morbidity characteristics were hardly affected by EST or feeding strategy. In conclusion, a few indications were found that a lower EST during late incubation as well as delayed feeding after hatch may each impair later-life resilience to necrotic enteritis. However, these findings were not manifested consistently in all parameters that were measured, and conclusions are drawn with some restraint.

AB  - The taxonomic completeness index (ratio of observed to expected species; O/E) is widely used in stream bioassessment programs to infer ecological impairment. However, its sensitivity to detecting anthropogenic disturbances may be reduced by (1) the modelling procedure used to determine the expected species at a site (2) the inability of the index to account for assemblage shifts through species gains as well as losses; and (3) the frequent use of a threshold that only allows assessment of the absence of prevalent species. We used a version of the BC biotic index (an adaptation of Bray-Curtis distance) that incorporated alien and translocated species into the observed component, and generated expected native species probabilities using single species ensemble models ('BCA'). Sensitivity analysis, bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were used to test whether BCA better detected anthropogenic disturbances than the standard BC (i.e. without alien and translocated species) and O/E-50 derived from the same models. We also tested three additional fish biotic indices currently used in the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Of the indices tested, BCA explained the greatest amount of variance in anthropogenic disturbance variables, followed by BC and the proportional sample abundance of alien species. The BCA index was 18% more sensitive to detecting non-reference conditions, 20% more responsive to an anthropogenic disturbance gradient, and had twice the number of significant bivariate correlations with disturbance variables than the O/E-50 index derived from the same underlying predictive model. We suggest that the improved performance of BCA relative to O/E-50 lies in its ability to detect the addition of alien, translocated, and some native species whose traits allow them to persist or thrive in degraded conditions, and the inclusion of low prevalence taxa that may be sensitive to mild levels of disturbance. Given that generation of the BCA index requires no further information than already provided by traditional multivariate predictive models, we recommend its inclusion into bioassessment programs that use multivariate fish based indices.

AB  - Scenario analysis has the potential to improve management of aquatic systems throughout the Mountaintop Removal-Valley Fill mining (MTR-VF) region of central Appalachia. However, the extent to which surface mining interacts with other landuse stressors (i.e., cumulative effects) is unclear, and this limits our ability to predict the effects of new mines on physical, chemical, and biological conditions downstream. We tested for additive and interactive effects of landuse change (surface mining, deep mining, and residential development) on water quality (specific conductance and Se), habitat quality, and benthic macroinvertebrates via a uniquely designed watershed-scale assessment of the Coal River, West Virginia (USA). We derived equations for predicting in-stream response to landscape changes and predicted the outcome of a realistic future scenario involving development of 15 permitted mines. Elevated Se concentrations were directly correlated with incremental increases in surface-mining extent. Surface mining, deep mining, and residential development had additive effects on elevated specific conductance and reduced biological condition. We found evidence of a positive interactive effect (stressor antagonism) of deep mining and residential development on biological condition, presumably caused by stream-flow augmentation from deep mines. Landscape context influenced predicted impacts from construction of 15 new mines because of additive and interactive effects of landuse change. New surface mines increased the number of receiving streams exceeding chemical and biological criteria, but a greater proportion of receiving streams exceeded chemical and biological criteria at equivalent levels of new mine development when pre-existing stressors were present. When surface mining was the only stressor, >= 30 or 40% increases in surface mining caused 100% of streams to exceed chemical or biological standards, respectively, whereas in streams stressed by deep mining and residential development, >= 10% additional surface mining caused 100% of streams to exceed chemical and biological standards. Continued progress in this area will require a better understanding of how landuse change affects aquatic systems in the rest of the MTR-VF mining region, where watershed-to-watershed variation in landuse patterns probably causes variability in ecological response.

AB  - Water availability in the ecosystem is one of the most crucial environmental factors that determines global terrestrial biome distribution. However, aridity/humidity conditions in the geologic past are difficult to quantify, mainly owing to the lack of a proper parameter. By using modem global climatic data, we here examine five selected previously proposed aridity indices (AIs), in which the climatic variables involved, including both precipitation and temperature, are simple and likely available in studies of paleoclimatology and paleoecology, although with different degrees of uncertainty. They were first evaluated along the modem climatic zones of eastern China, with the main metric of Thornthwaite humidity index (HI) and with the supplementary reference of soil moisture index (SMI) and near-ground atmospheric relative humidity (RH). Then AIs and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) were further statistically compared with HI, SMI, and RH, respectively, based on 1189 monitored data sets from meteorological stations over the world. The results show that the Koppen aridity index (AI(Koppen)), expressed as mean annual precipitation divided by mean annual temperature plus a constant of 33, is the most accurate and precise index among all selected indices, supported by the highest correlation coefficient respectively to HI, SMI, and RH, three widely-employed major indicators sensitive to hydrological dynamics in climatology and meteorology. Specifically, AI(Koppen) does well mirror corresponding HI along four representative transects from North America, South America, Africa, and Australia, which cover the typical arid and humid climates and span the main terrestrial biome types. Moreover, our results also distinctly reveal that, as also shown by many studies on modern climate, precipitation alone is inadequate to measure the hydrological condition, because both temperature and evapotranspiration are two other critical factors that strongly influence water balance in the ecosystem, meanwhile evapotranspiration is mainly affected by temperature. Based on the validated AI(Koppen), we briefly discuss the aridity/humidity condition in China during the middle Miocene. The results demonstrate that moisture did decrease westward, but it is also clear that western China in the middle Miocene appears not to have been as dry as previously thought, indicated by the AI(Koppen) values representing a sub-humid to humid climate.

AB  - Because climate can affect xylem cell anatomy, series of intra-annual cell anatomical features have the potential to retrospectively supply seasonal climatic information. In this study, we explored the ability to extract information about water stress conditions from tracheid features of the Mediterranean conifer Juniperus thurifera L. Tracheidograms of four climatic years from two drought-sensitive sites in Spain were compared to evaluate whether it is possible to link intra-annual cell size patterns to seasonal climatic conditions. Results indicated site-specific anatomical adjustment such as smaller and thicker tracheids at the dryer site but also showed a strong climatic imprint on the intra-annual pattern of tracheid size. Site differences in cell size reflected expected structural adjustments against cavitation failures. Differences between intra-annual patterns, however, indicated a response to seasonal changes in water availability whereby cells formed under drought conditions were smaller and thicker, and vice versa. This relationship was more manifest and stable at the dryer site.

AB  - The geochemistry of the youngest Mediterranean sapropel layer suggests changes in productivity and water column oxygen conditions during sapropel deposition. The Ba-enriched interval is broader than the organic-carbon-rich interval of this sapropel. We suggest that the Ba-enriched horizon records the original thickness of the sapropel prior to subsequent partial oxidation. The main carrier of Ba is barite, as microcrystals (0.5-5 mu m) having a morphology characteristic of marine barite, particularly abundant beneath high productivity regions. Ba concentrations do not change at the sapropel layer oxidation front and diagenetic barite crystals are absent, thus the Ba-enriched layer reflects original oceanic conditions of increased biological productivity during sapropel deposition and not diagenetic Ba remobilization. Paleoredox indicators point to restricted oxygenated bottom water but not to fully anoxic conditions. Detrital elements within this layer indicate a lower eolian terrigenous input, enhanced humidity, and increased precipitation/runoff thus likely higher nutrient supply.

AB  - Monitoring the effect of management in rangelands is an integral part of the process of adaptive management. An understanding of how individual species react to management has two major benefits. Firstly, monitoring, can be simplified by avoiding species which are reacting mostly to other influences, and secondly the abundance of species can be interpreted in a meaningful way for assessing the influence of previous management. Gradient analysis on a matrix of 69 sample sites and 125 species in the St Bathans area of Central Otago identified a relatively homogenous data set, within which the effects of environmental variation had been minimised so that the major pattern of vegetation composition change was explained by pastoral impact. Ten plant species showed clear responses along the pastoral impact gradient, and were abundant over certain ranges of this gradient. It is recommended that these species be used to monitor trends in vegetation condition.

AB  - The Late Neogene represents warm Earth conditions immediately prior to the development of extensive northern hemisphere glaciation, and this period in Earth history may therefore provide the best available analog for the projected outcome of continued global warming. There are few interior continental sites of Late Neogene age from the eastern half of North America and subsequently very little is known about the conditions characterizing climate. The Early Pliocene (similar to 5 Ma) Pipe Creek Sinkhole (PCS) includes the sediment fill of a complex karst environment that developed in north-central Indiana, USA (Lat. 40 degrees 27' 25.4 ''. Long. 85 degrees 47' 37.2 ''). The site includes more than 3 m of high-chroma, red-colored silty-clay sediment interpreted to be terra rossa. The terra rossa delta(13)C values average -20 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand PDB and are interpreted to represent sediment deposited in a closed cave system under high summer temperatures and with well-drained soils. An in-situ paleosol at the top of the terra rossa represents a transition from a closed cave to an open environment that eventually flooded, thereby becoming a small pond. delta(13)C values from lacustrine sediments with organic matter derived dominantly from algae average -20.6 parts per thousand and suggest the pond was stagnant and enriched with bicarbonate from the underlying limestones or via aquifers. Pond sediments include abundant vertebrate fossils, which are broadly consistent with those inhabiting an open ecosystem such as a savannah or parkland. However, the PCS pollen includes low taxonomic diversity that is dominated by pine with some hickory and flowering plants, but no grass pollen. We propose two hypotheses to explain the PCS stratigraphic record: (1) The pollen assemblage may represent a local pine dominated ecosystem associated with the pond paleoenvironment, such as a riparian community, and that the greater landscape was drier and open; (2) Alternatively, the climate may have became wetter raising the elevation of the groundwater table and initiating the formation of the pond. Then in response to the wetter conditions an early succession forest ecosystem developed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. The length-weight relationship and condition factor of fish are indicators of physiological well-being and may be related to reproduction and feeding periods. These attributes were evaluated for a population of Hoplosternum littorale sampled in the Santo Anastacio Reservoir (Fortaleza, Northeastern Brazil). Materials and methods. One hundred and fifty-five specimens were collected with gillnets between October 2009 and March 2010, and standard length (cm), total weight (g), sex and gonadal maturation stage were registered. Results. The observed length-weight relationship indicated negative allometric adjustment (2.72). Only seventy individuals were evaluated for the condition factor analysis, sexual determination and gonadal state classification. Condition factor values peaked in November and plummeted in February, no statistical differences in sex ratio (X-2 = 13.683; p = 0.057) were observed. Mature females were collected throughout the study period. Conclusions. The results indicate that the population of H. littorale in the Santo Anastacio reservoir presents growth deficiency and changes in reproductive strategy in this hypereutrophic environment.

AB  - The temperature and soil moisture conditions as well as vegetation patterns were studied to describe the habitat and to model the life cycle of Melanoplus frigidus, a true alpine grasshopper of the Scandes. In the low alpine belt of the Norwegian Scandes the species colonizes only the warmest microhabitats with maximum soil surface temperatures of 31 degrees C. Vegetation of these habitats consists of shrub-rich heath dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus and Calluna vulgaris. Using continuously measured temperature data, the development times for four different seasons were modeled and related to field observations. The maximum delay of adult molt was estimated to amount to 3 weeks, the delay being determined by the variation in spring temperature conditions between different years. The possibilities of using M. frigidus as an indicator organism of climate change effects on alpine zoo-coenoses of the Scandes are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the role of perceptions of service quality and sacrifice in patients attending the accident and emergency (A&E) departments with minor medical conditions that can be treated by their general practitioner (GP). Perceptions of service quality were measured using modified service quality performance indicators. Perceptions of monetary and non-monetary sacrifice were also captured. Questionnaire-based data were gathered prospectively through a random sample of adult patients who exhibited minor medical conditions at a UK teaching hospital A&E department. Service quality perceptions played a major part in the decision to attend A&E, whereas sacrifice perceptions did not. Perceptions of competence and credibility were the most important quality determinants and were rated higher for A&E than GP. Given that there were some misconceptions about the quality and nature of services each setting provides, recent reforms bringing about an ever-expanding range of healthcare service options may cause further confusion in patient decision-making.

AB  - This paper studies whether (and how) corporate decisions are affected by internal factors (e.g., the financial conditions of own company) and external factors (e.g., the actions of local competitors) in an imperfectly competitive environment. We study the listed real estate developers in Beijing as a case study. Our hand-collected dataset includes transaction-level information booked indicators (e.g., profitability, liability, and liquidity) and unbooked financial indicators (political connections). Our multi-step empirical model shows that both the firm's financial conditions and its competitors' counterparts are essential but play different roles in the output design, pricing, and the time-on-the-market (TOM). Internal versus external factors' relative importance relates nonlinearly to the degrees of market concentration. Market leaders' existence alters the small firms' strategy and leads to higher selling prices and slower selling pace in the local market. Our comprehensive financial indicators (booked and unbooked) better predict corporate behaviors than traditional measures.

CP  - Symposium on The Chalk of the Northern Province - A Synopsis
AB  - Flints are recognized reliable lithostratigraphic markers in chalk sedimentary rocks and may provide an indication of Late Cretaceous palaeogeographic conditions. Their distribution and often characteristic form allow correlation over a wide area, and they may provide information about the local variations in submarine topography and water depth. The absence of flint from parts of the Chalk Group is, like its presence, predictable, but not as well explained. The distribution of flint in the Northern Province is reviewed with quantitative methods being used to highlight sedimentary patterns, flint-rich levels and a possible correlation with marlstones containing reworked volcanic ash. The form of flints is considered to be an expression of conditions prevalent within the chalk sedimentary pile which, in turn, is influenced by variations in sea floor topography and water depth. Therefore, flints may be regarded as indicators of late Cretaceous environmental conditions; their distribution over the area of a wide, generally similar, shelf sea and their form demonstrates subtle local variations in water depth and sediment properties.

AB  - The risk assessment procedures of pesticides in the European Union are mostly based on worst-case scenarios developed for central and northern European conditions. From the point of view of Mediterranean conditions, these assessment procedures are not always appropriate, and therefore the development of specific scenarios is required. There are differences not only in meteorological data (temperature, solar irradiation, or rainfall volume and annual distribution) between these countries, but also in farm distribution, crop characteristics, soil or sediment properties and surface or groundwater characteristics. These differences are more evident for the typical crops of the southern countries, such as olive groves, vineyards, citrus or rice fields, and in these cases more realistic estimates of exposure are required. Our proposal includes the development of new criteria to improve the ecological risk assessment process for the conditions of the Mediterranean region, and the justification of this need.

AB  - Rearing social animals like pigs in isolation from conspecifics can have consequences on behaviour and physiology. The aim of this experiment was to determine whether rearing conditions affect body posture. We adapted a method for quantitative evaluation of posture based on geometric morphometrics, developed in horses, for pigs and applied it in different conditions. Forty-eight 75-day-old females were reared either alone in 2.25 m(2) pens (IH, N=24 animals and 4 groups) or in groups of four in 4.64 m(2) pens (GH, N=24) for two weeks. They were habituated to human handling (stroking, speaking) and marking on their backs every day, and tested individually once a day for 10 min in a corridor outside the home pen during the two subsequent weeks. We observed their behaviour and posture during the first exposure to the test (novelty), and the fourth and fifth (after habituation). On the sixth and seventh tests, a familiar stockperson was present in the corridor (human presence). Before each test, the animals were marked with seven landmarks along their length, corresponding to their anatomical points and were easily located. An experimenter took pictures of the animals walking along the corridor, and these pictures were transferred to Tps software for analysis.
   GH animals were more often active in the rearing pen than IH (median (IQ) 15% of observations [12-20%] versus 2% [0-13%]; P<0.05). All animals except one IH initiated contact with the handler during the last sessions of handling (Fisher's exact test, ns). Principal Component Analyses revealed significant effects of rearing and testing conditions on pigs' behaviour and posture. Novelty led to fewer vocalisations and more exploration for IH than GH animals (P<0.05), but there were no differences between treatments after habituation to the testing situation. The backs of IH animals were more rounded than those of GH (P<0.05; dimension 1 of PCA), independently of the test condition. Human presence had no effect on posture.
   In conclusion, the method based on geometric morphometrics that we developed to study pig posture detected variations in walking posture in pigs associated with rearing conditions. Postures might reflect affective states in pigs, as shown in other species, but further studies are needed to verify this. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on the analysis of lake sediments retrieved from the deepest part of Lake Nam Co (Tibetan Plateau). One gravity core of 115 cm length, covering the last similar to 4000 cal BP, was analyzed for geochemical and biological parameters. High organic content at similar to 4000 cal BP and the coinciding presence of pyrite framboids until similar to 2000 cal BP point to hampered decomposition of organic material due to anoxic conditions within the lake sediments. At the same time sedimentological and biological proxies suggest a rather high lake level, but still similar to 5 m below the recent one, with less saline lake water due to enhanced monsoonal activity. During this time a change in the source of organic matter to lowered input of terrestrial components is observed. A rather quick shift to a dry environment with less monsoonal influence and a lake level similar to 15 m lower than today at similar to 2000 cal BP lead to the oxygenation of sediment the degradation of organic matter and the absence of pyrite. Oscillations of the lake level thereafter were of minor amplitude and not able to establish anoxia at the lake bottom again. A wet spell between similar to 1500 cal BP and similar to 1150 cal BP is visible in proxies referring to catchment hydrology and the ostracod-based water depth transfer function gives only a slightly elevated lake level. The last similar to 300 years are characterized by low TOC and rising TN values reflecting enhanced nutrient supply and hence an advancing influence of human activity in the catchment. Decreasing TOC/TN values point to a complete shift to almost solely aquatic biomass production. These results show that hydrological variations in terms of lake level change based on monsoonal strength can be linked to redox conditions at the lake bottom of Nam Co. Comparison with other archives over larger parts of the Tibetan Plateau and beyond exhibits a rather homogeneous climatic pattern throughout the late Holocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gas separation via hollow fibre membrane modules (HFMM) is deemed to be a promising technology for natural gas sweetening, particularly for lowering the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in natural gas, which can cause various problems during transportation and process operation. Separation performance via HFMM is affected by membrane properties, module specifications and operating conditions. In this study, a mathematical model for HFMM is developed, which can be used to assess the effects of the aforementioned variables on separation performance. Appropriate boundary conditions are imposed to resolve steady-state values of permeate variables and incorporated in the model equations via an iterative numerical procedure. The developed model is proven to be reliable via model validation against experimental data in the literature. Also, the model is capable of capturing axial variations of process variables as well as predicting key performance indicators. It can be extended to simulate a large-scale plant and identify an optimal process design and operating conditions for improved separation efficiency and reduced cost.

AB  - This article presents the results from the long-term Water Framework Directive monitoring of Posidonia oceanica in the Valencian Community, Spain. A total of six areas where Posidonia occurs were studied. Locations were characterized by a different ecological condition: degraded Posidonia meadows; meadows in good conditions; meadows close to the best reference conditions. The spatiotemporal variability of different indicators were sampled from 2005 to 2017. Lower quality meadows are characterized by a lower density and coverage of Posidonia, a higher proportion of dead Posidonia, a higher proportion of plagiotropic rhizomes, smaller shoots, and higher epiphyte biomass, as well as the presence of foliar necrosis marks. For all study sites, the temporal trends indicated a decrease in the quality of the meadows from 2005 to 2011 and a recovery from 2012 to 2017. Some variability observed in the indicators such as P. oceanica cover in patchy meadows, could not be explained by changes in the meadow health.

AB  - The ability of a government to pursue policy initiatives depends substantially upon trends in public opinion. This research examines public attitudes toward environmental spending from 1974 to 1991. Using individual-level data over seventeen years obtained from the US National Opinion Research Center, we find evidence that support for enhanced environmental funding is influenced by an array of demographic and attitudinal factors including age, education, gender, ideology, party affiliation and urbanization. In particular, we also uncover evidence that personal and macro-level economic conditions play a role in conditioning the acceptance by individuals of increased environmental funding. At the personal level, work status and income are significant indicators of individuals' attitudes. Our results imply that macroeconomic conditions are also influential. While we find indications of increasing support for environmental funding independent of demographic, attitudinal and economic factors, our research suggests that policy-makers should be aware of a variety of socioeconomic influences on public opinion.

AB  - Lithuania is representative of maritime to continental climate, no water limitation, and moderate ground-level ozone (O-3) pollution. We investigated the trends of meteorological variables and 03 and how these environmental conditions associate with tree health from 2001 onward. Ozone metrics for forest protection, based on Accumulated 03 exposure Over a Threshold of X ppb (AOTX) or on Phytotoxic O-3 Dose over a Y threshold (PODY), were modeled at nine ICP-Forests plots over the time period 2001-2014. Tree-response indicators, i.e. crown defoliation and visible foliar O-3 injury, were assessed during annual field surveys carried out at each ICP-Forests plot over the time period 2007-2017. Mann-Kendall and Sen statistical tests were applied to estimate changes over time of meteorological variables, response indicators and O-3 metrics. Finally, the O-3 metrics were correlated (Spearman test) to the response indicators over the common period 2007-2014. Over this time period, trend analyses revealed an increasingly hotter (+0.27 degrees C decade(-1), on average) and drier climate (rainfall, -48 mm decade I). A reduction was found for O-3 annual mean (-0.28 ppb decade(-1), on average) and AOT40 (-2540 ppb.h decade(-1), on average) whereas an increase was found for PODO (+0.40 mmol m(-2) decade(-1), on average). Visible foliar O-3 injury increased (+0.17% decade(-1)), while an improvement of the crown conditions (-5.0% decade(-1)) was observed. AOT40 was significantly associated with crown defoliation while PODY and soil water content were correlated with visible foliar O-3 injucy. As visible foliar O-3 injury was negligible in all the studied species, the results suggest that moderate O-3 pollution (approximately 30 ppb as annual average) does not induce biologically significant effects on this forest vegetation under the current conditions, however the overall O-3 risk (PODO) is expected to increase in the future under a hotter and drier climate.

AB  - Since coffee bean roasting is a complicated process involving transient transport processes along with complex chemical reactions, modeling and optimizing such process is a challenge. Here, machine learning was first used to formulate models that allowed predictions of selected quality indicators of coffee beans undergoing hot air or superheated steam roasting at various conditions. Starling particle swarm optimization (SPSO) as well as other swarm intelligence and gradient-based algorithms were then used to determine conditions that would yield roasted beans with quality indicators similar to those of benchmarks. Test was also performed to determine if Robusta beans could be roasted at conditions depicted by SPSO to yield the beans with quality indicators similar to those of commercial blend of Arabica and Robusta beans. SPSO predicted values of quality indicators with average errors of lower than 9% and 13% when laboratory-scaled Robusta beans and commercial blend of beans were used as benchmarks.

AB  - Measuring distance is essential for health monitoring and condition assessment of civil engineering structures. This paper reviews recent advances in remote sensing technologies for measuring distance based on electromagnetic waves. Specifically, four families of technologies are reviewed, which are the Global Navigation Satellite Systems, microwave radars, laser-based methods, and vision-based methods. The reviewed content covers the measurement principles, signal processing methods, state-of-the-art applications, and key performance metrics. The investigated performance includes the measurement accuracy, sampling frequency, operating distance, robustness to the environment, and compatibility with autonomous platforms. Existing inconsistent viewpoints concerning the performance are discussed. Based on the features of different technologies, a decision tree is presented to facilitate selection of appropriate methods for intended applications. This research is expected to promote development and applications of remote sensing technologies for facilitating condition assessment of engineering structures.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of environmental factors and rootstock growth stage on graft success. The experiment was conducted during 2012 and 2013 at the Black Sea Agricultural Research Institute of Samsun, Turkey. The whip-and-tongue method was used to graft 'Chandler' (J. regia) scion wood onto one-yr-old English walnut seedlings (Juglans regia L.). A factorial experiment with two years, two nursery conditions (open field and greenhouse with 50% shade) and four grafting times (15 March, 5 April, 25 April and 15 May) was performed to evaluate factors affecting grafting success. Graft success ranged from 18.3 to 100 % depending on nursery conditions, grafting time and year. Best graft success was obtained between the period of bud burst and about 15 cm shoot growth of rootstocks. Depending on the year, graft success was negatively correlated with minimum and mean temperature (p<0.01).

AB  - The achievement of high level personalized sets of comfort parameters is contemplated within the more general context of so-called smart buildings, where people, by means of the new communication technologies, become active actors to the process of the singling out and control of the best indoor conditions. This dynamic intelligence approach would usefully contribute to better energy-efficient and environment-friendly management of buildings. Multi-agent schemes are suitable tools in this aim, since they are able to manage the user-building-plant system, where adaptivity of people to indoor conditions is suitably achieved. In this article, a contribution to the development of the classical Fanger's model is presented, embodying a user's personal preferences referring to his/her cognitive-emotive-relational ambit. The proposed algorithm is based on a particular multi-agent aimed at the assessment of subjective indoor comfort. Such a subjective-adaptive model is meant herein as a tool for achieving an optimal control of thermal comfort conditions in buildings.

AB  - Beach sands can sustain indigenous and introduced populations of enterococci. The objective of this study was to evaluate wave action in promoting the release of introduced bacteria. To accomplish this objective this study developed a method to assess attachment and identified conditions under which introduced bacteria are integrated into the sand. A new "shearing assay" showed that attachment of the introduced spike mimicked that of the natural sand when the spike was allowed to integrate into the sand for 24 h at room temperature at a sand moisture content of 20%. Experiments in a wave flume showed that waves were capable of releasing about 60% of the total bacteria added. This suggests that for the range of wave conditions evaluated (height: 1.9-10.5 cm, period:1-2.7 s), waves were incapable of releasing all of the bacteria. Further study is needed to evaluate bacteria attachment mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A series of European Marine Sites has been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) in England. The aim of this study was to develop a practical methodology to assess the condition of SACs by applying a suite of biomarkers. Biomarkers were applied to the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the shore crab Carcinus maenas from the Fal and Helford SAC (Cornwall). Individual biomarkers provided useful diagnostic information on the activity of certain classes of contaminants and an integrated Biomarker Response Index (BRI) was used to achieve a more holistic understanding of the condition of the SAC. The BRI indicated that the general health of both organisms was impacted in the upper part of the SAC (Fal Estuary) which correlated well with known chemical hotspots and sources of contamination. The BRI allows a pragmatic way to prioritise SAC sites that may require further investigative studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Comparative analysis of morphological and chemical properties of the soil chronosequence on Kastanozems soils in the steppe zone of the Russian Plain, which included paleosoils buried beneath kurgans erected ca. 2000 BC, AD 50, AD 200, and AD 1250 was performed to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions in this archeologically important region. Paleoenvironmental dynamics were traced using the state of microbial communities of paleo and modem soils (including the dynamics of total and glucose-reactive biomass, and the abundance of microorganisms grown on selected media). We demonstrate that the share of the glucose-reactive microorganisms in the microbial community, the ecological-trophic structure, and oligotrophicity index might serve as indicators of the state of microbial communities and be used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The morphological-chemical and microbial properties confirm an and period ca. 2000 BC, slightly wetter conditions ca. AD 50, and more humid conditions ca. AD 1250. (c) 2007 University of Washington.

AB  - If animals signal their level of need for certain resources, scientists should be able to use these signals in assessing animal well-being. Theoretical models show that, under certain conditions, natural selection can favour the evolution of ''honest'' signalling systems, where vocal and other natural signals provide reliable indicators of the signaller's needs. These conditions include that signaller and receiver are related, that signallers vary in their degree of need for a response, and that producing the signal entails some ''cost'' in terms of individual fitness. Arguably, these conditions are met by vocal signals given by piglets when separated from the sow (as in weaning) or when injured (as in castration),and initial experimental results suggest that variation in these signals provides information on the animals' welfare. However, as not all signals relate to need, researchers should attempt to understand the natural function of a signal before invoking it as a measure of well-being.

AB  - Continuous manufacturing of biologics is one of the priorities of the biopharmaceutical industry. However, its widespread implementation is hampered by a lack of noninvasive/nondestructive process analytical technology (PAT) systems capable of real-time in-line monitoring of product flow parameters, such as concentration and/or aggregate content. We have previously demonstrated that, under nonflow conditions, the water proton transverse relaxation rate, R-2((H2O)-H-1), is sensitive to protein concentration and aggregate content in biopharmaceutical formulations. In the present work, we explored the potential of water proton NMR under flow conditions (flow-wNMR) to use R-2((H2O)-H-1) as a quantitative indicator of protein concentration variations and aggregate levels in the process flow. We show that, under flow conditions, R-2((H2O)-H-1) is sensitive to rather small changes in protein concentration (<1 mg/mL) and is capable to detect variations in the aggregate content of <1%. Our findings suggest that flow-wNMR could be advantageously used as a real-time in line noninvasive PAT for continuous biomanufacturing.

AB  - The primary focus of Czech agricultural and rural geographers in the past decade was put on the regional impacts triggered by the transformation of agriculture and the influences of the Common Agricultural Policy on agriculture. Multifunctionality or spatial polarization of agriculture of Czechia remained the object of marginal scientific interest, despite the fact that such topics were largely discussed amongst foreign experts in connection with a theoretical transformation of the rural space. Therefore, relying on indicators of crop and livestock production, the ambition of the paper is to uncover the dynamics of spatial polarization of agriculture in Czechia. Its conclusions reveal an increasing spatial polarization of agriculture during the Czech integration into the European Union between regions with different natural conditions ( areas with favourable conditions for agriculture and mountainous areas). It turns out, however, that while the fertile regions have been gradually specializing on crop production, spatial polarization in livestock production increases due to the rising role of mountainous areas.

AB  - Dangerous fire elements are forest fires, which annually cause enormous damage of a social and economic nature. The territory of the Tomsk region is located in the taiga zone of Western Siberia; the forestry industry is one of the leading in the economic complex. For the period 2012-2019 here more than 20 thousand hectares of forest plantations died from fires. In this regard, the climatic assessment of trends in conditions favorable to the occurrence of fires in specific territories is of considerable scientific and practical interest.
   The purpose of this work is to assess climatic changes in meteorological factors for the Tomsk station affecting the potential for a fire, and an economic interpretation of the events taking place.
   To assess the fire hazard, special indicators (indices) have been developed, which take into account, first of all, the temperature and humidity conditions of the time period. In our study, the CI indicator (complex indicator) is used. The fire hazard is the higher, the higher the CI value.
   The economic indicators of the degree of adaptation of the forest complex to modern climatic conditions are estimated.
   The conditions at Tomsk station during rainless periods during fire hazardous seasons (April - September) from 1924 to 2015 were considered. Determined rainless periods and their characteristics - the beginning and end, the duration of the period without precipitation, air temperature (average and maximum), minimum relative humidity and wind speed (average and maximum).
   Analysis of the fire hazard index revealed an increase in the fire hazard of forests in Tomsk over the past 90 years. There is a statistically significant increase in the number of days with meteorological conditions that create preconditions for the occurrence of forest fires.
   During the warm half of the year, the sum of the flammability indices increased significantly. The number of days with a high forest fire hazard has increased and the number of days with a low fire hazard has decreased. The presented quantitative indicators of the fire hazardous season confirm a certain influence of the climatic factor on the frequency of forest fires in the region.
   In unfavorable fire-hazardous seasons, an important role is played by the technical component (equipment and technical means) and technological equipment (methods of work, rules of procedure) of forestry organizations.
   With the existing natural recurrence of fires in the region, the necessary conditions for improving economic indicators are a decrease in the cost of forest protection measures and a decrease in the coefficient of unforeseen losses.

AB  - Non-inversion tillage (NIT) is often recommended as a soil conservation measure, protecting soil structure and soil life and preventing erosion. As the adoption of this measure is still below policy targets in many European regions, this study aimed at gaining insights in constraints and drivers of implementing NIT to understand how to stimulate behavioural change. This study uses the theory of planned behaviour as a framework for understanding farmers' decisions on applying NIT. This framework was applied in 8 case studies from 8 Farm Type Zones (FTZ) spread over 4 European countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy). We used a sequential mixed method, starting with qualitative semi-structured interviews followed by a quantitative survey. Our results show varying adoption rates ranging from 19% to more than 80% across the FTZs. There are large differences between FTZs and even more between countries regarding the number and nature of enabling and hampering factors identified. Although our results do reveal some widely acknowledged advantages and constraints (such as less labour/fuel needs and more weeds), several of them are restricted to one or only some of the FTZs. Some of the conditions favouring or discouraging NIT are related to biophysical characteristics of the FTZs. Besides these biophysical characteristics, agricultural specialization and especially the crops cultivated influence the decision whether or not to plough. Also timing of sowing and harvest of particular crops influences farmers' perceptions on the ease or difficulty to apply NIT. Finally, cultural, political and socio-economic conditions of the regions are influencing adoption behaviour of the farmers, e.g. good results with ploughing, having nice looking fields, availability of equipment, the existence of subsidies and the opinion of referents influence the decision whether or not to implement NIT in the singular FTZs. These insights in context-specific enabling and disabling conditions are helpful in defining targeted actions to stimulate adoption in a given region. This paper concludes with an overview of how the resulting insights in farmers' behaviour might contribute in addressing effective intervention strategies to increase adoption of NIT.

AB  - Parallel global rise in pit-latrine sanitation and groundwater-supply provision is of concern due to the frequent spatial proximity of these activities. Study of such an area in Malawi has allowed understanding of risks posed to groundwater from the recent implementation of a typical developing-country pit-latrine sanitation policy to be gained. This has assisted the development of a risk-assessment framework approach pragmatic to regulatory-practitioner management of this issue. The framework involves water-supply and pit-latrine mapping, monitoring of key groundwater contamination indicators and surveys of possible environmental site-condition factors and culminates in an integrated statistical evaluation of these datasets to identify the significant factors controlling risks posed. Our approach usefully establishes groundwater-quality baseline conditions of a potentially emergent issue for the study area. Such baselines are foundational to future trend discernment and contaminant natural attenuation verification critical to policies globally. Attribution of borehole contamination to pitlatrine loading should involve, as illustrated, the use of the range of contamination (chemical, microbiological) tracers available recognising none are ideal and several radial and capture-zone metrics that together may provide a weight of evidence. Elevated, albeit low-concentration, nitrate correlated with some radial metrics and was tentatively suggestive of emerging latrine influences. Longer termmonitoring is, however, necessary to verify that the commonly observed latrine-borehole separation distances (29-58 m), alongside statutory guidelines, do not constitute significant risk. Borehole contamination was limited and correlationwith various environmental-site condition factors also limited. This was potentially ascribed to effectiveness of attenuation to date, monitoring of an emergent problem yet to manifest, or else contamination from other sources. High borehole usage and protective wall absence correlated with observed microbiological contamination incidence, but could relate to increased human/animal activity close to these poorly protected boreholes. Additional to factors assessed, a groundwater-vulnerability factor is recommended that critically relies upon improved proactive securing of underpinning data during borehole/latrine installations. On-going concerns are wide ranging, including poorly constrained pit-latrine input, difficulties in assessing in-situ plume natural attenuation and possible disposal of used motor oils to latrines.

AB  - Relationships between immunocompetence, somatic condition, parasitism and water temperature in a wild population of chub Leuciscus cephalus were investigated. The effects of a rapid temperature increase in early spring were studied for both sexes as water temperature affects immunocompetence. Investment in gonads and activity of mucus lysozyme were negatively correlated; lysozyme activity decreased as temperature increased. No correlations were found between lysozyme activity and parasitism or intensity of infection by monogeneans, the most abundant metazoan parasite group in L. cephalus. There was a positive correlation, however, between respiratory burst intensity and parasitism. Indices of investment in gonads and spleen were correlated, showing that energetic reserves allowed either investment in gonads and spleen, or that spleen investment, even if often used in other studies in immunoecology, was not always a significant indicator of immunocompetence during this period. This last proposition is supported by the lack of correlation between spleen investment and other factors linked to immunocompetence.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to study the trends of transport of thiram, a dithiocarbamate pesticide, at different time and depth in the fields under real field conditions for wheat crop. Numerical simulations were carried out by solving the coupled soil-water content movement and mass transport equations using HYDRUS- 1D. The supplementary data used for paramaterization of HYDRUS-1D comprise of irrigation treatments, climatic conditions, and soil characteristics. Results focus on the effects and influence of irrigation treatments on pesticide persistence and mobility. Modelling results were in good agreement with the experimentally determined thiram concentrations. Application of the model to measured field data of thiram movement indicates that the modelling approach can provide reliable and useful estimates of the mass flux of water and non-volatile pesticide in vadose zone. For policy-makers and planners, some regulation strategies are suggested for controlling inappropriate pesticide application under deficit irrigation or rain-fed conditions.

AB  - The present study aimed to study if the intensity and precocity of short-term leaf responses of Nicotiana tabacum 'Bel-W3' depended on the daily atmospheric levels of ozone and/or daily meteorological conditions in a State Park located in the city of Sao Paulo, SE Brazil. From 16 September to 14 October 2002, three lots of six potted plants were exposed for fourteen days. Leaf necrosis, atmospheric ozone concentrations and meteorological parameters were daily measured. The average percentage of leaf necrosis ranged from 5% to 20%. A 4th degree polynomial model was proposed to explain daily progress of leaf necrosis on plants. The average ozone levels were increased from morning (1.3-39.2 ppbv) to the midday (1.6-52.0 ppbv) and decreased in the evening (0.5-39.9 ppbv). Daily pattern of accumulated percentage of leaf necrosis was not strictly related to ozone, but was influenced by the meteorological conditions and stage of development of leaves.

AB  - In a majority of industrialised countries, traffic noise abatement is considered as essential. Road pavements can contribute to this challenge. Researches carried out in the past ten years have made it possible to rank the acoustic performances of pavements for short range conditions in terms of A-weighted vehicle pass-by sound pressure levels L-Aeq. This classification has now to be confirmed for long range situations in terms of A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels L-Aeq, an indicator currently used for environmental nuisances. This is the purpose of this paper, which presents theoretical and experimental results concerning the ranking changes at various distances from the road and for three kinds of acoustically different pavements. Preliminary results show that the ranking close to the road seems to be preserved at distances up to 200 m with some differences depending on the considered reference period (6 h-22 h or 22 h-6 h) which can be attributed to weather and traffic conditions.

AB  - Values of delta C-13 are frequently reported with radiocarbon dates from organic materials. In C-3 plants delta C-13 values have been linked to changes in water use efficiency as a response to arid conditions. By calculating C-13 discrimination (Delta C-13) from C-13 isotopic composition (delta C-13), archaeologists can gain potentially valuable inference into past climate conditions. Values of Delta C-13 reflect the process of discrimination against heavier C-13 isotopes of carbon by comparing the delta C-13 of samples to that of the atmosphere, and can be calculated when records of atmospheric delta(CO2)-C-13 are available. The present study examines a 1300 year history of radiocarbon-derived 6,13C from the Lower Alentejo of Portugal using charcoal recovered from excavations of a series of medieval habitation sites in the study area. To calculate Delta C-13, the posterior means generated from Bayesian change-point analysis of delta(CO2)-C-13 records were used. Archaeological data were then compared to contemporary ecological studies of Delta C-13 of the same taxa against instrumental records of climate. Values of Delta C-13 fell within mean ranges for the taxa through a period of population growth between the 7th and 10th centuries AD. During the height of the Medieval Warm Period in the 11th century AD Delta C-13 values frequently fell to low levels associated with arid conditions. At this time environmental degradation and erosion were documented. Values of Delta C-13 increased for a brief period in the early 12th century AD before the rural Lower Alentejo was largely abandoned for nearly two centuries. Another period of aridity occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries AD. Radiocarbon-derived Delta C-13 is a potentially useful paleoclimate proxy for archaeologists provided that results can be paired with observed Delta C-13 variation in studies that pair these data with instrumental climate records.

AB  - We inferred late Pleistocene and early Holocene (24-10 ka BP) environmental conditions in and around Lago Peten Itza, Guatemala from ostracode remains in the lake sediments. Multivariate statistics were run on autecological information for 29 extant ostracode species collected in 63 aquatic ecosystems on the Yucatan Peninsula along a steep, increasing NW-S precipitation gradient and across a large altitudinal range. Conductivity and water depth are the most important factors that shape ostracode communities. Transfer functions were developed and applied to fossil ostracode assemblages in a similar to 76-m sediment core (PI-6, similar to 85 ka) taken in 71 m of water from Lago Peten Itza, to infer past shifts in conductivity and water level. Results suggest climate was cold and wet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Alternating dry and wet conditions characterized the deglacial. Early Holocene climate was warmer and wetter. The LGM was characterized by low ostracode species richness (4 spp.) and abundance (<940 valves g(-1)), dominance of benthic over nektobenthic taxa, abundant Physocypria globula, conductivity as low as 190 mu S cm(-1), and clay-rich sediments with relatively high total organic carbon and low C/N ratios (<14), suggesting relatively deeper water at the core site associated with abundant precipitation. Greatest water depth at the core site during the LGM occurred late in the period and was similar to 50 m. The deglacial was characterized by drier conditions, higher ostracode species richness (6 spp.) and abundances up to 18,115 valves g(-1), dominance of nektobenthic species, and presence of shallow-water and littoral-zone indicators such as Heterocypris punctata and Strandesia intrepida, conductivity up to 550 mu S cm(-1), C/N ratios as high as 37, and gypsum deposition. Lowest inferred lake depth at the core site during the deglacial was similar to 20 m. The early Holocene was characterized by high numbers of ostracode remains, up to 25,500 valves g(-1), and the presence of L. opesta and P. globula. Cytheridella ilosvayi was absent from late Pleistocene sediments, suggesting it colonized northern Central America during the Holocene.

AB  - We investigated theoretically how the sensitivity of organisms to the toxicity of chemicals varies depending on their life-history traits, which are subject to evolution. We used a resource-allocation model in which organisms allocate their resources to reproduction, maintenance of life (reduction of death), and reduction of the toxicities of chemicals. First we investigated the optimal allocation rates in the absence of chemicals. We found that when evolution occurred in low-density populations, the allocation rate for reproduction was larger than that for maintenance of life, and hence an r-strategy evolved. The r-strategists had lower sensitivity (higher resistance) against the toxicity than K-strategists, which was the optimal strategy in high-density populations. Second, we examined the optimal allocation rates in the presence of chemicals. The allocation rate for the reduction of toxicity varied depending on the shape of functions for the reduction of toxicity. When the efficiency for the reduction was low, organisms did not allocate resources to reduce toxicity, and they remained sensitive to chemicals (sensitive type). When the toxicity was efficiently reduced, the organisms allocated resources to reduce the toxicity and became insensitive to the chemicals (resistant type). When the function for the reduction had a sigmoidal shape, evolutionary bistability appeared, and the organisms eventually evolved either to allocate resources for chemical reduction or not to do so depending on the initial conditions of evolution. This result explains the large variation in the sensitivities to chemicals in organisms collected from polluted areas. We also found that the toxicity required to reduce the population growth rate by 10% (EC10) was higher for the resistant type than for the sensitive type in general; however, when the toxicity tests were conducted under a resource-poor condition, EC10 was even smaller in the resistant type than in the sensitive type (i.e., resistant organisms are more sensitive than sensitive organisms). This counterintuitive result occurred because the allocation of resources for toxicity reduction was larger than needed, and was thus an overinvestment under the resource-poor condition. Together with the results, we conclude that lacking an understanding of the evolutionary aspect may lead to insufficient risk assessment and management.

AB  - Climate changes are expected to increase fire frequency, fire season length, and cumulative area burned in the western United States. We focus on the potential impact of mid-21st-century climate changes on annual burn probability, fire season length, and large fire characteristics including number and size for a study area in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Although large fires are rare they account for most of the area burned in western North America, burn under extreme weather conditions, and exhibit behaviors that preclude methods of direct control. Allocation of resources, development of management plans, and assessment of fire effects on ecosystems all require an understanding of when and where fires are likely to burn, particularly under altered climate regimes that may increase large fire occurrence. We used the large fire simulation model FSim to model ignition, growth, and containment of wildfires under two climate scenarios: contemporary (based on instrumental weather) and mid-century (based on an ensemble average of global climate models driven by the A1B SRES emissions scenario). Modeled changes in fire patterns include increased annual burn probability, particularly in areas of the study region with relatively short contemporary fire return intervals; increased individual fire size and annual area burned; and fewer years without large fires. High fire danger days, represented by threshold values of Energy Release Component (ERC), are projected to increase in number, especially in spring and fall, lengthening the climatic fire season. For fire managers, ERC is an indicator of fire intensity potential and fire economics, with higher ERC thresholds often associated with larger, more expensive fires. Longer periods of elevated ERC may significantly increase the cost and complexity of fire management activities, requiring new strategies to maintain desired ecological conditions and limit fire risk. Increased fire activity (within the historical range of frequency and severity, and depending on the extent to which ecosystems are adapted) may maintain or restore ecosystem functionality; however, in areas that are highly departed from historical fire regimes or where there is disequilibrium between climate and vegetation, ecosystems may be rapidly and persistently altered by wildfires, especially those that burn under extreme conditions.

AB  - In order to assess the biological effects of the Prestige oil spill (POS), mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were collected in 22 localities along the North coast of the Iberian Peninsula over 3 years (April 2003-April 2006). Different tissue-level biomarkers including cell type composition (volume density of basophilic cells, Vv(BAS)) in digestive gland epithelium, structural changes of digestive alveoli (mean luminal radius to mean epithelial thickness, MLR/MET) and histopathological alterations (prevalence and intensity) of the digestive gland were analysed. Severe alterations in the general condition of the digestive gland tissue were observed all over the study area up to 2004-2005. High Vv(BAS) values were recorded mainly in Galicia but also to a lesser extent in the Bay of Biscay in 2003-2004. Atrophy of the digestive alveoli, measured in terms of MLR/MET, was detected all along the studied area up to 2006. Inflammatory responses cannot be related to pollution due to the POS: (a) prevalence and intensity of focal hemocytic infiltration were higher in the Bay of Biscay than in Galicia but they did not show a clear temporal trend; (b) high intensities of brown cell aggregates were only sporadically recorded; and (c) granulocytomas were more frequently recorded in the Bay of Biscay than in Galicia and especially in localities (i.e. Arrigunaga) subjected to chronic pollution. Likewise, Marteilia, trematodes, intracellular ciliates, unidentified eosinophilic bodies, R/CLO and Mytilicola did not follow any recognisable pattern that could be associated to the POS. In contrast, high Nematopsis intensities recorded in several localities in 2003 might suggest some response of local interest after the POS (i.e., in combination with particular factors/conditions). More data at a regional scale are needed before histopathology may provide a reliable ecosystem health assessment but the present results suggest that the approach is worthwhile. Overall, although Vv(BAS) returned to reference values by 2004-2005, MLR/MET values indicated that the mussel health condition was affected during the whole study period up to April 2006.

AB  - Modern global warming is likely to cause future melting of Earth's polar ice sheets that may result in dramatic sea-level rise. A possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) alone, which is considered highly vulnerable as it is mainly based below sea level, may raise global sea level by up to 5-6 m. Despite the importance of the WAIS for changes in global sea level, its response to the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary is poorly constrained. Moreover, the geological evidence for the disintegration of the WAIS at some time within the last ca. 750 kyr, possibly during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (424-374 ka), is ambiguous. Here we present physical properties, palaeomagnetic, geochemical and clay mineralogical data from a glaciomarine sedimentary sequence that was recovered from the West Antarctic continental margin in the Amundsen Sea and spans more than the last 1 Myr. Within the sedimentary sequence, proxies for biological productivity (such as biogenic opal and the barium/aluminum ratio) and the supply of lithogenic detritus from the West Antarctic hinterland (such as ice-rafted debris and clay minerals) exhibit cyclic fluctuations in accordance with the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. A prominent depositional anomaly spans MIS 15-MIS 13 (621-478 ka). The proxies for biological productivity and lithogenic sediment supply indicate that this interval has the characteristics of a single, prolonged interglacial period. Even though no proxy suggests environmental conditions much different from today, we conclude that, if the WAIS collapsed during the last 800 kyr, then MIS 15-MIS 13 was the most likely time period. Apparently, the duration rather than the strength of interglacial conditions was the crucial factor for the WAIS drawdown. A comparison with various marine and terrestrial climate archives from around the world corroborates that unusual environmental conditions prevailed throughout MIS 15-MIS 13. Some of these anomalies are observed in the pelagic Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic and might originate in major ice-sheet drawdown in Antarctica, but further research is required to test this hypothesis.

AB  - For five decades Olduvai Gorge has been a key site to reconstruct and understand the relationship between environmental and landscape conditions and use of affordances by early African hominin populations. Following the first Olduvai Gorge Coring project (OGCP) during 2014, a multiproxy microbiological analysis, which includes phytoliths, pollen, diatoms, sponge spicules and chrysophyte cysts, was undertaken on samples collected from various borehole cores. The aim of the study is to better understand palaeoenvironmental and palaeovegetation conditions and changes through time and their relationship to hominin presence and evolution. This study details the first palaeobotanical and palaeoenvironmental study of Borehole 2A at Olduvai Gorge. It represents the as yet oldest known sedimentary sequence in the Olduvai Basin for a portion of the pre-Bed I Naibor Soit Formation; this is a unit that is not accessible in any natural exposures in Olduvai Gorge, and has only recently been encountered by drilling. Here we present the results from a particularly phytolith-prone portion between similar to 2.09 Ma and 2.12 Ma.
   Phytolith results indicate a savannah environment dominated by grasses, where Poaceae were a key component and where the C-3 Pooideae grasses were mostly dominant, alternating with C-4 grasses. Oscillations between grass subfamilies, C-3 Pooideae, C-4 Chloridoideae, and C-4 Panicoideae to lesser degrees, indicate five substantial climatic shifts, varying between more humid and arid conditions. Associated with phytoliths, freshwater indicators such as diatoms, sponge spicules and chrysophyte cysts were also identified, suggesting the presence of wetlands in the lake catchment area. Pollen is extremely rare in the sediments but when present, comprises fungal spores and Poaceae pollen, thus supporting the wetland and grassland reconstructions, respectively. These results offer for the first time, a whole picture of the palaeovegetation and associated palaeoenvironments for this pre-Bed I period. Together with previous results from other areas and chronological periods, they improve our understanding of the evolution and adaptation of early hominins and their close relationship to the surrounding landscape.

AB  - Aims
   After abandonment of grasslands, secondary succession leads to the invasion by woody species. This process begins with the accumulation of tree litter in the forest-grassland ecotone. Our objectives were to determine the relationships between litter amounts and vegetation composition and cover along natural forest-grassland ecotones and to experimentally study the initial effects of tree litter accumulation on grassland vegetation and on microsite conditions.
   Methods
   We established 11 transects varying from 12 to 15 m in length in different forest-grassland ecotones in the Lahn-Dill highlands, Germany, and measured the mass and cover of tree litter and the cover and composition of vegetation at five sequential positions along each transect by using 1 m(2) plots with five replications. In a field experiment, we established plots subjected to different litter amounts (0, 200 and 600 g m(-2)) and evaluated changes in grassland vegetation, soil temperature and soil nutrient availability below the litter layer.
   Important Findings
   Tree litter amounts decrease from 650 to 65 g m(-2) across the forest-grassland ecotone. Vegetation changed from shrubs and annual species (adapted to more stressful conditions) in the forests edge to grasses, rosettes and hemirosette species (with higher competitive abilities) in the grassland. These anthropogenic forest-grassland ecotones showed abrupt edges, and the two adjacent ecosystems were characterized by different species pools and functional groups. In the field experiment, the presence of a litter layer reduced vegetation biomass and cover; the species richness was only reduced in the treatment with high litter (600 g m(-2)). Additionally, adding litter on top of vegetation also reduced thermal amplitude and the number of frost days, while increasing the availability of some nutrients, such as nitrogen and aluminium, the latter being an indicator of soil acidification. Adding a tree litter layer of 600 g m(-2) in grassland areas had strong effects on the composition and diversity of grassland vegetation by reducing the cover of several key grassland species. In, or near, forest edges, litter accumulation rapidly changes established vegetation, microsite conditions and soil nutrients.

AB  - Soil compaction is an ongoing issue of concern in agricultural land use. Measuring and modeling stress-strain relationships for various loading conditions and field traffic intensities is therefore important for assessing and predicting soil deformation and estimating related changes in soil functions such as aeration and hydraulic conductivity. A well-known and widely used parameter that quantifies soil stability is the pre-compression stress (P-c) Pre-compression stress values are determined from compression curves measured in confined compression tests under static loading conditions. It reflects the stress history of the soil and separates the re-compression stress range (below the pre-compression stress), where soil deformation is assumed to be fully elastic, from the virgin compression stress range (above the pre-compression stress). where soil deformation is considered plastic. Particularly, in agricultural land use, however, soil deformation is caused by dynamic rather than static loading processes where in situ stress paths diverge from the conditions applied during standard static soil testing. While the pre-compression stress is a useful indicator for the soil's bearing capacity it neglects plastic soil responses in the re-compression stress range which may become important, especially concerning subsoil compaction, when long-term intensive field traffic inducing multiple reloading events is considered. On the other hand if volume deformation is estimated from compressibility indices derived under static loading conditions it may potentially overestimate the true compression since loading times are much shorter during real wheeling events than during consolidation tests.
   We developed a new programmable pneumatic multistep oedometer (PMO) in order to quantify soil deformation under dynamic loading conditions. The oedometer allows defining virtually any stress path and hence provides a flexible method for dynamic soil testing. To demonstrate the potential applications of dynamic soil testing accounting for typical loading conditions on arable soils we conducted confined compression tests under various stress paths. Examples from cyclic loading tests (100 loading cycles) and the simulation of stress paths measured in situ with stress-state transducers (SST) during a wheeling experiment are shown. Results suggest that dynamic soil loading leads to cumulative soil deformation with significant effects on soil functions shown by a reduction of air conductivity coefficients. Soil compaction studies concerning agricultural field traffic should account for the time-dependency and non-static nature of load application to obtain more realistic predictions of possible changes in soil functions.

AB  - We studied three commonly used bioindicator groups: phytoplankton, phytobenthos and benthic invertebrate communities' structure patterns in transitions between lotic and lentic habitats as consequences of two consecutive large dams constructed in the early twentieth century on the intermediate reach of a lowland river in Normandy (NW, France), the Selune. According to sampling station position along the river, including two in the two reservoir lakes, we defined three sorts of transitions, from upstream to downstream: lentic to lotic transition (hereafter len-lot), lentic to lentic transition (hereafter len-len), within the two reservoir lakes, and lentic to lotic transition (hereafter len-lot). Lot-len transition, imposed by damming, and the recovery of lotic character of the river afterward dams, promoted different diversity patterns for the studied organisms' groups. Phytobenthos' alpha diversity significantly incresed in the len-lot transition, and the highest 13 diversity score was observed in the lot-len. Both, habitat conditions and spatial controls drove phytobenthos community structure. Benthic invertebrate community was mainly shaped by habitat conditions. Invertebrate's alpha diversity significantly changed in the lot-len and len-lot transitions, with the 13 diversity score being the highest in the lot-len transition. Community's traits composition of invertebrates best fitted predictions on lotic- and lentic- type communities. Phytoplankton's alpha diversity remained unchanged in the transitions and subsequently 13 diversity scores were low. According to the results, we proposed three classes of organisms based on their response to river damming: i) organisms indifferent or tolerant to dams effect, like phytoplankton communities in this study, that were neither hampered by changes in water flow velocity, and did not display dispersal limitation neither; ii) organisms sensitive to habitat conditions shift but not limited in their dispersal capacity by the dam, like benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos in this study. Benthic invertebrate community and phytobenthos communities differed in their response likely due to their differential dispersal capabilities and niche breadth; iii) organisms limited in their dispersal by the dam, not represented in this study. Riverine organisms best tracked transitions, while 13 diversity assessment revealed as the most useful metric to disentangle the relative contribution of dispersal limitation or habitat modification provoked by multiple dams.

AB  - Simple Summary The increasing interest in the welfare of farmed animals has resulted in the development of alternative production systems for pigs. Access to outdoor pens or pastures is considered to improve welfare, as it is environmental-friendly and widely accepted by society. Outdoor housing allows pigs to freely display their natural behaviors, which is perhaps the most significant advantage of this type of housing vs. indoor housing systems. Among various indoor systems, bedding made of different materials, especially straw, appears to promote appropriate behavioral patterns in pigs, but it may also lead to respiratory disorders. However, the literature indicates that none of the described housing systems for pigs is perfect, and each one has some negative effects on welfare, management, and food safety. Humans who care for pigs prefer an environment that not only allows the pigs to express their natural behaviors but also limits the development of aggression and stereotypes. Most of the behavioral and health problems encountered by pigs in barren, conventional conditions are solved by alternative housing systems. However, it is not known whether these systems are advantageous in terms of the performance of pigs. In this work, we review the effects of housing systems on pigs' behaviors and performance, which are among the major indicators of the welfare of these animals. Research results point out that outdoor systems are more ideal for sows and fatteners than buildings. Nonetheless, outdoor housing is associated with two major effects in both groups: increased activity due to environmental exploration and higher space allowance, and increased incidence of injuries compared to indoor systems. Sows are more active when housed in groups, but they experience an increased frequency of injuries. According to the literature, group-housed sows give birth to healthy piglets with good daily weight gains. The difference in the fattening and slaughter performance of pigs raised indoors vs. outdoors remains unclear, and the results reported so far are inconsistent. Outdoor systems seem to be associated with a higher incidence of osteochondrosis and lesions of elbow and hock joints, whereas indoor systems cause a greater degree of body soiling in pigs. Based on the reviewed literature, it may be concluded that outdoor housing helps to solve behavioral issues in pigs but leads to other problems in pig production.

AB  - In an era of anthropocene, threatened and endemic species with small population sizes and habitat specialists experience a greater global conservation concern in view of being at higher risk of extinction. Predicting and plotting appropriate potential habitats for such species is a rational method for monitoring and restoring their dwindling populations in expected territories. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) coalesces species existence sites with environmental raster layers to construct models that describe possible distributions of plant species. The present study is aimed to study the potential distribution and cultivation hotspots for reintroducing the high value, vulnerable medicinal herb (Rheum webbianum) in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh using population attributes and ecological niche modelling approach. Sixty-three populations inventoried from twenty-eight areas display a significant change in the phytosociological attributes on account of various anthropogenic threats. The current potential habitats coincide with actual distribution records and the mean value of Area Under Curve (AUC) was 0.98 and the line of predicted omission was almost adjacent to omission in training samples, thus validating a robustness of the model. The potential habitat suitability map based on the current climatic conditions predicted a total of 103760 km(2) as suitable area for the growth of Rheum webbianum. Under the future climatic conditions, there is a significant reduction in the habitat suitability ranging from -78531.34 Km(2) (RCP 4.5 for 2050) to -77325.81 (RCP 8.5 for 2070). Furthermore, there is a slight increase in the suitable habitats under future climatic conditions, ranging from +21.99 Km(2) under RCP 8.5 (2050) to +3.14 Km(2) under RCP 4.5 (2070). The Jackknife tests indicated Precipitation of Driest Month (BIO14) as the most contributing climatic variable in governing the distribution of R. webbianum. Therefore, scientifically sound management strategies are urgently needed to save whatever populations are left in-situ to protect this species from getting extinct. Present results can be used by conservationists for mitigating the biodiversity decline and exploring undocumented populations of R. webbianum on one hand and by policymakers in implementing the policy of conservation of species with specific habitat requirements by launching species recovery programmes in future on the other.

AB  - Under temperate climate conditions, organic farming systems show improved soil quality compared to non-organic systems, whereas little long-term research on the impact of organic farming on soil quality has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Within the system comparison (SysCom) project, two long-term field experiments were set up in 2007 in the sub-humid Central Highlands of Kenya to compare organic and conventional farming at two input levels (high input systems with recommended rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and pesticides and with irrigation vs. rain-fed low input systems with low N, P and pesticides), with a similar design at both sites. The two sites differ mainly in their inherent soil properties and in the amount and distribution of rainfall. At the end of each three-year crop rotation period, we analyzed a set of chemical, biological and physical soil quality parameters in 0-20 cm soil depth. After nine years, microbial parameters seemed to have reached a steady state, whereas chemical parameters were still changing. Most soil quality parameters were highest under the high input organic farming system. The high input conventional system performed well in preserving several soil quality indicators, but a trend for acidification and the lack of soil carbon build-up raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of the system. Low input organic and conventional farming systems did not improve soil quality and even showed decreasing trends in several chemical parameters. Total and available P accumulated over time, especially in both high input systems, suggesting increasing risks of losses to the environment. Pronounced site effects revealed strong interactions with pedo-climatic conditions, with soil quality under high input organic farming improving to a greater extent at the site with more favorable conditions. Besides effects on soil quality, important criteria for sustainable input levels are thus the general availability of inputs, resulting nutrient input output budgets as well as interactions of inputs with inherent soil properties.

AB  - The combination of bioremediation and aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) has become attractive because of the possibility of solving environmental and energy problems simultaneously. While the impact of ATES on groundwater quality due to temperature change has received ample attention in literature, the effect of the greatly enhanced groundwater flow velocity on groundwater quality has not yet received sufficient scientific attention. To fill this gap in understanding, we conducted a simple yet straightforward experiment to illustrate the impact of hydrodynamic shear force due to the water flow by ATES on the release of dissolved organic matter, which can potentially be advantageous to bioremediation. Vigorous shaking conditions were applied to simulate the enhanced dynamics at the ATES well center and nearby. As the indicators of dissolved organic matter, COD and TOC concentrations were significantly impacted by shaking. COD increased from 5.4 mgO(2)/L to 36.3 mgO(2)/L during horizontal shaking. The maximum COD level was determined as 33.8 mgO(2)/L during orbital shaking, while the TOC level was growing from 6.7 to 28.7 mg C/L Meanwhile, redox potential (with initial level -100 mV) was decreasing to -450 mV synchronously with the elevating COD and TOC level. Temperature was also revealed as a significant factor in the organic matter releasement Microbial iron reduction was deemed to occur, yet sulfate reduction was not initiated during the whole experiment. Eventually, the structure of the soil-water matrix has been changed due to the extensive hydraulic and particle collisions, resulting in blackish appearance and thicker layer of fine particles. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the role of the ATES-induced water flow in the subsurface biogeochemistry and give insight into the perspective of the combination of bioremediation and ATES. In general, an increase in dissolved organic matter can be expected due to the increased shear force at high flow conditions in the ATES system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riparian tree species, growing under different conditions of water availability, can adapt their physiology to maximise their survival chances. Rivers in South Africa may flow perennially, seasonally or ephemerally (episodically). Different riparian species are adapted to survive under each of these different flow regimes by making use of surface, ground, soil, rainwater, or some combination of these. These water sources are available to varying degrees, depending on local climatic, hydrological, geohydrological and geomorphological conditions. This paper tests physiological differences among trees along rivers with varying flow regimes. In this study 3 parameters were selected and tested, namely wood density, specific leaf area and water use efficiency through stable carbon isotope measurements. All three parameters are quick, simple and cheap to determine and as such their value for standard-procedure river monitoring programmes or environmental flow requirement procedures was tested. Acacia erioloba is an arid-adapted riparian tree along the ephemeral Kuiseb (Namibia) and Kuruman (South Africa) Rivers that shows decreasing specific leaf area and increasing wood density correlating with deeper groundwater levels. Intraspecific changes for specific leaf area and carbon isotope values were demonstrated for Acacia mellifera and Croton gratissimus at varying distances from the active channel of the seasonal Mokolo River (South Africa). No significant differences in physiology were noted for Salix mucronata, Brabejum stellatifolium and Metrosideros angustifolia, growing along the perennial Molenaars and Sanddrifskloof Rivers (South Africa) under reduced flow conditions. Only the measurement of specific leaf area recurrently showed that significant physiological differences for trees occurred along rivers of the drier flow regime spectrum (seasonal and ephemeral). As such, this physiological measurement may be a valuable indicator for water stress, while the other measurements might provide more conclusive results if a larger sampling size were used. Specific leaf area, in conjunction with other carefully picked water stress measurement methods, could be considered for monitoring programmes during environmental flow assessments, river health monitoring exercises and restoration projects. This would be particularly valuable in rivers without permanent flow, where there is little speciesspecific knowledge and where current monitoring methods are unsuited.

AB  - Mussels are used as bioindicator organisms to assess bioavailable contaminant concentrations in coastal waters. This study used radiotracer methodologies to examine the bioaccumulation and efflux rates of six metals (Ag, Am, Cd, inorganic Ca, organic Co [as cobalamine], Pb, and Zn) in the mussel Mytilus galloprovinciallis, in which the dissolved phase and ingested phytoplankton food were compared quantitatively as sources. Mussels maintained in the laboratory in running seawater and caged in the field for up to 4 months generally displayed similar metal absorption efficiencies (AEs) and efflux rates from their soft parts. AEs from food were typically lower than radioisotope retention efficiencies from the dissolved phase and ranged from 4% for Am to about 60% for Pb; values were comparable to those reported for the common blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, Efflux rate constants from mussel soft parts (1-5% daily) were comparable to M. edulis values from short-term depurations; biological half-lives of all metals in soft parts, shells, and whole mussels typically ranged from 10 to 60 days, although exceptions were noted. Metals obtained from food were primarily bound to soft part tissues; metals from the dissolved phase were mostly associated with the mussel shells. Higher AEs and lower efflux rates of cobalamine than of inorganic Co suggest that cobalamine is a more bioavailable form of cobalt for mussels. Mussel fecal pellets were enriched with metals following ingestion, with retention half-times of the metals in the pellets ranging from 18 days for Ag to 107 days for Am. Fecal pellet deposition beneath mussel beds may play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of these metals in coastal ecosystems, The efflux rate constants and AEs can be used in kinetic models to estimate the relative importance of food and water as source terms for metals in mussels and to predict metal concentrations in mussels under different field conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed to show that AEs are critical parameters influencing metal concentrations in mussels (particularly for Am, Ag, and Zn), and the results from this study indicate that laboratory-derived estimates of AEs are applicable to field conditions.

AB  - There is increasing awareness that structure-based indicators should be considered for assessing the biological value of late successional forests. In order to increase the unique habitat features critical for old-growth associated species, it is important to identify and rank candidate potential forest sites on the basis of their distinctive structural features. Data on living and deadwood components for the identification of old-growth condition are usually acquired in the considered forest stands by two sampling survey: (i) census performed in relatively large monitoring sites; (ii) network of small sampling units, on which inventory practices are usually based. Several authors argued that choosing between these survey strategies might have substantial effects on the values of common indicators of old-growth condition. Our study aims at (i) assessing the total estimate differences among old-growth structural indicators measured in field plots with different sizes, and (ii) defining the optimal sample size for the reliable assessment of such indicators. The study was carried out in six beech dominated forest stands on the Apennines range in Italy. In each stand, living and deadwood components were surveyed and geocoded in 1-ha square areas. Based on these dataset, circular plots with radii ranging from 4 m up to 20 m were then considered in order to quantify the effect of sampling plot size on the estimation of four structural indicators: (1) number of living trees; (2) number of large trees (dbh >= 50 cm); (3) total deadwood volume; (4) number of deadwood elements (snags, dead standing trees; lying dead trees, lying deadwood) with dbh (or average diameter for lying deadwood) >= 30 cm. We found that the size of the sampling plots should be at least 500 m(2) in order to establish a database for the assessment of the investigated indicators. The census approach should be preferred to the sampling plot approach for old-growth forest stands smaller than 3-5 ha. The achieved results contribute to define assessment protocols for characterizing and ranking the degree to which forest stands approximate old-growth condition based on standardized indicators.

AB  - Background: Despite their ecological, economic and medical relevance, very little information is available on the distribution of planktonic cnidarians, this being particularly true for some regions of the ocean such as the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, the effect of locally important oceanographic features such as the offshore autumnal transport on the distribution of planktonic cnidarians has long been overlooked in this region. Because of this, the present study aimed to analyse the spatial patterns of planktonic cnidarian assemblages in the southern Gulf of Mexico during the autumn of 1998, when particularly intense conditions of convergence, offshore water transportation and productivity were recorded. The assemblages were described in terms of their composition, abundance (volume), diversity, dominance and equitability. Cluster (Bray-Curtis index) and ordination (multidimensional scaling (MDS)) analysis were performed in order to link the observed distribution of species with the environmental parameters.
   Results: Sixty-eight taxa were recorded, with Koellikerina fasciculata and Muggiaea atlantica representing new records for the region. The holoplanktonic species Diphyes dispar, Abylopsis spp., Liriope tetraphylla, Diphyes bojani, Aglaura hemistoma, Muggiaea kochi, Chelophyes appendiculata and Eudoxoides mitra were dominant with respect to abundance (ml/1000 m(3)) and frequency of occurrence and defined the differences among the groups of stations. Four groups of sampling stations were identified: (A) the mouth of the Grijalva-Usumacinta system, (B) the Campeche Bank, (C) the area of offshore oil rigs and (D) the continental shelf off Tabasco and associated oceanic waters. The parameters that defined the groups of stations were zooplankton volume, sampling station depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration.
   Conclusions: Planktonic cnidarians are useful as indicators of water masses, since the observed zonation was congruent with the surface circulation patterns that are present during the autumn (offshore transportation) and the presence of particular local environmental conditions, including those at the mouth of the Grijalva-Usumacinta system and those associated with the area of oil rigs. We would expect that similar conditions of strong offshore transport would lead to a similar horizontal stratification in the assemblages of planktonic cnidarians in other parts of the world, driven mainly by salinity, oxygen, depth and zooplankton gradients.

AB  - Dairy production from planted pastures is one of the main farming systems in the southern Cape region of South Africa. Large tracts of natural rangeland were converted to planted pastures for increased fodder production. To sustain these agro-ecosystems, the physical condition of soil needs to be protected. The objective of this study was to assess the impact that conversion of natural rangeland to planted pastures had on the physical condition of a sandy soil after 19 years. An irrigated minimum-till kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum)-Iyegrass (Lolium spp.) pasture soil was compared with a virgin fynbos soil. Physical indicators of soil quality were measured at 0-100 mm, 100-200 mm and 200-300 mm depth intervals. The planted pasture was highly productive, in comparison to the natural vegetation. Clay content was similar (P <= 0.01) between sites within the 0-100 mm and 100-200 mm depths and comparison of indicators between sites and interpretation thereof should be unbiased for those depths. Penetration resistance and to a lesser extent also bulk density of the planted pasture soil showed that conversion of virgin soil to minimum-till pastures adversely affected soil physical resistance by increased compaction. Aggregate stability (water stable aggregate percentage) was higher (P <= 0.05) in the 0-100 mm and 100-200 mm layers of virgin soil and the soil microstructure was adversely affected with a lower water stable aggregate percentage in planted pasture soil compared to that of the virgin soil. Infiltration rate did not differ between sites. In comparison to fynbos vegetation, planted pasture increased water holding capacity of the 0-100 mm layer by 5.0% (P <= 0.01), but did not affect (P > 0.01) water holding capacity in the 100-200 mm and 200-300 mm layers. Conversion of virgin soil to minimum-till kikuyu-ryegrass pasture degraded the dynamic physical condition of a podzolic soil over 19 years in terms of physical resistance and soil microstructure strength, but enhanced water holding capacity and maintained infiltration rate.

AB  - Fruit tree production faces the major challenge of ensuring maximal productivity with due consideration for the environment and human health. The increasingly recognized concept of ecosystem service could help to address this duality. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework based on a soil crop model to investigate how agricultural management and pedoclimatic conditions affect the joint production of marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services through underlying ecosystem functions in apple orchards. The ecosystem services considered on an annual scale were soil nitrogen availability, climate regulation, water regulation and fruit production. Ecosystem functions and services were described by specific indicators that were quantified using the STICS soil crop model. This model was parameterized using data collected on two experimental apple orchard sites under conventional and low-input or organic management in southeastern France. The interdependencies between environmental components, cultural operations and ecosystem functions were dynamically integrated by the model and highlighted significant interactions between the indicators of ecosystem services. Thus, the service indicators soil organic nitrogen variation and the prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of leaching were positively correlated and in conflict with soil mean nitrate concentration and mean soil humidity. They were also linked negatively to nitrogen mineralization enhanced by irrigation and positively to soil carbon sequestration impacted by fertilization; these two functions were impacted by soil conditions. Yield and carbon sequestration presented a strong synergy and were positively correlated to nitrogen absorption increased by mineral fertilization. Globally, nitrogen fertilization management and planting density were particularly important for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, but soil and climate effects were far from negligible, especially for nitrogen and water-related services. The ecosystem service profiles of the studied cropping systems were diversified, with contrasted profiles showing high yield and carbon sequestration but low prevention of nitrogen denitrification and of nitrogen leaching, and more balanced profiles. The STICS crop model made it possible to quantify and analyze profiles of ecosystem services and should be helpful in instrumenting the dialogue between fruit growers and other stakeholders by simulating scenarios to optimize multiple services. However, it has to be improved to address the impact of grass cover on soil functions and the long-term functioning of apple orchards.

AB  - Culture experiments are uniquely suited for uncovering the fundamental factors controlling skeletal geochemistry because it is possible to explore conditions beyond what is found in the modern ocean and to decouple parameters that co-vary in nature. We cultured juvenile individuals of a cold-water coral (Balanophyllia elegans) in a set of experiments that decoupled carbonate chemistry parameters over a wide range of pH, DIC, and [CO32-] values. Using a multi-element mixed spike isotope dilution method we then analyzed cultured skeletons for U/Ca, which has been proposed as a potential proxy for seawater pH and [CO32-], as well as Sr/Ca, and Mg/Ca.
   We find that U/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in cultured B. elegans are most strongly correlated with solution DIC and not pH or [CO32-]. We also confirm previous observations that Metal/Calcium (Me/Ca) ratios follow the same correlated relationships between and among individuals across different experimental conditions. Interpretation of these robust Me/Ca patterns within the framework of a geochemical model of biomineralization allows us to identify two "rules" of skeletal growth for B. elegans. First, changes in seawater exchange rates can explain variability in B. elegans Me/Ca ratios, correlations between these ratios, and sensitivity of Me/Ca to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. Second, our model best fits our data if we assume that calcifying fluid pH for B. elegans remains constant across widely varying experimental seawater compositions. Our study has implications for the recently developed Sr-U paleothermometer because it refines our understanding of the environmental parameters affecting this proxy. Our model further demonstrates that U/Ca is not a robust indicator of seawater pH or [CO32-]. Instead, U/Ca may record how calcifying fluid [CO32-] responds to changes in the environment or calcification dynam-ics, which may be useful in evaluating how corals respond to changes like ocean acidification. Measurements of U/Ca and additional Me/Ca ratios in other coral species, evaluated within a similar framework, may elucidate how those species respond to environmental change.

AB  - The large temporal and spatial variability in marine productivity encountered by marine predators may negatively influence breeding success. The Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella (AFS), a marine predator in the Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem with a circumpolar distribution, exhibits a short, 4 mo lactation coinciding with increased summer marine productivity. The diet of AFS, and the distance to significant and productive oceanographic features, such as the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), varies considerably between populations. We studied the foraging activity, foraging efficiency and the pup provisioning strategies of lactating AFS at a key breeding site in the southern Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen Archipelago. Foraging parameters were examined in relation to interannual variability in oceanographic conditions and prey availability in the PFZ over 3 consecutive breeding seasons (1998 to 2000). The location of foraging zones, diving activity, diet and foraging efficiency varied significantly between years, concurrently with annual changes in sea-surface temperature (SST) and prey availability. The strongest recorded El Nino Southern Oscillation event in 1997-1998 coincided with anomalously warm waters in the vicinity of the Archipelago. Deeper diving by females, reduced maternal and pup body condition, and minimal pup growth rates and low catch per unit effort of the primary prey species, lanternfishes (Myctophidae) were all recorded in this period. Maternal size was positively related to the growth performance of pups only in this period, indicating the importance of age/size and/or experience in mediating environmental fluctuations. Foraging efficiency over a foraging cycle and variability in mean provisioning rates (trip duration), were identified as proxies of prey availability within the foraging range of seals, emphasising the effectiveness of the use of AFS foraging behaviour as an indicator of both food and oceanographic variability and climatic anomalies. The increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST events in sectors of the SO, however, may elicit specific behavioural responses from 'central place foragers' (i.e. species that return to breeding sites to feed their young) to avoid sustained poor body condition of females and their weaned offspring.

AB  - Managers of protected natural areas seek to protect their natural conditions while providing opportunities for recreational visitation. Camping is an essential element of backcountry and wilderness recreation for a variety of protected natural areas in the U.S. and internationally. Furthermore, overnight visitors to protected areas spend a substantial portion of their time on campsites so their behaviors determine the nature and extent of resource impacts, and the quality of their recreational experiences can be affected by campsite conditions. The U.S. Forest Service manages nearly 2000 designated campsites in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. This research assessed resource conditions on 81 wilderness campsites and paired undisturbed controls in 1982 and 2014 to quantify long-term ecological changes. A comprehensive array of physical, vegetative, and soil indicators were measured to identify long-term trends over 32 years of continuous campsite use. Our findings reveal substantial changes in area of vegetation cover, exposed soil, and soil erosion on campsites. Although mean campsite size is unchanged, the proportion of campsite area in the "core" has decreased, shifting some use and impact into peripheral "satellite" tenting areas just beyond campsite borders. The ecology of campsites has been significantly altered by a large reduction in number and cover of campsite trees. The number of campsite trees decreased by 44% from 1982 to 2014. Visitors are cutting both on- and off-site trees for firewood, and tree seedlings are rarely able to germinate and survive due to visitor activity. These findings reveal that older campsites are not stable. Long-term camping impacts that are ecologically, managerially, and experientially meaningful are occurring; these impacts could be minimized through more sustainable management practices. These include selecting more resistant sites, such as those with resistant rocky shorelines, and sloping terrain that constrains campsite expansion. Construction and maintenance of tenting sites can attract and spatially concentrate camping impact. Actions to halt tree cutting are also critical. Heavy long-term visitation in protected natural areas requires more sustainable and intensive visitor impact management actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oil sands mining is a major disturbance to boreal landscapes in north-eastern Alberta, Canada. Freshwater peatlands dominate the landscape prior to mining, but the post-mining reclamation landscape will have wetlands that span a salinity gradient. Little is known about the native Vegetation communities in subsaline and saline marshes in the boreal region, yet these communities offer the best potential for reclamation of wetlands after oil sands mining. The overall intent of this study is to provide information oil natural wetland communities along a gradient of salinities that can be used to enhance oil sands wetland reclamation. Our specific study objectives were to: (I) characterize environmental conditions of industrial and natural wetlands, (2) characterize vegetation communities (Composition and diversity) lit these wetlands, (3) and explore how vegetation communities (composition and diversity) may be influenced by environmental conditions. We Surveyed vegetation communities and environmental variables in 25 natural boreal wetlands along a salinity gradient and in 10 industrial marshes ill the oil sands mining region. We observed all electrical conductivity (EC) range of 0.5-28 mS cm(-1) in the wetlands, indicating that salinity similar to or higher than anticipated for oil sands reclamation is naturally present in some boreal wetlands. We observed low species richness in both industrial and natural wetlands. There were 101 plant species observed in all the wetlands, with 82 species recorded in the natural wetlands and 44 species in industrial wetlands. At the plot level, richness decreased with increasing EC and pH, but increased with soil organic matter. Using Cluster Analysis and indicator species analysis we defined 16 distinct vegetation community types, each dominated by one or two species of graminoid vegetation. In general these communities resembled those of boreal or prairie marshes. Electrical conductivity, pH, and water depth were important factors correlating with community composition Of the wetlands, however peat depth and soil organic content did not differ among community types. Not all community types were present in industrial wetlands, indicating that these communities may need to be planted to enhance overall diversity ill future reclaimed oil sands wetlands.

AB  - Human activity is changing environmental conditions on a global scale. Among the ecosystems that are affected by human activities, coral reefs are among the most prominent. In Brazil, the coral reefs of the Corumbau Marine Extractive Reserve (CMER) and Abrolhos National Marine Park (ANMP) in Bahia state have some of the highest coral cover in the South Atlantic Ocean. Hard coral cover, algal cover, and foraminiferal population distribution patterns were used to assess the coral reef benthic environments, and define a background that can be used in worldwide comparisons in future studies. To compare these two monitoring approaches in different coral reef environments, relative frequency data for occurrence of hard coral and algal cover, using point-intercept transects as proposed by the Reef Check protocol, and foraminiferal samples were collected from Corumbau (nearshore) and Abrolhos (offshore) in April 2005. The foraminiferal assemblage was evaluated using the FORAM index (FI - Foraminifera in Reef Assessment and Monitoring), which provides a numeric diagnosis of suitability of benthic habitat to support calcifying organisms that host algal symbionts, originally developed for Caribbean reef areas. Coral cover in the surveyed areas, both in Corumbau and in Abrolhos, ranged from 13% to 37%, while high foraminiferal diversities (H') were found in all stations. Dominance of symbiont-bearing taxa of Amphistegina lessonii and Archaias angulatus only occurred at two shallow stations, Mato Verde and Siriba, both in Abrolhos, where FI>4.00. Stations located in Corumbau and Abrolhos had FI values<4.00. Q-mode cluster analysis showed that foraminifers have specific preferences for physical conditions, especially hydrodynamics and light availability, which influence the FI index. Although coral cover in these areas can be considered good by regional standards, foraminifer analysis showed that the benthic system was unfavorable for symbiont-bearing foraminiferal species at most stations. This discrepancy reveals that the FI must be used with caution in areas other than the northwestern Atlantic and Caribbean where it was developed, and that some coral species can thrive in muddier conditions than can most symbiont-bearing foraminifers.

AB  - In this study, the reaction between Co(III)-EDTA and hypophosphite ion, catalyzed by Pd(II), was chosen as the indicator reaction. The inhibition kinetics of this catalytic reaction were investigated in the presence of iodide ion and the possibility of its analytical application was evaluated. Catalyzers other than PdCl2 (Pt, An and Ni salts) were assayed for the indicator reaction and it was observed that these catalysts have no effect on the reaction. The important variables that affected the reaction rate were investigated and the optimum conditions giving maximum sensitivity were established. The calibration graph, prepared following the inhibition kinetic method, gave a curve exhibiting a linear relationship (r = -0.9878) between the initial rate and iodide concentrations up to 35 ng.mL(-1) I-. Iodide was quantitatively be determined in the range 2-35 ng.mL(-1)I(-) with a detection limit of 1.2 ng.mL(-1)I(-) (3S(b)/M criterion). The RSDs of the method (n = 5) for 7 and 14 ng.mL(-1) are 1.19 and 0.81%, depending on the iodide concentration, respectively. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance over time at 540 nm. Iodide in trace amounts had a strong inhibitory effect under optimum conditions. The possibility of the estimation of trace amounts of iodide based on its inhibitory effect was investigated. The method was applied to the determination of iodide in water, urine, table salt and some drug samples, and was compared with the modified Sandell-Kolthoff method. The determination of the iodide content of biological fluids is important both in malnutrition conditions and in metabolic and epidemiological studies of thyroid diseases. The main advantage of this proposed method for the determination of iodide in urine samples is that it does not necessitate an additional pretreatment step. The quantitative method developed, based on inhibition kinetics, is practical, fast and economical. For this reason, it is a technique open to research for the development of application fields (chemistry, biochemistry, environmental, pharmaceutical chemistry etc.).

AB  - Irregular masses, veins and leaf replacements composed of the phosphate minerals vivianite, mitridatite, anapaite and hydroxylapatite occur in the Sarantaporo-Elassona Upper Miocene lacustrine basin, Thessaly, central Greece. They are hosted in clayey diatomite, Grey to dull green irregular veins of anapaite up to 40 cm thick and spherical concretions up to 2 cm in diameter sporadically occurred at shallow depths. Minor hydroxylapatite rims anapaite masses. Mitridatite occurs in the near surface as greenish-brown veins 5 cm thick, cutting the diatomite or oriented sub-parallel to bedding. The mitridatite veins are rimmed by, and grade into, iron oxides-hydroxides at the surface. In borehole samples, at depths greater than 40 m, bluish vivianite frequently replaces leaves and faecal pellets up to 2 cm in diameter.
   Conditions permitting the precipitation of phosphate minerals in the basin were the deposition of organic matter, a highly reducing environment at depth (possibly in the lake water but certainly in the bottom sediment), and a low availability of calcium during sedimentation, but its subsequent moderate enrichment in groundwater.
   The kind of phosphate formed depended on the diagenetic microenvironment. The diagenetic environment was slightly alkaline (8 > pH > 7). The Ca2+/Fe2+ and Ca2+ phosphates (i.e. anapaite and hydroxylapatite) that occur at shallow burial depths, most likely formed at the expense of the originally formed Fe2+-phosphate vivianite. The progressive substitution of Fe by Ca is attributed to the action of Ca-rich groundwater. The alteration of the ferrous phosphate anapaite to the ferric phosphate mitridatite, plus amorphous iron hydroxides and goethite at the surface, is an indicator of strongly oxidising conditions.
   The Fe2+ ions of the phosphates were derived from the leaching of the ultrabasic and schist basement rocks. The absence of calcite in the diatomite reflects the low calcium content of the lake water during sedimentation. The presence of smectite and vermiculite promoted the adsorption of phosphate ions in the sediments of the basin.
   The accumulation of Fe indicates of the presence of a eutrophic lake environment. The phosphate minerals further suggest stagnant bottom waters and high biological productivity that was promoted by warm-humid conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim To determine how the distribution and cover of different vegetation types are affected by physical factors and livestock in a mountain range with a long evolutionary history of grazing.
   Location Upper vegetation belt of the Cordoba mountains (1700-2800 m a.s.l., 31 degrees 34' S, 64 degrees 50' W) in central Argentina.
   Methods Using GIS, we analysed the relationships of plant cover types to physical features (physiography and topography) and indicators of accumulated livestock pressure (distance to human settlements and roads) through multinomial logistic regression. We predicted a present vegetation map which was validated with a real map. We then constructed two maps simulating minimum and maximum values of accumulated livestock pressure for the whole area. Map comparisons allowed evaluation of the possible influence of livestock, both in extension and intensity.
   Results Both physical features and livestock pressure influenced the occurrence of vegetation units. The overall accuracy of the predicted map at the pixel level was low (26%) indicating low habitat specificity of the vegetation units. We suggest that some part of the unaccounted for variance was due to livestock pressure patterns that were not fully captured by our indicators. Our models proved adequate for predicting the total percentages of vegetation units at coarser scales. The extrapolations showed that under a history of low livestock pressure, such as in sites far away from human settlements and roads, the area would be dominated by woodlands, tussock grasslands and natural rock outcrops. Under a history of heavy livestock pressure, in turn, rock exposed by erosion, tussock grasslands and natural rock outcrops would dominate.
   Main conclusions Vegetation units showed low habitat specificity, and were associated with accumulated livestock pressure, indicating that livestock and its associated activities are important factors structuring the landscape and have important consequences for the integrity of the ecosystem. Results suggest that although this system evolved with large herbivores, it has experienced irreversible degradation processes, and intensification of current domestic livestock pressure is likely to lead to even more land degradation.

AB  - Most biomarkers of lung toxicity presently available require a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Such a procedure cannot be applied for monitoring populations at risk in the industry or environment nor for a regular follow-up of patients with lung disorders. A lung biomarker, measurable in serum, BAL fluid and sputum has recently been identified. This biomarker is a microprotein initially isolated from urine (Urine Protein 1) and subsequently identified as the major secretory product of lung Clara cells which are non-ciliated cells localized predominantly in terminal bronchioles. This protein called Clara cell protein (CC16) is a homodimer of 15.8 kDA. Several lines of evidence indicate that CC16 is a natural immunoregulator protecting the respiratory tract from unwanted inflammatory reactions. CC16 secreted in the respiratory tract diffuses passively by transudation into plasma from where it is rapidly eliminated by glomerular filtration before being taken up and catabolized in proximal tubule cells. Studies reviewed here suggest that CC16 in BAL fluid or serum is a sensitive indicator of acute or chronic bronchial epithelium injury. A significant reduction of CC16 has been found in serum and BAL fluid of asymptomatic smokers. On average serum CC16 decreases by 15% for each 10 pack-year smoking history. Serum CC16 was also found to be decreased in several occupational groups chronically exposed to different air pollutants (silica, dust, welding fumes). A dose-effect relationship with the intensity of exposure to dust has been found in one study on foundry workers. The concentration of CC16 in serum can also be used to detect an acute or chronic disruption of the bronchoalveolar/blood barrier integrity. While confirming the potential interest of CC16 as a lung biomarker, clinical investigations indicate that CC16 might be an important mediator in the development of lung injury. These findings open new perspectives in the assessment of lung toxicity by suggesting that readily diffusible lung-specific proteins may serve as peripheral markers of pneumotoxicity.

AB  - Ecological indicator values (EIV) are a commonly used tool for assessing habitat conditions in various ecosystems. They are relatively rarely used for the analysis of epiphytic communities, which results from objective difficulties in the study of this group of organisms in full height gradient on settled trees. Windthrows provide a rare opportunity to fully analyse the biota diversity of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens. The aim of the study was to determine and compare the EIV variability for bryophytes and lichens in the vertical gradient, from terrestrial to different epiphytic exposures. The fieldworks were carried out on two windthrow areas in the Kampinos National Park (central Poland). A set of floristic lists was prepared within five distinguished parts of trees (trunk base, lower trunk, upper trunk, lower crown and upper crown) and three parts of their uproots (pit, bottom root plate and top root plate) for three species (oak, birch, pine). Ten individuals of each tree species were selected. The average values of five ecological indicator values (light, temperature, continentality, humidity and acidity) were calculated within the examined parts of trees and their uproots. The significance of differences between bryophyte and lichen EIV within same parts of trees and their uproots was checked using Wilcoxon paired test. The significance of differences of EIV calculated for bryophytes and lichens pulled together between distinguished tree and uproot parts were checked with Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney tests. Ordination of researched parts in terms of their EIV was carried out using NMDS method. The values of individual EIV obtained with the use of bryophytes and lichens for the examined parts of trees and their uproots differed significantly in most cases. The values of temperature and continentality in most cases were significantly higher for lichen, which may indicate the need for additional calibration of these indicators for these groups of organisms. The use of both groups of organisms in bioindication has increased the quantity and quality of available ecological information. The research confirmed the usefulness of ecological indicator values as a tool for analysing general habitat conditions in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The Philippine government borrowed heavily from the Asian Development Bank and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to finance its Contract Reforestation Program between 1988 and 1992. People were paid to plant trees on public lands in the first 3 years of the program. A 25-year stewardship agreement succeeds the paid labour arrangement which provides cost benefit sharing between the contractor and the government. Results of the first phase of implementation were poor. On the same site where problematic reforestation projects were assessed in the study are successful small tree farmholdings without government support. The study aimed to determine the success conditions for spontaneous and sustainable tree growing at the farm level. Six cases of farm-based tree growing in northern and central Luzon were investigated. Twenty-six respondents were interviewed using informal and semi-structured questionnaires. de Groot's actor-in-context analysis provided the main inquiry technique (de Groot, W.T., 1992. Environmental Science Theory: Concepts and Methods in a One-World Problem Oriented Paradigm. Elsevier, Amsterdam). The success conditions identified were (1) practice of intercropping, (2) the farmers' direct need for tree products and other uses, (3) assured access or property rights, (4) wood products market prospects, (5) the farmers' economic situation, (6) the farmers' enterprising attitude, (7) building on local options and (8) collective or neighbourhood co-operation. As part of the government intervention for maximum program impact the following steps are recommended: (1) provision of more planting areas with tenurial security; (2) granting of usufruct permits on arable open public lands; (3) making tree growing or conservation measures a condition for progressive attainment of stronger land tenure status; (4) creation of a wood market and other institutional infrastructures; (5) allow any enterprising farmers to encroach on new areas for farm forestry; (6) food security before reforestation concerns; (7) building on what is natural; and (8) flexible and contextualized reforestation plans. Upland farms are potential management units for reforestation. As a management modality farm-based tree growing is appropriate for squatted public lands or areas under stewardship agreement and it is strategic in penetrating the inaccessible and remote sites with a high certainty of success.

AB  - We reconstructed the Holocene developmental history of a kettle-hole peatland in the Tuchola Forest of Northern Poland, using pollen, testat amoebae and plant macrofossil indicators. Our aims were to determine the timing and pattern of autogenic succession and natural and anthropogenic influences on the peatland. Northern Poland is under mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences but has so far been less studied in a palaeoecological context than more oceanic regions of Europe. In the first terrestrial developmental phase of the mire, the testate amoebae-inferred depth to water table revealed two major dry shifts at ca. 9400 (end of lake phase) and ca. 7100 cal BP (a period of global cooling and dry shift in Western Europe). Conditions became wetter again in two steps at ca. 6700 and ca. 5800 BP after a dry event at ca. 6100 BP. The timing of the wet shift at 5800 BP corresponds to wet periods in Western Europe. Peat accumulation rates were low (0.1 mm yr(-1)) between ca. 5600 and ca. 3000 BP when sedges dominated the peatland. In the last 2500 yrs surface moisture fluctuated with wet events at ca. 2750-2400, and 2000 BP, and dry events at ca. 2250-2100 and 1450 BP. After 1450 BP a trend towards wetter conditions culminated at ca. 500 cal BP, possibly caused by local deforestation. Over the mire history, pH (inferred from testate amoebae) was mostly low (around 5) with two short-lived shifts to alkaline conditions (7.5) at ca. 6100 and 1450 BP indicating a minerotrophic influence from surface run-off into the mire. Up to about 1000 BP the ecological shifts inferred from the three proxies agree with palaeoclimatic records from Poland and Western Europe. After this date, however correlation is less clear suggesting an increasing local anthropogenic impact on the mire. This study confirms that kettle-hole peatlands can yield useful palaeoenvironmental data as well as recording land-use change and calls for more comparable studies in regions are the interface between major climate influences.

AB  - Identifying the determinants of the N dynamics ics of plant prunings or litter is important for the efficient management of agroecosystems in order to improve their productivity. The plant materials in these ecosystems are managed as soil surface mulches or are incorporated into the soil. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate which plant chemical parameter best governs N release. In these studies, different plant materials have been incorporated into a soil with a set of known characteristics. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of different soil properties on N release from plant leaves, when they were incorporated into soils under non-leaching conditions. A laboratory incubation experiment (for 8 weeks) was carried out with dried and ground leaves of six leguminous plants and wild sunflower, which were mixed with three soils (alfisol; ultisol, udult: ultisol, humult). Leaf cellulose was the major chemical parameter that determined leaf N release in the alfisol and ultisol, udult. In the ultisol, humult, the C/N ratio and hemicellulose concentration were better related to N release. Cellulose was not a good indicator of N release in the ultisol, humult, possibly due to a low soil pH which did not favour the activity of the cellulose-degrading enzymes of microbes active in decomposition. Soil pH determined the specific C source that was used to generate energy for microbial action and N mineralization/immobilization. It also had an effect on the nitrification of the mineralized N. The levels of labile soil C fractions governed the mode or nature of N release (i.e. mineralization or immobilization). The levels of labile leaf C fractions incorporated into the soils governed the extent of N release. The soil N concentration in the decomposable organic matter pool, as compared to the leaf N concentration, determined whether leaf N limited its own release. It is recommended from this study that, in grouping different leaf materials as sources of N, the properties of soils into which they are incorporated should also be considered, in addition to leaf quality in terms of its chemical composition. In future studies, the relationships identified under laboratory conditions in this experiment should be verified under field conditions.

AB  - The author analyses literature data on anomalies of limbs in Anura. It is shown that published data is usually not enough to discuss either conditions of appearance or the causes of anomalies. Traditional statistical methods does not adequately characterise the frequency of anomalies. The author suggests a new criteria for ascertaining the fact of appearance of mass anomalies. A number of experimental data don't correspond to current theoretical ideas about the nature of anomalies. It is considered to distinguish "background" and "mass" anomalies. "Background" anomalies can not be a good indicator of unfavourable condition of development.

AB  - This paper provides an assessment of the links between residential satisfaction with the housing sector and the overall quality of life (QOL) in Bandar Tun Razak area (BTR). As the QOL concept is multidimensional, five domains were selected to measure the overall QOL namely; economic capacity, safety condition, social involvement and community participation, physical and emotional health, and spiritual life. While for the housing sector, the study involved 32 indicators that cover the different housing features. Besides, In order to obtain a representative sample, a stratified convenient sampling was employed and 331 questionnaires were collected. The findings show that respondents were slightly unsatisfied with safety condition and economic capacity, whereas they were only slightly satisfied with social and community participation which require further attention to the improvement of these three domains. Moreover, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was applied on the housing indicators resulting in the extraction of five factors which are: housing size, neighbourhood quality, public facilities, housing suitability, and housing quality. Among these five factors, it was found that the housing size affects the overall residential satisfaction highly. Eventually, a path diagram was employed to measure links between the housing sub-domains and QOL domains. The results show that the housing size and public facilities influence the economic capacity domain effectively. While the neighbourhood quality and housing suitability affect both safety condition and social and community participation domains.

AB  - Sludge samples taken from different sources and times may have different characteristics that could affect dewatering performance. In this study, 20 sludge samples from five wastewater treatment plants and different seasons in 1 year were characterized. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that solid content (SC), total suspended solid (TSS), polysaccharides and proteins contents had positive correlations with the capillary suction time (CST), whereas volatile suspended-solid/total suspended solid (VSS/TSS) exhibited negative correlations with CST. Moreover, no correlations between CST and specific resistance to filtration were found among these different sludge samples. The principal component analysis confirmed that only two group variables could represent most of the sludge characteristic parameters. The first set of variables represents the particulate nature of the biotic factors (SC, VSS/TSS, SCOD, TSS, polysaccharides and proteins), and the second set is the pH. CST could not be a reasonable indicator of dewaterability in sludge deep dewatering by Fe2+/S2O8 (2-)-phosphogypsum composite conditioning. Furthermore, the results of diaphragm filter press dewatering showed that initial SC and VSS/TSS were the most dominant sludge characteristics affecting the solid content of dewatered cake (R (p) = 0.610, p = 0.016; R (p) = -0.838, p = 0.000, respectively) with Fe2+/S2O8 (2-)-phosphogypsum composite conditioning. Results from this study suggest that dewatering performance is predictable by sludge characteristics parameters for Fe2+/S2O8 (2-)-phosphogypsum conditioning.

AB  - Biodegradation of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl) phosphorothioate) in sediments from wetlands and agricultural drains in San Joaquin Valley, CA was investigated. Sediments were collected monthly, spiked with chlorpyrifos, and rates of chlorpyrifos degradation were measured using a standardized aerobic biodegradation assay. Phosphoesterase enzyme activities were measured and phosphotriesterase activity was related to observed biodegradation kinetics. First-order biodegradation rates varied between 0.02 and 0.69 day(-1), after accounting for abiotic losses. The average rate of abiotic chlorpyrifos hydrolysis was 0.02d(-1) at pH 7.2 and 30 degrees C. Sediments from the site exhibiting the highest chlorpyrifos degradation capacity were incubated under anaerobic conditions to assess the effect of redox conditions on degradation rates. Half-lives were 5 and 92 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. There was a consistent decrease in observed biodegradation rates at one site due to permanently flooded conditions prevailing during one sampling year. These results suggest that wetland management strategies such as allowing a wet-dry cycle could enhance degradation rates. There was significant correlation between phosphotriesterase (PTE) activity and the chlorpyrifos biotransformation rates, with this relationship varying among sites. PTE activities may be useful as an indicator of biodegradation potential with reference to the previously established site-specific correlations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional methods for detecting indicator and pathogenic bacteria in water may underestimate the actual population due to sublethal environmental injury, inability of the target bacteria to take up nutrients and other physiological factors which reduce bacterial culturability. Rapid and direct methods are needed to more accurately detect and enumerate active bacteria. Such a methodological advance would provide greater sensitivity in assessing the microbiological safety of water and food. The principle goal of this presentation is to describe novel approaches we have formulated for the rapid and simultaneous detection of bacteria plus the determination of their physiological activity in water and other environmental samples. The present version of our method involves the concentration of organisms by membrane filtration or immunomagnetic separation and combines an intracellular fluorochrome (CTC) for assessment of respiratory activity plus fluorescent-labelled antibody detection of specific bacteria. This approach has also been successfully used to demonstrate spatial and temporal heterogeneities of physiological activities in biofilms when coupled with cryosectioning. Candidate physiological stains include those capable of determining respiratory activity, membrane potential, membrane integrity, growth rate and cellular enzymatic activities. Results obtained thus fat indicate that immunomagnetic separation can provide a high degree of sensitivity in the recovery of seeded target bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7) in water and hamburger. The captured and stained target bacteria are then enumerated by either conventional fluorescence microscopy or ChemScan(R), a new instrument that is very sensitive and rapid. The ChemScan(R) laser scanning instrument (Chemunex, Paris, France) provides the detection of individual fluorescently labelled bacterial cells using three emission channels in less than 5 min. A high degree of correlation has been demonstrated between results obtained with the ChemScan and traditional plate counts of mixed natural bacterial populations in water. The continuing evolution of these methods will be valuable in the rapid and accurate analysis of environmental samples.

AB  - Conservation is likely to be most successful if it draws on knowledge from across the natural and social sciences. The ecosystem services concept has been called a boundary object in that it facilitates development of such interdisciplinary knowledge because it offers a common platform for researchers, policy makers, and practitioners. However, a question that remains is to what extent the interdisciplinary knowledge needed is provided by disciplinary diversity within the field. We asked where is knowledge on ecosystem services produced, how interdisciplinary is this knowledge, and which disciplines facilitate the greatest disciplinary integration? We defined interdisciplinarity as the extent to which published research draws on knowledge that crosses disciplinary borders and used citations as a quantitative indicator of communication among disciplines, based on journal classification. We used disciplinary diversity, richness, and heterocitation as measures of interdisciplinarity and betweenness centrality as a measure of disciplinary integration. Our data set contained 22,153 publications on ecosystem services, published from 1983 to 2018. We found that ecosystem services research matured; average yearly output growth was 33.8%, more than the 8-9% growth in scientific output across all fields. Over time, the network clustering coefficient, measuring connectedness of individual disciplines, rose from 0.388 to 0.727, suggesting increased density in the network of citations. Researchers in the field published more articles (3566 in 2018 alone) across more disciplines (77 unique disciplines in 2018). However, this growth was not mirrored by an increase in the diversity (stable at 0.7-0.9) or richness (averaging 0.35 unique disciplines per citation) of citation patterns. Heterocitation scores, or out-of-group citations, for arts, humanities, social sciences, and law ranged from 56% to 64%, which was lower than we expected, although this may serve to protect the integrity of social science disciplines and attract broader engagement from within. Ultimately, a small number of productive disciplines are central to supporting disciplinary integration. However, opportunities exist for conservation practice to draw on a broader field of research, to realize the potential that the diverse body of knowledge of interdisciplinary work offers.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms are transforming a variety of research areas with accuracy levels that the traditional methods cannot compete with. Recently, increasingly more research efforts have been put into the structural health monitoring domain. In this work, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network, namely SHMnet, for a challenging structural condition identification case, that is, steel frame with bolted connection damage. We perform systematic studies on the optimisation of network architecture and the preparation of the training data. In the laboratory, repeated impact hammer tests are conducted on a steel frame with different bolted connection damage scenarios, as small as one bolt loosened. The time-domain monitoring data from a single accelerometer are used for training. We conduct parametric studies on different layer numbers, different sensor locations, the quantity of the training datasets and noise levels. The results show that the proposed SHMnet is effective and reliable with at least four independent training datasets and by avoiding vibration node points as sensor locations. Under up to 60% additive Gaussian noise, the average identification accuracy is over 98%. In comparison, the traditional methods based on the identified modal parameters inevitably fail due to the unnoticeable changes of identified natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results provide confidence in using the developed method as an effective structural condition identification framework. It has the potential to transform the structural health monitoring practice. The code and relevant information can be found at .

AB  - The life-history theories of aging predict lifetime trade-offs between early reproductive allocation and late-life survival, reproduction, or both components of fitness. Recent studies in wild populations have found evidence for these early-late life trade-offs, but rarely have they been found across multiple traits while exploring the additional effects of variation in environmental conditions and individual quality. Benefiting from longitudinal data on adult female mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), we investigated the influence of age at first reproduction (AFR) and early reproductive success (ERS) on longevity, late reproductive success, and senescence rates while accounting for the influence of natal environmental conditions and individual quality. Contrary to predictions, we did not find evidence for early-late life trade-offs. Instead, an earlier AFR and a greater ERS had positive but weak direct effects on late reproductive success. Natal population density, however, was the strongest determinant of all life-history traits, having a direct negative effect on female longevity, late reproductive success, AFR, and ERS. Although natal density reduced the probability of annual reproduction and annual survival during adulthood, higher allocation to reproduction in early life and poorer natal conditions did not lead to accelerated rates of senescence during adulthood. The results of this investigation provide an integrated picture of early-late life trade-offs, underscoring the importance of accounting for environmental conditions because of their potentially strong implications for population dynamics.

AB  - Pollution on electrical insulators is one of the greatest causes of failure of substations subjected to high levels of salinity and environmental pollution. Considering leakage current as the main indicator of pollution on insulators, this paper focuses on establishing the effect of the environmental conditions on the risk of failure due to pollution on insulators and determining the significant change in the magnitude of the pollution on the insulators during dry and humid periods. Hierarchical segmentation analysis was used to establish the effect of environmental conditions on the risk of failure due to pollution on insulators. The Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized to determine the significant changes in the magnitude of the pollution due to climate periods. An important result was the discovery that leakage current was more common on insulators during dry periods than humid ones. There was also a higher risk of failure due to pollution during dry periods. During the humid period, various temperatures and wind directions produced a small change in the risk of failure. As a technical result, operators of electrical substations can now identify the cause of an increase in risk of failure due to pollution in the area. The research provides a contribution towards the behaviour of the leakage current under conditions similar to those of the Colombian Caribbean coast and how they affect the risk of failure of the substation due to pollution.

AB  - In this paper, we assess and develop a climate service focused on the production of seasonal predictions for summer wildfires in a Mediterranean region through a participatory approach with end-users. We start by building a data-driven model that links a drought indicator (Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI) with a series of burned areas in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). Afterwards, we feed this model with SPEI forecasts obtained through a combination of the antecedent observed conditions and climatology. Finally, we assess the forecasting skill of the system by using cross-validation to evaluate the predictions as if they had been made operationally. Our fire forecasting system reveals an untapped and useful burned area predictive ability. We argue that this source of predictability is mostly attributable to the effect of observed initial conditions on summer drought conditions. This system was conceived with the stakeholders, merging climate-driven predictions with information that is of interests to the users, including the identification of climate variables, thresholds and models. The co-production of this customized system allows fire-risk outlooks to be translated into usable information for fire management. This fire forecasting ability plays a crucial role in developing proactive fire management practices such as long-term fuel assessment and other fire-risk planning, thus minimising the impact of adverse climate conditions on summer burned area.

AB  - Scenario-based pollutant load analysis was conducted to develop a part of a concept for planning and management of wastewater treatment systems (WWTSs) under the mixture conditions of centralised and on-site WWTSs. Pollutant discharge indicators and pollutant removal efficiency functions were applied from another paper in the series, which were developed based on the existing conditions in urban and peri-urban areas of Bangkok, Thailand. Two scenarios were developed to describe development directions of the mixture conditions. Scenario 1 involves keeping the on-site wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) within the areas of centralised WWTSs. Scenario 2 is dividing the centralised and on-site WWTS areas. Comparison of the smallest values of total pollutant discharge per capita (PDCtotal) between Scenarios 1 and 2 showed that the smallest PDCtotal in Scenario 1 was smaller than that in Scenario 2 for biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus whereas the smallest PDCtotal in Scenario 2 was smaller than that in Scenario 1 for total nitrogen, total coliforms and faecal coliforms. The results suggest that the mixture conditions could be a possible reason for smaller pollutant concentrations at centralised WWTPs. Quantitative scenario-based estimation of PDCtotal is useful and a prerequisite in planning and management of WWTSs.

AB  - The Pleistocene volcanic paleosols of Armenia and Mexico combine the features of both arid and humid pedogeneses. They were studied in order to reconstruct the environmental conditions during the period of the initial settlement of humans in these areas. The main attention was paid to the micromorphological analysis of the pedogenic features. The pedocomplexes studied in Armenia have been forming since the Early Pleistocene. They bear evidences of humid (weathering, clay illuviation, and gleying) and arid (calcification) pedogeneses alternating in different soil layers and pointing to climatic cycles. The nonuniform lithology of the soil profiles is related to pulsating volcanic activity. Mexican paleosols of the Late Pleistocene period are similar to the lower layers of the soils in Armenia with respect to the features characteristic of the humid and arid phases of pedogenesis. This allows us to suggest that the early stages of the formation of the Armenian pedocomplex proceeded under warmer paleoclimatic conditions similar to those of a tropical climate. It is shown that the arid pedogenesis may erase the features produced during the previous stage of humid pedogenesis. The studied paleosols are characterized by the destruction of the features inherited from the humid phase (the clayey groundmass and illuviation coatings) by the newly forming calcite. Paleopedological records point to the fact that the paleoenvironmental conditions during the periods of the initial settlement of humans in both regions differed significantly from the modern environmental conditions in these regions.

AB  - The metabolic activity of cells (MAC) of the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus was studied. The MAC level of F. vesiculosus was increased in oil-polluted environment. The period of formation of response to the addition of toxicant depends on the habitat conditions of the alga. Metabolic activity increased within several minutes in plants taken from the clean area and on the 3rd day of exposure in plants from the oil-polluted area. The MAC level of F. vesiculosus can be used as an indicator of the presence of stressful factors in algal habitat.

AB  - The energetic status of fishes represents energy stored as protein and lipids and reflects the ability of an individual to reproduce, migrate, and transition through life stages, ultimately influencing survival. However, traditional measurement methods, while highly accurate, are time consuming, expensive, and lethal, and nonlethal methods such as condition factor may not adequately characterize energetic status. We collected 161 Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) from four interior Alaska river basins with varying hydrologic regimes during early summer and autumn seasons, and used multiple regression and model selection to evaluate the efficacy of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a nonlethal condition assessment method, to predict percent dry mass and percent lipid content estimated from proximate analysis. We found that Arctic grayling energetic status varied across seasons, by sex, and fish from sites with spawning runs of Pacific salmon had higher energy content than those from sites without salmon, potentially due to the influence of salmon-derived food subsidies. Electrical measurements explained 82% and 80% of the variability in percent dry mass and percent total lipids, respectively, and top models showed high predictive performance (observed vs. predicted root mean squared error <= 2.2%). Overall, we found the BIA approach to provide rapid, precise, and non-lethal estimates of Arctic grayling body condition. Such an approach may be useful for future work to characterize Arctic grayling bioenergetics and monitor fish condition under a rapidly changing Arctic environment.

AB  - Background and aims - Deforestation and forest degradation have hugely affected the Southern Ethiopian Rift Valley, jeopardizing biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning. Quantifying the impacts of human activities on the remaining woody plant communities and recognizing vegetation-enviromnent relationships provide the basis for targeted conservation and rehabilitation.
   Material and methods - The study was performed in the Nech Sar National Park (NSNP). Based on a large systematic vegetation survey of 104 plots, we quantified the woody vegetation composition, and we provided a vegetation classification based on Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling, cluster analysis and indicator species analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated vegetation - environment relationships and the effects of human disturbance on community composition and woody plant species richness and diversity.
   Key results - Our analyses revealed three very distinct woody vegetation types (Acacia mellifera-Combretum aculeatum; Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius-Deinbollia kilimandscharica and Acacia polyacantha-Ficus sycomorus) which were significantly differentiated by soil pH, electrical conductivity, available soil phosphorus and organic matter, and by elevation. Human disturbance, as quantified by a compound Human Disturbance Index (HDI) significantly affected community composition, species richness and diversity, and was significantly positively correlated with species richness and diversity. The latter is likely due to intermediate levels of disturbance and encroachment of disturbance affiliated shrubs such as Dichrostachys cinerea, Lantana camara, and Acalypha fruticosa. Furthermore, the demographic structure of key woody species such as Acacia poyacantha, Acacia tortilis, Balanites aegyptiaca, Diospyros abyssinica, Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius and Terminalia brownii, showed impacts of human disturbance.
   Conclusion - Our results provide a baseline for further conservation actions in the NSNP which should be differentially targeted on the different plant community types. Overall, human disturbance seems not to have resulted yet in species richness declines, although it has started to affect the integrity of the delineated vegetation types and resulted in small scale succession.

AB  - Condition monitoring of natural gas distribution networks is a fundamental prerequisite for evaluating safety of the operation during the lifetime of the system. Due to the high level of uncertainty in the observed data, predicting the operational reliability of the networks is complicated. Moreover, there is a fluctuation in most of the monitoring data in different time scales, as most of the derived data tend to be of non-stationary nature and are complex to model or forecast. Therefore, a more realistic data driven approach for developing a reliability framework needs to be considered. This paper aims at proposing a probabilistic model to predict the complexity of the non-stationary behaviour in monitoring data. It also aims at developing a novel framework for the time dependent reliability assessment of a natural gas distribution system using condition-monitoring data. To this end a methodology by integrating Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) is developed. The advantages of the methodology are demonstrated through a case study of a Natural Gas Regulating and Metering Station operating in Italy.

AB  - This article uses "extreme-bound"-type analysis to revisit the determinants behind the widely differing economic growth in Russian regions prior to the recent global financial crisis. Using data of regional growth in 1995-2006 for 77 Russian regions, it examines the growth drivers for the phase of economic decline up to 1998 and for the period of strong growth afterwards separately. Looking at forty variables considered to be potentially related to growth, it determines, for each of the two periods, the ones robustly associated with Russian economic performance. Among the variables considered are proxies of politico-institutional features, indicators of economic reform, and measurements of both economic and non-economic initial conditions. The main findings are as follows: during the period of economic decline up to 1998, differences in Russian regional growth were almost entirely driven by initial conditions, with resource and human capital endowments, industrial structure, and geographical location playing the dominant roles. However, after the 1998 crisis, the importance of initial conditions declined and was basically reduced to fuel production, advantageous geographical location, and population structure. There is also some evidence that more reform-oriented policies and better regional leadership made a difference. These results could be seen as pointing to determinants of economic performance in periods of actual economic decline being different from those in normal times of economic growth.

AB  - The Orange River estuary is a Ramsar site that has been placed on the Montreux Record following the degradation of 300 ha of salt marsh. The groundwater and surface sediments are hypersaline and above the tolerance range of the dominant plant Sarcocornia pillansii. This study measured the sediment characteristics in 2005 (dry conditions) and in 2006 (flood and high rainfall). The sediment EC ranged from 120.9 +/- 4.7 mS cm(-1) in 2005 to 52.5 +/- 4.8 mS cm(-1) in 2006 with sediment moisture content sufficient for the germination of seed during both years (9.7 +/- 0.7%). The small areas of remaining S. pillansii have the potential to produce 40 billion seeds, which would be sufficient to revegetate the desertified marsh, but due to hypersaline sediment conditions the successful establishment and survival of the seedlings remain low, Many seeds (3616 m(-2)) and seedlings (1296 m(-2)) were found in drift lines in 2006. Microhabitats created by the adult vegetation also provided favourable conditions for seed germination. Laboratory studies indicated that seeds of S. pillansii germinate best in freshwater (40% at 0 psu compared to 5% at 35 psu). Exposure to hypersaline conditions (70 psu) decreased the viability of the seeds, The potential of the marsh to rehabilitate naturally therefore depends on sufficient freshwater entering the marsh.

AB  - Epiphyllous liverworts form a special group of bryophytes that primarily grow on leaves of understory vascular plants, occurring in constantly moist and warm evergreen forest in tropical and subtropical regions. They are very sensitive to climate change and environmental pollution. Previous studies have focused largely on microhabitat preferences of epiphyllous liverworts and demonstrated the importance of climate factors such as humidity, temperature and light. However, little is known about the relationship between distribution of epiphyllous liverworts and macro-habitat factors at broad spatial scales. Here, we predicated the distribution of epiphyllous liverworts in China based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices at a 1 km spatial resolution using presence-only ecological niche models. We used the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) to validate the models, and then used the Wilcoxon paired test to compare model performances. Furthermore, we applied the jackknife test to identify the important factors affecting predictions. Our results showed that the highest accuracy (i.e., AUC = 0.98 and TSS = 0.93) in predicting epiphyllous liverworts was achieved by the model that combined climatic and remotely sensed vegetation variables. The satellite-derived annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as the annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) emerged as the most important predictors of distribution patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, while climatic variables such as precipitation in the wettest quarter and temperature of the coldest quarter were of ancillary importance. The significant contributions of NDVI and NDWI in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, and the strong relationship between this species and evergreen forest implies that epiphyllous liverworts may be a useful indicator for forest degradation or integrity at broad spatial scales.

AB  - The paper compares the results of two studies of salt damage at the Wakefield Tower, Tower of London. The first, in 1993, was based on semi-quantitative salt analysis and hygroscopicity measurements. The second was based on quantitative analysis and a thermodynamic model, ECOS. Both studies aimed to predict environmental conditions that would minimise salt damage to the interior stonework. Their predictions are markedly different, and this paper examines the reasons for the differences. It is shown that hygroscopicity alone is not a reliable indicator of crystallisation from mixed salt solutions.

AB  - Many studies assess the impact of anthropogenic activities in water bodies using methods that focus on physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of water. The use of benthic invertebrates as tools for biomonitoring protocols helps the understanding of those impacts, when these modifications cannot be explained only by the water characteristics. We analyzed the environmental characteristics and invertebrate fauna structure in an 80 m extension of streams located in four micro-basins. This reach-scale analysis included streams of three riparian vegetation conservation states: preserved in both riverbanks (forested), removed in both riverbanks for pasture (pasture), and one riverbank with riparian vegetation and another with pasture (intermediate). The environmental data analysis indicated a clear separation between the forested and pasture streams, emphasizing the interaction of the state of riparian vegetation's preservation with some habitat characteristics, such as width, substrate type and shelter for the fauna. Our initial hypothesis about the benthic invertebrates' structure was to find in streams with conserved riparian vegetation a benthic fauna composed mainly by groups more specialized and dependent on coarse substrate and plant material imported from the forest and used as shelter and food resource. This hypothesis was confirmed, with higher abundance of groups sensitive to pollution, such as Plecoptera and Trichoptera, mainly in preserved streams. However, when analyzed together the environmental characteristics and the OTUs that best explained the land uses' differences (RDA analysis), in two micro-basins there was more fauna's similarity between intermediate and pasture profiles, and in the other two the three profiles differed from each other. These differences may be related not only to reach-scale physical characteristics, but also to catchment-scale attributes of each micro-basin, as the invertebrate distribution and abundance are influenced by a variety of physical/biological factors at different scales. Thus, the study of the possible influence of riparian vegetation conservation states on habitat characteristics and benthic invertebrate structure seems to be dependent on the spatial scale analyzed.

AB  - To determine the environmental impact of oil-combustion pollutants and soil dust on a lichen, we examined the spectral reflectance of thalli of the epiphytic fruticose lichen, Ramalina duriaei, expressed as Values of NDVI (the normalized difference vegetation index). We analyzed electrolyte leakage caused by degradation of cell, membranes in terms of electric conductivity of water, apart from chlorophyll degradation, the latter expressed as changes in the A435 nm/A415 nm ratio to indicate the physiological status of the lichen. The concentrations of Al, Cr, Fe, K, Ni, P, sulfate-S, Ti and V in the lichen thallus were measured to quantify the degree of pollution. Thalli of R. duriaei, growing in a nature reserve on the periphery of a 40-year-old industrial town, Ashdod, in southwest Israel were compared with thalli of R. duriaei from an unpolluted forest in the northeastern part of the country transplanted to the polluted areas in and around the town. After an exposure for 10 months, many transplants exhibited lower NDVI values, higher electric conductivity values as well as a lower A435 nm/A415 nm ratio. The three physical/physiological parameters thus reflected severe injury in the lichen transplants. The concentrations of Al, Cr, Fe, Ni, sulfate-S, Ti and V in the lichen transplants were found to correlate inversely with the NDVI values, whereas the concentrations of Fe, Ni, Ti and V were found to correlate with electric conductivity. The decrease in the A435 nm/A415 nm ratio was found to correlate with high concentrations of Al, Fe, Ni, sulfate-S, Ti and V in the lichen transplants, whereas the concentration of K and P correlated with both the NDVI value and the A435 nm/A415 nm ratio. It is concluded that in situ thalli of R. duriaei, the only indigenous fruticose lichen growing in the region of Ashdod, are endangered by the presence of pollutants and by acid rain due to the combustion of heavy fuel oil.

AB  - 1. The application of fungicides is considered an indispensable measure to secure crop production. These substances, however, may unintentionally enter surface waters via run-off, potentially affecting the microbial community. To assess such risks adequately, authorities recently called for suitable test designs involving relevant aquatic micro-organisms.
   2. We assessed the structural and functional responses of leaf-associated microbial communities, which play a key role in the breakdown of allochthonous leaf material in streams, towards the inorganic fungicides copper (Cu) and elemental sulphur (S). These substances are of particular interest as they are authorized for both conventional and organic farming in many countries of the world. We used the food choice of the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum (indicative for micro-organism-mediated leaf palatability) as well as microbial leaf decomposition as functional endpoints. Moreover, the leaf-associated microbial communities were characterized by means of bacterial density, fungal biomass and community composition facilitating mechanistic understanding of the observed functional effects.
   3. While Gammarus preferred Cu-exposed leaves over unexposed ones, microbial leaf decomposition was reduced by both Cu and S (up to 30%). Furthermore, Cu exposure decreased bacterial densities (up to 60%), stimulated the growth of leaf-associated fungi (up to 100%) and altered fungal community composition, while S did not affect any of the assessed structural endpoints.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We observed both structural and functional changes in leafassociated microbial communities at inorganic fungicide concentrations realistic for surface water bodies influenced by conventional and organic farming. Our data hence justify a careful re-evaluation of the environmental safety of the agricultural use of these compounds. Moreover, inclusion of an experimental design similar to the one used in this study in lower tier environmental risk assessments of antimicrobial compounds may aid to safeguard the integrity of aquatic microbial communities and the functions they provide.

AB  - Prioritizing is essential to optimize resource allocation and restoration benefits. Bauxite mining is an important economic activity in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil. The exploitation process of this ore creates demands for compensatory forest restoration, which may be directed to key areas for conservation such as the Buffer Zone of the Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (BZ-SBSP). The objective of this study was to propose a new application of Multicriteria Evaluation based on Geographic Information Systems (MCE-GIS) to suggest priority areas for compensatory forest restoration in BZ-SBSP by using criteria important at the landscape level and in the field. The modeling of priority areas followed a suitability scale approach, which varied from 0 to 255, using five factors: permanent preservation areas, slope, land use and land cover, distance from conserved forest fragments and ecological corridors. The factors were aggregated under three different risk scenarios: Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), low risk Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) and high-risk OWA. Suitability increased with the risk assumed in the analysis. The area corresponding to the very high priority class increased from 0.31% in the most conservative scenario to 10.72% in the riskiest scenario. The high-risk OWA scenario can be considered the best alternative for presenting a greater number of viable options and high suitability in at least some factors. The maps generated in this study may support multiple stakeholders to identify and direct resources to high priority sites. It is important to highlight that a set of economic, social, and technical factors may still restrict the restoration of an area indicated as high priority. Thus, this study can be considered as general guidelines for restoration planning, suggesting areas that should result in greater benefits derived from forest restoration and in greater success of the projects, when considering the landscape of interest, its integrity and other relevant aspects that should be considered in a restoration project.

AB  - Purpose Within most environmental contexts, the collection of 'undisturbed' samples is widely relied upon in studies of soil and sediments. However, the impact of sampler-induced disturbance is rarely acknowledged, despite the potential significance of modification to sediment structure for the robustness of data interpretation. In this study, 3D computed X-ray microtomography (mu CT) is used to evaluate and compare the disturbance imparted by four commonly used sediment sampling methods within a coastal salt marsh. Materials and methods Paired sediment core samples from a restored salt marsh at Orplands Farm, Essex, UK, were collected using four common sampling methods (push, cut, hammer and gouge methods). Sampling using two different area-ratio cores resulted in a total of 16 cores that were scanned with mu CT to identify and evaluate sediment structural properties of samples that can be attributed to sampling method. Results and discussion 3D qualitative analysis identifies a suite of sampling disturbance structures including gross-scale changes to sediment integrity and substantial modification of pore space, structure and distribution, independent of sediment strength and stiffness. Quantitative assessment of changes to pore space and sediment density arising from the four sampling methods offers a means of direct comparison between the impact of depth sampling methods. Considerable disturbance to samples results from use of push, hammer and auguring samplers, whilst least disturbance is found in samples recovered by cutting and advanced trimming approaches. Conclusions In many environmental studies involving sediment recovery through coring or other depth sampling, there is no such thing as an undisturbed sediment sample. The novel use of mu CT scanning of sealed sediment cores has enabled the identification and evaluation of the nature and extent of sample disturbance resulting from four common types of sediment recovery methods. Depth sampling and coring methods remain key tools for understanding sediments and soils, but referring to undisturbed sediment sampling is no longer tenable without supporting evidence.

KW  - COMPARATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT
AB  - Following the Earth Summit in 1992, Cuba designed and implemented a variety of programs, administrative structures, and public awareness activities to promote sound environmental management and sustainable development. This came shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the strengthening of the US blockade in 1990, which resulted in a 35% drop in Cuban GDP. This period, referred to as the Special Period, witnessed a decrease in many environmentally damaging activities both by choice and by necessity, but also resulted in many decisions to resuscitate the Cuban economy. The purpose of this work was to compare and rank the environmental risks Cuba faced before and during the Special Period (1990-2000) using two Comparative environmental risk assessments (CERAs). To do so, an ecosystem integrity risk assessment matrix was constructed with 42 risk end points. The matrix assessed the fisk posed by 17 problem areas including air pollution, water contamination, solid waste sites, pesticides and ecosystem degradation. The risks were calculated using five criteria: area affected, vulnerability of affected population, severity of impact, irreversibility of effect and uncertainty. To construct this matrix, both literature reviews and expert interviews in Cuba were conducted in 2000. The results showed a general decrease in risk scores during the Special Period. Before the Special Period, high risks were posed by: terrestrial degradation and industrial wastewater and sludge, followed by freshwater degradation, surface water stressors, and pesticides. After the Special Period, industrial wastewater and sludge and pesticides were no longer high-risk areas, but municipal wastewater and marine coastal degradation ranked higher than previously. Also, the fisk endpoints most stressed after 1990 were affected by activities controlled by the government, such as mining and tourism, and lack of infrastructure. Therefore, the claims that public environmental education is the main pathway to sustainable development in Cuba seem uninformed and other management practices should be evaluated.

AB  - Ellenberg indicator values for plant species are widely used metrics in ecology, providing a proxy measure of environmental conditions, without direct measurements. They integrate environmental conditions over time since species will only persist where conditions are favourable. Ellenberg moisture (F) values summarise the hydrological environment experienced by plants. However, the relationship between indicator values and hydrological metrics appears to be influenced by a range of other abiotic and biotic factors, limiting our ability to fully interpret Ellenberg F. Focussing on Ellenberg F, we evaluated how the unweighted mean plant community F value to hydrology, specifically water table depth, is influenced by other environmental factors, ground cover type and alpha diversity in UK seasonal coastal wetlands (dune slacks). As expected, water table depth had the strongest influence on unweighted mean Ellenberg F. We show that unweighted mean Ellenberg F was more sensitive to changes in water table levels for plant communities that were more nutrient limited, when the organic matter layer was thicker and there was less bare ground cover. Unweighted mean Ellenberg F was consistently lower for a given water table depth, when there was lower atmospheric nitrogen deposition, lower loss of ignition (a measure of organic matter content) and more diverse plant communities. These findings help us to better interpret what Ellenberg F indicator values tell us about hydrological conditions, by understanding the factors which alter that relationship.

AB  - Alterations to flow regimes from regulation and climatic change both affect the biophysical functioning of rivers over long time periods and large spatial areas. Historically, however, the effects of these flow alteration drivers have been studied separately. In this study, results from unregulated and regulated river management models were assessed to understand how flow regime alterations from river regulation differ under future climate conditions in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Four representative flow alteration metricsmean annual flow, low flow duration, centroid timing and mean weekly rate of decreasewere calculated and statistically characterized under historical and future unregulated and regulated conditions over a 20-year period at each of the eight regulated river locations below dams across the Sierra Nevada. Future climatic conditions were represented by assuming an increase in air temperature of 6 degrees C above historical (1981-2000) air temperatures, with no change in other meteorological conditions. Results indicate that climate warming will measurably alter some aspects of the flow regime. By comparison, however, river regulation with business-as-usual operations will alter flow regimes much more than climate warming. Existing reservoirs can possibly be used to dampen the anticipated effects of climate warming through improved operations, though additional research is needed to identify the full suite of such possibilities.

AB  - Background: Understanding the biological basis of complex, heritable illnesses such as schizophrenia is facilitated by sensitive and functionally specific measures of intermediate processes. Context processing is a theoretically motivated construct associated with executive function. Impairments in this process have been associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. In the present study, we evaluated whether a specific deficit in context processing could be associated with the unexpressed genetic liability to schizophrenia.
   Methods: Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia, 24 unaffected siblings and 36 control subjects completed a version of the AX task with (1) a condition that required context processing and (2) an expectancy condition in which intact context processing could lead to errors.
   Results: Patients and unaffected siblings performed relatively worse in the context processing condition, whereas controls performed relatively worse in the expectancy condition. A double dissociation between siblings and controls (F = 9.5, P<.005) constituted strong evidence of a specific deficit in context processing associated with a familial or genetic liability to schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence of high diagnostic efficiency was also noted (specificity, 38%; and sensitivity, 100%).
   Conclusions: Context processing deficits have been associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Such a dysfunction may occur even when genetic liability to schizophrenia is unexpressed clinically. The present method of demonstrating a double dissociation may be a useful approach to exploring endophenotypes related to specific cognitive and neural processes that can be measured in ways sensitive to subtle group differences.

AB  - Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum are important phytopathogens which contaminate cereals in the Mediterranean climatic region with fumonisins. In this study we examined the interaction between the fungicide efficacy of tebuconazole and water potential (Psi(w)) (-0.7-7.0 MPa) x temperature (20-35 degrees C) on growth and FUM1 gene expression by real time RT-PCR (an indicator of fumonisin biosynthesis) in strains of both Fusarium species. Concentrations of tebuconazole required to reduce growth by 50 and 90% (ED50 and ED90 values) were determined. Growth of strains of both species was largely reduced by tebuconazole, with similar efficacy profiles in the interacting water potential x temperature conditions. In contrast, FUM1 expression was not generally reduced by tebuconazole. Moreover, sub-lethal doses in combination with mild water stress and temperatures less than 35 degrees C significantly induced FUM1 expression with slight differences in both species. These results suggest that the efficacy of antifungal compounds to reduce mycotoxin risk would be more effective if consideration is given to both growth rate and toxin biosynthesis in relation to interacting environmental conditions. This is the first study linking fungicide efficacy of tebuconazole with environmental factor effects on control of growth and FUM1 gene expression of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum.

AB  - Squat lobster populations found in the Humboldt Current System over the continental shelf from similar to 28 to 37A degrees S release pelagic larvae in sub-surface cold (similar to 11 A degrees C) hypoxic waters. Larvae subsequently spread throughout the water column encountering both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We analyzed some short- and long-term responses of Pleuroncodes monodon larval metabolism to hypoxia at 11 A degrees C. Routine and postprandial aerobic respiration rates were lower in hypoxia than in normoxia for all zoeal stages. Zoea V oxyconformed, while megalopae oxyregulated down to very low oxygen concentrations. Throughout zoea I development, the rate of nitrogen (protein) accumulation in zoea I was lower, and C:N ratios were higher under hypoxic conditions than in normoxia. Citrate synthase (CS) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) apparent specific activities (as indicators of aerobic and metabolic potentials, respectively) decreased and remained at the same level, respectively, throughout zoea I reared under hypoxic conditions. Anaerobic to aerobic potential (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/CS) was higher in organisms reared under hypoxia, and MDH/LDH potential ratios were characteristic of organisms tolerant to hypoxia. In spite of P. monodon zoea endurance and metabolic adaptations to decreasing oxygen tensions, intense hypoxia as such of their release site would affect their overall condition especially toward the end of the molt cycle. Our results indicate the importance of considering the interaction between environmental oxygen variability and recruitment success.

AB  - Specific root length (SRL, m g(-1)) is probably the most frequently measured morphological parameter of fine roots. It is believed to characterize economic aspects of the root system and to be indicative of environmental changes. The main objectives of this paper were to review and summarize the published SRL data for different tree species throughout Europe and to assess SRL under varying environmental conditions. Meta-analysis was used to summarize the response of SRL to the following manipulated environmental conditions: fertilization, irrigation, elevated temperature, elevated CO2, Al-stress, reduced light, heavy metal stress and physical disturbance of soil. SRL was found to be strongly dependent on the fine root classes, i.e. on the ectomycorrhizal short roots (ECM), and on the roots < 0.5 mm, < 1 mm, < 2 mm and 1-2 mm in diameter SRL was largest for ECM and decreased with increasing diameter. Changes in soil factors influenced most strongly the SRL of ECM and roots < 0.5 mm. The variation in the SRL components, root diameter and root tissue density, and their impact on the SRL value were computed. Meta-analyses showed that SRL decreased significantly under fertilization and Al-stress; it responded negatively to reduced light, elevated temperature and CO2. We suggest that SRL can be used successfully as an indicator of nutrient availability to trees in experimental conditions.

AB  - Animals can use social information to detect threat in the environment. In particular, social learning allows animals to learn about dangers without incurring in the costs of trial-and-error learning. In zebrafish, both chemical and visual social cues elicit an innate alarm response, which consists of erratic movement followed by freezing behavior. Injured zebrafish release an alarm substance from their skin that elicits the alarm response. Similarly, the sight of conspecifics displaying the alarm response can also elicit the expression of this response in observers. In this study, we investigated if these social cues of danger can also be used by zebrafish as unconditioned stimulus (US) in learning. We found that only the chemical cue was effective in the social fear conditioning. We suggest that this differential efficacy of social cues results from the fact that the alarm cue is a more reliable indicator of threat, than the sight of an alarmed conspecific. Therefore, although multiple social cues may elicit innate responses not all have been evolutionarily co-opted to act as US in associative learning. Furthermore, the use of the expression of the immediate early genes as markers of neuronal activity showed that chemical social fear conditioning is paralleled by a differential activation of the olfactory bulbs and by a different pattern of functional connectivity across brain regions involved in olfactory processing.

AB  - We developed an approach for inventorying wetland resources, assessing their condition, and determining restoration potential in a watershed context. This article outlines how this approach can be developed into a Wetland Monitoring Matrix (WMM) that can help resource management agencies make regulatory and nonregulatory decisions. The WMM can be embedded in a standard planning process (Wetlands, Wildlife, and Watershed Assessment Techniques for Evaluation and Restoration, or W(3)ATER) involving the setting of objectives, assessing the condition of the resource, prioritizing watersheds or sites, implementing projects, and evaluating progress. To that process we have added the concepts of reference, hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification, and prioritization for protection and restoration by triage or adaptive management. Three levels of effort are possible, increasing in detail and diagnostic reliability as data collection shifts from remote sensing to intensive sampling on the ground. Of key importance is the use of a consistent set of monitoring protocols for conducting condition assessments, designing restoration and creation projects, and evaluating the performance of mitigation projects; the same variables are measured regardless of the intended use of the data. This approach can be tailored to any region by establishing a reference set of wetlands organized by HGM subclasses, prioritizing watersheds and individual wetlands, and implementing consistent monitoring protocols. Application of the approach is illustrated with examples from wetlands and streams of the Spring Creek Watershed in central Pennsylvania, USA.

AB  - This study examined the acceptable noise level in an office environment by interviewing 422 occupants about the aural environment being perceived in 61 air-conditioned offices in Hong Kong. The survey samples covered different types of building and prevalent mechanical air supply system. In particular, the measured equivalent continuous noise level L-eq in the offices was chosen as an indicator and correlated with the subjective responses from occupants on a visual analogue assessment scale and a dichotomous assessment scale. The results showed that this acceptability was significantly influenced by the office noise level and it would be correlated with a logistic regression model. A satisfaction criterion of the noise level could be evaluated from the frequency distribution of the occupants' response at certain L-eq, In addition, the proposed satisfaction criterion of aural comfort in current design practice was confirmed by the survey samples: an indoor environment with an equivalent continuous noise level L-eq of 57.5 dBA would be adopted as a design criterion for some offices.
   Practical application: The neutral criterion for aural comfort indicated by the equivalent continuous noise level L-eq in air-conditioned offices was determined within the range of 45-70 dBA and the 'optimum' noise level L-a = 57.5 dBA to be maintained in an office was determined from the survey. This study provides a template for applying a statistical frequency analysis and logistic regression model to examine the 'optimum' criteria for aural environment indicated by equivalent continuous noise level L-eq in air-conditioned offices elsewhere.

AB  - The probabilistic analysis on condition monitoring data has been widely established through the energy supply process to specify the optimum risk remediation program. In such studies, the fluctuations and uncertainties of the operational data including the variability between source of data and the correlation of observations, have to be incorporated if the efficiency is of importance. This study presents a novel probabilistic methodology based on observation data for signifying the impact of risk factors on safety indicators when consideration is given to uncertainty quantification. It provides designers, risk managers and operators a framework for risk mitigation planning within the energy supply processes, whilst also assessing the online reliability. These calculations address the involved and, most of the time, unconsidered risk to make a prediction of safety conditions of the operation in future. To this end, the generalized linear model (GLM) is applied to offer the explanatory model as a regression function for risk factors and safety indicators. Hierarchical Bayesian approach (HBA) is then inferred for the calculations of regression function including interpretation of the intercept and coefficient factors. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation from likelihood function and prior distribution, the HBA is capable of capturing the aforementioned fluctuations and uncertainties in the process of obtaining the posterior values of the intercept and coefficient factors. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed framework, an autonomous operation of Natural Gas Regulating and Metering Station in Italy has been considered as case study.

AB  - The discussion on renewable sources of synthesis gas and the discussion about flaring associated gas initiated new attraction on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis with a specific focus on smaller scale due to the distributed nature of the feedstock. Microstructured reactors have often been discussed as solution for process intensification at isothermal conditions and are thus supposed to be suitable for small scale applications in FT synthesis. Catalyst integration into these reactors can be done by packing of particles, but hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the case of gas-liquid flow under FT conditions with unusual ratios of particle diameter to channel or slit width are not accessible by calculation methods without many assumptions and uncertainties. An analysis of the product distribution in two different microstruc-tured reactors with different slit width at otherwise constant conditions revealed that slight temperature gradients in the catalyst bed over the slit width may be the reason for ca. 3% lower chain growth probability at channel width 1.5 mm compared to 0.8 mm. By applying predictions from kinetic parameters from literature, the estimated peak Delta T was 6 K in the larger microstructure. When this peak Delta T was used to calculate the change in methane selectivity and conversion, however, the methane selectivity increase with slit width was over-predicted and a conversion change was assumed, which did not occur in the experiments. Nevertheless, the experiments and the comparison with calculated chain growth probability are indicators for isothermal conditions in channel widths <1 mm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - CROSS-SECTION
KW  - GROWTH
AB  - Using a panel of 77 Russian regions we investigate the reasons behind large differences in regional growth performance for the period from the start of transition to the 1998 crisis. We consider politico-institutional characteristics, indicators of regional economic reform and initial conditions (including economic, geographical and structural features). Surprisingly, differences in institutional characteristics or economic reform explain relatively little of the observed difference in regional growth performance. For example, we find no evidence that a region's economic performance has been influenced by the political orientation of its leaders, or the political preferences of the population. In contrast, a region's initial industrial structure, as well as its natural and human resource endowments, had a large impact on its economic growth performance during the 1990s. It is important to note that our findings should not be interpreted as saying that reform in transition countries is generally less important than initial conditions, nor that reform in Russia was not or is not needed. Our focus on Russian regions captures only the aspects of reform that have (or have not) been initiated in the regions, and thus does not take into account the large-and arguably more important - part of the changes that have been undertaken at the national level. However, our study shows that regional differences in reform played a minor role in determining the relative economic performance of Russian regions in the 1990s, especially when compared with the impact of the initial conditions in which regions found themselves at the beginning of the transition.

AB  - The series of biennial United States (US) National Water Quality Inventory Surveys shows no reduction in the percentage of dearaded miles of streams since the early 1990s despite an exponential increase in river restoration projects to improve water quality, enhance in-stream habitat and manage the riparian zone. This may suggest that many river restoration projects fail to achieve their objectives. This is partly due to a lack Of understanding of the dynamics of the degraded riverine system and its interaction with the riparian zone. These projects could, therefore, benefit from using proven models of stream and riparian processes to guide restoration design and to evaluate indicators of ecological integrity. The US Department of Agriculture has developed two such models: the channel evolution computer model CONCEPTS and the riparian ecosystem model REMM. These models have been integrated to evaluate the impact of edge-of-field and riparian conservation measures on stream morphology and water quality. Vegetative riparian conservation measures are commonly used to stabilize failing streambanks. The shear strength of bank soils is,really affected by the degree of saturation of the soils and root reinforcement provided by riparian vegetation. The integrated model was used to study the effectiveness of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers in controlling streambank erosion of an incised stream in northern Mississippi. Comparison of model results with observations showed that pore-water pressures are accurately predicted in the upper part of the streambank, away from the groundwater table. Simulated pore-water pressures deviate from those observed lower in the streambank near the phreatic surface. These discrepancies are mainly caused by differences in the simulated location of the phreatic surface and simulated evapotranspiration in case of the woody buffer. The modelling exercise further showed that a coarse rooting system, e.g. as provided by trees, significantly reduced bank erosion rates for this deeply incised stream.

AB  - Sustainable development is difficult to be achieved in mountain regions because of their sensitivity to climate change. The rapid development of mountain tourism worldwide during the last years makes the goal for sustainable mountain tourism even more challenging. Key factor to the development of mountain tourism in Europe was the function of ski centres. According to the spirit of the Brundtland Report ski centres are not in general sustainable, because they may have economic benefits but they negatively affect the other two pillars of sustainability: environment and society. The present paper focuses on a ski resort in Greece, attempting to assess the impact of mountain tourism on the sustainable development of the area. Ski resorts played a crucial role to the bloom of mountain tourism in Greece. Its evolution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has been affected by the economic crisis that afflicts the country in the past years. Demographic data compared with tourism indicators were used to assess the environmental impact of tourism in the area. Moreover, meteorological data were used in order to examine the correlation of climatic conditions and the number of visitors. The results show that the ski centre in Elatohori despite the economic benefits has a major environmental impact, especially because of the increased carbon emissions caused by the visitors of the area. Additionally, the climatic conditions (precipitation and temperature, especially the absolute maximum air temperature) affect the number of visitors.

AB  - Many forest-dwelling bats spend their diurnal inactivity period in tree cavities. During this time bats can save energy through heterothermy. A heterothermic response (torpor) is characterized by a lowered body temperature, reduced metabolic rate, and reduction of other physiological processes, and can be influenced by the microclimatic conditions of roost cavities. The thermal and physical characteristics of roosts used by the sympatric, ecologically, and morphologically similar bat species Myotis bechsteinii, M. nattereri, and Plecotus auritus were compared. These three species differ in their heterothermic behavior, with the lowest skin temperatures observed for P. auritus. Therefore, we hypothesized that roosts occupied by the three species should differ in roost characteristics and microclimatic conditions, whereby P. auritus should select colder and thermally less stable roosts. The results showed that horizontal depth of the cavity, diameter of the roost tree, and microclimatic conditions within roosts differed among species. Roosts of P. auritus had the lowest horizontal depth, lowest thermal stability, and lowest mean minimum roost temperatures. Height of the roost, diameter of the roost tree, and vertical depth were also shown to influence microclimatic conditions. With increasing diameter of the tree and increasing horizontal depth, mean minimum roost temperature increased and thermal stability improved. Furthermore, with ascending height above ground insulation and mean roost temperatures increased. Our results imply that species such as P. auritus, which use pronounced torpor as a primary energy saving strategy, prefer colder cavities that support their heterothermic strategy.

AB  - The cultural value of geomorphological heritage (i.e., geomorphosites) is universally recognised and at the same time the interest on its mutability, as a consequence of both natural-climate and human pressure, is growing. In some cases a sudden increase in the velocity of processes can cause irreversible modifications threatening the survival of sites as well as their scientific value in terms of integrity. The focus of this paper is put on two types of geomorphosites (active geomorphosites and evolving passive geomorphosites), in which it is possible to observe and quantify the geomorphological processes varying mainly as a response to climate change. The study cases are runoff-derived landforms on unconsolidated deposits in two morphoclimatic contexts: 'calanchi' on marine originated clays in the Italian Apennines in Mediterranean climatic context (Crete d'Arbia and Radicofani, Tuscany) and earth pyramids formed in glacial deposits in continental Alpine environment (Pyramides d'Euseigne, Canton Valais, Switzerland). In both sites, human activities have strongly contributed to landscape evolution. To investigate erosion rates, dendrogeomorphological analysis (i.e. stress indicators and root exposure analysis) were combined with traditional quantitative geomorphological techniques. Analysis of the roots exposure, well correlated with the climatic data (denudation rates are higher during wet period), show that denudation rates are lower at Pyramides d'Euseigne due to the different texture of the deposits. Unfortunately, at the moment, a comparison between the two sites based on geomorphological monitoring data is not possible due to the different time interval of analysis, and only conclusions on denudation rates coming from roots exposure are allowed. Both geomorphosites have a high scientific value (representativeness and educational exemplarity) and are characterised by dynamicity. Providing data for modelling the sites evolution and possible decrease of their scientific value, caused by proceeding of the process itself, may be particularly significant.

AB  - Body-size spectra are inherent characteristics of organisms that can be used to summarise the functional structure of a community and thus be used in both ecological studies and biomonitoring programs. In order to determine the effect of water depth on body-size spectra of marine periphytic ciliate communities, a 1-month baseline survey was conducted at four depths (1, 2, 3.5 and 5m) in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Based on equivalent spherical diameters (ESD), 50 species were categorised into seven body-size ranks: S1, 2-17m; S2, 22-27m; S3, 29-36m; S4, 37-49m; S5, 53-71m; S6, 84-92m; S7, 127-153m. These seven body-size ranks were composed of four trophic functional groups: algivores (A), bacterivores (B), predators (R) and non-selectives (N). Body-size rank S1 was composed primarily of the B functional group; S2 was composed of the N and R functional groups, S3 and S4 were composed of the A, B and N functional groups, S5 and S6 were composed of the A functional group and S7 was composed of the R functional group. The medium body-size ranks (S4 and S5) were dominant at 1 and 2m, whereas the smallest body-size rank (S1) was dominant at 3.5 and 5m. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates revealed a clear vertical variation in body-size spectra at the four depths. Body-size diversity indices peaked at 2-3.5m and fell sharply at 5m. Body-size diversity indices peaked at 2-3.5m and fell sharply at 5m. Body-size distinctness, as measured by the paired-index (ellipse) test, showed an increasing trend of departure from the expected pattern from surface to deeper layers. These results suggest that the body-size spectra of periphytic ciliates may be significantly shaped by water depth and thus may be used as bioindicators of the ecological integrity and quality of water at different depths in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastics have become a global concern due to their increasing use and discharge into the environment. These ubiquitous particles are known to have extremely low degradation rates and accumulate mostly in the marine environment. The evidence for bioaccumulation and indicators of stress linked to microplastics is also stated in the literature. However, the real environmental impact of microplastics has not yet been revealed. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the interaction mechanisms between microplastics and (micro)organisms under controlled (standard) laboratory conditions and environmentally relevant conditions to reflect the true environmental-situation. In this study, we aimed to understand how microplastics extracted from commercially available toothpaste samples interacted with four types of bacteria under both standard and seawater conditions. For this purpose, bacterial inhibitions were examined, and mechanisms of inhibition were evaluated by biochemical parameters (total protein, lipid peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, and extracellular carbohydrate levels) of bacteria and physicochemical properties (zeta potential, particle size, surface chemistry) of microplastics. Results showed that gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa were affected in controlled and sea water media, respectively. The inhibition of the bacteria relied on the high zeta potentials of the microplastics, and, biochemically, protein and lipid peroxidase activity of bacteria were important in both media. On the other hand, while biochemical responses were similar in both media, the difference between the cell wall and microplastics surface charge was important only in seawater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differences in the ability to sustain chronic stress can underlie the variation in individuals' fitness directly or indirectly by impairing the expression of condition-dependent signals used in female mate choice. Therefore, understanding the effect of the stress response on individuals' fitness is key to identifying the mechanism of sexual selection. We tested the hypothesis that an indicator of stress-the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L ratio)-is related to several major components of male fitness in the lekking Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix), a species with intense male-male competition. The H/L ratio accurately measured the stress response, as it increased within a few hours of trapping and during the months prior to the mating season. The H/L ratio was positively related to the expression of morphological traits, suggesting that males of higher "quality" might be able to express elaborated ornaments and better cope with stressful conditions or with changes in health status. However, in Black Grouse, ornaments are (partly) independent of behavioural display and are under only weak selective pressure. Therefore, the H/L ratio was not significantly related to male mating success and survival to the following year. Under natural conditions, observed levels of the H/L ratio might not be associated with strongly deleterious effects because of behavioural adjustments. Mechanisms other than the stress response may mediate the observed variance in male mating success.

AB  - Mechanized maneuver training can impact soil quality in many ways, most notably through soil displacement and compaction. To identify indicator variables for inclusion in monitoring programs on military lands, a replicated small-plot study of tracked vehicle disturbance effects on tallgrass prairie soil properties was initiated on Fort Riley, KS, in 2003. A range of disturbances encompassing soil surface texture, environmental conditions, and traffic intensity were evaluated. Soil physical (rutting and compaction) and chemical (soil organic matter and nutrients) properties were monitored annually on curve and straightaway track areas through 2007. Rut depth remained significant (P <= 0.05) for curves of inside and outside tracks in both soil surface textures throughout the study and was more severe for repeated vs. single traffic events. Bulk density increased with disturbance under wet soil conditions, repeated traffic, and on curve areas but recovered to undisturbed levels within 1 to 3 yr. Soil compaction as measured by penetrometer resistance was more severe for traffic under wet soil conditions and remained significant (P <= 0.05) at depths of 5 to 10 cm in both soil surface textures throughout the study. Residual effects of tank traffic on soil chemical properties were generally mild, but soil C was reduced following disturbance under wet soil conditions, repeated traffic, and on curve areas and required 3 to 4 yr to recover to undisturbed levels. The results of this study emphasize the importance of suitable impact management to maintain the sustainability of tallgrass prairie for military training activities.

AB  - The effect of varying diet and environmental conditions at the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) on the fatty acid and hydrocarbon compositions of five species of copepod and krill, Euphausia superba, was investigated. Zooplankton at the MIZ experienced a range of conditions, from a low algal biomass (mainly flagellates) under pack-ice to a spring bloom dominated by diatoms in the open ocean. Principal Component Analysis classified the copepods into three dietary regimes: (i) omnivores or general algal feeders under the pack ice, (ii) dinoflagellate feeders, and (iii) diatom feeders in the open ocean. This classification was supported by the distribution of the diatom marker n-heneicosahexaene (n-C-21:6) and a general indicator of herbivory, the isoprenoid pristane. The fatty acid and hydrocarbon composition reflected dietary preferences and availability as the season progressed. Of the copepods under the pack-ice, Oithona spp. was omnivorous whereas Calanus propinquus was feeding preferentially on flagellates. Metridia gerlachei fed on flagellates in all conditions, but also included diatoms in its diet during the bloom. Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, which passed the winter in diapause, were feeding almost exclusively on diatoms in the open ocean. Euphausia superba, which were also mainly diatom feeders in the open ocean, were feeding on the sea-ice algae (diatoms) and suspended material from the water column (dinoflagellates) under the pack-ice.

AB  - California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create similar to 100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm-dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the "exceptional" 2012-2014 drought in California.

AB  - We examined otolith opacity of Baltic cod in relation to environmental conditions in order to evaluate the formation mechanisms of seasonal patterns used in age determination. Adult fish were tagged with data storage tags (DSTs) and a permanent mark was induced in the otoliths by injection of a strontium chloride solution. Based on environmental conditions experienced, fish were classified into different behavioural types: non-reproducing 'non-spawner', and 'spawner' undertaking spawning migrations. Otolith opacity, an indicator of otolith and fish somatic growth and condition, was examined in relation to these environmental drivers. Temperature was the only environmental variable with a significant effect, overlaying a strong size-related effect. The temperature effect was not uniform across behavioural types and spawning periods. Opacity showed a negative correlation with temperature as expected-but in non-spawning fish only. In spawners, the general trend was a decrease in opacity from pre- to post spawning. A significant - but positive - temperature effect was only found in the pre-spawning period. The negative effects during and following spawning were not significant. In spawners, this decoupling leads to an otolith structure with stronger contrasts and more abrupt changes, while in non-spawners, opacity changes more smoothly. The trigger for this decoupling seems to be an interaction between temperature exposure and seasonal variations in food availability and may serve as a tool to identify the occurrence and repetitiveness of spawning in Baltic cod.

AB  - We developed a series of tools to address three integrated tasks needed to effectively manage wetlands on a watershed basis: inventory, assessment, and restoration. Depending on the objectives of an assessment, availability of resources, and degree of confidence required in the results, there are three levels of effort available to address these three tasks. This paper describes the development and use of synoptic land-cover maps (Level 1) to assess wetland condition for a watershed. The other two levels arc a rapid assessment using ground reconnaissance (Level 2) and intensive field assessment (Level 3). To illustrate the application of this method, seven watersheds in Pennsylvania were investigated representing a range of areas (89-777 km(2)), land uses, and ecoregions found in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Level I disturbance scores were based on land cover in 1-km radius circles centered on randomly-selected wetlands in each watershed. On a standardized, 100-point, human-disturbance scale, with 100 being severely degraded and 1 being the most ecologically intact, the range of scores for the seven watersheds was a relatively pristine score of 4 to a moderately degraded score of 66. This entire process can be conducted in a geographic information system (GIS)-capable office with readily available data and without engaging in extensive field investigations. We recommend that agencies and organizations begin the process of assessing wetlands by adopting this approach as a first step toward determining the condition of wetlands on a watershed basis.

AB  - Regions beyond the present or past penetration of the Indian and African monsoons have experienced several large and abrupt climatic fluctuations over the past 13 C-14 kyr.
   Pollen and lake records from West Asia (Western Tibet and Rajasthan), East Africa (Ethiopia) and West Africa (Western Sahara, Sahel and subequatorial Africa) were selected on the basis of chronological control, sensitivity of both site and environmental indicators to climate change, the continuity of the record, and interdisciplinary control of the palaeoclimatic interpretation.
   Conditions wetter than those of today prevailed during the early-mid-Holocene period, but major dry spells are recorded at all sites during the intervals similar to 11.0-9.5 kyr BP, similar to 8-7 kyr BP and 3-4 kyr BP. Several records also suggest dry events of minor amplitude around 6 kyr BP. Potential boundary forcings of insolation and sea surface and tropical land surface conditions are discussed. The solar radiation accounts for the general envelop of the post-glacial monsoon fluctuations, but explains neither the timing nor the amplitude of the short-term changes. In spite of apparent covariation between fluctuations in sea surface conditions in the North Atlantic and the monsoon record, no direct mechanism could be found relating the intensity of the oceanic thermohaline conveyor belt to the monsoon strength. Changes in tropical land surface conditions (soil moisture negative feedback, and changes in CH4 production from wetlands) provide a more satisfactory hypothesis for explaining abrupt reversal events.

AB  - Recognition and mapping of mineralization-related patterns in geochemical data is a key computational analysis to achieve a predictive model of prospectivity for mineral deposit occurrence. This contribution describes a spatio-geologically informed fuzzy classification (SGIFC) for portraying the spatial-frequency distribution of mineralization through integration of geochemical concentrations, 3D spatial properties, and geological knowledge contained in surface samples. A spatio-geological interaction model (SGIM) was defined to constitute an SGIFC by modulating fuzzy memberships in each iteration of standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) according to the incorporation of both spatial and geological inter-sample similarities. This strategy was adapted to the compositional nature of multi-elemental data and implemented by programming over packages supplied within the R language environment. A comparative experiment on soil samples collected in a porphyry Cu-Au system was subjected to understand how the SGIM affects standard memberships spatially, statistically, and geostatistically. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of fuzzy memberships through Moran's I calculation and Monte Carlo simulation indicated that SGIFC leads to more robust spatially connected patterns compared to FCM models. Moreover, variogram analysis illustrated that SGIM orients the spatial continuity of mineralization-related memberships along the diffusion bearing of hydrothermal fluids across geological structures of the study area. Rock samples collected along trenches, as well as Cu volumetric productivities, were used as benchmarks to evaluate the integrity of the derived predictive models. The results reveal that the distribution pattern of mineralization-related memberships for SGIFC, compared to that of FCM, is more consistent with sub-outcropping and deep metallogenic realities and describes a more significant quantitative association with subsurface mineral content within the study region. The incorporation of SGIM into fuzzy classification has demonstrated the sufficiency to synthesize the comprehensive information of samples to predict effectively potential targets for follow-up exploration.

AB  - Alterations in natural flow regimes caused by dams can significantly alter the aquatic habitats of stream organisms. However, few studies have characterized flow regulation to assess its impacts on stream fauna in the context of interannually variable extreme floods. This study aims to understand the variation in stream animals along flow regulation gradients due to hydropower dams in a catchment experiencing typhoons. We observed freshwater fishes and stream insects at fully regulated sites (receiving residual flow), moderately regulated sites (receiving hydropower outflow), and nonregulated site (tributary) in the Mimi River catchment in southern Japan, in summer and winter from 2010 to 2018. We computed indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) in each calendar/water (July to June) year from 2007 to 2017 and selected subsets of IHA based on principal component analysis (PCA) and variance inflation factor. The largest variance was mainly explained by minimum discharge levels (e.g., 30-day annual minimum) and flow variability among IHAs, distinguishing the moderately regulated and nonregulated sites from fully regulated sites because of residual flow and suppressed high pulses in the fully regulated sites. Generalized additive models revealed that annual maxima of specific discharge were most significant predictors of fish and insectmetrics while its effects were generally inconsistent between summer and winter. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that insect communities were clustered into the regulation extents in both seasons. The differences in winter fauna between the regulated and nonregulated sites, characterized by Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera abundance, were associated with maximum discharge and high pulse numbers. Fish community variation did not correspond to flow regime gradients. Our findings on mechanistic ecohydrological consequences of various flow regulations, supported by long-term observations, will be useful for river managers attempting to compensate for alterations in flow regime and ecological integrity.

AB  - Biological functional traits help to understand specific stressors that are ignored in taxonomic data analysis. A combination of biological functional traits and taxonomic data is helpful in determining specific stressors which are of significance for fish conservation and river basin management. In the current study, the Taizi River was used as a case study to understand the relationships between the taxonomic and functional structure of fish and land use and water quality, in addition to determining the thresholds of these stressors. The results showed that taxonomic structure was significantly affected by the proportion of urban land and specific conductivity levels, while functional metrics were influenced by the proportions of farmland and forest. Threshold indicator taxa analysis found that Phoxinus lagowskii, Barbatula barbatula nuda, Odontobutis obscura, and Cobitis granoei had negative threshold responses along the gradients of urban developments and specific conductivity. There was a significant change in fish taxonomic composition when the proportion of urban land exceeded a threshold of 2.6-3.1%, or specific conductivity exceeded a threshold of 369.5-484.5 S/cm. Three functional featureshabitat preference, tolerance to disturbances, and spawning traitsshowed threshold responses to the proportion of farmland and forest. The abundance of sensitive species should be monitored as part of watershed management, as sensitive species exhibit an earlier and stronger response to stressors than other functional metrics. Sensitive species had a positive threshold response to the proportion of forest at 80.1%. These species exhibited a negative threshold response to the proportion of farmland at 13.3%. The results of the current study suggest that the taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages are affected by land use and water quality. These parameters should be integrated into routine monitoring for fish conservation and river basin management in the Taizi River. In addition, corresponding measures for improving river habitat and water quality should be implemented according to the thresholds of these parameters.

AB  - Agroforestry systems have been re-evaluated with a renewed scientific interest as appropriate models for achieving sustainable production while maintaining planned and associated biodiversity and agroecosystem functioning. Traditional bamboo-tree gardens in West Java are known to play substantial ecological and socioeconomic roles. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between income generation and biodiversity by studying 83 bamboo-tree gardens that varied in species composition and degree of commercialization. We conducted a survey of the vegetation and interviewed the owners or managers of each plot. We identified 42 planned and utilized species and 19 associated non-use species. Eight vegetation groups were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), each of which varied in individual densities of different utilization species types, Simpson's diversity index, management intensities, and potential annual gross income. The group with the highest potential income generation was dominated by clove trees (Syzygium aromaticum); however, this group also had a lower level of diversity and higher levels of management intensity than the other groups, but all of the pairwise groups were not significantly different. About 60% of the villagers used at least some fuelwood as a domestic energy source, and almost all of them collected fuelwood from bamboo-tree gardens regardless of ownership. There were no significant differences in density of potential fuelwood species among the vegetation groups. There were significant positive correlations between income and most management activities. The regression model between gross income and Simpson's diversity index with the best fit was a unimodal curve, which strongly suggests that maximum diversity can be conserved at an intermediate level of income. Nevertheless, this intermediate level of gross income is probably not adequate as the primary source of income for garden owners, although some gardens had the potential to achieve higher income levels with no decline in diversity. We suggest that maximizing individual density and multistratifying canopy layers could improve profitability within perennial crop-based agroforestry systems in West Java.

AB  - Telomere length can be considered as an indicator of an organism's somatic state, long telomeres reflecting higher energy investment in self-maintenance. Early-life is a period of intense investment in somatic growth and in physiological maturation but how this is reflected in telomere length remains unclear. Using European starling chicks we tested: (i) how telomere length measured at asymptotic mass is related to proxies of somatic growth and physiological maturity in 17-day-old nestlings; (ii) how telomere length measured at 17 days then predicts the changes in somatic and physiological maturity occurring in fledglings (between 17 and 21 days); (iii) how growth and telomere length co-vary when chicks are under experimentally good (fed) growth conditions. Depending on environmental conditions, our data suggest links between somatic growth, physiological maturation and body maintenance parameters (positive with oxidative stress and negative with telomere length) in nestlings. Telomere length measured at day 17 predicted a subsequent change in physiological maturation variables observed in fledglings, but only in second-brood chicks: chicks with shorter telomeres had a higher pre-fledging rate of increase in haematocrit and haemoglobin content and a greater decrease in reticulocyte count. Finally, food supplementation of chicks did not change telomere length compared with that in control siblings. Our results suggest that physiological maturation prior to fledging may occur at the expense of telomere length but only when environmental conditions are sub-optimal.

AB  - Visible derivative spectroscopy (VDS) analysis of sediment from Cleland Lake, Southeastern British Columbia provides a reconstruction of paleolimnological productivity and hydrologic change during the past 14,000 calibrated C-14 years before present (cal yr BP). The first five principal components (PC) of the VDS data explain 97% of the variance in the VDS data set. Four PCs correlate with standard reflectance derivative spectra for diatom, dinoflagellate algae, and cyanophyte pigments that record ecological change, while two PCs are paleohydrologic indicators. Dinoflagellate algae are predominant from 11,600 to 8600 cal yr BP then decrease to low levels after similar to 8500 cal yr BP. PCs 3-5 represent variations in cyanophyte abundance and exhibit peaks from 14,000 to 11,600, 14,000 to 9500, and 6100 to 5400 cal yr BP, respectively. Conditions shifted toward favoring diatoms around 9400 and lasted until 170 cal yr BP. Higher dinoflagellate-related pigment concentrations suggest a lower lake level from 11,600 to 8600 cal yr BP, followed by higher water levels and wetter conditions after 8500 cal yr BP. We propose that drier conditions transitioning from the late glacial into the Holocene were caused by summer insolation-driven, non-linear feedbacks between the northern hemisphere subtropical high-pressure systems, vegetation, and soil moisture.

AB  - Microfauna community structure was examined in the mixed liquor of a bench-scale bioreactor equipped with an intermittent aeration and feeding system. The reactor was operated under an intermittent aeration of 25 min in every 1 h and varying feeding conditions (0.264, 0.403 and 0.773 kg BOD5/m(3) d). A total of 14 protozoan and metazoan taxa were identified by microscopic examination. Sessile ciliates, followed by crawling ciliates, were the major protozoan groups under 0.403 kg BOD5/m(3) d organic loading conditions, while sessile ciliate population was remarkably increased under an organic loading of 0.773 kg BOD5/m(3) d. Principal Component Analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient tests were performed in order to reveal relationships between microfauna community and operational parameters. Ciliophora specific-18S rRNA gene clone library was constructed to identify ciliate diversity under 0.773 kg BOD5/m(3) d organic loading conditions. Ciliophora diversity consisted of members of Aspidiscidae, Epistylidae, Opisthonectidae and Vorticellidae, with the majority of the clones being associated with the species Vorticella fusca. At least one novel phylogenetic linkage among Ciliophora was identified. Comparisons made after molecular characterization and microscopic examination of Ciliophora community showed that the estimation of broad ciliate groups is useful for ecological considerations and evaluation of the operational conditions in wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - The National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) is one of a series of probability-based National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to provide a comprehensive assessment of the condition of the Nation's waters. Randomized design and standardized training and protocols allow USEPA to analyze data that are nationally consistent and regionally relevant. Each NARS assessment was preceded by careful consideration of key logistical elements that included pre-survey planning, training, sampling logistics, and laboratory analysis. Numerous state, tribal, and contractor crews were supported across the country for each assessment; sampling and sample analyses were tracked from initiation; laboratory analyses were completed at USEPA, state, regional, and contract laboratories; and the data analyses and reporting were completed by USEPA-led workgroups, states, and contractors. The complexity and difficulty of each step offered unique challenges and provided lessons learned for each of the NARS assessments. Major logistical elements for implementing large scale assessments that are constrained by sampling period and number and duration of visits are covered in this paper. These elements include sample transport, equipment and supplies, sampling and sample tracking, information management regional technical expertise, and a sound field training program. This paper describes how lessons from previous assessments were applied to the NWCA and how new challenges faced in the NWCA were addressed and carried forward into future surveys.

AB  - Vast amounts of oil & gas (O&G) are consumed around the world everyday that are mainly transported and distributed through pipelines. Only in Canada, the total length of O&G pipelines is approximately 100,000 km, which is the third largest in the world. Integrity of these pipelines is of primary interest to O&G companies, consultants, governmental agencies, consumers and other stakeholder due to adverse consequences and heavy financial losses in case of system failure. Fault tree analysis (ETA) and event tree analysis (ETA) are two graphical techniques used to perform risk analysis, where ETA represents causes (likelihood) and ETA represents consequences of a failure event. 'Bow-tie' is an approach that integrates a fault tree (on the left side) and an event tree (on the right side) to represent causes, threat (hazards) and consequences in a common platform. Traditional 'bow-tie' approach is not able to characterize model uncertainty that arises due to assumption of independence among different risk events. In this paper, in order to deal with vagueness of the data, the fuzzy logic is employed to derive fuzzy probabilities (likelihood) of basic events in fault tree and to estimate fuzzy probabilities (likelihood) of output event consequences. The study also explores how inter-dependencies among various factors might influence analysis results and introduces fuzzy utility value (FUV) to perform risk assessment for natural gas pipelines using triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability criteria, namely, social, environmental and economical consequences. The present study aims to help owners of transmission and distribution pipeline companies in risk management and decision-making to consider multi-dimensional consequences that may arise from pipeline failures. The research results can help professionals to decide whether and where to take preventive or corrective actions and help informed decision-making in the risk management process. A simple example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural intensification is strongly related to the application of pesticides which may substantially affect agroecosystems. It is recognized that the effect of pesticides on agroecosystems is associated with the application of multi-component mixtures rather than from individual pesticides. In sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivation, the most used pesticides are herbicides. Herbicides are commonly applied with varying intensities depending on their amount of active ingredients and dosages to coincide with weed species-specific occurrence. Research on their ecotoxicological effects on functional attributes of agroecosystems has not received adequate attention. This study aims to determine the impact of three common sugar beet herbicide strategies (HS) on the biological activity of the edaphic community, proposed as a functional indicator for potential decomposition capability. The strategies compared were: HS1: two herbicides, 100% of authorized application rate; HS2: three herbicides, <50% of authorized application rate; HS3: six herbicides, <= 35% of authorized application rate. To discern anticipated small differences, different tillage intensities (ploughing and mulching) and comprehensive field trials at 19 environments (site x year) distributed throughout Germany were compared. Feeding activity on bait substrate and the mass loss of wheat straw were measured to quantify the effect of HS on the decomposition activity of the edaphic community.
   Overall, this study demonstrated that no consistent significant differences in biological activity were found among herbicides strategies. Environment and tillage intensity were the main factors influencing the biological activity of the edaphic community. Biological activity was highly variable among environments and was reduced by differences in tillage. Furthermore, temperature was observed to be an important factor for the biological activity. Moreover, soil parameters resulting from reduced tillage intensity in the mulching system enhanced biological activity. In conclusion, clear and direct effects of changing herbicide strategies on the functional integrity of the edaphic community could not be discerned. These results were quantified for the first time through considering multiple influencing factors in situ. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), which are the raw materials for energy, play an effective and determining role in energy planning, the development of countries, and then sustainability of them. When the global and regional geographies are evaluated from the geo-strategic and geo-political point of view, it is clearly seen that among all fossil fuels, coal is distributed more "equally" in ratio than oil and natural gas reserves and that it is gradually gaining importance for the countries that do not have energy resources or that have limited ones or have resources on the verge of exhaustion. When the latest innovations in environmentally-friendly technologies in the field of burning-storing CO2 emission in thermal power plants besides the principle of "sustainable development" are also added to this situation, it is an undeniable fact that the coal will continue to be a significant primary energy resource in the future, though to a limited extent, both in Turkey and around the world. In this study, in order to be able to detect numerically the impact of CO2 resulting from the fossil fuel consumption on global warming and the process of climate change; a numerical evaluation on a global scale has been given by associating the "total primary energy supply"-"CO2 emission" of the total 136 countries in 2005 together with such basic indicators as "total primary energy supply/capita"-"ton CO2/capita." The potential CO2 emission for the year 2030 has been estimated. Moreover, with the aim of keeping the integrity of the subject studied, the distribution of the thermal power plants working with fossil fuels among geographical regions in Turkey and the relationship between the existence of forests in these regions and average annual increase in temperature (Delta T) between the periods of 1975-1992 and 1993-2006 have also been examined according to the data from a total of 133 macro-climatic meteorological stations within the scope of this study.

AB  - Due to the heterogeneous distribution of resources along large rivers, understanding prey utilization by basin-scale fish assemblages remains a challenge, and thus, recognizing regional fish trophic guilds and indicator species is important. We analyzed the stomach contents of 96 fish species along the subtropical East River in China and identified 8 prey items (29 subcategories). Site-specific differences in fish diet composition (DC) revealed longitudinal shifts in utilized prey taxa, from upstream lotic to downstream semi-lentic items, and these were characterized by a decrease in the proportions of epilithic diatoms and aquatic insect larvae (Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae) accompanied by an increase in bivalves (Corbicula and Limnoperna), shrimps and fishes, and organic sediments. The relative prey consumption weighted by fish abundance and biomass indicated that decreasing insect consumption and increasing detritus consumption were two fundamental vectors governing fish-centered feeding pathways. Seventeen prey-oriented fish guilds that were clustered based on DC matrix determined the spatial variation in the fish trophic structure. The cumulative presence of (a) upstream guilds reliant on insects and epiphytes, (b) midstream guilds reliant on hydrophytes, molluscs, and nekton, and (c) downstream guilds reliant on detritus, annelids, and plankton resulted in a longitudinal increase in guild richness, but this continuity was interrupted near the industrialized estuary. The most abundant 28 fish species across the guilds were selected as trophic indicator species; their spatial distribution significantly (p 0.05) explained >80% of the environmental and prey variables identified. These species signified the availability of predator-prey links in distinct habitats and the key environmental factors supporting these links. With a high contribution (>51%) of exotic species, an increase in detritivores downstream distinguishes the subtropical East River from temperate rivers. Particularly, in the disturbed lower reaches, the dominance of detritivores prevailed over the predicted increase in other feeding groups (e.g., omnivores and carnivores).

AB  - One of the promising approaches to monitoring biodiversity is assessing the status of pressures driving the biodiversity state. To achieve this, we need to identify the principal pressures that cause simultaneous biodiversity loss across taxonomic groups and clarify how multiple pressures act synergistically or at least simultaneously to decrease biodiversity in the focal ecosystem. Here, we used a series of 64 ponds as a case study and we developed a framework for an integrated biodiversity indicator that took into consideration the estimated relative importance of multiple pressures. The indicator is defined as a function of the pressure(s) and is parameterized to explain a number of individual indicators of biodiversity, such as richness, abundance, and functional diversity of focal taxa. We selected aquatic macrophytes, Odonata, and benthic macroinvertebrates as the focal taxa. In addition, we focused on three types of pressure: eutrophication (represented by total phosphorus, total nitrogen, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and density of cyanobacteria of pond water), habitat destruction (land-use type around the pond and pond bank protection), and invasive alien species (abundance of bluegill, largemouth bass, red swamp crayfish, and American bullfrog). We then evaluated the relationships among direct pressures and the individual biodiversity indicators and used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to calculate the integrated biodiversity indicator. Using this framework, we demonstrated that eutrophication had greater effects on the state of biodiversity of the agricultural ponds than did habitat destruction or the presence of invasive alien species. We also showed that the integrated indicator could well explain the behaviors of several individual biodiversity indicators, including total richness, endangered species richness, and functional diversity of focal taxa. These results demonstrate the advantages of the framework in providing a more practical method for assessing biodiversity, and quantifying the relative importance of the major threats to biodiversity to prioritize strategies in conservation planning and policy making.

AB  - Heritability and Genetic Gain are commonly used by plant breeders to estimate the accuracy of a selection index and used for measuring the response to selection. The aim of the present study was the genetic and phenotypic analyses of some physiological traits to identify the most reliable of them for selective breeding of pistachio cultivars under drought stress condition. Nineteen Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) cultivars with wide range of tolerance to drought stress were collected from across the orchards of Rafsanjan (Iran's center of pistachio cultivation) and were used in randomized complete block design with three replications under two environmental conditions (normal and water stress) in 2011-2012. The results of genetic analysis showed that high magnitude of phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation along with broad sense heritability and genetic gain were estimated in relative water protection (RWP), excised leaf water loss (ELWL), relative water content (RWC) and relative water loss (RWL) under drought stress condition, indicating that the inheritance of these traits can be mainly controlled by additive gene effects followed by reflecting the possibility of effective selection for genetic improvement of these traits. Path analysis revealed that RWP had the highest direct and RWL and WRC indirect effects on YSI. Principal component analysis indicated that selected indices were reliable for classification and identification of drought-tolerant pistachio cultivars and identified RWP, RWC and WRC as the best indicators for screening drought tolerant genotypes.

AB  - Preferential flow is a well recognized mechanism for the accelerated leaching of nutrients and pollutants through soil, contributing to the contamination of surface-and groundwater bodies. This study assessed the risks associated with slurry spreading and the potential effects of preferential flow, under natural rainfall, on four soil types with contrasting textures under wet and dry initial conditions. Breakthrough patterns of bromide were analyzed to quantify water flow patterns, and the data were compared to leachate nutrient composition. Bovine slurry, spiked with bromide, was applied to lysimeters (3 per treatment and 4 soil types) each under wet and dry initial soil conditions. Bromide served well as an indicator of the potential occurrence of preferential flow. Preferential flow was found to be most likely to occur in the soil with the finest texture under wet initial conditions and least likely in the soil with the coarsest texture. Leaching of relatively high concentrations of total reactive phosphorous was found to occur simultaneously with bromide under wet initial conditions, but no other relationships were observed between nutrients and bromide. Dye was applied to one lysimeter of each soil type at the end of the experiment to compare qualitative information about the infiltration mechanisms. Preferential flow was found to occur primarily in the form of macropore flow. Water quality considerations must be taken into account when promoting the spreading of organic manures on wet soils in early spring to improve nutrient efficiency. The land application of slurry at agronomic rates related to crop requirements restricts nutrient leaching.

ED may simply reflect a limit of human physiology, yet ED equates to genetic death and the high prevalence of ED is a clear evolutionary paradox. Why is a condition which totally blocks reproduction so widespread? Epidemiology shows that impotence is a common symptom of almost all major diseases and male reproductive physiology is sensitive to general health and to environmental, psychological, and physical stressors. Moreover, erectile dysfunction is a predictor of myocardial infarction and stroke. Briefly, efficient erection is a marker of good health and good health prognosis. In the animal kingdom, mate choice is often based on extravagant and cumbersome physical traits (such as the peacock's tail). These traits, that are necessary for gene propagation, are at the same time efficient handicaps which reduce the survival of the carrier. What animal studies show, is that these handicaps can function as honest indicators of the individual's fitness. In other words, their expression is condition-dependent and only individuals with high phenotypic quality present the trait. By mating with males which express the trait, females indirectly select for individuals of superior fitness which will be inherited by the offspring. Erection is very clearly a condition-dependent trait in the human species. We suggest that the fragility of male sexual physiology is a sexually selected handicap which hampers the reproduction of individuals with lower phenotypic quality.

AB  - Freshwater aquatic ecosystems are highly sensitive to flow regime alteration caused by anthropogenic activities, including river regulation and atmospheric warming-induced climate change. Either climate change or reservoir operations are among the main drivers of changes in the flow regime of rivers globally. Using modeled unregulated and simulated regulated streamflow under historical and future climate scenarios, this study evaluated potential changes to the flow regime due to climate change and reservoir operations for the major tributaries of the San Joaquin River Basin, California United States. We selected a set of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) to evaluate historical and projected future trends of streamflow dynamics: rise and fall rates, durations and counts of low and high pulses, and the magnitude of extremes. Results show that most indicators have pronounced departures from baseline conditions under anticipated future climate conditions given existing reservoir operations. For example, the high pulse count decreases during regulated flow conditions compared to increased frequency under unregulated flow conditions. Finally, we observed a higher degree of flow regime alteration due to reservoir operations than climate change. The degree of alteration ranges from 1.0 to 9.0% across the basin among all future climate scenarios, while reservoir operations alter the flow regime with a degree of alteration from 8.0 to 25%. This study extends multi-dimensional hydrologic alteration analysis to inform climate adaptation strategies in managed river systems.

AB  - Many restoration projects' success is not evaluated, despite available conventional ecological assessment methods. There is a need for more flexible, affordable, and efficient methods for evaluation, particularly those that take advantage of new remote sensing and geospatial technologies. This study explores the use of illustrative small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) products, made using a simple structure-from-motion photogrammetry workflow, coupled with a visual assessment protocol as a remote evaluation and ecological condition archive approach. Three streams were assessed in the field ("surface assessments") using the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2 (SVAP2) and later illustrated in sUAS products. A survey of 10 stream experts was conducted to (1) assess the general utility of the sUAS products (high-resolution video, orthomosaics, and 3D models), and (2) test whether the experts could interpret the products and apply the 16 SVAP2 elements remotely. The channel condition, bank condition, riparian area quantity, and canopy cover elements were deemed appropriate for remote assessment, while the riparian area quality, water appearance, fish habitat complexity, and aquatic invertebrate complexity elements were deemed appropriate for remote assessment but with some potential limitations due to the quality of the products and varying site conditions. In general, the survey participants agreed that the illustrative products would be useful in stream ecological assessment and restoration evaluation. Although not a replacement for more quantitative surface assessments when required, this remote visual approach is suitable when more general monitoring is satisfactory.

AB  - Enrichment aims to improve captive animals' welfare by enhancing their environments. Two of the struggles associated with measuring welfare are identifying when animals' needs are being met or surpassed and identifying how individual differences play a role in these outcomes. Using a group of related Guyanese squirrel monkeys, we studied changes in five welfare indicators under different environmental conditions. Manipulating food presentation, walkways, and toys, we created five enrichment levels ranging from just above USDA standards to considerably more complex than the animals' normal housing. At the end of each level, a novelty test was performed in which an unfamiliar woman entered the enclosure and offered food. Changes in behavior as a function of enrichment condition were analyzed using a repeated-measures MANOVA. Compared to baseline, less enrichment consistently increased negative welfare indicators (abnormal behavior, aggression, and negative responses to the novelty test), while more enrichment sometimes decreased these indicators. Positive welfare indicators were less consistently related to enrichment, but positive response to the novelty test did increase somewhat in the most enriched condition. Across conditions, rank correlations revealed that individuals had highly consistent individual differences in positive responses to novelty and somewhat consistent individual differences in rates of aggression. The goal of the enrichment and the species, sex, and individual animals to be enriched should be considered when selecting a welfare indicator, and facilities measuring animal welfare should study changes in the behavior of specific individuals to control for individual differences.

AB  - The condition of the periwinkle Littorina littorea, expressed in terms of its shell morphology, reproductive impairment (i.e. female sterility/intersex, male penis shedding), trematode infestation load, lipid reserves and dry/wet weight ratio, was determined in function of environmental stress along the polluted Western and relatively clean Eastern Scheldt estuary (The Netherlands). The upstream increasing pollution and decreasing salinity levels along the Western Scheldt estuary (Fig. 1) are reflected in the dry/wet weight ratio and lipid content of the periwinkles. Compared to the Eastern Scheldt, female intersex (i.e. indicator of TBT pollution) and sterility occurred more frequently in the Western Scheldt estuary, while male penis shedding was even restricted to the latter estuary. The highest population intersex and sterility incidence was found near the harbour of Vlissingen and reflects potential nautical activities. The number of trematode infested periwinkles did not differ between both estuaries, although local sampling site differences were detected within each estuary, reflecting the complex interactions that exist among parasites, hosts and the local environment. Finally, both estuaries were maximally discriminated from each other based on the shell weight of the periwinkles using a canonical discriminant analysis. Periwinkles with the heaviest shells were found in the Western Scheldt estuary and may reflect growth rate or structural population differences caused by the less favourable living conditions in the Western Scheldt estuary.

AB  - A hillside with abandoned, wooded hay meadows in Leikanger in Sogn og Fjordane county, Western Norway, was investigated in 1992-1995. A management regime combining restoration (topping) of old pollarded trees, scything and removal of hay was reintroduced in the area. The availability of light, hydrological conditions and the nutrient content of the soil were the most important factors determining development of hay meadow vegetation to forest vegetation. Indicators of shaded conditions included Valeriana sambucifolia and Oxalis acetosella, while Anthriscus sylvestris was indicator of light conditions. Species such as Campanula rotundifolia, Pimpinella saxifraga, Plantago lanceolata, Lychnis viscaria and Hieracium pilosella, which were recorded mostly on dry ridges, were regarded as "relict" species, more common formerly when the area was managed in a traditional way. The cover of tall grasses and herbs, such as Dactylis glomerata, Poa trivialis and Anthriscus sylvestris, increased the first two years after restoration. This indicates an increase in available nutrients, probably a "pioneer clearing fertilization" due to the introduced pollarding. Restoration and management resulted in drier, more homogenous ecological conditions and reduced the differences in local climate between formerly open meadows and more wooded areas in the restored area. However, most of the vegetation seemed to be quite stable during the study period. One class, however, comprised releves from several unstable plots of the experimental site. The frequency of some light-demanding species increased in the experimental site, while the frequency of Oxalis acetosella and Epilobium montanum increased in the control site.

AB  - Cognitive load has for long been studied in relation with learning processes. In our study, we investigated the impact of cognitive load in real-life situations taking the example of train travelers looking for relevant information in a train station. For this purpose, we created a virtual reality model of the tested train station from which we conducted a real-life study. Our aim was to compare travelers' cognitive load impact in real-life environmental condition versus virtual reality simulation of the same environment. Regular and occasional travelers were recruited and were assumed as experts and novices, respectively. Investigation of cognitive load was based on physiological, subjective and behavioral aspects. These were measured using electrodermal activity, NASA-Task Load Index and recognition of relevant factual and contextual information seen by travelers in the train station, respectively. These three indicators used in both real-life and virtual reality were expected to follow the same trend, irrespective of the environmental condition, but were expected to vary with respect to expertise level. A higher cognitive load was forecasted for novice travelers than for expert travelers. The findings revealed no difference on the three indicators between virtual and real-life conditions. However, novice travelers showed higher cognitive load responses than expert travelers, in both environmental conditions. Our results suggest virtual reality as a promising technique for cognitive load analysis during navigation, and an effective method for neurocognitive assessments in daily life situations.

AB  - The Italian cultural heritage is one of the most noticeable in the world; an important part of it is subjected to natural hazard and risk conditions. Religious buildings, due to their location on impervious sites are particularly exposed to landslides. In this paper we study the hermitage of Cerbaiolo (Tuscany, central Italy). The hermitage, founded in the 8th century as a Benedictine monastery is now a Franciscan Women Institute seat. The buildings are on the edges of a limestone plate overlapped to a clayey formation. Falls, toppling and slides are present along the limits of the plate due to the geomechanics properties of the rock and to the contrast between the two lithological complexes. In order to identify the main joint sets affecting the rock mass a structural-geological survey was carried out and four sets are identified. The rock plate was classified according to Bieniawski, Barton and Geological Strength Index approaches. The outcomes confirm the predisposing factors to mass movements, corresponding to the intensity and characteristics of fracturing of the rock mass. With regard to the slope stability analysis, a failure mechanism involving sliding along a single plane (plane failure) was assumed on the first approximation. The analyses take into account the presence of tension cracks as an indicator factor for the instability phenomenon. The results of stability analyses, performed in static and seismic conditions, indicate a widespread instability condition. The dip slope direction, the properties and type of discontinuities and the local variation of composition influence the hazard assessment.

AB  - Application of liquid manure to fields is a common practise to efficiently utilize and dispose of manure in many North American farm operations. Guidelines given to farm operators frequently focus on the amounts of manure required to provide certain nutrient requirements given the source of the manure and plant requirements. Under proper conditions, this is an efficient use of manure with few adverse environmental impacts. However, under adverse conditions, excessive application rates can result in significant ground and surface water contamination by bacterial and other contaminants in the manure. A key problem is that the pathways by which these contaminants reach surface waters are not well understood. Because of this, not enough information is available on the amounts which can be safely spread and those conditions to avoid in order to prevent inadvertent contamination by the spreading of liquid manure. The experiments described in this paper report on bacterial contamination at a single field site due to liquid manure spreading under accepted practises in Ontario over a two year period. A nalidixic acid resistant strain of Escherichia coli was used as a biotracer to quantify the degree of transport from the field level to nearby receiving waters. The results show that significant amounts of bacteria can reach surface water by infiltrating through the soil and travelling through sub-surface tile drains to the receiving water. Rain shortly after manure application is suggested to be the most important indicator of bacterial contamination rather than spreading rate (volume applied per unit area) or condition of the field prior to spreading.

AB  - Habitat quality affects the condition of predatory beetles in terms of size and weight. Carabid body weight and size are defined and measured in many ways. The way of collecting and preserving of beetles affects these parameters. This makes comparison between studies difficult. This paper presents more precise methods to determine the condition of the carabid P. cupreus in farmland. Beetles were caught alive by using pitfall traps and were weighted. Elytra maximum length and area were measured by image analysis. The elytra area appeared to be a good indicator for beetle size. The relative fresh weight was defined as the fresh weight/elytra area. To convert weight from formalin trapped beetles into fresh or dry weight, relationships between different weighing procedures were established. Analyses were made of the relation between various weight and size parameters. The relative fresh weight of both sexes increases significantly early in the season. Weight and relative fresh weight do not differ significantly between sexes. Since females are expected to respond more clearly to environmental circumstances in terms of weight, variability should be higher. This is best reflected in the relative fresh weight which is much more variable in females than in males. Therefore this parameter is most suitable for assessing individual conditions. For P. cupreus the multiplication factor to transform alcohol weight into fresh weight is 1.19. Because all dry, fresh and alcohol weights are highly correlated it depends on the research questions and circumstances which method to choose.

AB  - The aim of the research was to study the floristic richness of balks, i.e. uncultivated strips separating fields, and to research the dependence of plant communities there on habitat conditions and adjacent crops. The share of segetal species in those communities was also analysed. In the western part of the Siedlce Plateau 70 balks among intensively cultivated fields were examined in 2016-2018. The balks divided fields with corn, winter cereals and spring cereal mixtures. The research was conducted with the Braun-Blanquet method, with 110 phytosociological releves results used as study material. The flora specified this way was analysed in terms of biological structure, forms of life, persistence, historical and geographical spectrum, species rarity and presence of invasive species. In addition, the interdependence between the species richness of balks and habitat conditions as well as the type of neighbouring crops was studied. Habitat conditions were established with the Ellenberg indicator values, based on indicative species and taking into account light, temperature, moisture, soil reaction and nitrogen content. The development and floristic diversity of balk plant communities as ecotone areas were largely influenced by a proximity of arable fields and habitat conditions, especially by soil moisture and the amount of nitrogen. Balk flora consisted of vascular plants with 161 species, mainly apophytes. Those were mostly perennial species, hemikryptophytes. Among the most common field weeds from the class of Stellarietea mediae, 25 species were identified in balks. There were 26 rare and endangered species and 14 species having the status of invasive taxa.

AB  - In recent years in Malaysia, severe road crashes involving intercity buses have been increasing. With increased public concerns about intercity bus safety, effectively managing travel risk has become critical for both intercity bus operators and road safety policy makers. Intercity bus drivers are generally at a higher risk for crashes due to long hours of driving and exposure to different road conditions. Therefore, understanding and quantifying their risks and taking steps to manage them could improve intercity bus safety. The aim of this study is to establish a safety performance index for each risk domain to measure and compare intercity bus safety in terms of risk factors. The risk domains considered in this study were road environment conditions, bus driver driving behaviors and bus safety conditions. The weighted indicators were aggregated into the safety performance index for each risk domain was done using the Exploratory Factor Analysis method. The paired sample t-test was then applied to determine which safety performance indices were significantly different from each other. The results indicate that road environment conditions have contributed more to intercity bus safety risks on the east coast than on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia. The evidence presented in this study shows that different intercity bus companies showed mixed safety performance in different risk domains. Therefore, we suggest the development of targeted road safety programs for each intercity bus company to address intercity bus safety problems.

AB  - Understanding the geographical patterns and divisions of communities is a fundamental step in achieving the sustainable management of ecosystems, especially in deteriorating global and local environments. The idea of geographical division has been applied on all continents but Antarctica, but it has never been rigorously tested for stream ecosystems in China, leaving a gap in knowledge for many basic and applied research questions regarding, for example, diversity patterns, conservation issues or climate change effects. To fill this gap, we aimed to (1) evaluate the geographical divisions of the macroinvertebrate communities in Chinese streams using the self-organizing map (SUM) method and (2) to characterize the distribution patterns in relation to different environmental variables. Macroinvertebrates were collected from 57 relatively clean stream sites covering a south-north gradient along the boundary of the geographic ladder (or altitudinal divide) in China. SUM was used to analyze large-scale biogeographical divisions of the macroinvertebrate communities. The sampling sites were divided into six clusters, distinguishing the samples from northern, central, and southern China. This pattern was also reflected by biotic metrics (abundance, biomass, taxa and sum of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera richness, and diversity). The gradient of environmental variables, particularly water quality variables, was similar between the clusters, with the exceptions of two clusters from southwestern China when considering altitude and one cluster from northern China when considering conductivity and TN. The different clusters from the SUM were associated with indicator species, with clean-water adapted species dominating in southwestern China and pollution tolerant species in northern China. However, there were no significant correlations between environmental variables and biotic metrics. The overall combination of environmental variables and organism data suggests that spatial variation was the main predictor determining the composition of the macroinvertebrate communities on a large-scale, and the trained SUM appeared to be efficient at classifying streams on a broad geographic scale.

AB  - China's Tibet autonomous region has abundant solar energy resources, cold winters, and cool summers. These are ideal conditions for the application of passive solar heating methods. However, differences in climatic conditions and building types can significantly affect passive solar technology's feasibility, which makes it challenging to promote passive solar buildings in Tibet. In this study, the suitability zone for passive solar technology is categorized based on the sub-zoning indicators for Tibet. By modeling between direct gain windows, Trombe walls, and attached sunspaces, the effect of indoor thermal environments and the capacity for heating load reduction is compared for different passive solar technologies. The climate-difference impact analysis shows that the I-B-1 zone is better suited for passive solar technology than other climate zones. More specifically, this zone has an average energy-saving rate difference of up to 28.61% compared to the II-A-1 zone. The analysis of the impact of building type differences indicates that residential buildings have higher Trombe wall-to-wall ratio limits and more significant potential for energy savings than office buildings. The study also clarifies the implications of Tibet's climate conditions and building type differences on the effectiveness of passive solar technology. Moreover, it recommends appropriate passive solar technology adoption methods for every climate zone. This study can be used as a reference and engineering guide to improving the indoor thermal environment of Tibetan buildings, tailored to the highly variable local conditions.

AB  - Introduction The functional consequences of the bacterial gut microbiome for child health are not well understood. Characteristics of the early child gut microbiome may influence the course of enteric infections, and enteric infections may change the composition of the gut microbiome, all of which may have long-term implications for child growth and development. Methods and analysis We are conducting a community-based birth cohort study to examine interactions between gut microbiome conditions and enteric infections, and how environmental conditions affect the development of the gut microbiome. We will follow 360 newborns from 3 sites along a rural-urban gradient in northern coastal Ecuador, characterising enteric infections and gut microbial communities in the children every 3 to 6 months over their first 2 years of life. We will use longitudinal regression models to assess the correlation between environmental conditions and gut microbiome diversity and presence of specific taxa, controlling for factors that are known to be associated with the gut microbiome, such as diet. From 6 to 12 months of age, we will collect weekly stool samples to compare microbiome conditions in diarrhoea stools versus stools from healthy children prior to, during and after acute enteric infections, using principal-coordinate analysis and other multivariate statistical methods. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approvals have been obtained from Emory University and the Universidad San Francisco de Quito institutional review boards. The findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus were once the dominant salmonid in the Big Manistee River, Michigan, but were extirpated from the watershed around 1900 and from the state of Michigan by 1936, likely due to overfishing, biotic interactions with introduced fish species, and habitat loss occurring largely around the turn of the 20th century. An interest in reestablishing native species by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians led to an assessment of environmental conditions in a portion of the watershed encompassing 21 km of the Big Manistee River to determine whether suitable Arctic Grayling habitat remains. During summer in 2011-2013, abiotic habitat metrics, including water characteristics, substrate composition, channel profile, channel geomorphic unit, and stream velocity, were assessed across eight tributaries within the watershed. To assess whether abiotic conditions in these tributaries might support Arctic Grayling, the environmental conditions were compared to literature values from rivers where current or historical Arctic Grayling populations have been reported. This comparison, in conjunction with an assessment using a habitat suitability index for Arctic Grayling, indicated that important abiotic conditions were within ranges consistent with those associated with current and past populations of Arctic Grayling in North America. The results of this study will guide potential future reintroductions and indicate that suitable Arctic Grayling habitat does exist in portions of the Big Manistee River watershed, an assessment that will be further refined when coupled with biotic features of the environment.

AB  - Over 70% of Kenya's wildlife resources occur outside protected areas, in areas where land use practices do not necessarily conform to wildlife conservation standards. Ensuring that land use practices in these areas accommodate wildlife conservation is vital in effectively conserving wildlife in this country. Tindress Farm in Rift Valley offers a good example of a place where economic activities and wildlife conservation can work harmoniously. The farm has set up a 320-ha wildlife sanctuary in the hilly parts of the property to provide a haven for wildlife displaced by human settlements in the surrounding environs. The Tindress Farm management needed to know the diversity and optimum number of wildlife species that the sanctuary could accommodate. This study set out to 1) outline a set of models for objectively calculating wildlife stocking levels and 2) demonstrate the practical use of these models in estimating optimum stocking levels for a specific wildlife sanctuary. After comparing models using forage inventory methods models and utilization-based methods (UM), we opted to use UM models because of their focus on ecological energetics. This study established that the range condition in Tindress Wildlife Sanctuary varied from poor to good (29-69%) and recommended a total stocking density of 158.9 grazer units and 201.4 browser units shared out by the various herbivore species. These estimates remain a best-case scenario. The effects of rainfall, range condition, and condition of the animals should be monitored continuously to allow for adjustments through active adaptive management.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to introduce a newly developed multi-criteria analysis for the comparison of two grid expansion alternatives, conventional and voltage-regulated distribution transformer. The case study comprises environmental, economic, technical and social aspects.
   Design/methodology/approach The newly developed method decision condition Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (DC-PROMETHEE) combines scenario planning with the multi-attribute decision-making method PROMETHEE. DC-PROMETHEE supports the decision-maker to evaluate the total potential of an alternative considering a large number of decision conditions. The calculated performance indicator supports the decision-maker to select the best alternative.
   Findings The voltage-regulated distribution transformer shows a high overall potential in the present case study. This leads to the recommendation to the investigated distribution system operator to include the voltage-regulated distribution transformers as a grid expansion measure.
   Practical implications The DC-PROMETHEE can be applied to other distribution system operators by considering their individual grid topology and preferences. Other fields of application are infrastructure investments in the service area, in which expansion alternatives are evaluated in a large number of decision conditions. Examples include telecommunication, gas supply, water supply, sewage and rail networks.
   Originality/value This paper develops the DC-PROMETHEE approach. The DC-PROMETHEE enables the multi-criteria evaluation of a few alternatives in a large number of decision conditions.

AB  - The duration of the postfledging dependence period (PFDP) is supposed to be modulated by the parent offspring conflict: Offspring should extract the highest levels of parental investment, although parents may respond by setting fixed limits to the level of investment or by raising the costs of attempts to extract additional investment. In this context, longer PFDPs are expected in nests tended by higher quality parents and in dominant siblings. We explored these hypotheses with a combination of experimental and correlative results. First, we food supplemented offspring during the PFDP to study whether food supply during fledging, an indicator of parental quality, has an effect on the PRO duration in the Eurasian kestrel. We found that the PFDP was longer in food-supplemented nests. Second, we measured the duration of the PFDP over 3 years under different environmental conditions to explore whether the quality of parents and nestling phenotype were correlated with the duration of PFDP. Correlative results suggest that fledglings raised by higher quality parents and in the year with poorer food conditions showed longer PFDP. Furthermore, male fledglings showing grayer coloration in the rump (an index of competitive capacity) have longer PFDPs than browner males. Overall, our results suggest that parent, rather than offspring characteristics, can modulate the PFDP duration mediated by food conditions, although more colored nestlings stay in the nest territory for longer periods.

AB  - The degree of developmental instability has been hypothesized to reflect the level of environmental and genetic stress. However, levels of fluctuating asymmetry or other indicators of developmental instability are rarely measured in the same populations under field and common garden conditions, making it difficult to determine whether differences in asymmetry derived from field measurements are simply phenotypic or genetic in origin. We studied fluctuating asymmetry of leaves in three populations of Digitalis thapsi L. that differed dramatically in mean seed production under field conditions and when reared in a common garden. While absolute asymmetry decreased with leaf position, there was no position effect on relative asymmetry after adjustment for leaf width. Absolute and relative asymmetry did not differ between seedlings and mature plants in the greenhouse. There was no significant difference in absolute or relative asymmetry of leaves between plants grown in the greenhouse and in the field, although there was a significant population 3 rearing environment interaction. The number of leaves and the maximum length and width of leaves of mature plants reared in the common garden differed among populations. Fluctuating asymmetry in leaves was not significantly correlated with any measure of vegetative growth or reproduction. These findings indicate that the effects of environmental conditions and selection may override the effects of inherent differences. Thus, conclusions about levels of developmental instability in different populations based on field studies may differ considerably from conclusions based on results from common garden experiments.

AB  - Redox potential (E-H) measurements can provide qualitative information about sediment processes and conditions. However, there are problems associated with the measurement and interpretation of E-H values. The measurement difficulties can be partly addressed by ensuring that suitable indicator electrodes are properly cleaned and tested before use. We compared the performance of platinum and glassy carbon indicator electrodes, and concluded that the former are preferred for application to natural waters and sediment. However, glassy carbon electrodes may be more suitable for measuring redox potentials involving organic species. The most effective way to clean platinum electrodes was to use abrasive polishing routinely and concentrated nitric acid to overcome long term fouling. A 1:100 dilution of ZoBell's solution (while maintaining the original electrolyte strength) was found to be a sensitive test solution for determining the condition of indicator electrodes. While limitations to the interpretation of E-H will remain for most natural systems, we have demonstrated various ways in which useful information could be obtained from redox potential measurements in sediment using a multiple-electrode redox probe (MERP). These examples included general characterisation of the redox conditions of sediment from a vertical redox profile, highlighting zones of varying redox processes within a profile, and obtaining evidence of temporal changes in redox conditions that arise in estuarine sediment during tidal cycles.

AB  - The reliability of turbo-generator bearings affects the stability and safety of power plants. To detect early symptoms of failure, prediction of the performance degradation of turbo-generator bearings is particularly important. At present, most related research relies on accelerated degradation test platforms; however, the industrial field environment and complex working conditions may affect practical application. In this study, a performance degradation prediction approach for turbo-generator bearings considering complex working conditions based on a clustering indicator and a self-optimized deep learning model (SODLM) is proposed. First, the Dirichlet process-Gaussian mixture clustering model is introduced to construct the performance degradation indicator (PDI) of the turbo-generator. Then through introducing the hyper-parameter constraint, the hyper-parameter influence significance comparison mechanism, and the minimum training epoch, an improved hyperband (IH) is established to realize the automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters in the prediction model. Furthermore, the SODLM is constructed based on the IH and a stacked one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Finally, the performance degradation trend of a turbo-generator bearing in a practical industrial field is successfully predicted through the proposed approach. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed PDI avoids the influence of sampling frequency and complex working conditions. Compared with traditional optimization algorithms and prediction models, the proposed performance degradation prediction approach demonstrates better accuracy and stability.

AB  - There is a rivalry between policies on intensification of forest management to meet the demands of a growing bioeconomy, and policies on green infrastructure functionality. Evaluation of the net effects of different policy instruments on real-world outcomes is crucial. First, we present data on final felling rates in wood production landscapes and stand age distribution dynamic in two case study regions, and changes in dead wood amounts in Sweden. Second, the growth of formally protected areas was compiled and changes in functional connectivity analysed in these regions, and the development of dead wood and green tree retention in Sweden was described. The case studies were the counties Dalarna and Jamtland (77,000 km(2)) representing an expanding frontier of boreal forest transformation. In the wood production landscape, official final felling rates averaged 0.84%/year, extending the regional timber frontier. The amount of forest <60 years old increased from 27-34% in 1955 to 60-65% in 2017. The amounts of dead wood, a key forest naturalness indicator, declined from 1994 to 2016 in north Sweden, and increased in the south, albeit both at levels far below evidence-based biodiversity targets. Formal forest protection grew rapidly in the two counties from 1968 to 2020 but reached only 4% of productive forests. From 2000 to 2019, habitat network functionality for old Scots pine declined by 15-41%, and Norway spruce by 15-88%. There were mixed trends for dead wood and tree retention at the stand scale. The net result of the continued transformation of near-natural forest remnants and conservation efforts was negative at the regional and landscape levels, but partly positive at the stand scale. However, at all three scales, habitat amounts were far below critical thresholds for the maintenance of viable populations of species, let alone ecological integrity. Collaboration among stakeholder categories should reject opinionated narratives, and instead rely on evidence-based knowledge about green infrastructure pressures, responses, and states.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of fish is influenced by multiple factors at temporal and spatial scales, and their community composition represent good river integrity indicators. The main objective of this study was to describe the composition and structure of fish assemblages along the Anchique river sub-basin (that drains to Magdalena river), and to test the hypothesis that these communities vary temporally and spatially. For this, four sites (E1, E2, E3 and E4) were sampled along the river (from river birthplace to Magdalena river), during the periods of high and low waters, in 2014. In each site, longitudinal transects (100 m long x 2 m wide, 60 min) were established and fishing was made with both electrofishing and trawl (10 m x 1 m, 0.05 m) nets. Fish samples were fixed and transported to the laboratory for posterior taxonomic identification with the use of keys; fish diversity and structure composition were calculated with the use of standard models. Besides, substrate composition and environmental variables were also considered. A total of 652 fish belonging to 36 species were recorded; high water showed higher values (325 fish with 32 species) than low water period (300 fish with 31 species). Siluriformes was dominant (51 %), followed by Characiformes (32 %), Gymnotiformes (5 %), Cyprinidontiformes and Cichliformes (6 %). Most abundant families were Characidae (28.3 %; 9 spp.), Loricariidae (23.4 %; 8 spp.) and Trichomycteridae (15.0 %; 2 spp.). Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there is no significant difference among some environmental variables at the temporal level. The values of structural complexity and substrate composition indices showed that E4 had the highest values (0.8), followed by E1 (0.6), and E2 and E3 (0.4). Moreover, E4 had the highest richness and diversity, according to Hill's number. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that the substrate, and the complexity and width of the river channel, had a significant influence on fish composition and distribution. The fish community richness and diversity did not change temporarily, but did spatially, which could be related to the different structural features of sampling sites.

AB  - Species assemblages are related to environmental factors acting at different landscape scales. Local habitat heterogeneity also contributes to maintain the regional species pool. Understanding factors determining species presence is therefore crucial for formulation of successful conservation and management strategies. Odonates can reveal much about patterns of species assemblages since their presence at a site reflects both their dispersal ability and life cycle constraints. Odonate assemblages were studied at 31 ponds located in three different landscapes: forest, urban and field. The impact of pond geographical distribution and their local characteristics (i.e., vegetation, suspended matter, freshwater macroinvertebrates, pond area and temporariness) on odonate composition, species richness and larval presence were studied. According to their intrinsic requirements, damselfly and dragonfly presence on ponds depended on local characteristics. Some species of the two orders were only detected in field or forest ponds. Moreover, some species were never detected in urban ponds. Differences in odonate assemblages were mainly related to vegetation, freshwater macroinvertebrates and pond area. Species richness was related to predator abundance and pond area, especially for dragonflies. The presence and abundance of odonate larvae were both related to aquatic vegetation, and to contrasted aquatic variables of ponds. Therefore, this study confirms that vegetation within and around ponds determines odonate presence. Interestingly, in a pond, species detected at the adult stage were not always detected at the larval stage, highlighting the need to really consider both parts of the lifecycle when studying odonate assemblages. Diversity of local habitats within and around ponds depends strongly on the surrounding landscape and influences the assembly of odonates. Forest and field ponds presented particularly dissimilar species assemblages. Urban ponds had no specific environmental habitats compared to the other contexts. Species present on these ponds are rather generalist and able to support human disturbances. Overall, this study confirms that pond heterogeneity may be a key factor in maintaining the regional pool of odonate species.

AB  - New 'critical levels' (CLE) for assessing the effects of atmospheric ammonia on sensitive ecosystems have recently been adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) of 1 and 3 [2-4] mu g NH(3) m(-3) of ambient air (including water vapour), for different species sensitivities and their associated habitats. Based on these values, we examined how indicator choice affects estimates of stock-at-risk in the European 'Natura 2000' network.
   We applied an atmospheric model, FRAME, to estimate surface air concentrations of ammonia at 5 km and 1 km resolution for the UK network of Natura sites, optionally including calibration with the National Ammonia Monitoring Network. As a base indicator, we estimated the overall percentage area of the UK Natura network that exceeded critical level thresholds ('Area Weighted Indicator', AWI). We compared this with an alternative approach, estimating the percentage number of Natura sites where the critical level was exceeded (Designation Weighted Indicator', DWI), which we consider more relevant under the terms of the Habitats Directive.
   Using the AWI (with 1 km calibrated ammonia), we estimate that 11.2%, 1.3% and 0.2% area of the UK Natura network exceeds the critical level values of 1, 2 and 3 mu g NH(3) m(-3), respectively. By contrast, using the DWI, the equivalent exceedances are 59.1%, 23.6% and 9.8%. The highest regional exceedance (DWI, critical level 1 mu g NH(3) m(-3)) was calculated for England (91.9% exceeded), and the lowest for Scotland (24.0% exceeded). High resolution maps show that the larger threat estimated by the DWI approach is explained by (i) an anti-correlation between NH(3) concentration and Natura site area and (ii) the fact that exceedance over part of a Natura site is considered to represent a threat to the integrity of the whole site.

AB  - Growth and chemical compositional characteristics of the brown tide-forming alga, Aureoumbra lagunensis Stockwell, DeYoe, Hargraves et Johnson, were studied through a series of nitrogen-limited and phosphate-limited continuous cultures over a range of growth rates. The specific growth rate of A. lagunensis was hyperbolically related to the cell quota of the limiting nutrient in ammonium-limited cultures. In phosphate-limited cultures, the relationship was best described by a straight line. The N cell quota of A. lagunensis ranges from about 20 fmol at zero growth rate under N-limited conditions to a high of roughly 85 fmol under N-replete conditions. Similarly, the P cell quota of A. lagunensis ranges from about 0.15 fmol at zero growth rate under P-limited conditions to a high of 2 fmol under P-replete conditions. Aureoumbra lagunensis has a very high N:P critical ratio (> 100). The high N:P critical ratio, as well as the organism's apparent ability to use forms of phosphorus other than phosphate under severe phosphate deficiency, may partially explain its success in P-limited environments, such as the Laguna Madre. In addition, a uniqe quadratic relationship between the productivity index (PI) and growth rate was discovered. Such a relationship supports an earlier argument that PI may not be a good indicator of nutritional status.

AB  - While post-release mortality estimates have been conducted on a range of shark species, the short-term sublethal effects of capture, handling and release are poorly known and have been mostly investigated in controlled conditions. In addition, the widely accepted notion that immediate post-release active swimming is an indicator of shark condition has never been tested. This study assessed the effects of deck exposure by analysing postrelease behaviour of two species of shark, the draughtboard (Cephaloscyllium laticeps) and the piked spurdog (Squalus megalops) in-situ using a remote-operated-vehicle and in a replicated experiment in controlled conditions. In total, 67 sharks were caught with demersal fish trawls and commercial longlines and subjected to different deck exposures and release environments. Tailbeat rates of deck-exposed sharks were significantly lower than the control sharks, but this effect differed between in-situ and experimental environments. Results indicate that capture has species-specific effects, that post-release effects may last longer than 5 min, and that controlled experiments may not be reliable indicators of post-release effects. Immediate post-release swimming was not a good predictor of post-release behaviour, suggesting capture and release fisheries may have significant sub-lethal effects on some species of shark, and that limiting capture or handling time may reduce post-release effects.

AB  - Iron availability limits primary productivity in large areas of the world's oceans. Ascertaining the iron status of phytoplankton is essential for understanding the factors regulating their growth and ecology. We developed an incubationindependent, molecular-based approach to assess the iron nutritional status of specific members of the diatom community, initially focusing on the ecologically important pennate diatom Pseudonitzschia. Through a comparative transcriptomic approach, we identified two genes that track the iron status of Pseudo-nitzschia with high fidelity. The first gene, ferritin (FTN), encodes for the highly specialized iron storage protein induced under ironreplete conditions. The second gene, ISIP2a, encodes an iron-concentrating protein induced under iron-limiting conditions. In the oceanic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia granii (Hasle) Hasle, transcript abundance of these genes directly relates to changes in iron availability, with increased FTN transcript abundance under iron-replete conditions and increased ISIP2a transcript abundance under iron-limiting conditions. The resulting ISIP2a: FTN transcript ratio reflects the iron status of cells, where a high ratio indicates iron limitation. Field samples collected from iron grow-out microcosm experiments conducted in low iron waters of the Gulf of Alaska and variable iron waters in the California upwelling zone verify the validity of our proposed Pseudo-nitzschia Iron Limitation Index, which can be used to ascertain in situ iron status and further developed for other ecologically important diatoms.

AB  - The impacts of seawater acidification and salinity shifts on metabolism, energy reserves, and oxidative status of mussels have been largely neglected. With the aim to increase the current knowledge for the mussel Mytilus galtoprovincialis a 28-day chronic test was conducted during which mussels were exposed to two pH (7.8 and 7.3; both at control salinity 28) and three salinity (14, 28 and 35, at control pH, 7.8) levels. After exposure to different conditions, mussels electron transport system activity, energy reserves (protein and glycogen content) carbonic anhydrase activity, antioxidant defences and cellular damage were measured. Results obtained showed that mussels exposed to seawater acidification presented decreased metabolic capacity that may have induced lower energy expenditure (observed in higher glycogen, protein and lipids content at this condition). Low pH condition induced the increase of carbonic anhydrase activity that was related to acid-base balance, while no significant activation of antioxidant defence mechanisms was observed resulting in higher LPO. Regarding the impacts of salinity, the present study showed that at the highest salinity (35) mussels presented lower metabolic activity (also related to lower energetic expenditure) and an opposite response was observed at salinity 14. Carbonic anhydrase slightly increased at stressful salinity conditions, a mechanism of homeostasis maintenance. Lower metabolic activity at the highest salinity, probably related to valves closure, helped to mitigate the increase of 120 in this condition. At low salinity (14), despite an increase of antioxidant enzymes activity, 120 increased, probably as a result of ROS overproduction from higher electron transport system activity. The present findings demonstrated that Mytilus galloprovincialis oxidative status and metabolic capacity were negatively affected by low pH and salinity changes, with alterations that may lead to physiological impairments namely on mussels reproductive output, growth performance and resistance to disease, with ecological and economic implications.

AB  - Physical performance is crucial for animal survival and fitness. In this context, greater bite forces can provide advantages and may allow an individual to gain access to reproductive partners and/or different food resources. Here, we explored the determinants of bite force in a wild population of the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). Our objectives were to elucidate (1) if sex, head width, heart rate (as an indicator of overall physical fitness) and body condition drive variation in bite force in this population of wild mouse lemurs; and (2) the relative importance of the ecological niche in determining bite force by comparing results from this wild population with previously published results on bite force, body mass and head width from a laboratory colony of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). We captured 32 wild brown mouse lemurs at night in the Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar during the beginning of the rainy season from 1st to 31st October 2016. We measured bite force, heart rate, body mass and head width of all individuals, and assigned sex and body condition (estimated as the unstandardized residual of a regression of body mass against head size). Although maximum bite force was positively correlated with body mass, it was not correlated with body condition. Residual bite force was highly correlated with residual head width and heart rate. The mean bite force of wild brown mouse lemurs was much lower than that of grey mouse lemurs in captivity, but showed similar relationships to head dimension and body mass. Even when corrected by body condition, grey mouse lemurs bit significantly harder than brown mouse lemurs. The difference in bite force between species could be explained by differences in head size and niche divergence with brown mouse lemurs eating mostly soft fruits and grey mouse lemurs eating more hard insects.

AB  - Sedimentary records of redox-sensitive trace elements hold significant potential as indicators of paleoceanographic environmental conditions. Records of Re can reveal the intensity of past reducing conditions in sediments at the time of deposition, whereas records of Ag may record the magnitude of past diatom fluxes to the seafloor. Confidence in paleoenvironmental reconstruction from records of either metal, however, requires it to have experienced negligible redistribution since deposition. This study examines diagenetic rearrangements of Re and Ag that occur in response to exposure to bottom-water O-2 in environments of low sedimentation rate, including Madeira Abyssal Plain turbidites and eastern Mediterranean basin sapropels. Authigenic Re was remobilized quantitatively by oxidation but poorly retained by the underlying sediments. All records are consistent with previous work demonstrating that only a limited reimmobilization of Re occurs preferentially in C-org-rich, reducing sediments. Silver was also mobilized quantitatively by oxidation, but it was subsequently immobilized more efficiently in all cases as sharp peaks immediately into anoxic conditions below active oxidation fronts, and these peaks remain immobile in anoxic conditions during long-term burial. Comparison of Ag, S, and Se records from various cores suggests that Ag is likely to have been immobilized as a selenide, a mechanism previously proposed for Hg in similar situations (Mercone et al., 1999). Coexisting narrow peaks of Ag and Hg with Se offer a means of assessing whether oxidative burndown has ever occurred at the top of C-org- and sulfide-rich sedimentary units. Although these results suggest that caution must be used when inferring paleoenvironmental information from records of Ag and Re in cores with low sediment accumulation rates (<5 cm ka(-1)), they should not affect the promise that authigenic Ag and Re records hold for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in sediments with higher accumulation rates and where anoxic conditions have been maintained continuously.

AB  - The prognostic is the key to the state-based maintenance of Francis turbine units (FTUs), which consists of performance state evaluation and degradation trend prediction. In practical engineering environments, there are three significant difficulties: low data quality, complex variable operation conditions, and prediction model parameter optimization. In order to effectively solve the above three problems, an ensemble prognostic method of FTUs using low-quality data under variable operation conditions is proposed in this study. Firstly, to consider the operation condition parameters, the running data set of the FTU is constructed by the water head, active power, and vibration amplitude of the top cover. Then, to improve the robustness of the proposed model against anomaly data, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is introduced to clean outliers and singularities in the raw running data set. Next, considering the randomness of the monitoring data, the healthy state model based on the Gaussian mixture model is constructed, and the negative log-likelihood probability is calculated as the performance degradation indicator (PDI). Furthermore, to predict the trend of PDIs with confidence interval and automatically optimize the prediction model on both accuracy and certainty, the multiobjective prediction model is proposed based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and Gaussian process regression. Finally, monitoring data from an actual large FTU was used for effectiveness verification. The stability and smoothness of the PDI curve are improved by 3.2 times and 1.9 times, respectively, by DBSCAN compared with 3-sigma. The root-mean-squared error, the prediction interval normalized average, the prediction interval coverage probability, the mean absolute percentage error, and the R2 score of the proposed method achieved 0.223, 0.289, 1.000, 0.641%, and 0.974, respectively. The comparison experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to low-quality data and has better accuracy, certainty, and reliability for the prognostic of the FTU under complex operating conditions.

AB  - Low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and consequently may affect the heavy metal transport in aquifer systems. In this study, the influences of LMWOAs on the transport of Cd2+ under different pH conditions in saturated porous media were evaluated. For this, three LMWOAs such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid were employed. A two-site nonequilibrium transport model was applied to simulate the transport data. Under acidic conditions (pH 5.0), the results indicated that LMWOAs inhibited the transport of Cd2+ even at the low concentrations of organic acids (i.e., 0.05 and 0.1 mM). The inhibition effects might be attributed to the complexation role of the sand surface-bound organic acids and also electrostatic interaction. Meanwhile, the inhibition effects of LMWOAs on Cd2+ transport in the following order of citric acid > tartaric acid > acetic acid, which was also in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between Cd2+ and LMWOAs. This order may be dependent on their molecular structures (i.e., amount and type of functional groups) and complexing strength. Interestingly, when the LMWOA concentrations 0.5 mM, tartaric acid and citric acid still inhibited Cd2+ transport, while acetic acid slightly enhanced the Cd2+ mobility due to its weaker complexing strength. However, under neutral conditions (pH 7.0), LMWOAs generally enhanced the transport of Cd2+. The transport-enhancement of LMWOAs was ascribed to the formation of stable aqueous non-adsorbing Cd-organic acid complexes. In addition, citric acid could obviously inhibit the transport of Cd2+ under competitive transport conditions (i.e., with competing cations), which is mainly due to different complex affinities of citric acid to Pb2+ and Cd2+. These findings demonstrate that LMWOAs may inhibit or facilitate Cd2+ transport under different environmental conditions. Thus, environmental assessment concerning the transport of heavy metals should consider the roles of organic acids. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work aimed to explore the potential of autochthonous microorganisms from an urban estuary and from activated sludge of an associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), for biodegradation of an antidepressant drug, paroxetine, and on a cholesterol-lowering agent, bezafibrate. These compounds were chosen as representatives of extensively used pharmaceuticals. Autochthonous microorganisms from the indicated sources were exposed to the target pharmaceuticals (1 mg/L) in co-metabolism with sodium acetate (500 mg/L) along a two-weeks period, for a total of 7 two-weeks periods (here referred as cycles). Exposures were carried out in batch mode, under different incubation conditions (agitation vs. static). Removal of pharmaceuticals was monitored at the end of each cycle, by analysing the culture medium. For paroxetine, fluoride ion release was also followed as an indicator of defluorination of the molecule. The structure of the bacterial communities was analysed by ARISA (Automated rRNA Intergenic Spacer Analysis), at the beginning of the experiment and at the end of the first and the last cycles to identify substantial changes associated with the time of exposure, the incubation conditions and the presence and type of pharmaceuticals. Incubation conditions affected not only the bacterial community structure, but also the biodegradation efficiency. At the beginning of the experiment, removal of target pharmaceuticals was found to be lower under agitation than under static conditions, but at the end of the experiment, results showed high removal of the pharmaceuticals from the culture medium (> 97%) under both conditions, mainly by microbiological processes. For paroxetine, adsorption and abiotic processes also had an important influence on its removal, but defluorination only occurred in the presence of microorganisms.

AB  - Reliable estimates of short- and longer-term in situ growth and condition of organisms are critical if one hopes to understand how the environment regulates survival. This study reports the first comparison of somatic- (K), biochemical- (RNA-DNA ratio, RD) and otolith- (increment widths, OIW) based indices of condition of a young juvenile fish. Measurements were made on European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) that had i) known differences in somatic growth rate caused by providing different, constant prey ration levels, ii) been fed ad libitum at 7, 11, 15, 18 and 22 degrees C, and iii) been deprived of prey for either 4,8 or 12 days and re-fed for 8 days. All three proxies explained significant amounts (70 to 90%) of the variability in measured growth rate. In fish experiencing a change in their feeding level and concomitant change in mass-at-length (K), RD tracked changes in both length and mass while OIW only tracked changes in length. Values of OIW and RD were highest at 18 degrees C suggesting that this is the optimal temperature for growth in these juveniles. During food deprivation, RD and OIW rapidly decreased and reached their lowest values within similar to 4 days. Upon re-feeding, RD increased most rapidly, K was most variable and the response time in OIW was slowest (two-times slower than RD). These patterns reflected preferential allocation of food energy to restore body mass in recently re-fed fish prior to fish increasing both mass and length. These results indicate that the sensitivity and applicability of growth proxies depend on the recent feeding history, that proxies have different response times, and that caution be taken when inferring growth and condition in early life stages of fishes that forage in patchy prey environments.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential for using functional feeding groups (FFGs) as indicators of water quality conditions in rivers, using the Buffalo River, South Africa, as a specific example. Multivariate classification and ordination techniques were used to investigate species and FFG distributions in relation to a number of physico-chemical variables at 16 sites from the headwaters to the estuary of the Buffalo River.
   Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) of species composition ranked most of the sites sequentially down the river, irrespective of water quality conditions. Ordination of FFGs from a set of riffle samples collected in mid-late summer showed only weak relationships between FFG distribution and water quality changes, except where variables changed sequentially down the river (e.g. pH and temperature). Individual species responses to water quality gradients were examined for nine riffle-dwelling species representing diverse FFGs. Following correspondence analysis of a matrix of environmental variables and species frequencies, some species showed strong associations with defined ranges of some variables. In particular, Adenophlebia auriculata (Leptophlebiidae, Ephemeroptera) from the headwater sampling site, was associated with low pH and low temperature. Simulium damnosum occurred under conditions of high turbidity, while Afronurus harrisoni was found under high concentrations of potassium, ammonium and nitrite ions.
   We conclude that although there was a distinct headwaters fauna in the Buffalo River, and sequential downstream changes in species composition, most FFGs (apart from shredders) were represented down the whole length of the river. FFG classifications are therefore unlikely to provide useful indications of water quality conditions in the Buffalo River.
   Using a categorical approach to classifying water quality variables, and by applying correspondence analysis to the resulting matrix, we recognised nine species that could be used to define water quality. These indicator species can be used to define tolerance ranges of the fauna for water quality conditions in different parts of the Buffalo river.

AB  - To date, projections of European crop yields under climate change have been based almost entirely on the outputs of crop-growth models. While this strategy can provide good estimates of the effects of climatic factors, soil conditions and management on crop yield, these models usually do not capture all of the important aspects related to crop management, or the relevant environmental factors. Moreover, crop-simulation studies often have severe limitations with respect to the number of crops covered or the spatial extent. The present study, based on agroclimatic indices, provides a general picture of agroclimatic conditions in western and central Europe (study area lays between 8.5 degrees W-27 degrees E and 37-63.5 degrees N), which allows for a more general assessment of climate-change impacts. The results obtained from the analysis of data from 86 different sites were clustered according to an environmental stratification of Europe. The analysis was carried for the baseline (1971-2000) and future climate conditions (time horizons of 2030, 2050 and with a global temperature increase of 5 degrees C) based on outputs of three global circulation models. For many environmental zones, there were clear signs of deteriorating agroclimatic condition in terms of increased drought stress and shortening of the active growing season, which in some regions become increasingly squeezed between a cold winter and a hot summer. For most zones the projections show a marked need for adaptive measures to either increase soil water availability or drought resistance of crops. This study concludes that rainfed agriculture is likely to face more climate-related risks, although the analyzed agroclimatic indicators will probably remain at a level that should permit rainfed production. However, results suggests that there is a risk of increasing number of extremely unfavorable years in many climate zones, which might result in higher interannual yield variability and constitute a challenge for proper crop management.

AB  - Substrate conditions are considered crucial for the survival of juvenile freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera L.)-and therefore for the recovery of overaged populations in danger of extinction - as fine sediments can clog the interstitial habitat and hamper water and oxygen circulation to the juveniles. Watercourses and their bed sediments must meet two seemingly diametrically opposite requirements in order to offer the freshwater pearl mussel appropriate habitats: stable substrates for all live stages and an unclogged interstitial for the juveniles. As only few scientific publications deal with subsurface conditions in pearl mussel brooks, the present preliminary study tries to contribute to this topic by compiling a variety of chemical and hydromorphological data from several Austrian watercourses with distinctly different characteristics. It was clearly shown that discharge patterns, hydraulic pressure, water depths and flow velocities affect both river bed stability and the perfusion of the hyporheic zone: In an artificial millrace with permanent low flow conditions and a permanently stable substrate a distinct barrier was detected within the first 5 cm substrate depth that totally blocks the interchange between surface and interstitial water, resulting in an accumulation of substances of all kinds, among them potentially toxic substances. Such a barrier was also found to be building up in several natural watercourses, clearly indicating the danger of adverse land-use and of long-term low flow conditions in smaller brooks (given that the local decrease in precipitation, proven in long-term studies, proceeds). Significant differences in substrate concentrations in the interstitial water were detected between watercourses, whereas chemical conditions in the surface water exhibited no differences at all. An accompanying biomonitoring study showed high survival rates all over the study area, indicating the suitability of juvenile freshwater pearl mussels as bioindicators in terms of surface water, but not of interstitial water.

AB  - Marine food webs are structured through a combination of top-down and bottom-up processes. In coral reef ecosystems, fish size is related to life-history characteristics and size-based indicators can represent the distribution and flow of energy through the food web. Thus, size spectra can be a useful tool for investigating the impacts of both fishing and habitat condition on the health and productivity of coral reef fisheries. In addition, coral reef fisheries are often data-limited and size spectra analysis can be a relatively cost-effective and simple method for assessing fish populations. Abundance size spectra are widely used and quantify the relationship between organism size and relative abundance. Previous studies that have investigated the impacts of fishing and habitat condition together on the size distribution of coral reef fishes, however, have aggregated all fishes regardless of taxonomic identity. This leads to a poor understanding of how fishes with different feeding strategies, body size-abundance relationships, or catchability might be influenced by top-down and bottom-up drivers. To address this gap, we quantified size spectra slopes of carnivorous and herbivorous coral reef fishes across three regions of Indonesia representing a gradient in fishing pressure and habitat conditions. We show that fishing pressure was the dominant driver of size spectra slopes such that they became steeper as fishing pressure increased, which was due to the removal of large-bodied fishes. When considering fish functional groups separately, however, carnivore size spectra slopes were more heavily impacted by fishing than herbivores. Also, structural complexity, which can mediate predator-prey interactions and provisioning of resources, was a relatively important driver of herbivore size spectra slopes such that slopes were shallower in more complex habitats. Our results show that size spectra slopes can be used as indicators of fishing pressure on coral reef fishes, but aggregating fish regardless of trophic identity or functional role overlooks differential impacts of fishing pressure and habitat condition on carnivore and herbivore size distributions.

AB  - 1. Effective management of fish and wildlife populations benefits from an understanding of the effects of stressors on individual physiology. While physiological knowledge can provide a mechanistic understanding of organismal responses, its applied utility is limited because it cannot easily be used by stakeholders.
   2. Reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP) is a method that involves checking for the presence or absence of natural animal reflexes to generate a condition (RAMP) score in response to stressors and to predict fate. The method has previously been validated with fishes in artificial laboratoryand field-based holding studies as a responsive measure of fisheries capture stress and a predictor of delayed mortality, but has not been evaluated in the wild.
   3. We used radio telemetry to monitor migration success of 50 endangered coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch following incidental capture in an aboriginal beach seine fishery in the lower Fraser River (Canada). RAMP was used to measure the condition of fish at release and to predict migration success following capture. Biopsy of an additional 43 coho profiled physiological condition at time of release.
   4. Individuals with greater reflex impairment (higher RAMP scores) at release experienced significantly higher rates of migration failure. RAMPscores were also significantly correlated with fishery handling time. Plasma variables showed that captured coho had experienced physiological stress characteristic of exhaustive exercise and hypoxia, with significantly elevated cortisol and lactate values for fish entangled longer in fishing gear.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This is the first validation of RAMP in a wild setting. Based on our findings, fishers could use the method and make adjustments in fishing behaviour in real-time to improve fish condition and reduce the mortality of bycatch, and conservation practitioners could monitor animal condition and identify problems that deserve management attention. RAMP is an easy, rapid and inexpensive approach to predicting mortality and measuring vitality and performed better than traditional physiological tools that cannot easily be used by stakeholders.

AB  - Endophytic fungus-tall fescue symbiosis can improve the rhizosphere physical quality, but contribution of oxygen-limited conditions on this change, particularly in semiarid and arid regions has not been established yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on the rhizosphere quality indicators under different aeration conditions in a greenhouse pot experiment. The treatments were seven levels of air-filled porosity, AFP (0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.750, 0.100, 0.125 and 0.150 m(3 )m(-3)) in a sandy loam soil, and two genotypes (75C and 75B) of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea = Schedonorus arundinaceus Schreb.) each with endophytic fungus Epichloe coenophiala (E+) and without endophyte (E-). Soil biophysical properties were determined on the intact soil aggregates from rhizosphere zone: structural stability (by HEMC, high energy moisture characteristic), percent of water-stable aggregates, water repellency, basal soil respiration and soil organic matter. The results showed that by decreasing the AFP, and reducing redox potential to < 300 mV, (i) all biophysical indices, and the activity and population of soil microorganisms (especially fungi) significantly decreased, (ii) the role of biological and chemical aggregators was reduced and soil structure degradation was intensified, and (iii) aggregate stability indices and water repellency were associated with the quality of soil organic matter, rather than its quantity. Soil structural stability under genotype 75B was higher and lower than genotype 75C for the oxygen-limited and non-limited conditions, respectively. Stability indices, water repellency and soil organic matter content were greater in the rhizosphere of E+ plants compared to E-ones. No significant differences were observed for the HEMC stability indices between 75B and 75C genotypes for E+ plants, whereas for the E- plants, they were significantly greater in genotype 75C. Endophytic fungi increased the rhizosphere aggregate stability through the water-repellent exudates, extension of root system and enhanced organic carbon storage especially under oxygen-limited conditions.

AB  - Farmed adult Greenshell (TM) mussels were exposed to a range of conditions immediately after harvest to evaluate the effects on emersion survival and the implications for live transport. Two experiments were performed, coinciding with the mussel harvest season during summer and winter 2017. In the summer experiment, a wide range of conditions were tested to identify alternatives to be evaluated in more detail during the winter experiment. The postharvest experimental conditions selected included transient re-immersion at different temperatures, cold and heat-shock, tidal simulation, and packing with ice. These treatments aimed to either reduce postharvest stress and/or give the mussels a potentially beneficial physiological and behavioural advantage to help them cope with emersion. The mussels responses in terms of gaping and survival differed between summer and winter, and among and within treatments. Sub-ambient temperature seawater exposure after harvest tended to improve the survival time of the mussels in both seasons, the effect being dependent on both temperature and duration of the exposure. Some of the differences observed could be explained by the conditions (in the wild and in the laboratory) to which the mussels were exposed before emersion and the different capability that each mussel has to cope with stress. However, the exact mechanisms driving these changes are not fully understood and require further investigation. This study, nevertheless, indicates that emersion survival (i.e. live mussel shelf-life) could be extended by re-immersion after harvest combined with a sub-lethal cold-shock followed by immersed recovery before transportation. If the commercial shelf-life of live product can be significantly extended, the implications for food quality and safety will also need to be evaluated. A similar approach could be applied in other shellfish such as other species of mussels as well as oysters or clams to improve shelf-life, considering their physiological capabilities and behaviour and how those are affected by environmental conditions in different seasons or regions.

AB  - Anthropogenic development has adversely affected river habitat and species diversity in urban rivers, and existing habitats are jeopardized by future uncertainties in water resources management and climate. The Los Angeles River (LAR), for example, is a highly modified system that has been mostly channelized for flood control purposes, has altered hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, and is thermally altered (warmed), which severely limits the habitat suitability for cold water fish species. Efforts are currently underway to provide suitable environmental flows and improve channel hydraulic conditions, such as depth and velocity, for adult fish migration from the Pacific Ocean to upstream spawning areas. However, the thermal responses of restoration alternatives for resident and migrating cold water fish have not been fully investigated. Using a mechanistic model, we simulated the LAR's water temperature under baseline conditions and future alternative restoration scenarios for migration of the native, anadromous steelhead trout in Southern California and the historically resident Santa Ana sucker. We considered three scenarios: 1) increasing roughness of the low-flow channel, 2) increasing the depth and width of the low-flow channel, and 3) allowing subsurface inflow to the river at a soft bottom reach in the LA downtown area. Our analysis indicates that the maximum weekly average temperature (MaxWAT) in the baseline condition was 28.9 degrees C, suggesting that the current river temperatures would act as a limiting factor during the steelhead migration season and habitat for Santa Ana sucker. The MaxWAT dropped about 3%-28 degrees C after applying all the considered scenarios at the study site, which is 3 degrees C higher than the determined steelhead survival threshold. Our simulations suggest that without consideration of thermal restoration, restoring hydraulic conditions may be insufficient to support cold water fish migration or year-round resident native fish populations, particularly with potential river temperature increases due to climate change.

AB  - The global problem of groundwater being contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) originating from highly contaminated soils has created a need to remediate these locations. In situ immobilisation of PFASs in soil by applying sorbents is often a preferred low-cost technique to reduce their mobility and leaching to groundwater, but the long-term efficacy of sorbents has not yet been investigated. In this study, the longevity of remediation of two different soils by two common sorbents (RemBind (R), and pulverized activated carbon, Filtrasorb (TM) 400) was assessed. Regulatory agencies often rely on standardised leaching procedures to assess the risk of contaminant mobility in soils. Hence, the Australian Standard Leaching Procedure and the U.S. EPA Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework were applied to quantify the desorption/leaching of a wide range of PFASs from unremediated and remediated soils under a range of pH conditions (pH 2 to 12). Ease of desorption and subsequent leaching from the unremediated soils was related to C-chain length; while short-chain PFASs were easily desorbed and leached, long-chain PFASs were more difficult to desorb. Desorption of long-chain PFASs was also pH dependent in unremediated soils, with desorption being greater at high pH. Both sorbents retained PFASs strongly in the remediated soils (> 99% for most PFASs) across a broad range of pH conditions, with only small differences between the sorbents in terms of efficacy. Both sorbents showed better retention of PFASs under low pH conditions. Remediation of PFAS-contaminated soils with these sorbents could be considered robust and durable in terms of changes in soil pH, with little risk of subsequent PFASs desorption under normal environmental pH conditions. Ultimately, to give regulators and site owners the greatest level of confidence that immobilisation is stable for the longer term, it should also be tested under repeated cycles of leaching and under different conditions.

AB  - In modern siliciclastic environments terrestrial and aquatic vegetation binds substrate, controls weathering and erosion rates, influences run-off, sediment supply and subsequent depositional architecture. This study assesses the applicability of modern depositional models that are impacted by vascular vegetation, as analogues for ancient pre-land plant systems. A review of pre-Devonian published literature demonstrates a paucity of described tidal successions; this is possibly due to the application of modern analogues for interpreting the record when there is a lack of tidal indicators. This paucity suggests a need for revised models of tidal deposition that consider the different environmental conditions prior to land plant evolution. This study examines the Ordovician-Silurian Tumblagooda Sandstone, which is exposed in the gorge of the Murchison River and coastal cliffs near Kalbarri, Western Australia. The Tumblagooda Sandstone comprises stacked sand-rich facies, with well-preserved bedforms and trace fossils. Previous interpretations of the depositional setting have proposed from a mixed sheet-braided fluvial and intertidal flats; to a continental setting dominated by fluvial and aeolian processes. An enigmatic element is the rarity of mud-rich facies preserved in the succession. Outcrop logging, facies and petrographic analysis record dominantly shallow water conditions with episodes of emergence. Abundant ichnotaxa indicate that marine conditions and bi-directional flow structures are evidence for an intertidal and subtidal depositional environment. A macrotidal estuary setting is proposed, with evidence for tidal channels and repeated fluvial incursions. Physical and biogenic sedimentary structures are indicative of tidal conditions. The lack of clay and silt resulted in the absence of flaser or lenticular-bedding. Instead cyclic deposition of thin beds and foreset bioturbation replaced mud drape deposits. Higher energy conditions prevailed in the absence of the binding activity of plants in the terrestrial and marine realm. This is suggestive of different weathering processes and a reduction in the preservation of some sedimentary features.

TI  - Linear mixed-effects models to describe length-weight relationships for yellow croaker (Larimichthys Polyactis) along the north coast of China
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, length-weight relationships and relative condition factors were analyzed for Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) along the north coast of China. Data covered six regions from north to south: Yellow River Estuary, Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong, Jiaozhou Bay, Coastal Waters of Qingdao, Haizhou Bay, and South Yellow Sea. In total 3,275 individuals were collected during six years (2008, 2011 -2015). One generalized linear model, two simply linear models and nine linear mixed effect models that applied the effects from regions and/or years to coefficient a and/or the exponent b were studied and compared. Among these twelve models, the linear mixed effect model with random effects from both regions and years fit the data best, with lowest Akaike information criterion value and mean absolute error. In this model, the estimated a was 0.0192, with 95% confidence interval 0.0178 similar to 0.0308, and the estimated exponent b was 2.917 with 95% confidence interval 2.731 similar to 2.945. Estimates for a and b with the random effects in intercept and coefficient from Region and Year, ranged from 0.013 to 0.023 and from 2.835 to 3.017, respectively. Both regions and years had effects on parameters a and b, while the effects from years were shown to be much larger than those from regions. Except for Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong, a decreased from north to south. Condition factors relative to reference years of 1960, 1986, 2005, 2007, 2008 similar to 2009 and 2010 revealed that the body shape of Yellow Croaker became thinner in recent years. Furthermore relative condition factors varied among months, years, regions and length. The values of a and relative condition factors decreased, when the environmental pollution became worse, therefore, length-weight relationships could be an indicator for the environment quality. Results from this study provided basic description of current condition of Yellow Croaker along the north coast of China.

AB  - The present report is the companion study of our previous study in which we investigated the impact of the dissolved organic matter, water cationic composition and pH on the bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of copper (Cu) in aquatic mosses (Fontinalis antipyretica). The impact had been assessed under laboratory controlled conditions and modelled using a two-compartment model calibrated under a wide range of water compositions (Ferreira et al., 2008, 2009). Herein are reported the validation stage of the abovementioned approach for contrasted geochemical field conditions.
   Experiments were performed with aquatic mosses that were exposed for 7 d to two nominal Cu concentrations (5 and 15 mu g L-1) in a flow-through field microcosm supplied with four contrasting natural waters. At the end of the exposure period, a 6-fold difference in the bioaccumulated Cu contamination levels was found among the four deployment sites, suggesting a significant control of the water quality on the metal bioaccumulation by aquatic mosses.
   In parallel, the so-called 'labile' Cu concentration for the same four field conditions was determined using a DGT device (Diffusive Gradient in Thin film). By coupling these DGT measurements and a cation competition model involving Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and H+, the time-dependent Cu concentrations in aquatic mosses were predicted; these simulation results were compared to the actual bioaccumulation of Cu in mosses.
   We found that any bioaccumulation model that ignores water characteristics is not suitable to predict the Cu accumulation by aquatic mosses under various water quality conditions. Instead, we found that our approach integrating DGT measurements and cationic composition was able to reproduce the Cu bioaccumulation kinetics by aquatic mosses for a wide range of water quality conditions.
   In conclusion, the DGT approach was demonstrated to be a dynamic in situ measuring technique that can be used as a surrogate of bioindicators if the cationic correction is taken into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - RNA/DNA ratios are used in many organisms as an indicator of growth, biomass or metabolic functioning. We hypothesised that hermatypic corals, as they depend for growth largely on energy transferred from their algal symbionts, may show an effect in the RNA/DNA ratio with factors influencing irradiance. This was tested along 2 environmental gradients: in relation to depth (decreasing irradiance) and in relation to environmental degradation (increased turbidity). RNA/DNA ratios were determined by HPLC in coral samples collected over depth gradients in 3 islands off the coast of north-west Java, Indonesia. The reefs range from shallow reefs (depth < 3 m) in very turbid water, which are close to eroded shores, to intermediate reefs (depth < 6 m) further from the shore with less turbid water, to offshore clear water control reefs (depth < 20 m). RNA/DNA ratio was shown to be negatively correlated with depth in all but the most turbid conditions, suggesting it is an expression of metabolic acclimatisation of the coral host-symbiont community with decreasing irradiance (i.e. photoadaptation). Comparing the RNA/DNA ratio in clear and turbid waters, the decrease with depth tended to be steeper over a shorter depth range under turbid conditions, analogous with the more rapid extinction of light in these conditions. The relationship between the RNA/DNA ratio and light was consistently higher under turbid conditions (p = 0.0037), indicating that RNA/DNA ratio had shifted to a higher level, possibly indicating a genetic adaptation in the metabolic functioning of corals in the turbid environment. The positive relation between light and RNA/DNA ratio would suggest the opposite, i.e. lower ratio under turbid conditions. The RNA/DNA ratio may provide a relatively reliable method to determine the metabolic functioning (health) of individual coral colonies.

AB  - Fertility of soils is largely determined by their physical and chemical properties. Response of soil environment is a mobile indicator of soil fertility. Direction and intensity of almost all soil processes that provide nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium regimes of soils, as well as availability of macro- and microelements for plants, depend on it. The paper presents the result of a field study of acid-alkaline conditions of profiles of black soil of typical and leached different terms of agricultural use of soil catens of the meadow-steppe section of the Belgorod region in 2019. The research object was different-age arable areas with an age of agricultural development of 140 and 240 years, respectively. The steepness of surface in areas corresponding to the meadow-steppe zonal landscape of the forest-steppe did not exceed 4-6 degrees. As a result of field studies, 32 incisions were studied in the meadow-steppe section (6 incisions on background catens and 12 incisions on open catens). Each incision was provided with layered values of morphometric indicators of soil horizons. For background steppe soils, shade slopes are characterized by more alkaline conditions, in comparison with southern slopes. For 140-year-old arable land, the situation is opposite: shadow slopes have a more acidic reaction of the medium, in comparison with insoluble ones; for 240-year-old arable land, alkaline-acid conditions on the slopes of opposite expositions did not differ significantly. In the first 140 years of plowing, acidification of the soil profile occurs; the difference in the pH value between the background and arable land values of 140 years of age on the slope of the northern exposition reaches 1.6 on the surface, gradually decreasing to 0.2 at depth. Further plowing leads to alkalization of the soil profile by 0.6-0.9 pH units. The research results can be used in development of agricultural systems in crop industries.

AB  - The identification of hydric soils is important for wetland delineation and protection. South Africa currently uses the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) wetland delineation guidelines which can be subjective in certain contexts. A robust technical standard that can be legally conclusive is therefore required and should be developed for South African conditions. The National Technical Committee of Hydric Soils (NTCHS, 2007) in the United States of America has accepted the Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) tube methodology as a technical standard, but this had not yet been tested in South Africa. It is proposed that the NTCHS (2007) be adapted for use in South Africa. These Fe-coated tubes are installed into the soil and if reducing conditions are present, the Fe coating is removed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of IRIS tubes as a technical standard for wetland delineation in South Africa. The study took place in three different wetland systems (Malahlapanga, Nshawu and the Tshuthsi spruit) in the Kruger National Park. Piezometers were installed in triplicate in each zone, and the water table, pH and Eh were recorded monthly. Soils were classified, soil wetness indicators identified, and vegetation described. The study took place from September 2012 to August 2013. The areal percentage of paint removed from the top 300 mm of the IRIS tubes was quantified by scanning the tubes and then compared to the DWAF wetland indicators. It was found that the DWAF indicators and the IRIS tube method were mostly in agreement; however, the conditions at the Tshutshi spruit were not favourable for Fe reduction, and hence the use of IRIS tubes, due to the high pH values recorded. The IRIS tubes were therefore a useful tool for wetland delineation in the majority of conditions, but are not recommended in high pH, sodic environments. Further research is recommended over a wider geographical area as well as testing the MIRIS methodology (Manganese Indicators of Reduction in Soils) in wetlands that would inhibit Fe reduction.

TI  - Exploring the linkage between spontaneous grass cover biodiversity and soil degradation in two olive orchard microcatchments with contrasting environmental and management conditions
T2  - SOIL
LA  - English
AB  - Spontaneous grass covers are an inexpensive soil erosion control measure in olive orchards. Olive farmers allow grass to grow on sloping terrain to comply with the basic environmental standards derived from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP, European Commission). However, to date there are few studies assessing the environmental quality considering such covers. In this study, we measured biodiversity indices for spontaneous grass cover in two olive orchards with contrasting site conditions and management regimes in order to evaluate the potential for biodiversity metrics to serve as an indicator of soil degradation. In addition, the differences and temporal variability of biodiversity indicators and their relationships with environmental factors such as soil type and properties, precipitation, topography and soil management were analysed.
   Different grass cover biodiversity indices were evaluated in two olive orchard catchments under conventional tillage and no tillage with grass cover, during 3 hydrological years (2011-2013). Seasonal samples of vegetal material and photographs in a permanent grid (4 samples ha(-1)) were taken to characterize the temporal variations of the number of species, frequency of life forms, diversity and modified Shannon and Pielou indices.
   Sorensen's index showed strong differences in species composition for the grass covers in the two olive orchard catchments, which are probably linked to the different site conditions. The catchment (CN) with the best site conditions (deeper soil and higher precipitation) and most intense management presented the highest biodiversity indices as well as the highest soil losses (over 10 t ha(-1)). In absolute terms, the diversity indices of vegetation were reasonably high for agricultural systems in both catchments, despite the fact that management activities usually severely limit the landscape and the variety of species. Finally, a significantly higher content of organic matter in the first 10 cm of soil was found in the catchment with worse site conditions in terms of water deficit, average annual soil losses of 2 t ha(-1) and the least intense management. Therefore, the biodiversity indices considered in this study to evaluate spontaneous grass cover were not found to be suitable for describing the soil degradation in the study catchments.

AB  - Flat terrain and soils with variable permeability make it difficult to assess the relative importance of surface and subsurface runoff in the Canadian Prairies, especially in riparian areas that are critical for water transmission and solute transport. The main objective of this study is therefore to determine whether patterns of hydrologic state variables, namely, near-surface soil moisture (SM), soil electrical conductivity (SEC), and soil temperature (ST), can help infer riparian-to-stream soil water movement in Prairie landscapes. Focus is on the near-level Catfish Creek Watershed (south-eastern Manitoba, Canada) where 3 riparian sites were monitored: a naturally vegetated grassland site, a headwater forested site, and a highly impacted grassed site adjacent to an engineered drainage dyke and a man-made drainage channel. Data from 9 to 12 SM, SEC, and ST surveys completed at each site in 2015 using a 75-point grid are matched with riparian water table data, surface water level data from adjacent drainage channels, and indicators of antecedent moisture conditions. Pattern characteristics, in the form of descriptive statistics and variogram parameters, are estimated for each state variable and then correlated to indicators of antecedent moisture conditions, stream, and subsurface water level data to infer soil water movement. Results show that potential evapotranspiration, depth to water table, and antecedent precipitation have a significant yet variable impact on SM, SEC, and ST patterns. A switching behaviour, between dry and wet conditions, is present in riparian areas characterized by grassland vegetation and well-drained soils. The occurrence of shallow subsurface flow is inferred during the wettest conditions. Although riparian SM conditions are useful for predicting streamflow response in adjacent channels, such is not the case for riparian SEC and ST. Further investigations are however necessary to confirm the usefulness of SM spatial patterns for predicting streamflow response in other landscapes across the Canadian Prairies.

AB  - The assessment of general condition of fish in the moderately contaminated aquatic environment was performed on the European chub (Squalius cephalus) caught in September 2009 in the Sutla River in Croatia. Although increases of the contaminants in this river (trace and macro elements, bacteria), as well as physico-chemical changes (decreased oxygen saturation, increased conductivity), were still within the environmentally acceptable limits, their concurrent presence in the river water possibly could have induced stress in aquatic organisms. Several biometric parameters, metallothionein (MT), and total cytosolic protein concentrations in chub liver and gills were determined as indicators of chub condition. Microbiological and parasitological analyses were performed with the aim to evaluate chub predisposition for bacterial bioconcentration and parasitic infections. At upstream river sections with decreased oxygen saturation (similar to 50 %), decreased Fulton condition indices were observed (FCI: 0.94 g cm(-3)), whereas gonadosomatic (GSI: 2.4 %), hepatosomatic (HSI: 1.31 %), and gill indices (1.3 %) were increased compared to oxygen rich downstream river sections (dissolved oxygen similar to 90 %; FCI: 1.02 g cm(-3); GSI: 0.6 %; HIS: similar to 1.08 %; gill index: 1.0 %). Slight increase of MT concentrations in both organs at upstream (gills: 1.67 mg g(-1); liver: 1.63 mg g(-1)) compared to downstream sites (gills: 1.56 mg g(-1); liver: 1.23 mg g(-1)), could not be explained by induction caused by increased metal levels in the river water, but presumably by physiological changes caused by general stress due to low oxygen saturation. In addition, at the sampling site characterized by inorganic and fecal contamination, increased incidence of bacterial bioconcentration in internal organs (liver, spleen, kidney) was observed, as well as decrease of intestinal parasitic infections, which is a common finding for metal-contaminated waters. Based on our results, it could be concluded that even moderate contamination of river water by multiple contaminants could result in unfavourable living conditions and cause detectable stress for aquatic organisms.

AB  - Two hundred and seventy-seven shells of the long-lived bivalve mollusc Arctica islandica, collected from the Fladen Ground, northern North Sea, were radiocarbon dated and their taphonomic condition assessed, in order to determine whether taphonomic condition might provide a reliable indication of time since the death of the animal. With nine stations from across the Fladen Ground sampled, some strong geographic biases in C-14 ages were apparent, with living and modern (post-bomb pulse) material found in the northern part of the Fladen Ground while older material (first half of the last millennium and Early Holocene/Lateglacial) was concentrated in the central and western sites. Samples from the south and east Fladen Ground were sparse and were dominated by material from the second half of the last millennium. This south-north distribution is interpreted as the result of environmental change over millennial time-scales in the North Sea causing a gradual northward shift of living A. islandica populations and is not thought to be related to post mortem transport of shells to the south and east. Taphonomic condition, assessed using discriminant analysis and principal component analysis of five characteristics (amount of remaining periostracum, presence and condition of the ligament, extent of erosion at the shell margin, amount of bioerosion, and condition of the inner shell layer), appeared to be a generally unreliable indicator of time since the death of the animal. Based on these five taphonomic characteristics, discriminant analysis placed 81.1% of post-bomb shells, 39.6% of shells from the period 0-500 yr BP, 68.0% of shells from the period 500-1000 yr BP and 20.0% of shells from the Early Holocene/Lateglacial group into the correct radiocarbon age grouping, providing no support for the idea that this method can be used to triage shells for chronology construction as an alternative to radiometric dating.

AB  - A study was conducted on the sorption of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) on five soils formed under different redox conditions: an Arenosol (A_20) with fully aerobic conditions, two Gleysol samples (G_20 and G_40) with suboxic and anoxic conditions and two Histosols (H_20 and H_80) with mostly anoxic conditions. The soils were characterized on the basis of total organic carbon (TOC), specific surface area (SSA) and the Fourier transform infrared spectra of the humic acid and humin fractions (the soil remaining after alkali extraction) of the soil. The maximum adsorption capacity of the soils (Q(max)) ranged from 10.7 to 83.6 mg/g in the order G_20 > H_20 > G_40 > A_20 > H_80, which reflected the organic matter content of the soils. The sorption isotherms were found to be nonlinear for all the soil samples, with Freundlich n values of 0.45-0.68. The strong nonlinearity found in the adsorption of the H_80 samples could be attributed to their high hard carbon content, which was confirmed by the high aromaticity of the humin fraction. The maximum sorption capacity (Q(max)) of the soils did not increase indefinitely as the organic carbon content of the soils rose. There could be two reasons for this: (i) the large amount of organic matter may reduce the number of binding sites on the surface, and (ii) the decrease in SSA with increasing soil OC content may limit the ability to adsorb EE2 molecules. In anaerobic soil samples, where organic matter accumulation is pronounced, the amount of aromatic and phenolic compounds was higher than in better aerated soil profiles. Strong correlations were found between the amount of aromatic and phenolic compounds in the organic matter and the adsorption of EE2 molecules, indicating that pi-pi interaction and H-bonding are the dominant sorption mechanisms.

AB  - Monitoring is an essential part of an environmental management system (EMS) if landholders are to demonstrate improved environmental performance. This paper reports results of two surveys to determine environmental issues and priorities for monitoring. The first survey was conducted on 12 EMS pilot projects, and the second on 18 catchment management organisations in Australia. With the exception of pastoral zones, EMS facilitators identified moderate to major issues in land condition, water balance, riparian zone, native vegetation condition and pests. Water quality issues were rated as minor to moderate problems. Issues raised by the greatest number of respondents were water balance problems and weed and pest issues. Catchment managers reported widespread degradation issues in land condition, water balance problems, altered water flow, water quantity and availability and water quality. Degradation of the riparian zone and native vegetation were also reported. Both EMS facilitators and catchment management organisations understood the need for environmental monitoring; however, few EMS pilot projects have addressed it. This was due, in part, to a lack of readily available tools and concentration on the EMS process itself. Tools of most interest to facilitators were soil erosion risk, soil test interpretation, soil structure assessment, soil health, water leakage and perenniality, water quality, riparian zone management, herbicide resistance, greenhouse emissions and energy use. Facilitators also suggested that tools should be delivered in several formats, but workshops delivered by experts were of most interest. Catchment managers had realistic and pragmatic views about the role of landholder monitoring in assessing catchment outcomes and there is a mismatch between landholder monitoring and catchment reporting requirements. Landholders are likely to monitor only what is in their direct interests and this will be mainly on land condition. We conclude that on-farm environmental monitoring conducted by landholders will be of limited use for catchment management organisation reporting. However, it will be very important in helping farmers to make more informed decisions about their environmental management, together with education and support. The issue of catchment condition monitoring and reporting requires serious attention as current monitoring and reporting is likely to be inadequate.

AB  - Records of the testate amoeba fauna of soils have accumulated throughout the 20(th) century from numerous sites on all the Earth's continents, ranging from equatorial to polar, with analyses of species assemblages in relation to environmental conditions - especially hydrological. Testates have considerable potential to be used as indicators of environmental change and to give insight into the processes of microbial biogeography and speciation. Small ubiquitous species may have an essential role in the biological succcession as soils develop from mineral substrates. Present knowledge suggests that future research in these areas will be of high value.

AB  - Woody biomass generated in short-rotation coppice (SRC) plantations with aspen (Populus tremula L.) has good properties for bioenergy crop production: annual yields are high, labour input per year is low, and it is ecologically valuable because of the multi-year rotation periods. Eastern Germany has a special advantage in producing bioenergy crops: the former "agricultural cooperatives" built up quite large farms with, compared to Western Germany, comparatively large fields. Therefore, a modelling study of the potential and the impacts of aspen SRC plantations in the five eastern federal states of Germany under the recent climate and future climate projections was conducted. The ecophysiological forest growth model 4C was used to simulate the growth of aspen SRC plantations and their impacts on carbon in soils, and groundwater recharge, on selected suitable areas currently under crops but with marginal site conditions for cropping. A clear signal to enhanced growth condition over the whole area can be seen in the simulation of the mean annual woody biomass yield under conditions of climate change, which increased from 7.47 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate to 9.26 t DW ha(-1) a(-1) at the end of the considered future period 2034-2055 under climate change. The mean soil carbon sequestration rate was 0.81 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the recent climate and could rise up to 0.93 t C ha(-1) a(-1) under the assumption of climate change. On the other hand, the mean annual percolation rate, used as an indicator of impacts on the regional water budget, will diminish under future climatic conditions. The results suggest that aspen SRC plantations are a suitable contribution to regional CO2 mitigation and carbon sequestration under possible change of climate, but that negative impacts on the regional water budget are possible.

AB  - Field root investigations are often limited by the static nature of classical observations, resulting in the need to develop alternative methodologies that allow dynamic interpretation of root architecture variability on the basis of static measurements. The objectives of this work were (i) to evaluate the use of selected morphological indicators, namely root apical diameter (Da) and the length of the apical unbranched zone (LAUZ), in predicting primary and lateral root growth patterns in banana trees, (ii) to propose a field methodology for the assessment of root dynamics based on static measurements. Banana trees (Musa acuminata cv `Grande Naine') were grown in 5 rhizotrons as well as in field conditions, respectively on pouzzolane and Mollic Andosols. In rhizotrons, root growth analysis was carried out by reporting root elongation, Da and LAUZ, three times a week. In field conditions, 4 series of excavations were made at three-week intervals. Apart from root growth rate, measurements were the same as those in the rhizotrons.
   LAUZ was confirmed as a stable and good predictor of root growth rate for the different types of roots. In the rhizotrons, the root growth of lateral roots was found to be well correlated to the product of Da and the growth rate of the bearing root. Evaluation in field conditions from static observations attested consistent relationships between measured and predicted root length for lateral roots (slopes close to 1:1). The apical diameter can be considered as a good indicator of root growth potential, while actual lateral root growth depends on the bearing root elongation rate. Morphological static indicators calibrated from growth dynamics in rhizotrons are of major interest in explaining growth variability in field conditions. Especially the `growth rate-LAUZ' relationship can be considered a useful tool in interpreting field patterns of growing roots in relation to various soil conditions.

AB  - We investigated the effects of increased egg production on body condition as well as on measures of reproductive performance in great skuas, Stercorarius skua, over two subsequent years. We experimentally increased egg production from the normal two to six eggs. Six eggs might also be produced under natural circumstances after repeated clutch loss. After the production of the last egg we measured: (i) body mass, (ii) pectoral muscle, and (iii) haematocrit, total red blood cell count and mean corpuscular volume, as indicators of body condition. We took the same measurements of control females who had produced the normal clutch of two eggs. The measurements were repeated one year after the manipulation, and survival, laying dates, clutch sizes and hatching success were recorded for up to three consecutive years. After producing six eggs, females were lighter, had smaller pectoral muscles and lower haematological values than control females. Hatching success of eggs was significantly reduced. Even one year after the experiment there were still differences in body condition. Annual survival was not affected by the manipulations, although there was an indication that survival costs depended on whether chicks were raised after the increased egg production. While pair bonds and egg sizes were not affected in the post-experimental year.. females started breeding significantly later than in the previous year. Two years after the experiment laying dates had advanced again and were not different from those of control females. This pattern of maintaining survival and egg sizes, but delaying breeding in the post-experimental year was found for two independent groups of females which had both been subjected to increased egg production. These results present evidence that increased egg production can have long-term effects on female body condition and aspects of reproduction. However, although present, the costs of extra eggs appear to have been relatively small in the great skua in comparison to the two other bird species for which inter-annual effects have been reported.

AB  - A feeding station is the area of forage a grazing animal can reach without moving its forefeet. Grazing behavior can be divided into residence within feeding stations (with bites as benefits) and movement between feeding stations (with steps as costs). However, relatively little information has been reported on how grazing animals modify their feeding station behavior seasonally and interannually in response to varying environmental conditions. The feeding station behavior of beef cows (Japanese Black) stocked on a tropical grass pasture (bahiagrass dominant) was monitored for 4 years (2010 to 2013) in order to investigate the association of feeding station behavior with meteorological and sward conditions across the seasons and years. Mean air temperature during stocking often exceeded 30 degrees C during summer months. A severe summer drought in 2013 decreased herbage mass and sward height of the pasture and increased nitrogen concentration of herbage from summer to autumn. A markedly high feeding station number per unit foraging time, low bite numbers per feeding station and a low bite rate were observed in summer 2013 compared with the other seasons and years. Bite number per feeding station was explained by a multiple regression equation, where sward height and dry matter digestibility of herbage had a positive effect, whereas air temperature during stocking had a negative effect (R-2 = 0.658, P<0.01). Feeding station number per minute was negatively correlated with bite number per feeding station (r = -0.838, P<0.001). It was interpreted that cows modified bite number per feeding station in response to the sward and meteorological conditions, and this largely determined the number of feeding stations the animals visited per minute. The results indicate potential value of bite number per feeding station as an indicator of daily intake in grazing animals, and an opportunity for livestock and pasture managers to control feeding station behavior of animals through managements (e.g. fertilizer application, manipulation of stocking intensity and stocking time within the day).

AB  - The diversity and spatial patterns of polychaetes, a proven proxy for environmental assessment studies, were studied in 28 stations covering subtidal and intertidal segments as well as bunders and docks of the Mumbai Port. Univariate and multivariate analyses of polychaete data were used to determine the level of environmental degradation in various segments of the port area. The dominance of the deposit feeder, Paraprionospio pinnata along with a reduction in species diversity can be considered as indicator of stressed conditions.

AB  - Micro X-ray fluorescence mapping and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra were successfully measured for selenium (Se) in barite formed in marine sediments, which showed that Se(IV) was mainly found in the barite. The results showed that (i) Se in natural barite can be detected by mu-XRF-XAFS, (ii) the presence of Se(IV) suggested that the barite was precipitated under suboxic conditions, and (iii) the oxidation state of Se in barite can be used as a redox indicator of the depositional environment.

AB  - Quality of life depends on various physical and social conditions, such as the epidemiological environment in which a person lives. The availability of health care and the nature of medical insurance-public as well as private-are among the important influences on life and death. So are other social services, including basic education and the orderliness of urban living, and the access to modern medical knowledge in rural communities. The statistics on mortality draw our attention to all these policy issues. Mortality information can throw light also on the nature of social inequalities, including gender bias and racial disparities.

AB  - Testate amoebae are one of the most studied groups of microorganisms in Sphagnum peatland ecosystems and, therefore, one of the most reliable bioindicators of their ecological status. Peatland ecosystems are supported by a delicate biogeochemical balance that leads to the formation of peat, one of the main sinks of C, as a result of soil-atmosphere interaction, but currently they are one of the most threatened wetland types at their southern distribution limit. In the European continent, where climatic conditions limit peat formation, they have endured significant anthropic pressure for centuries, and the risk of loss of biodiversity linked to these ecosystems is critical. In addition, peatlands are poorly known ecosystems in the Iberian Peninsula compared with other wetlands; therefore, we have studied the chemical parameters of water and the diversity patterns of testate amoebae in the western Iberian Peninsula to better understand the current status of these ecosystems. The analysis of testate amoeba communities showed an inverse relationship between the diversity and conservation status of these peatlands, both in relation to chemical parameters (i.e., pH, electrical conductivity, phosphates) and to the proportion of anthropized area, with a marked geographical pattern in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - The National Climate Indicators System (NCIS) aims to provide a suite of systematically updated, easily interpretable, and policy relevant national metrics of key physical, ecological, and societal conditions. The NCIS will distill and communicate complex scientific information to a broad audience as part of sustained National Climate Assessments. The current NCIS has made significant strides in defining its scope, providing an initial suite of indicators, and outlining its future development goals. In line with the scope and aims of the NCIS, we present a set of terrestrial primary productivity indicators that are scientifically defensible, scalable, directly related to climate, nationally important, built on existing agency efforts, and linked to the conceptual framework of the NCIS. The Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) indicators provide seasonal and annual metrics of the growth of all plant material across the contiguous U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The GPP and NPP products used to produce the indicators have become key carbon measurements of environmental health and ecosystem services, including food, fiber, and fuels supporting national economies, human sustainability, and quality of life. We demonstrate how the proposed GPP and NPP indicators are relevant across indicator system sector topics of Forests, Grassland/Rangelands/Pastures, Agriculture, Wildfire, and Seasonal Timing and Phenology, can be used in concert with existing proposed indicators, and will aid to filling current gaps in the NCIS.

AB  - There is a need to develop bioassessment tools that can diagnose the effects of individual stressors that can have multiple ecological effects. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, our experiments aimed to identify the sensitivity of metabolites to changes in food availability and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and compare these results to identify metabolites that may differentiate between the effects of these two stressors. Forty-eight, laboratory-raised, red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) were randomly assigned and exposed to one of three food availability or DO treatment levels (high, normal, low). Starved crayfish had lower amounts of amino acids than fed crayfish, suggesting catabolic effects of starvation on tail muscle tissue for energy requirements. In contrast, crayfish exposed to hypoxic conditions experienced changes in abundance of metabolites primarily associated with energy metabolism. Tail muscle was the only tissue sensitive to food and DO stress, suggesting the need to select tissues for monitoring appropriately. Our evaluation of environmental metabolomics as a tool for bioassessment indicates that several identified metabolites in crayfish tail muscle may be able to diagnose food and oxygen stress. Further study is required to determine if these metabolic effects are linked with changes of individual fitness and higher levels of biological organization, such as population size.

AB  - The Critical Zone (CZ) includes the biophysical processes occurring from the top of the vegetation canopy to the weathering zone below the groundwater table. CZ services provide a measure for the goods and benefits derived from CZ processes. In intensively managed landscapes, cropland is altered through anthropogenic energy inputs to derive more productivity, as agricultural products, than would be possible under natural conditions. However, the actual costs of alterations to CZ functions within landscape profiles are unknown. Through comparisons of corn feed and corn-based ethanol, we show that valuation of these CZ services in monetary terms provides a more concrete tool for characterizing seemingly abstract environmental damages from agricultural production systems. Multiple models are combined to simulate the movement of nutrients throughout the soil system, enabling the measurement of agricultural anthropogenic impacts to the CZ's regulating services. Results indicate water quality and atmospheric stabilizing services, measured by soil carbon storage, carbon respiration, and nitrate leaching, among others, can cost more than double that of emissions estimated in previous studies. Energy efficiency in addition to environmental impact is assessed to demonstrate how the inclusion of CZ services is necessary in accounting for the entire life cycle of agricultural production systems. These results conclude that feed production systems are more energy efficient and less environmentally costly than corn-based ethanol.

AB  - Most work on generic early warning signals for critical transitions focuses on indicators of the phenomenon of critical slowing down that precedes a range of catastrophic bifurcation points. However, in highly stochastic environments, systems will tend to shift to alternative basins of attraction already far from such bifurcation points. In fact, strong perturbations (noise) may cause the system to "flicker" between the basins of attraction of the system's alternative states. As a result, under such noisy conditions, critical slowing down is not relevant, and one would expect its related generic leading indicators to fail, signaling an impending transition. Here, we systematically explore how flickering may be detected and interpreted as a signal of an emerging alternative attractor. We show that-although the two mechanisms differ-flickering may often be reflected in rising variance, lag-1 autocorrelation and skewness in ways that resemble the effects of critical slowing down. In particular, we demonstrate how the probability distribution of a flickering system can be used to map potential alternative attractors and their resilience. Thus, while flickering systems differ in many ways from the classical image of critical transitions, changes in their dynamics may carry valuable information about upcoming major changes.

AB  - The end-Permian mass extinction greatly diminished marine diversity and brought about a whole-scale restructuring of marine ecosystems,, these ecosystem changes also profoundly affected the sedimentary record. Data presented here, attained through facies analyses of strata deposited during the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (southern Turkey) and at the close of the Early Triassic (southwestern United States), in combination with a literature review, show that sedimentary systems were profoundly affected by: (1) a reduction in biotic diversity and abundance and (2) long-term environmental fluctuations that resulted from the end-Permian crisis. Lower Triassic strata display widespread microbialite and carbonate seafloor fan development and contain indicators of suppressed infaunal bioturbation such as flat-pebble conglomerates and wrinkle structures (facies considered unusual in post-Cambrian subtidal deposits). Our observations suggest that depositional systems, too, respond to biotic crises, and that certain facies may act as barometers of ecologic and environmental change independent of fossil assemblage analyses. Close investigation of facies changes during other critical times in Earth history may serve as an important too] in interpreting the ecology of metazoans and their environment.

AB  - Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) adopt antipredator (alarm) behavior when they detect alarm pheromone released from an injured conspecific. This is an adaptive response since alarm pheromone is generally released only in the context of a predation event. Alarm reactions may also occur in response to chemical and visual stimuli that minnows learn to associate with release of alarm pheromone. Here, we tested if fathead minnows can learn to associate a nonbiological, visual stimulus with predation risk. Minnows were simultaneously exposed to red light and conspecific alarm pheromone, inducing an alarm reaction. When retested using red light alone, small shoals of minnows displayed an antipredator response: dashing movements and disorganized swimming followed by decreased height in the water column and increased shoal cohesion. This resulted from a single-trial exposure to the combined cues and demonstrates a robust ecological mechanism by which minnows learn to recognize indicators of predation risk that may vary in space and time. However, learning to associate risk with biologically irrelevant stimuli may be an ecological liability. How minnows discern between relevant and irrelevant stimuli in nature is not known.

AB  - The concept of precision conservation can be defined as a set of space technologies and other procedures linked to mappable environmental variables, which can be used to program conservation management practices for natural resources that consider the variability of these variables in space and time within of natural or agricultural systems. In this context, structural loss of soil through human activities is considered, as with a process with a spatial and temporal variation. The management of soil aggregation conditions can contribute to more regenerative and sustainable agricultural processes. It allows spatial analysis technologies through georeferenced visual indicators or even the use of systems with automatic learning, known as deep learning. In this sense, a fair visual method was developed with an analysis of fuzzy logic to classify aggregates in terms of shape, surface roughness, and biogenic structures. Thus, in a second stage, a model of the artificial neural network was developed, capable of detecting and classifying different forms of soil aggregates, thus allowing a brief discussion of the theme and its potential for application in conservation management through the analysis of aggregates via systems automatic sorting. In this way, elements are presented for the motivation of research and development in adaptive technologies in supporting decision-making that can help integrate dynamic and spatial information in the understanding of the soil's structural condition to preserve the soil more precisely.

AB  - The spatial structure of seagrass landscapes is typically ascribed to the direct influence of physical factors such as hydrodynamics, light, and sediment transport. We studied regularly interspaced banded patterns, formed by elongated patches of seagrass, in a small-scale intertidal ecosystem. We investigated (1) whether the observed spatial patterns may arise from feedback interactions between seagrass and its abiotic environment and (2) whether changes in abiotic conditions may lead to predictable changes in these spatial patterns. Field measurements, experiments, and a spatially explicit computer model identified a "scale-dependent feedback" (a mechanism for spatial self-organization) as a possible cause for the banded patterns. Increased protection from uprooting by improved anchoring with increasing seagrass density caused a local positive feedback. Sediment erosion around seagrass shoots increased with distance through the seagrass bands, hence causing a long-range negative feedback. Measurements across the depth gradient of the intertidal, together with model simulations, demonstrated that seagrass cover and mean patch size were predictably influenced by additional external stress caused by light limitation and desiccation. Thus, our study provides direct empirical evidence for a consistent response of spatial self-organized patterns to changing abiotic conditions suggesting a potential use for self-organized spatial patterns as stress indicators in ecosystems.

AB  - Rock lobster species are found worldwide and have a life history that includes development through a planktonic phyllosoma followed by a nektonic non-feeding puerulus that relies on stored energy during recruitment into near-shore habitats. Recruitment to adult populations of western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus) is highly variable and is likely to be strongly influenced by shelf width and oceanic conditions affecting cross-shelf transport and nutrition. Since the nutritional status of newly settled pueruli will reflect the phyllosoma feeding environment and distance swum, we studied levels of lipid, fatty acid (FA) and protein of 422 pueruli and 79 first instar juveniles from four Western Australian locations. Lipid levels generally were inversely related to shelf width but were variable, suggesting pueruli may travel complex trajectories to coastal settlement. Lipid and FA composition of pueruli were consistent with spatial and seasonal variation in Leeuwin Current and coastal productivity regimes. Seasonal differences in FA composition occurred regardless of the year of settlement. Pueruli had lower lipid levels during ENSO years, when recruitment tends to be lower also. Measures of puerulus nutritional status appear to provide valuable insights into the processes underpinning recruitment in Panulirus cygnus and other commercially and ecologically important species.

AB  - Changes in laboratory parameters can be caused by physical, chemical, biological and other external factors, depending on physiological conditions, in most cases they have an adaptive nature, and it is not always possible to distinguish them from physiological fluctuations. At the same time, obvious shifts in laboratory parameters may indicate a violation of adaptation processes and damage of tissues and organs, despite the absence of clinical manifestations of a disease.

AB  - Shelled pteropods are widely regarded as bioindicators for ocean acidification, because their fragile aragonite shells are susceptible to increasing ocean acidity. While short-term incubations have demonstrated that pteropod calcification is negatively impacted by ocean acidification, we know little about net calcification in response to varying ocean conditions in natural populations. Here, we examine in situ calcification of Limacina helicina pteropods collected from the California Current Ecosystem, a coastal upwelling system with strong spatial gradients in ocean carbonate chemistry, dissolved oxygen and temperature. Depth-averaged pH ranged from 8.03 in warmer offshore waters to 7.77 in cold CO2-rich waters nearshore. Based on high-resolution micro-CT technology, we showed that shell thickness declined by similar to 37% along the upwelling gradient from offshore to nearshore water. Dissolution marks covered only similar to 2% of the shell surface area and were not associated with the observed variation in shell thickness. We thus infer that pteropods make thinner shells where upwelling brings more acidified and colder waters to the surface. Probably the thinner shells do not result from enhanced dissolution, but are due to a decline in calcification. Reduced calcification of pteropods is likely to have major ecological and biogeochemical implications for the cycling of calcium carbonate in the oceans.

AB  - Ecosystems support and enhance human life through providing ecosystem services. The use of ecosystem services changes over time, as environmental conditions and people's lifestyles change. Urbanisation is an extreme form of environmental change that can be expected to drastically alter the use of ecosystem services. We analysed people's childhood memories to quantify temporal changes in indicators of 11 ecosystem services in Singapore a country which has rapidly urbanised over the past 70 years. We performed semi-structured interviews to elicit indicators of ecosystem service use from memories of childhood lifestyles and activities, comparing two groups of respondents; those born before 1960, and those born between 1989 and 1999. The two respondent groups recalled significantly different uses of ecosystem services, with a higher proportion of the pre-1960 respondents benefitting from locally-produced provisioning and regulating services, and a higher proportion of 1989-1999 respondents using most cultural services. This study thus demonstrates that urbanisation can decrease people's reliance on local ecosystems to provide raw materials, while leading to greater appreciation of cultural benefits. Management of ecosystem services in the present must consider the possibility that supply and demand of future ecosystem services may change in potentially unpredictable ways.

AB  - Dust pollution can cause a significant damage of environment and endanger human health. Our study aimed to investigate epiphytic lichens and bryophytes in relation to long-term alkaline dust pollution and provide new insights into the bioindicators of dust pollution. We measured the bark pH of Scots pines and the species richness and cover of two cryptogam groups in 32 sample plots in the vicinity of limestone quarries (up to ca. 3 km) in northern Estonia. The bark pH decreased gradually with increasing distance from quarries. We recorded the changes in natural epiphytic communities, resulting in diversified artificial communities on pines near the pollution source; the distance over 2 km from the quarries was sufficient to re-establish the normal acidity of the bark and natural communities of both lichens and bryophytes. The cover of lichens and the number of bryophytes are a more promising indicator of environmental conditions than individual species occurrence. We confirmed previously proposed and suggested new bioindicator species of dust pollution (e.g., Lecidella elaeochroma, Opegrapha varia, Schistidium apocarpum). Limestone quarrying activity revealed a "parapositive" impact on cryptogamic communities, meaning that quarrying might, besides disturbances of natural communities, temporarily contribute to the distribution of locally rare species.

AB  - The European earwig Forficula auricularia is an effective predator in apple orchards. It is therefore crucial to study whether insecticides affect this natural pest control agent. Predation activity, i.e., the number of aphids eaten in 24 h, was determined under laboratory conditions after exposure of fourth-instar nymphs and adult earwigs to widely used insecticides (acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, deltamethrin, and spinosad), which were applied at the normal application rates. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities were also measured as indicators of pesticide exposure. Predation activity decreased significantly in nymphs exposed to spinosad (62 %) and chlorpyrifos-ethyl (98 %) compared with controls. A similar response was found for both esterase activities. Spinosad had a stronger effect on AChE (-33 %) whereas chlorpyrifos-ethyl affected CbE activity preferentially (-59 %). Spinosad (20 % of controls), acetamiprid (28 %), and chlorpyrifos-ethyl (66 %) also significantly decreased the predation behavior of adult male but not female (5 to 40 %) earwigs. Adult AChE and CbE activities were also significantly reduced (28 to 67 % of controls) in pesticide-exposed earwigs. Our results suggest that earwigs should be included in the environmental risk assessment framework for authorization of newly marketed plant protection products. Their predation behavior appears to be a sensitive and complementary biomarker.

AB  - We present the process of developing a macrophyte based index (River Macrophyte Index - RMI) for assessing river ecological status, that would be applicable for rivers with moderate to high water alkalinity, flowing over low slope terrain. A reference value and boundary values were determined for five ecological classes. The relation between the developed index and two existing indices, the Reference Index (RI) and the Trophic Index of Macrophytes (TIM), and selected environmental variables was established. The RMI is based on species composition and abundance from 208 sampling sites being in reference or good hydromorphological conditions and differing in the catchment land use. The percentage of natural areas in the sub-catchment was used for classifying macrophyte taxa into 5 ecological groups. 65 plant taxa, of which 47 were identified as indicator taxa, were included in the analysis. To assess the ecological status of a river site, the presence of at least 3 indicator taxa is necessary, otherwise the assessment is considered inconclusive. RMI is expected to indicate multiple pressures on the river, including trophic level. The developed index and RI and TIM indices differed in relation to slope, distance to source and catchment size.

AB  - The Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) workshop focused on the anthropogenic contaminants in the terrestrial environment, addressing various components of the ERA process. These included sources, exposure pathways, bioavailability, and toxicity to receptor organisms as well as risk communication. It was concluded that although the overseas experience on ERA for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., International Standards or guidelines from the European Union and the United States) is very useful, it is not directly applicable to Australia due to the differences in receptor organisms, contaminants, soil, and environmental conditions. Workshop discussions stressed on the need for making ERA locally relevant (in terms of choice of receptor organisms, sampling strategy, and bioavailability considerations). The workshop discussions highlighted the need of better appreciation of both the similarities and the clear differences between aquatic and terrestrial ERAs. The availability of reliable data, problems with databases, estimation of bioavailability, and extrapolations from laboratory to field were noted among the key limitations. ERA-being inherently complex and involving a range of environmental compartments, target receptor, and exposure pathways-at a minimum requires a multidisciplinary approach to address the complexities. Bringing a multidisciplinary team together often proves a major challenge in ERA. The delegates called for continued efforts in this area and formation of a network or working group in Australia.

AB  - Bryophytes play an important role in the process of ecological succession: conditioning the environment favourably for the emergence of subsequent groups. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of bryophyte communities in a cronossequence in the Caxiuana National Forest, Para, Brazil. To this end, biological material was collected in forest remnants with different successional stages based on regeneration age: Stage I (0 - 10 years), Stage II (10 - 25), Stage III (> 25) and Stage IV (primary forests). Density, richness and composition of species were compared between successional stages and the occurrence of possible indicator-species was investigated. The identified taxa were also classified by guilds of tolerance to solar radiation and colonized substrate. Composition of species was the variable that most contributed to understanding the distribution of bryophyte communities throughout successional stages, with eight species identified as potential indicators of some successional stages. Generalist species predominated in all stages. The richness of sun tolerants, in turn, decreased with the progress of succession, while shade tolerants increased. The land use history and land cover can influence the availability and quality of substrates and consequently their colonization by bryophytes in the different stages.

AB  - Coral reefs are one of the important ecosystems in coastal areas. Coral reefs have important values for coastal communities and their presence is particularly vulnerable to disturbance from both natural and anthropogenic activities. Establishment of a marine conservation area is essential to protect coral reefs from over-exploitation. This study aims to assess the condition of coral cover and sustainability status of coral reef ecosystem in Pulo Pasi Gusung Marine Conservation Area (KKPD) of Selayar. The results of this study are expected to provide recommendation for government in policy making related to better management to improve supervision of coral reef ecosystems in Pulo Pasi Gusung KKPD. Data collection was conducted using line intercept transect (LIT) at 3 and 10 meter depth. Coral reef sustainability status was analyzed using Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) with Rap Insus COREMAG (Rapid Appraisal-Index Sustainability of Coral Reef Management) by comparing the management before the establishment of KKPD (Year 2010) and after the establishment of KKPD (Year 2015). Assessment is conducted on 5 dimensions namely ecological, economic, social cultural, technological and infrastructure dimensions as well as legal and institutional dimensions. The results of the analysis of the five dimensions in the assessment of coral reef sustainability status in Pulau Pasi after the establishment of KKPD on average experienced an increase in sustainable index than before the establishment of KKPD.

AB  - Oligochaeta assemblages are important components in freshwater environments, where their abundance and composition may indicate aspects related to water quality and sediment. The lack of information about these communities in Brazilian aquatic environments, as well as the application of native species as bioindicators of lotic environmental, stimulated the conception of this paper. Thus, the aim was to study the community of aquatic Oligochaeta in selected stretches of the Juruena River (MT), thereby generating grounds for future environmental monitoring action in lotic ecosystems. For this purpose, samples were analyzed at bimonthly intervals during the period from January to November 2009, in stretches of the Juruena River (Amazon River Basin) located in the State of Mato Grosso (MT). Two methods were used to collect the organisms: a) "D" network in small clusters of fixed macrophytes in the sediment on the river banks; and b) Ekman-Birge dredge in fine sediment. Preliminary results were 584 organisms distributed in 22 taxa. Of these, 22 valid species were identified. This number corresponds to approximately 25% of the aquatic oligochaete species registered in Brazil. Of these species, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Dero nivea and Pristina rosea can be associated with organic enrichment conditions and/or some level of environmental degradation.

AB  - Identification of the primary factors that influence the ecological distribution of species groups is important to managers of lowland-mountain forests in northern Iran. The aim of this study was to identify main ecological species groups, describe the site conditions associated with these species groups and the relationships between environmental factors and the distribution of ecological species groups using multi-variate analysis (Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)). For this purpose, 50 releves (400 m(2) each) were sampled using the Braun-Blanquet method. Vegetation was classified into three ecological species groups using a modified two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). In each releve, environmental factors (topographic and soil variables) were measured and analysed using one-way ANOVA and Pearson r statistics. Further, species diversity indices were determined for the identified ecological species groups. Our results show that the environmental factors, e.g. elevation, slope, slope aspect, soil texture, pH and organic matter, were the most important factors explaining the distribution of the three ecological species groups in the study area. The diversity of the ecological species groups decreased with elevation. The results provide an ecological basis for forest management and for developing strategies for forest conservation in the study area.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the impact of re-vegetation on the restoration of microbial community structure and soil microbiological properties in sand dunes that had been affected by mining activity. Soil samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons from a chronosequence (1, 9, 21 years) of re-vegetated dunes using a single preserved dune as a reference. The composition of the fatty acid methyl esters and soil microbial properties were evaluated. The results showed that the changes in microbial community structure were related to seasonal variations: biomarkers of Gram-positive bacteria were higher than Gram-negative bacteria during the dry season, showing that this group of organisms is more tolerant to these stressful conditions. The microbial community structure in the natural dune was less affected by seasonal variation compared to the re-vegetated areas, whereas the opposite was observed for microbiological properties. Thus, in general, the proportion of saprobic fungi was higher in the natural dune, whereas Gram-negative bacteria were proportionally more common in the younger areas. Although over time the re-vegetation allows the recovery of the microbial community and the soil functions, these communities and functions are different from those found in the undisturbed areas.

AB  - In the last 20-30 years, the temperature of the Mediterranean Sea has increased and global warming is allowing the establishment of tropical-affinity species into more temperate zones. Sessile communities are particularly useful as a baseline for ecological monitoring; however, a lack of historical data series exists for sessile marine organisms without commercial interest. Hydroids are ubiquitous components of the benthic sessile fauna on rocky shores and have been used as bio-indicators of environmental conditions. In this study on the benthic hydroid assemblages of the Chafarinas Islands (Alboran Sea, South-Western Mediterranean), we characterized the hydroid assemblages, identified the bathymetric gradients, and compared them with a previous study carried out in 1991. Hydroid assemblages showed a significant difference both between year and among depths. Furthermore, eight species not present in 1991 were found, including two possible new species and the tropical and subtropical species Sertularia marginata. Due to its strategic position at the entrance of the Mediterranean and the existence of previous data on hydroid assemblages, the Chafarinas Islands are proposed as a possible monitoring point for entrance of Atlantic tropical species into the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Many chemical pollutants have become ubiquitous in the environment, including some that interfere with hormones and other physiological mechanisms. These `endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) have harmful effects on development and physiology. We reviewed published evidence and found that EDCs also have adverse effects on a wide range of behaviours, including sexual and other reproductive behaviours, activity, motivation, communication, aggression, dominance and other social behaviours, and learning and other cognitive abilities. We also reviewed recent findings that challenge common assumptions in toxicology. For example, EDCs have several unanticipated properties, such as nonmonotonic dose effects and synergy. Furthermore, harmful effects of EDCs sometimes become apparent only when tested in natural ecological conditions, such as social stress and infection. These findings raise questions about the practicality and feasibility of testing chemical pollutants adequately. Finally, we discuss the implications of EDC research for species conservation and human health, and how toxicology and behavioural research might be better integrated. Behaviour might provide a useful indicator or biomarker for detecting harmful chemical contaminants; however, more integration between toxicology and behavioural ecology is needed to determine whether and how EDCs affect humans and other vertebrates outside of the laboratory.

AB  - The question remains of under what conditions can pig breeding be regarded as ecologically appropriate. Therefore an approach to develop holistic criteria is presented using the four paradigms of environmental protection and the three action-principles of "caring economy". Pragmatic systems for pig breeding are developed for two aspects: breeding for sustainable agriculture, what are the alternative goals of breeding, and sustainable breeding. The latter requires a considerable biodiversity in pigs used for everyday breeding. Whether or when such an ecologically bases pig breeding system will become a reality is discussed.

AB  - Canada is home to more lakes than any other nation, but there is a fragmented and limited understanding of the ecological status of these water bodies. Zooplankton are excellent bioindicators of lake health, given their central food web position. To date, many studies have investigated the effect of individual stressors on zooplankton communities, mediated through changes in water quality (e.g., macronutrients, temperature, or chemicals). Increasingly, stressors act simultaneously in lakes, often over extended periods of time. As part of the NSERC Canadian Lake Pulse Network project, pelagic zooplankton were sampled in 624 lakes across Canada, spanning six continental drainage basins. We evaluated the effect of 40+ environmental variables on zooplankton diversity and community composition, considering both taxonomic and functional approaches. We also tested specific hypotheses on the relationships between zooplankton communities and environmental conditions, including eutrophication, calcium, chloride, and fish predation. We found that lake morphometry variables were among the most important predictors of zooplankton diversity, while water quality metrics were more critical in explaining variation in community composition. Our results also reveal significant heterogeneity across Canada, with contrasting effects of environmental drivers among continental watersheds, highlighting that response models cannot be assumed to apply universally.

AB  - As one of the most relevant foodborne diseases, it is essential to know the factors related to the transmission, persistence and prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection. Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) might play a relevant role in T.gondii's life cycle. This species is the most consumed big game animal in Spain and may act as a source of infection if the meat is eaten raw or undercooked or due to cross-contaminations. Additionally, wild boar can act as an excellent bioindicator of T.gondii circulation in the ecosystem, because its natural behaviour leads to exposure to oocysts from the soil when rooting and tissular bradyzoites when scavenging. A total of 1003 wild boar were sampled from 2010 to 2017 in Mediterranean Spain. Blood samples were tested with an indirect ELISA test giving a total of 14.1% (95% confidence interval 12.0-16.4%) positive results. The prevalence was not homogeneous in neither the animals nor the sampled districts. Significant differences were found regarding age, climatic conditions and human space occupancy. Human population aggregation, assessed by Demangeon's index, was identified as an influential factor in T.gondii infection risk. This multiple approach allows us to evaluate local risks for human and environmental contamination.

AB  - Ectotherms are vulnerable to environmental changes and their parasites are biological health indicators. Thus, parasite load in ectotherms is expected to show a marked phenology. This study investigates temporal host-parasite dynamics in a lizard community in Eastern Spain during an entire annual activity period. The hosts investigated were Acanthodactylus erythrurus, Psammodromus algirus and Psammodromus edwardsianus, three lizard species coexisting in a mixed habitat of forests and dunes, providing a range of body sizes, ecological requirements and life history traits. Habitat and climate were considered as potential environmental predictors of parasite abundance, while size, body condition and sex as intrinsic predictors. Linear models based on robust estimates were fitted to analyse parasite abundance and prevalence. Ectoparasitic mites and blood parasites from two haemococcidian genera were found: Lankesterella spp. and Schellackia spp. Habitat type was the only predictor explaining the abundance of all parasites, being mostly higher in the forest than in the dunes. The results suggest that particularities in each host-parasite relationship should be accounted even when parasites infect close-related hosts under the same environmental pressures. They also support that lizard parasites can be biomarkers of environmental perturbation, but the relationships need to be carefully interpreted for each host-parasite assemblage.

AB  - Artificial streams are dynamic mesocosms, simulating aquatic systems and rivers. They are useful to study ecotoxicity of chemicals and their effects on flora and fauna colonizing the streams or introduced into the channels. These artificial rivers can also be used to study the influence of ecological and hydrodynamic parameters, such as the kind of substrate of river and flow rate. Responses of the bivalve Unio tumidus to substrate type (silt, sand, and pebbles) and water flow rate (high and low) were investigated after 15 and 35 days in the channels, in order to optimize the experimental conditions for ecotoxicity study with methyl methacrylate (MMA). The toxicological effects of different concentrations of MMA on bivalves and on communities of invertebrates and diatoms were determined after several weeks of exposure at a high flow rate. Biomarkers responses measured in the digestive gland and the gills of U. tumidus were the activities of detoxification systems as early indicators of toxicity and lipid peroxidation as a marker of cytotoxicity. Effects of MMA resulted in a decrease in antioxidant activities. Disturbances in bivalves appeared at lower concentrations than in communities. This indicates sensitivity of the biomarkers studied, which are predictive indicators of ecotoxicity. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In 21 derelict soils from a semi-arid Spanish Mediterranean area, with a lithological substrate of loams, submitted to a high degree of erosion, several biological and biochemical properties indicative of the soil degradation level were determined. The organic matter content of these soils was very low (mean value = 11.8 g kg(-1)), approximately one-third of the average value for organic matter content of natural soils in the same zone. Biological properties such as basal respiration and biomass C also had low values and were positively correlated with the organic matter content. Low values for dehydrogenase and catalase activity were indicative of low biological activity of the degraded soils. A positive correlation was found between the hydrolases related with the N, P, C and S cycles (urease, proteases, beta-glucosidase and arylsulphatase), as well as between these hydrolases and the organic matter content. Principal component analysis showed that all the variables studied, except catalase and qCO(2), had a similar behaviour. There was a negative correlation between many of the properties studied and electrical conductivity, which agreed with the higher degree of biological and biochemical degradation found in gypsiferous soils with a higher salt content. Arylsulphatase and beta-glucosidase activity were the hydrolases most affected by soil erosion processes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Currently, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of grain and grain legumes yield in Ukraine. The aim of this research was to characterize the spatial and temporal yield variability of cereals grain and grain legumes grown in 155 administrative districts in Polissya and Forest-steppezone of Ukraine in 1991-2017. The common feature of temporal changes for all administrative districts is the existence of the trend that can be described by the fourth degree polynomial. We provide agroeconomic and agrotechnological origin to the nature of the trend. The yields dynamics of grain and grain legumes is described by the absolute term, which reflects the starting conditions of soil fertility in the initial period of research and the indicators of maximum rate of yields decline in the 90s and the maximum rate of yields increase in the 2000s. The indicators of the maximum rate of reduction and the maximum rate of increase of yield can be used as markers of agroecosystem stability to external factors. It can be noted that the southern regions of Ukraine are less stable and more exposed to the destructive influence, while the central and western regions are more stable and rapidly increase productivity under favorable conditions. This research has found that the agroecological systems of the regions of Ukraine are far from the maximum ecological capacity, and agroeconomic and agrotechnological factors are the limiting now.

AB  - In recent years, adhesive bonding has found its way to construction applications such as bridges. Given the harsh conditions that such structures are usually exposed to, it is necessary to account for environmental factors, particularly moisture and temperature, in the design phase. Cohesive zone modelling has attracted much attention in the last decade as a promising method to design adhesive joints. Despite this interest, the effects of moisture and thermal cycles on cohesive laws have not been investigated to the knowledge of the authors. In this paper, we present a method to directly measure the environmental-dependent cohesive laws of a structural adhesive loaded in pure Mode-I and Mode-II. Special consideration is given to overcome issues such as the time-consuming nature of moisture ingression and specimen dimensions, which could be problematic due to the size-limitations of conditioning equipment. The accuracy of this method was verified through simulation of the experiments using the finite element analysis. The effects of exposure to 95% relative humidity, immersion in saltwater and distilled water, and freeze-thaw cycles in the presence or absence of moisture were investigated. The results indicate the damaging effects of combined saltwater and freeze-thaw cycles which were clearly reflected on the shape of the cohesive laws. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective environmental management hinges on efficient and targeted monitoring, which in turn should adapt to increasing disturbance regimes that now characterize most ecosystems. Habitats and biodiversity of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, are in declining condition, prompting a review of the effectiveness of existing coral monitoring programs. Applying a regional model of coral cover (i.e., the most widely used proxy for coral reef condition globally) within major benthic communities, we assess the representation and complementarity of existing long-term coral reef monitoring programs on the GBR. We show that existing monitoring has captured up to 45% of the environmental diversity on the GBR, while some geographic areas (including major hotspots of cyclone activity over the last 30 yr) have remained unmonitored. Further, we identified complementary groups of reefs characterized by similar benthic community composition and similar coral cover trajectories since 1996. The mosaic of their distribution across the GBR reflects spatial variation in the cumulative impact of multiple acute disturbances, as well as spatial gradients in coral recovery potential. Representation and complementarity, in combination with other performance assessment criteria, can inform the cost-effective design and stratification of future surveys. Based on these results, we formulate recommendations to assist with the design of future long-term coral reef monitoring programs.

AB  - All organisms must anticipate and balance energetic demands and available resources in order to maximize fitness. As hormones coordinate many interactions between an organism's internal condition and the external environment, they may be key in mediating the allocation of resources to meet these demands. However, given that individuals differ considerably in how they react to changes in energetic demand, we asked whether variations in endocrine traits also correspond with life history variation. We tested whether natural variation in glucocorticoid hormone levels, oxidative stress measurements, and condition related to reproductive effort in a free-living songbird, the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor. We then tested whether any of these traits predicted the probability of a particular individual's return to the local population in the following two years, an indicator of survival in this philopatric species. We found that males and females with longer telomeres had lighter nestlings. Moreover, individuals with lower plasma antioxidant capacity and higher reactive oxygen metabolites (i.e., greater oxidative stress) were less likely to return to the population. However, none of these traits were related to glucocorticoid levels. Our findings suggest a trade-off between reproduction and survival, with individuals with shorter telomeres having heavier nestlings but potentially paying a cost in terms of higher oxidative stress and lower survival. Interestingly, the evidence of this trade-off was unrelated to natural variation in glucocorticoids.

AB  - Sphagnum moss is the dominant plant type in modern boreal and (sub)arctic ombrotrophic bogs and is of particular interest due to its sensitivity to climate and its important role in wetland biogeochemistry. Here we reconstruct the occurrence of Sphagnum moss - and associated biogeochemical change - within a thermally immature, early Paleogene (similar to 55 Ma) lignite from Schoningen, NW Germany using a high-resolution, multi-proxy approach. Changes in the abundance of Sphagnum-type spores and the C-23/C-31 n-alkane ratio indicate the expansion of Sphagnum moss within the top of the lignite seam. This Sphagnum moss expansion is associated with the development of waterlogged conditions, analogous to what has been observed within modern ombrotrophic bogs. The similarity between biomarkers and palynology also indicates that the C-23/C-31 n-alkane ratio may be a reliable chemotaxonomic indicator for Sphagnum during the early Paleogene. The delta C-13 value of bacterial hopanes and mid-chain n-alkanes indicates that a rise in water table is not associated with a substantial increase in aerobic methanotrophy. The absence of very low delta C-13 values within the top of the seam could reflect either less methanogenesis or less efficient methane oxidation under waterlogged sulphate-rich conditions.

AB  - Only little attention has been paid to the impact of acid mine drainages (AMD) on aquatic ecosystems in Central Europe. In this study, we investigate the physico-chemical properties of low-order streams and the response of benthic invertebrates to AMD pollution in the Banska Stiavnica mining region (Slovakia). The studied streams showed typical signs of mine drainage pollution: higher conductivity, elevated iron, aluminum, zinc and copper loads and accumulations of ferric precipitates. Electric conductivity correlated strongly with most of the investigated elements (weighted mean absolute correlation = 0.95) and, therefore, can be recommended as a good proxy indicator for rapid AMD pollution assessments. The diversity and composition of invertebrate assemblages was related to water chemistry. Taxa richness decreased significantly along an AMD-intensity gradient. While moderately affected sites supported relatively rich assemblages, the harshest environmental conditions (pH < 2.5) were typical for the presence of a limited number of very tolerant taxa, such as Oligochaeta and some Diptera (Limnophyes, Forcipomyiinae). The trophic guild structure correlated significantly with AMD chemistry, whereby predators completely disappeared under the most severe AMD conditions. We also provide a brief review of the AMD literature and outline the needs for future detailed studies involving functional descriptors of the impact of AMD on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Pb (lead) contamination in water and soils is increasing and its accumulation in plants may have serious deleterious consequences for environment and human health. Lead effects on plants still remain unclear and, therefore, a selection of Pb sensitive parameters used as biomarkers is required for improvement within the scope of Ecological Risk Assessment. In this study Lactuca sativa L. plants were exposed to Pb to contaminated irrigation solutions (12.5 mg l(-1) and 125 mg l(-1)) for 15 days. Orthogonal analyses (time vs. Pb concentration vs. organ) were carried out after one, seven and fifteen days to elucidate about the effects of this element in plants. During exposure, plant growth, nutritional imbalance, water content, soluble protein content, lipid peroxidation (malondyaldehyde accumulation) and photosynthesis (chlorophyll contents and PSII fluorescence) were assessed in order to find the most adequated parameters for further studies in under realistic environmental conditions.
   Morphological and growth parameters showed decreases of root and shoot growth and alterations in root branching pattern. Biochemical parameters showed nutritional imbalance mostly concerning Pb, K (potassium) and Fe (iron) contents, changes in chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a:b ratio and malondyaldehyde accumulation. Therefore, such biochemical parameters may be used/recommended as assessment parameters complementary to morphologic ones (e.g. shoot and root lengths) both in toxicological tests and further studies under realistic environmental conditions.

AB  - The dynamics of karyotypical instability of Allium fistulosum L. (Welsh onion) during aging of genetically homogenous seeds from plants grown in three different areas was studied. We analyzed the frequency of anaphase cells with chromosomal aberrations "damage", as a number of chromosomal aberrations per cell with aberrations, and germinating capacity, as an indicator of the 'toxic' influence of age. The seeds' aging was accompanied by an increase in karyotypical instability (increasing frequency of anaphases with aberrations) and with certain changes in the spectrum of chromosome aberrations. The clearest distinctions between old and young seeds were found for the frequency of anaphase cells with chromosome aberrations. The general level of karyotypical instability positively correlates with the age of the seeds. The regression coefficient (b) corresponds to the general tendency of karyotypical instability during seeds' senescence under storage. For 'good' (A), 'normal' (B) and 'bad' (C) conditions, the coefficients (b's) are b(A) = 0.22, b(B) = 0.46 and b(C) = 0.84 (p < 0.05 for C, and p < 0.001 for A and B). It was found that different ecological conditions of plant vegetation strongly influence age-related dynamics of chromosomal instability in the seeds obtained from these plants. Possible mechanisms of the transgenerational impact of this effect are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that the ratio of elements in the humic acids clearly corresponds to the landscape conditions and quantitative characteristics of climatic parameters. They persist over time and can serve as one of the reliable indicators in assessing the environment of different periods of paleogeographic history.

AB  - Grasses and shrubs occupy large areas of fragile ecosystems following ecological restoration. Therefore, it is increasingly important to assess and monitor the environmental safety of pastures. However, previous studies on this topic lacked systematicity and directionality. In this study, we reviewed the literature on runoff and erosion to summarise the core issues for future research, resolve the current research bottleneck, and promote the balance of soil, water, and energy in fragile ecological areas. The results of the review indicate that coverage remained the main vegetation feature considered when characterising rangeland slope erosion and runoff. Erosion energy should be comprehensively considered based on the influence of vegetation on rainfall distribution and runoff erosivity. Rangeland slope erosion and runoff changes can only be explained by integrating the above-and below-ground characteristics of vegetation. Additionally, the impact of vegetation on runoff separation and the sediment transport processes at different erosion stages under rainfall conditions vary. Therefore, studying the comprehensive indicators of vegetation at different erosion stages in response to erosion and runoff will be vital in rangeland erosion research. From the perspective of disciplinary development, this study can promote the further development of soil erosion, ecology, soil science, hydrology, hydraulics, and other disciplines.

AB  - This study explores the relationships of AM fungal abundance and diversity with biotic (host plant, ungulate grazing) and abiotic (soil properties, precipitation) factors in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Soil and root samples were collected from grazed and ungrazed plots at seven sites across steep soil fertility and precipitation gradients. AM fungal abundance in the soil was estimated from the density of spores and the concentration of a fatty acid biomarker. Diversity of AM fungi in roots and soils was measured using DNA sequencing and spore identification. AM fungal abundance in soil decreased with grazing and precipitation and increased with soil phosphorus. The community composition of AM fungal DNA in roots and soils differed. Root samples had more AM fungal indicator species associated with biotic factors (host plant species and grazing), and soil samples had more indicator species associated with particular sample sites. These findings suggest that regional edaphic conditions shape the site-level species pool from which plant species actively select root-colonizing fungal assemblages modified by grazing. Combining multiple measurements of AM fungal abundance and community composition provides the most informed assessment of the structure of mycorrhizal fungal communities in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction In order to evaluate water quality of a canal system, the spatial pattern of protozoan communities in response to physicochemical variables was studied in the Hangzhou section of the Grand Canal, northern China during a 1-year cycle (February 2008-January 2009).
   Materials and methods Protozoan samples were monthly collected at six sampling stations with a spatial gradient of environmental status. Physicochemical parameters, e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters.
   Results The protozoan community structures represented significant differences among the six sampling stations. The spatial patterns of protozoan communities were significantly correlated with the changes of chemical variables, especially COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN. Of 88 protozoan taxa recorded over the study period, ten species (e.g., Carchesium polypinum, Colpidium campylum, Prorodon teres, Vorticella putrina, Zoothamnium arbuscula, Euglena spp., and Phacus spp.) were significantly related to COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that protozoa can be used as a robust bioindicator of water quality in freshwater river systems.

AB  - Emergy and economic analysis, accompanied by sensitivity analysis, were used to evaluate the ecological economic characteristics of three fish aquaculture systems on wetlands surrounding the Pearl River Estuary in China. The sustainability of these systems was compared to two aquaculture systems and two wetland systems, to provide reference conditions for the best use of limited wetland areas. We found that the three systems studied had similar emergy characteristics, despite their very different economic characteristics. Counter intuitively, the high economic input and output mode did not have higher environmental impact or lower sustainability compared with low economic input and output mode. Apparently, the sustainability of an intensive aquaculture system is determined mainly by how many natural renewable resources are exploited. The large differences in economic benefit and environmental impacts between the mangrove reserve and the aquaculture systems demonstrated the important role of nature reserves on preserving the sustainability of an estuary. Transformity (TR) and Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) are both indicators of system efficiency, but from different points of view, and they produced opposite results in assessing the efficiency of the same system in this study. The ratio of EYR to TR might be used in addition to the EYR and transformity as a discreet perspective on overall system production efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although freshwater habitats, especially springs, are widely recognized as top-priority habitats for monitoring and conservation procedures, their fauna, especially water beetles, are still poorly studied in the southeastern part of Europe. Thus, the dominant water beetle in these habitats, E. bosnica (Zaitzev, 1908) (Insecta: Coleoptera: Elmidae), has been completely ignored and misidentified. This study represents the first review of its taxonomy and its population and ecological traits. Both published and unpublished data are presented and discussed, as well as the results of field sampling in 46 springs and other waterbodies conducted in this region from 2004 to 2019. The identification characters of the male genitalia and the first DNA barcode of the species are presented. The results confirm the close phylogenetic relationship of E. bosnica with E. aenea (Muller, 1806) and E. rioloides (Kuwert, 1890). The species proved to be a useful environmental descriptor and can easily be used as a biological indicator due to its easy identification. The species shows remarkable sensitivity to environmental conditions and inhabits sites that are potentially under increased anthropogenic pressure and could disappear at an alarming rate. Thus, karstic habitats should be included in future conservation and monitoring procedures in this part of Europe.

AB  - Cyanobacteria of biological soil crusts (BSCs) represent an important part of circumpolar and Alpine ecosystems, serve as indicators for ecological condition and climate change, and function as ecosystem engineers by soil stabilization or carbon and nitrogen input. The characterization of cyanobacteria from both polar regions remains extremely important to understand geographic distribution patterns and community compositions. This study is the first of its kind revealing the efficiency of combining denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), light microscopy and culture-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing, applied to polar and Alpine cyanobacteria dominated BSCs. This study aimed to show the living proportion of cyanobacteria as an extension to previously published meta-transcriptome data of the same study sites. Molecular fingerprints showed a distinct clustering of cyanobacterial communities with a close relationship between Arctic and Alpine populations, which differed from those found in Antarctica. Species richness and diversity supported these results, which were also confirmed by microscopic investigations of living cyanobacteria from the BSCs. Isolate-based sequencing corroborated these trends as cold biome clades were assigned, which included a potentially new Arctic clade of Oculatella. Thus, our results contribute to the debate regarding biogeography of cyanobacteria of cold biomes.

AB  - Biofuel feedstock production can be a significant driver of landscape modification, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss. There is growing body of literature that shows how biofuel landscapes provide various ecosystem services (e.g., feedstock for fuel, carbon sequestration) and compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services). These effects are context-specific and depend largely on prior land use conditions and feedstock production practices. Changes in the flow of ecosystem services due to the conversion of natural and agricultural areas can have ripple effects on human wellbeing. Despite some recent attempts to apply to biofuel settings concepts and methods rooted in the ecosystem services literature, this is the exception rather than the rule within both the biofuel and the ecosystem services research communities. This paper synthesizes the current knowledge about the impact of biofuels on ecosystem services. It focuses especially on the feedstock production phase and outlines the main mechanisms through which landscape conversion affects the provisions of ecosystem services. It proposes conceptually coherent indicators to reflect these mechanisms and offers a critical discussion of key issues at the interface of biofuels and ecosystem services.

AB  - Water-level fluctuations determine the ecological function of shallow lakes and wetlands. Wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) are reliable indicators of the biotic conditions at multiple trophic levels, thereby reflecting an ecosystem response to water-level changes. We used a historic nesting record dating back to 1977 and an information-theoretic approach to identify environmental factors that were most important for predicting the number of wading bird nests at Lake Okeechobee, a highly managed reservoir in Florida. The three top models accounted for 71% of the Akaike weight. Model variables included area of willow (Salix spp.) for nesting substrate, maximum depth of the lake on January 1, and foraging habitat availability over the nesting season. Collectively, the results suggest that the number of nests was greatest when area of nesting substrate was high and water levels were moderate (3.9-4.4 m). Nesting substrate was greatest when water levels fell below 3.9 m at least once every three years. Nest numbers dropped when either nesting substrate or foraging habitat was limited. This study identifies key hydrological parameters that support large populations of breeding wading birds and thus promote healthy, functioning wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Riparian vegetation, which performs many key ecological functions, has been modified or lost at an alarming rate during the past century as a result of human activity. The aims of this study are (a) to investigate the effects of poplar plantations on plant diversity in riparian zones; and (b) to estimate the ecological implications of extending cover by poplar plantations. For this purpose, we assessed species richness, habitat indicator species and functional diversity based on Grime's C-S-R strategies. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to examine the role of environmental factors such as soil properties, forest structure and management. Disturbance, in particular the frequency of harrowing, led to a decline in species richness and modified the indicator species and functional diversity by favoring Ruderal (R) species at the expense Stress-Tolerant (S) and Competitor (C) species, which are better suited to riparian forest conditions. Poplar plantations should not be used as surrogates for riparian forests, and minimizing harrowing in poplar plantations promotes vascular plant diversity. Furthermore, reintroduction of herbs, ferns and geophytes with a high conservation value and low seed dispersal capacity is advisable from the sixth year after establishment, once harrowing for weed control has been completed.

AB  - Ecological impacts associated with nature-based recreation and tourism can compromise park and protected area goals if left unrestricted. Protected area agencies are increasingly incorporating indicator-based management frameworks into their management plans to address visitor impacts. Development of indicators requires empirical evaluation of indicator measures and examining their ecological and social relevance. This study addresses the development of the informal trail indicator in Yosemite National Park by spatially characterizing visitor use in open landscapes and integrating use patterns with informal trail condition data to examine their spatial association. Informal trail and visitor use data were collected concurrently during July and August of 2011 in three, high-use meadows of Yosemite Valley. Visitor use was clustered at statistically significant levels in all three study meadows. Spatial data integration found no statistically significant differences between use patterns and trail condition class. However, statistically significant differences were found between the distance visitors were observed from informal trails and visitor activity type with active activities occurring closer to trail corridors. Gender was also found to be significant with male visitors observed further from trail corridors. Results highlight the utility of integrated spatial analysis in supporting indicator-based monitoring and informing management of open landscapes. Additional variables for future analysis and methodological improvements are discussed.

AB  - The overall impact of tuna farming on soft-bottom habitat was assessed at three tuna farms over a period of 3years, using benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators. Polychaetes and amphipods served as better indicators of the impact of tuna farming compared with molluscs and decapods. Lower number and Shannon-Wiener diversity of polychaete and amphipod taxa were recorded over time at the impacted plots compared with the control plots, while the polychaete/amphipod index indicated that the Ecological Quality Status at the impacted plots changed from Poor/Moderate to Good during the study period. Results of the multivariate analyses indicated significantly higher dispersion of samples of the polychaete and amphipod assemblages over time at the impacted plots compared with the control plots, indicative of stressed assemblages. Differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages between impacted and control plots were consistent across faunal groups except for molluscs, which showed no response. Results must be interpreted with caution due to the high spatiotemporal variation in the influence of tuna farming on the macroinvertebrate assemblages, which highlights the importance of including multiple impacted and reference areas, as well as replicate sampling times, in assessing the environmental impact of tuna farms.

AB  - In Canada, concerns are mounting that the coastal environments may be more affected by human activities than is evidenced by current monitoring and assessment of environmental quality. Holistically orientated approaches to coastal management have concluded that indicators of coastal sustainability must include a wider array of factors that go beyond marine ecosystem health to include the health and well-being of coastal terrestrial environments and human communities. Research is needed to bridge the disciplinary and jurisdictional barriers that hamper better understanding of the relationships between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and to help recognize the role of humans as both a contributing and an affected species in the coastal ecotone. Our examination of past and current knowledge of conditions along the Atlantic shore of Nova Scotia led us to challenge the predominant view that all is well along Canadian coasts. Using an interdisciplinary approach derived from landscape ecology, we examined international, national, and local efforts to assess management indicators against factors that gauge their relevance to marine- and land-development planning and management. We propose a new context for indicators, one that challenges scientists to provide decision-makers with information that can be used to drive social change, avoiding or mitigating human activities and sustaining coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Urban areas may contain a wide range of potential habitats and environmental gradients and, given the many benefits to human health and well-being, there is a growing interest in maximizing their biodiversity potential. However, the ecological patterns and processes in urban areas are poorly understood. Using a widely applicable ecological survey method, we sampled epiphytic lichen communities, important bioindicators of atmospheric pollution, on host Quercus trees in urban parks of London, UK, to test if common patterns relating to lichen diversity are mirrored in urban green spaces. We found lichen diversity to be dependent on host species identity, and negatively related to local tree crowding. In addition, we found a strong negative effect of tree size on lichen diversity, leaving large trees as unexploited niches. A novel network analysis revealed the presence of only pioneer communities, showing the lichen communities are being held in successional stasis, likely due to the heritage effects of SO2 emissions and current nitrogen pollution and particulate emissions. Our study highlights that jointly assessing species richness, community structure and the successional stage can be key to understanding diversity patterns in urban ecosystems. Subsequently, this may help best determine the optimum conditions that will facilitate biodiversity increase within cities.

AB  - Effective assessment of tourism impact on vegetation landscape is important for nature reserve management. A new index concerning multiple vegetation and tourism variables, integrative ecological sensitivity (IES), was constructed and applied to the evaluation of tourism impact on vegetation landscape in the Baihua Mountain Reserve of Beijing, China in this study. The relationships between vegetation landscape, environmental factors and tourism were analyzed by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to prove the usefulness of IES. The results showed that IES was effective in evaluation of tourism impact on vegetation landscape. The IES values varied greatly and related to tourism disturbance in the Baihua Mountain Reserve. TWINSPAN gave correct and rapid classification of vegetation landscape and identified 5 districts with different quality. Districts I and II were in nice and medium conditions and districts IV and V in overused by tourism. CCA ordination showed their changing tendency based on tourism development. Both elevation and tourism disturbance were significant in management of mountainous area such as the Baihua Mountain Reserve. The results of TWINSPAN and CCA further proved the effectivity of IES.

Multidisciplinary research on this topic is therefore needed. This article focuses on the impact of ecological conditions, functional groups, ecological strategies, floristic composition (through habitat preference of species), major floristic gradients (presented as first two NMDS axes), and the management on forage quality. We estimated the forage quality using indicator values. All of the available vegetation plots in the region on wet and mesic meadows, managed pastures, and tall-herb meadow/pasture fringes on deeper or shallower soils (i.e., grasslands) were collected, organized in a database, and elaborated according to standard procedure. We used a widely accepted grassland classification system that uses floristic composition to define grassland types. Based on an NMDS ordination diagram and according to functional groups, ecological strategies, and habitat preferences (behavior of species) and management, we defined three major groups: mesic meadows (mowed), wet meadows (mowed), and pastures (grazed). We correlated all groups' functional groups, ecological strategies, habitat preferences (behavior of species), major floristic gradients, management, and forage quality. We found that forage quality mainly depends on moisture conditions and that nutrients and grazing are less important. Within the grasslands under consideration, mesic meadows and mesic pastures have the highest forage quality.

AB  - The potential terrestrial toxicity of three pesticides, azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, and ethoprophos was evaluated using reproduction ecotoxicological tests with different non-target species: the collembolan Folsomia candida, the earthworm Eisenia andrei, and the enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus. All reproduction tests were performed with natural soil from a Mediterranean agricultural area (with no pesticide residues) in order to improve the relevance of laboratory data to field conditions. Controls were performed with natural and standard artificial soil (OECD 10% OM). The fungicide azoxystrobin showed the highest toxicity to earthworms (EC50 = 42.0 mg a.i. kg(-1) dw soil). Collembolans were the most sensitive taxa in terms of sublethal effects of chlorothalonil with an EC50 of 31.1 mg a.i. kg(-1) dw soil followed by the earthworms with an EC50 of 40.9 mg a.i. kg(-1) dw soil. The insecticide ethoprophos was the most toxic to collembolans affecting their reproduction with an EC50 of 0.027 mg a.i. kg(-1) dw soil. Enchytraeids were generally the least sensitive of the three species tested for long-term effects. Earthworms were not always the most sensitive species, emphasizing the need to increase the number of mandatory assays with key non-target organisms in the environmental risk assessment of pesticides.

AB  - The value of ants as bioindicators of incipient environmental change in rangeland condition was assessed on a local scale in the South Australian arid zone. The sensitivity of ants to intense pulses of unsustainable grazing was tested, in order to identify species, functional groups or community variables that could be used as indicators of more typical grazing pressure. Genera represented by the largest number of species were Iridomyrmex, Melophorus, Camponotus and Monomorium. A significant decrease in captures of Rhytidoponera metallica was recorded on swales, whereas the Iridomyrmex sp.(bicknelli) group increased on dunes relative to controls following grazing. The Generalized A Myrmicinae functional group increased on swales, and Hot-climate Specialist ants increased on dunes, after grazing. Several other species and functional groups responded qualitatively but not significantly. However, neither overall ant abundance and richness, nor the abundances of most of the common species and functional groups responded significantly to grazing in this local scale experiment, which rendered ants of limited use as early warning indicators of unsustainable management. The use of ants for this purpose is constrained by a lack of knowledge of the ecology of individual ant species, particularly of the less common and more localized species that are likely to be most sensitive to disturbance.

AB  - Innovation ecosystems are intricate networks that provide opportunities to access resources, capabilities, and cooperating firms for value-creating knowledge transfer. While the literature has noted the complex nature of diverse innovation ecosystem actors, fewer studies have refined how macro-institutional pressures impact behavioral interactions among diverse entities. The innovation ecosystem research has yet to theoretically refine how micro-level complex components (entities) navigate environments, coalescence, and overcome barriers within varying institutional conditions. Ultimately, each entity behaves and is governed by diverse motivational drivers. Yet, the divergent impacts this has on key behaviors have not been covered by broader-scale empirical studies. Therefore, this study focused on the institutional mechanisms that influence the crucial role of entrepreneurial networking activities in ecosystems. Using a global sample, the study employed a multi-level logistic regression model and data developed from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, World Development Indicators, Index of Economic Freedom, and the World Governance Indicators to reveal certain forms of institutional settings that influence collaborative behavior in the ecosystem and entrepreneurial networks' emergence. It emphasizes the need for managers and policymakers to recognize these effects and enact strategies that promote value creating entrepreneurial network behavior on the individual level to benefit the holistic ecosystem performance.

AB  - Species migration events are common features of the fossil record, but the impacts of immigration events vary. In this paper, the pattern and impact of two types of immigration events are compared: ephemeral invasion and biotic immigration events (BIMEs). Specifically, this study focuses on biotic patterns preserved in Edenian, Maysvillian, and Richmondian (Late Ordovician, Katian) age strata in the Cincinnati, USA region. New Edenian occurrences of rhynchonelliformean brachiopod taxa belonging to the classic "Richmondian Fauna" are documented, and the ecological and evolutionary impacts of these short-lived pre-Richmondian invasions and the sustained Richmondian Invasion are compared. The Richmondian Invasion produced substantial ecological changes and evolutionary impacts within the Cincinnatian paleocommunity; however, the ephemeral invasions that occurred in the Kope Formation did not produce a marked or lasting impact on ecological relationships within Cincinnatian paleocommunities. In each instance, an Edenian novel immigration or biotic event was limited in temporal duration and did not exceed the time to deposit a single sedimentary package. Although such ephemeral invasions do not result in community-scale changes, they nevertheless provide important information about basin connectivity, provide insight into abiotic environmental conditions, and can be useful stratigraphic indicators.

AB  - Since 1974, conservation efforts to protect an endangered species, the Golden Lion Tamarin (GLT), have led to the creation of the first strict nature reserve in Brazil - the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve (REBIO) - and the subsequent creation of the Environmental Protection Area of the Sao Joao River Basin, for sustainable use. This paper assesses the influence of Protected Areas (PA) creation and conservation programs on GLT habitat. Landscape metrics based on aerial photographs taken from three different periods are used to assess habitat conditions for this species through time. We analyzed the availability and potential quality of habitat in the years following the creation of the REBIO, comparing with its buffer zone and population rates correlations. We observed different trends in landscape dynamics between the REBIO, where most of the forest recovery occurred, and its buffer zone, where habitat loss was recorded. In general, the results showed an increase of continuous forest patches. The conservation/regeneration processes in the buffer zone have intensified in recent years. Comparisons over time, especially with respect to forest core areas and large patches, are valuable tools to assess landscape suitability for GLT survival at different spatial scales.

AB  - Oceans currently face a variety of threats, requiring ecosystem-based approaches to management such as networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). We evaluated changes in fish biomass on temperate rocky reefs over the decade following implementation of a network of MPAs in the northern Channel Islands, California. We found that the biomass of targeted (i.e. fished) species has increased consistently inside all MPAs in the network, with an effect of geography on the strength of the response. More interesting, biomass of targeted fish species also increased outside MPAs, although only 27% as rapidly as in the protected areas, indicating that redistribution of fishing effort has not severely affected unprotected populations. Whether the increase outside of MPAs is due to changes in fishing pressure, fisheries management actions, adult spillover, favorable environmental conditions, or a combination of all four remains unknown. We evaluated methods of controlling for biogeographic or environmental variation across networks of protected areas and found similar performance of models incorporating empirical sea surface temperature versus a simple geographic blocking term based on assemblage structure. The patterns observed are promising indicators of the success of this network, but more work is needed to understand how ecological and physical contexts affect MPA performance.

AB  - We present a range of airborne in situ observations of biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol over tropical South America, including a case study of a large tropical forest wildfire and a series of regional survey flights across the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado. The study forms part of the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) project, which was conducted during September and October 2012. We find limited evidence for net increases in aerosol mass through atmospheric ageing combined with substantial changes in the chemical properties of organic aerosol (OA). Oxidation of the OA increases significantly and rapidly on the scale of 2.5-3 h based on our case study analysis and is consistent with secondary organic aerosol production. The observations of limited net enhancement in OA coupled with such changes in chemical composition imply that evaporation of OA is also occurring to balance these changes. We observe significant coatings on black carbon particles at source, but with limited changes with ageing in both particle core size and coating thickness.
   We quantify variability in the ratio of OA to carbon monoxide across our study as a key parameter representing both initial fire conditions and an indicator of net aerosol production with atmospheric ageing. We observe ratios of 0.075-0.13 mu g sm(-3) ppbv(-1) in the west of our study region over the Amazon tropical forest in air masses less influenced by precipitation and a value of 0.095 mu g sm(-3) ppbv(-1) over the Cerrado environment in the east (where sm(-3) refers to standard metre cubed). Such values are consistent with emission factors used by numerical models to represent biomass burning OA emissions. Black carbon particle core sizes typically range from mean mass diameters of 250 to 290 nm, while coating thicknesses range from 40 to 110 nm in air masses less influenced by precipitation. The primary driver of the variability we observe appears to be related to changes at the initial fire source. A key lesson from our study is that simply aggregating our observations as a function of atmospheric ageing would have been misleading due to the complex nature of the regional aerosol and its drivers, due to the many conflating and competing factors that are present.
   Our study explores and quantifies key uncertainties in the evolution of biomass burning aerosol at both near-field and regional scales. Our results suggest that the initial conditions of the fire are the primary driver of carbonaceous aerosol physical and chemical properties over tropical South America, aside from significant oxidation of OA during atmospheric ageing. Such findings imply that uncertainties in the magnitude of the aerosol burden and its impact on weather, climate, health and natural ecosystems most likely lie in quantifying emission sources, alongside atmospheric dispersion, transport and removal rather than chemical enhancements in mass.

AB  - There is almost no information on how restoration of Sphagnum-dominated peatbogs, and in particular removal of reeds, affects the functioning of ciliate communities. Changes in vegetation patterns caused by restoration procedures may take years to be observed, while microbial processes already display effects after short-term exposure to changes in environmental conditions due to restoration. Based on the results of a long-term study, we assumed that mowing down of reeds causes changes in the physicochemical properties of peatbog water and sought to answer the question of how ciliate communities react to these changes and whether these microorganisms can play a significant role as bioindicators in evaluating the restoration process. Removal of reeds clearly modified the taxonomic composition and abundance of ciliates. This was reflected in an increase in the abundance and diversity of these protozoa and in a significant increase in the proportion of sphagnophilous species. Our results suggest an indicator species approach based on functional groups may be appropriate for biomonitoring peatbog restoration. A better understanding of what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatbogs and unravelling of these fundamental mechanisms are particularly critical in order to more accurately predict how peatbogs will respond to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Modern humans have occupied almost all possible environments globally since exiting Africa about 100,000 years ago. Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at >3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between human disturbance and ecological response is essential to the process of indicator development. For large-scale observational studies, sites should be selected across gradients of anthropogenic stress, but such gradients are often unknown for a population of sites prior to site selection. Stress data available from public sources can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) to partially characterize environmental conditions for large geographic areas without visiting the sites. We divided the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region into 762 units consisting of a shoreline reach and drainage-shed and then summarized over 200 environmental variables in seven categories for the units using a GIS. Redundancy within the categories of environmental variables was reduced using principal components analysis. Environmental strata were generated from cluster analysis using principal component scores as input. To protect against site selection bias, sites were selected in random order from clusters. The site selection process allowed us to exclude sites that were inaccessible and was shown to successfully distribute sites across the range of environmental variation in our GIS data. This design has broad applicability when the goal is to develop ecological indicators using observational data from large-scale surveys.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of Littoral ascidians were analyzed with respect to their possible relationships with environmental stress. As part of a multidisciplinary research project on the benthic communities in Algeciras Bay, southern Spain, a suite of environmental variables was measured (hydrodynamism, silting, suspended solids and organic matter). After displaying the similarities of fauna through clustering and ordination of sampling sites, the relationships between community differences and changes in the abiotic component were established based on the BIO-ENV procedure and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Hydrodynamism and the percentage of organic matter in the silt is the variable combination that best explains (Spearman correlation of 0.82) the biotic structure. While all ascidians show a certain tolerance to diverse environmental factors, some species such as Ciona intestinalis, Diplosoma spongiforme, Phallusia mammillata, Microcosmus squamiger, Styela plicata and Synoicum argus could be considered as indicators of areas which have been subject to intense stress (substrate transformation, water stagnation and sedimentation excess) over long periods of time, whereas others such as Aplidium conicum, Aplidium punctum, Clavelina dellavallei, Halocynthia papillosa and Stolonica socialis, which live only in natural and non-perturbed rock areas, could be categorized as species very sensitive to stress, as well as indicators of good conditions.

AB  - Identifying susceptible regions where biodiversity changes occur at fast rates is essential in order to protect and ameliorate affected areas. Large-scale coastal monitoring programs that focus on long-term variability are scarce, yet the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Pole to Pole is currently developing a regional collaboration throughout the American continent collecting biodiversity data in coastal habitats with a standardized systematic protocol. The use of photographic methods to collect assemblage data on intertidal rocky shores can be appropriate. The goal of this study was to analyze the performance of a simple, low-cost, non-destructive and lowtech photographic method on a broad geographical scale (? 2,000 km) of Atlantic Patagonian coastline. Concurrently, we aimed to identify indicators whose cover, presence or condition can be followed in time and used as beacons of change in biodiversity on these rocky intertidal shores. We also explored the potential relationships between assemblage structure and environmental variables, such as seascape classes. We identified and propose cover of mytilids, Coralina spp. and bare substrate as indicators of change due to their ecological relevance in intertidal assemblages and their visible and rapid response to human stressors or changes in environmental conditions. Finally, we illustrate the practicality and usefulness of remotely accessible environmental data, for instance the seascape classes approach as an integrative tool for large-scale rocky shore studies.

AB  - The West Nile virus is endemic in multiple European countries and responsible for several epidemics throughout the European region. Its evolution into local or even widespread epidemics is driven by multiple factors from genetic diversification of the virus to environmental conditions. The year of 2018 was characterized by an extraordinary increase in human and animal cases in the Central-Eastern European region, including Hungary. In a collaborative effort, we summarized and analyzed the genetic and serologic data of WNV infections from multiple Hungarian public health institutions, universities, and private organizations. We compared human and veterinary serologic data, along with NS5 and NS3 gene sequence data through 2018. Wild birds were excellent indicator species for WNV circulation in each year. Our efforts resulted in documenting the presence of multiple phylogenetic subclades with Balkans and Western-European progenitor sequences of WNV circulating among human and animal populations in Hungary prior to and during the 2018 epidemic. Supported by our sequence and phylogenetic data, the epidemic of 2018 was not caused by recently introduced WNV strains. Unfortunately, Hungary has no country-wide integrated surveillance system which would enable the analysis of related conditions and provide a comprehensive epidemiological picture. The One Health approach, involving multiple institutions and experts, should be implemented in order to fully understand ecological background factors driving the evolution of future epidemics.

AB  - The distribution range of the Mount Atlas mastic tree in North Africa extends from the Tellian Atlas mountains, where it is found together with Atlas cedars, to the central Sahara where it grows with acacias. It has a very wide ecological range making it a suitable candidate for extension with the advance of climate change effects. To follow a previous article on the relationship between climate and growth rings, this paper reports on the way climate determines the tree's radial growth in forested environments in a sub-humid bioclimate. The study was conducted in two stands on the slopes of Djebel Meddad, one south-facing and one north-facing. Our analysis of responses to extreme climatic events based on calculations for characteristic years shows that the species is more sensitive to extremes in warmer conditions of exposure, especially when these events inhibit growth. Average sensitivities are very similar on both slopes but low compared to those obtained for arid and semi-arid regions. Analysis of growth indicators shows that thin and thick growth rings always correspond to especially dry and especially rainy conditions. Average annual temperatures only have an additional effect. No very thin growth rings were recorded on either slope. The response functions show that climatic factors in a given year play a major role in the construction of growth rings.

AB  - Eukaryote-associated microbiomes interact with their hosts in multiple manners, thereby affecting the hosts' phenotype, physical condition and behaviour. In plants, bacteria have numerous functions, with variable net effects, both in natural and agricultural systems. However, information about the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities associated with different aboveground plant organs, particularly flowers, is lacking. In addition, the relative effects of microhabitat and environmental conditions on community establishment require further attention. Here, using culture-independent methods, we determine that leaves and three floral microhabitats (nectar, stamina and styles) of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae), a tree endemic to Hawai'i, host unique indicator communities composed of relatively abundant bacterial taxa. These indicator communities are accompanied by a large number of ubiquitous or rare bacteria with lower abundances. In our study system, the strong effect of microhabitat filtering on plant-associated community composition and bacterial richness and diversity strongly exceeds the influence of environmental effects such as precipitation, altitude, substrate age and geographic distance. Thus, the bacterial richness of aboveground plant organs is strongly underestimated when only one microhabitat, e.g. leaves, is considered. Our study represents a first step towards a comprehensive characterization of the distribution, composition and underlying factors, of plant bacterial communities, with implications for future basic and applied research on plant health, pollination and reproduction.

AB  - Studies of a spectrum of metabolites found in cereals are becoming one of the primary tools for evaluating their susceptibility to the effects of various environmental agents, such as: pathogens, temperature and precipitation. In order to reduce the effect of the environmental conditions, cultivars were grown under identical cultivation conditions.
   This study aimed to construct a model to differentiate infected from non-infected cereals by developing the metabolomic profile of barley, oats and rye. Fungal and total microflora content, trichothecenes, fatty acids and volatile compounds were determined in the grains using GC/MS and en electronic nose. The most significant compounds in the construction of the model were established as the following volatiles: (E, E)-3,5 octadien 2-one, 1-heptanol, naphthalene, p-xylene and dimethyl sulphone; fatty acids: oleic acid (C18:1n-9), alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7); mycotoxins: T-2, and HT-2 toxins and deoxynivalenol as well as the terpene: trichodiene. Chemometric techniques were established to enable the identification of the grains.
   Results indicate the necessity to extend the scope of analyses of cereals to include the metabolomic aspect. This will make it possible to identify a dependence between their most significant traits and will contribute to a better understanding of their cereal resistance mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent decades, the seasonal variation in NO3 (-) discharge from forest ecosystems has been used increasingly by ecologists and hydrologists as a diagnostic indicator of the nutrient status of ecosystems. Major factors underlying the seasonal patterns of stream NO3 (-) concentration include seasonal variations in (1) ecosystem nutrient demand, (2) solute transport capability of the hydrological condition, and (3) in-stream nutrient usage and supply. In this article I show how case studies have helped elucidate the dominant controlling factors by comparing data from Japanese catchments with previously compiled data from studies in North America and Europe. Moreover, I explain the different influences that hydrological and biogeochemical controls exert in regions with rainy (Japan) and dry (northeastern United States and Europe) summers. The seasonal variation in hydrological conditions is the predominant controlling factor in Japanese forests, whereas nutrient demand may predominate in the northeastern United States and Europe. I emphasize the importance of comparing seasonal patterns among regions with differing climates to obtain more universal explanations of seasonal variations in NO3 (-)-related biogeochemical and hydrological dynamics in a forest ecosystem. In addition, multi-scale investigations will be needed to provide insight into the relative contributions of hillslope biogeochemical effects and in-stream biological activities.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to provide an overview on current knowledge on origin, structure, chemical composition and factors influencing dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling in agricultural soils as well as it role in functioning of agroecosystems. DOM is considered as one of the most sensitive indicators of changes overlapping in the soil environment. It is the most mobile and active soil component serving as an easily available source of nutrients and energy for microbes and other living organisms. It participates in the soil forming processes, transports nutrients and pollutants into deeper soil horizons and actively supports processes of soil structure formation. DOM transformation in agroecosystems is impacted by many chemical, physical and biological factors and modified by climatic conditions and agricultural activities therefore the quantity and quality of DOM is very difficult to predict and control. Although, the role and the fluxes of DOM have been widely investigated in previous decades, but the research interest was focused mainly on forest soils and water reservoirs while less attention was paid to soils of agricultural usage. New challenges facing agriculture related to the protection of soil functions influencing ecosystem services, mitigation of climate changes and sequestration of organic carbon indicate DOM as a potential factor enabling to reach these goals.

AB  - Geothermally heated regions of Earth, such as terrestrial volcanic areas (fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers) and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, represent a variety of different environments populated by extremophilic archaeal and bacterial microorganisms. Since most of these microbes thriving in such harsh biotopes, they are often recalcitrant to cultivation; therefore, ecological, physiological and phylogenetic studies of these microbial populations have been hampered for a long time. More recently, culture-independent methodologies coupled with the fast development of next generation sequencing technologies as well as with the continuous advances in computational biology, have allowed the production of large amounts of metagenomic data. Specifically, these approaches have assessed the phylogenetic composition and functional potential of microbial consortia thriving within these habitats, shedding light on how extreme physico-chemical conditions and biological interactions have shaped such microbial communities. Metagenomics allowed to better understand that the exposure to an extreme range of selective pressures in such severe environments, accounts for genomic flexibility and metabolic versatility of microbial and viral communities, and makes extreme-and hyper-thermophiles suitable for bioprospecting purposes, representing an interesting source for novel thermostable proteins that can be potentially used in several industrial processes.

AB  - Around the world, artificially drained agricultural lands are significant sources of reactive nitrogen to stream ecosystems, creating substantial stream health problems. One management strategy is the deployment of denitrification enhancement tools. Here, we evaluate the factors affecting the potential of denitrifying bioreactors to improve stream health and ecosystem services. The performance of bioreactors and the structure and functioning of stream biotic communities are linked by environmental parameters like dissolved oxygen and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations, dissolved organic carbon availability, flow and temperature regimes, and fine sediment accumulations. However, evidence of bioreactors' ability to improve waterway health and ecosystem services is lacking. To improve the potential of bioreactors to enhance desirable stream ecosystem functioning, future assessments of field-scale bioreactors should evaluate the influences of bioreactor performance on ecological indicators such as primary production, organic matter processing, stream metabolism, and invertebrate and fish assemblage structure and function. These stream health impact assessments should be conducted at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Bioreactors have great potential to make significant contributions to improving water quality, stream health, and ecosystem services if they are tailored to site-specific conditions and implemented strategically with land-based and stream-based mitigation tools within watersheds. This will involve combining economic, logistical, and ecological information in their implementation.

AB  - Transgenic woody plants have been rapidly developed in recent years, and the commercial use of these transgenic plants has been recognized as an important approach to solving environmental and food problems. Concomitantly, the potential impact of transgenic woody plants on peripheral ecosystems should be considered before they are released for practical commercial use. In this study, we have used environmental biosafety assessments to evaluate three lines of transgenic Eucalyptus globulus that harbor the choline oxidase (codA) gene and have previously been proven to have different levels of salt tolerance. The assessments included two allelopathy bioassays and a survey on rhizosphere microbes, which have shown practicability in other transgenic plants. The two allelopathy bioassays were used for evaluating the potential impact of the transformants on the surrounding vegetation. The survey on rhizosphere microbes was performed to investigate the potential impact of transformants on the rhizosphere microbe community. The results indicated there was no significant difference between the transformants and non-transformants with respect to the impact on the surrounding vegetation and the rhizosphere microbe community. A combination of our biological evaluation of E. globulus was then used to successfully obtain approval for the plantation of transgenic E. globulus in a Type I field trial in Tsukuba.

AB  - Diatom indices developed in certain geographic regions are frequently used elsewhere, despite the strong evidence that such metrics are less useful when applied in regions other than that where species-environment relationships were originally assessed, showing that species have particular autoecological requirements in different geographic areas. In this study, we define the ecological profiles for selected environmental variables in three common epilithic diatom species in the Duero Basin (NW Spain), comparing our results with data gathered from different geographic regions. We assess differences in autoecological parameters obtained from the northern and southern subbasins, and from different years, in order to observe whether significant small-scale, spatiotemporal changes exist. Our results show that there are variations in species' autoecological parameters between different regions. Furthermore, there are significant changes comparing northern and southern Duero subbasins for certain species and physiochemical variables. Additionally, different autoecologies have been observed for certain diatoms and environmental factors comparing two different years. It can be concluded that freshwater diatom autoecologies can vary between different geographic areas. This implies that, in order to improve water-quality bioassessments, autoecology-based diatom metrics should be developed by quantifying species distributions along environmental gradients, using datasets representative of the areas or river types where the metrics will be applied.

AB  - The concepts of genetic diversity and naturalness are well known as measures of conservation values and as descriptors of state or condition. A lack of research evaluating the relationship between genetic diversity and naturalness in biological communities, along with the possible implications in terms of evolutionary aspects and conservation management, make this subject particularly important as regards forest tree communities. We therefore examined the following hypothesis: the genetic diversity of a central-European tree stand averaged over species increases with the naturalness of the stand, as defined by the Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV). The results obtained show that the hypothesis is unsustainable because differences between the averaged genetic diversities of the unnatural and semi-natural stand classes (69 cases) were mostly non-significant. Moreover in three cases, the average genetic diversity of unnatural stand classes was significantly higher than the average genetic diversity of the semi-natural stand classes. A significantly lower average genetic diversity of unnatural stand class was not detected in the statistical analysis. Thus, the naturalness of a tree species community, as inferred from PNV, does not serve as a straightforward indicator of ecological stability when the genetic diversity and the adaptability of tree species are unknown.

AB  - The DNase express test system and the SF-bioassay (sea urchin sperm fertilization bioassay) were used to assess the quality of sea and bottom sediment water sampled at 8 stations of the Troitsa Bay (Possyet Bay, Sea of Japan). The specific activities of 8 enzymes (alkaline and acid DNases, RNases, phosphatases and phosphodiesterases) were determined for the liver and gill tissues of the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus sampled at the same stations. The activities of all enzymes were higher in the liver than in the gills, and the activity of acid nucleases in both tissues was significantly higher than that of alkaline nucleases. The specific activities of some nucleases in the mussel tissues correlated to the level of seawater pollution. The activities of acid RNases and phosphodiesterases decreased in both tissues upon an increase in water pollution, up to 1.5-3 times in the gills, while the activities of alkaline and acid phosphatases and phosphodiesterases increased 1.5-4 times. Thus, the specific activities of acid RNases, phosphatases and phosphodiesterases from mussel liver can be a useful indicator of marine pollution. This approach can be used for biotesting of ocean water and for assessment of the biological condition of invertebrates adapting to various ecological and anthropogenic effects.

AB  - The symposium session, Indicators for Effects and Predictions of Harmful Algal Blooms, explored the current state of indicators used to assess the human health and ecological risks caused by harmful algal blooms, and highlighted future needs and impediments that must be overcome in order to provide a complete risk assessment of their impacts. Six recognized human poisoning syndromes resulting from algal toxins (paralytic, neuro toxic, amnesic, diarrhetic shellfish poisonings, ciguatera. fish poisoning, and putative estuary associated syndrome) impact human health through consumption of contaminated seafood, direct contact with bloom water, or inhalation of aerosolized toxin. Thorough health risk assessment for the variety of algal toxins is hampered to varying degrees because either the toxin has not been identified or indicators for exposure and effects remain poorly defined. Predicting the occurrence and determining the impacts of harmful algal blooms in coastal ecosystems are the two major ecological risk assessment needs. In the former case, the hazard is the suite of conditions that trigger bloom initiation, magnify bloom intensity or support bloom longevity, whereas in the latter case, the hazard is the algal toxin. In both cases, indicators (of triggering mechanisms, exposure, and effects) are better defined for some HAB species and toxins than others, but are by no means complete.

AB  - Globally, the process of urbanization is transforming land use and, as a consequence, reducing the efficiency of ecosystem services (ESs), which ensure a healthy and comfortable urban environment. In cities, green infrastructure (GI) is a key source of urban ESs. Russia is a highly urbanized country: 70% of its population live in towns or cities. As cities continue to expand, they are swallowing unsealed lands that support ESs. In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of the current state and recent changes in urban GI in Russia's 16 largest cities, including a biophysical evaluation of key urban ESs, using remote sensing data and freely available statistics. Our analysis identifies a weak correlation between GI area, ES volume, and favorable climate conditions as well as a stronger correlation between ESs and the increasing rate of urbanization. Considering Russia's high level of urbanization, the key importance of ESs for the well-being of citizens, and ongoing reductions of urban GI, major revisions to urban planning policy are required. Indicators of urban biodiversity, GI, and ESs should be incorporated into decision-making processes. In particular, it is vital that the accounting and monitoring of GI and ESs are established in all of Russia's larger cities.

AB  - This research applies and compares the Agroforestry Accounting System (AAS) and the lightly revised System of National Accounts (SNA) in five cork oak farms in Andalusia, Spain, in 2010. We value eighteen economic activities, eleven of which are managed by individual farmers and seven of which are overseen by government. Our objectives are to measure and compare ecosystem services (ES), gross value added (GVA) and environmental income (EI). The comparison takes into account the valuation of products at producer, basic and social prices. Our most noteworthy novelty is that the AAS proposal incorporates the environmental income as a variable which serves as a reference value for the condition of economic sustainability of ecosystem service consumption. Our results show that ES and GVA estimates vary depending on the omission/measurement of auto-consumed/donated non-commercial intermediate services and nature based activity with zero ES value represents nature's free physical service contribution to the farms net value added. Farms AAS ecosystem services at social prices contribute to 64% of final product consumption, and ES at basic prices represent 1.2 times the ES at social prices. Farm revised SNA ecosystem services at basic prices are 0.5 times the AAS ecosystem services at social prices.

TI  - Patterns in the distribution of vegetation in paramo areas: heterogeneity and spacial dependence
T2  - CALDASIA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - Two methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), analysis of spatial heterogeneity and dependence (auto-correlation), - - were applied to the cover patterns from ten paramo localities in the Central and Eastern cordilleras of Colombia. Among the localities studied, the high montane region of the Serrania de Perija, the paramo region of the Los Nevados National Park, and the paramo region under management of CORPOGUAVIO showed a good state of conservation and satisfactory level of connectivity among patches. Anthropic intervention, expansion of potato cultivation and other changes in land use mainly in the paramos of the Cordillera Oriental have alteredd the distribution patterns of natural vegetation types and resulted in significant losses of connectively. Under the circumstancesany attempt to restore the original conditions will be difficult and expensive. This problem is most acute in the paramo localities of La Rusia, Belen, Guantiva (towards the eastern slopes) Telecom, Merchan Tablazo, the northeastern sector of the paramo of Sumapaz and the eastern slopes of the mountains of Carmen de Carupa and surrounding areas. For the mountains of Guanacaste and Las Delicias (areas influenced by the volcano Purace) the problem is more acute towards the northwestern sector. The results of the present study can be applied to ecological restoration and conservation as they provide detailed information about the distribution of vegetation types andhabitatconnectivity, both indicators of ecosystem health.

AB  - Cryptic structure of species complexes confounds an accurate accounting of biological diversity in natural systems. Also, cryptic sibling species often become specialized to different ecological conditions, for instance, with host specialization by cryptic parasite species. The fungus Microbotryum violaceum causes anther smut disease in plants of Caryophyllaceae, and the degree of specialization and gene flow between strains on different hosts have been controversial in the literature. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses on M. violaceum from 23 host species and different geographic origins using three single-copy nuclear genes (beta-tub, gamma-tub, and Ef1 alpha). Congruence between the phylogenies identified several lineages that evolved independently for a long time. The lineages had overlapping geographic ranges but were highly specialized on different hosts. These results thus suggest that M. violaceum is a complex of highly specialized sibling species. Two incongruencies between the individual gene phylogenies and one intragene recombination event were detected at basal nodes, suggesting ancient introgression events or speciation events via hybridizations. However, incongruencies and recombination were not detected among terminal branches, indicating that the potentials for cross-infection and experimental hybridization are often not sufficient to suggest that introgressions would likely persist in nature.

AB  - Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are widely detected in surface waters of the western United States. These chemicals interfere with acetylcholine-mediated synaptic transmission in the nervous systems of fish and other aquatic animals via the inhibition of AChE (acetylcholinesterase) enzyme activity. Anticholinesterase insecticides commonly co-occur in the environment. This raises the possibility of antagonistic, additive, or synergistic neurotoxicity in exposed fish, including threatened and endangered species of Pacific salmon. We extracted AChE from the olfactory nervous system of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and investigated the inhibitory effects of organophosphates (the oxon derivatives of diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and malathion) and carbamates (carbaryl and carbofuran), alone and in two-way combinations. We found that the joint toxicity of anticholinesterase mixtures can be accurately predicted from the inhibitory potencies of individual chemicals within a mixture. This indicates that organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are noninteractive in terms of AChE inhibition and that it might be possible to estimate the cumulative neurotoxicity of mixtures by simple dose addition. Because organophosphates and carbamates are likely to have additive effects on the neurobehavior of salmon under natural exposure conditions, ecological risk assessments that focus on individual anticholinesterases might underestimate the actual risk to salmon in watersheds in which mixtures of these chemicals occur.

AB  - Hinia reticulata and Nucella lapillus (collected from 1989 to 1991 at Pointe de Pleneuf and Mean Melen, France, respectively) exhibit imposex in response to tributyltin (TBT) pollution leached from antifouling paints and proved to be good TBT bioindicators. H. reticulata was kept for 18 mo under TBT-free conditions in the laboratory, but no evidence for imposex remission was found. A second series of experiments showed that food chain uptake of TBT from a contaminated diet is an important mode of TBT exposure in H. reticulata. Comparative tank experiments with H. reticulata and N. lapillus demonstrated that the same type of TBT exposure resulted in comparable TBT body burdens, biological concentration factors, and imposex development in both species [measured as increase of VDS (vas deferens sequence index), uncubed RPS (relative penis size index) and average female penis length]. Differences in imposex development of natural and laboratory populations are discussed against the background of different types of TBT contamination of their food. A statistical study, based on an analysis of natural populations of both prosobranch species, makes a comparison of the specific TBT sensitivity of the two bioindicators possible. As a consequence it is proposed that TBT biomonitoring programs in Europe should use both prosobranchs as indicator species.

AB  - Climatically extreme weather events often drive long-term ecological responses of ecosystems. By disrupting the important symbiosis with zooxanthellae, Marine Cold Spells (MCS) can cause bleaching and mortality in tropical and subtropical scleractinian corals. Here we report on the effects of a severe MCS on high latitude corals, where we expected to find bleaching and mortality. The MCS took place off the coast of Perth (32 degrees S), Western Australia in 2016. Bleaching was assessed before (2014) and after (2017) the MCS from surveys of permanent plots, and with timed bleaching searches. Temperature data was recorded with in situ loggers. During the MCS temperatures dipped to the coldest recorded in ten years (15.3 degrees C) and periods of < 17 degrees C lasted for up to 19 days. Only 4.3% of the surveyed coral colonies showed signs of bleaching. Bleaching was observed in 8 species where those most affected were Plesiastrea versipora and Montipora mollis. These findings suggest that high latitude corals in this area are tolerant of cold stress and are not persisting near a lethal temperature minimum. It has not been established whether other environmental conditions are limiting these species, and if so, what the implications are for coral performance on these reefs in a warmer future.

AB  - A new methodology to classify European North-East Atlantic transitional waters into ecological types has been developed based on the most important hydrological and morphological features that are likely to determine the ecology of aquatic systems in transitional waters. Hydrological indicators help identifying if a transitional water area is dominated by fresh or sea water and/or by intertidal or subtidal areas, while morphological indicators allow an estimation of the complexity of the transitional water and the diversity of the habitats involved. Twelve transitional waters of the southern Bay of Biscay were classified using this methodology and the five hydro-morphological types obtained were validated with benthic macro-invertebrate data. Transitional waters with a complex morphology showed the highest values of species diversity, while those with a smaller tidal influence showed lower species diversity. The 'Scrobicularia' and 'Abra' assemblages, previously identified in the study area, were found to be related to different types of transitional waters. The 'Abra' assemblage only appeared in estuaries with a complex morphology and dominated by tidal influences, while the 'Scrobicularia' assemblage was detected in all the transitional waters except for a single coastal lagoon. This classification of transitional waters may therefore be useful to establish the biological reference conditions needed for European Directives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work investigates the increase of confirmed cases of West Nile virus and the relationship between weather-related patterns and the geographical expansion of West Nile virus in Greece, with a special focus on West Attica, Central Greece, a semi-arid, ecologically fragile Mediterranean area. Using data from the European Environment Agency, European Drought Observatory of Joint Research Centre, the pairwise relationship between surface air temperature anomalies, precipitation anomalies, soil moisture index anomalies, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation anomalies (fAPAR) was evaluated during summer time of 2018, a particularly intense virus outbreak. The empirical results of this study indicate that total precipitation during 2018 was extremely high, nearly 500% above the average. These conditions contributed to the increase of soil moisture index anomaly and fAPAR, creating an ideal microenvironment (wet soils and green pastures) for mosquito breeding. This phenomenon was directly associated with a drastic outbreak of West Nile virus cases in the area, compared with earlier years. Our results indicate how unusually high values of summer precipitation may have contributed (both through direct and indirect ecological channels) to the rapid spread of the West Nile virus in West Attica, causing a significant number of confirmed cases and fatalities. Climate change may bring forth other issues aside from natural disasters, including-but not limited to-virus expansion.

AB  - Root/shoot (R/S) ratio is an important index for assessing plant health, and has received increased attention in the last decades as a sensitive indicator of plant stress induced by chemical or physical agents. The R/S ratio has been discussed in the context of ecological theory and its potential importance in ecological succession, where species follow different strategies for above-ground growth for light or below-ground competition for water and nutrients. We present evidence showing the R/S ratio follows a biphasic dose-response relationship under stress, typical of hormesis. The R/S ratio in response to stress has been widely compared among species and ecological succession classes. It is constrained by a variety of factors such as ontogeny. Furthermore, the current literature lacks dose-response studies incorporating the full dose-response continuum, hence limiting scientific understanding and possible valuable application. The data presented provide an important perspective for new-generation studies that can advance current ecological understanding and improve carbon storage estimates by R/S ratio considerations.

AB  - Transitional Environments (TEs) have been deeply modified to meet human requirements, and for this reason are currently ranked among the most endangered aquatic ecosystems. The Adriatic baSin hosts a large number of TEs of which the Lagoon of Venice is the largest one, but information on its meiofauna are very dated or focused to localized areas. The present study is the first to document the spatial distribution of meiofauna in the whole Venice lagoon. Furthermore, the health status of the TE of Venice has been assessed by means of several faunal parameters (richness, diversity indices, structure of the entire al meio-faunal ssemblage and only rare taxa). All the univariate meiofaunal parameters (i.e. richness, diversity indices, Ne:Co ratio) were consistent in highlighting the worst ecological quality of the Porto Marghera district. Instead, the structure of the entire meiofaunal assemblage as well as that of rare taxa seemed to detect variations not directly related to pollution and likely due to the different hydrodynamic conditions of Lido and Malamocco inlets. On the basis of our results, we have also critically discussed the usefulness of the various faunal parameters in the monitoring assessment of the TEs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenanthrene (Phe) with carcinogenicity is ubiquitous in the environment, especially in aquatic environment; its toxicity is greater. To help determine toxicity risk and remediation strategies, this study predicted seasonal fate of Phe in aquatic environment. Candidate mechanisms including biodegradation, sorption, desorption, photodegradation, hydrolysis and volatility were studied; the results for experiments under simulated conditions for normal, wet and dry seasons in the Yinma River Basin indicated that biodegradation in sediment, sorption, desorption, and volatility were important pathways for elimination of Phe from aquatic environment and showed seasonal variations. A microcosm which was used to mimic sediment/water system was set up to illustrate seasonal distribution and transport of Phe. A Markov chain was applied to predict seasonal fate of Phe in air/water/sediment environment, the predicted results were perfectly agreed with results of microcosm experiments. Predicted results with a Markov chain suggested that volatility and biodegradation in sediment were main elimination pathways, and contributions of elimination pathways showed seasonal variations; Phe was eliminated from water and sediment to negligible levels over around 250 h in August and over 1000 h in May; in November, Phe was eliminated from water to a negligible level while about 31 % of Phe amount still remained in sediment over 1000 h.

AB  - Seagrasses are key components of coastal marine ecosystems and many monitoring programmes worldwide assess seagrass health and apply seagrasses as indicators of environmental status. This study aims at identifying the diversity and characteristics of seagrass indicators in use within and across European ecoregions in order to provide an overview of seagrass monitoring effort in Europe. We identified 49 seagrass indicators used in 42 monitoring programmes and including a total of 51 metrics. The seagrass metrics represented 6 broad categories covering different seagrass organizational levels and spatial scales. The large diversity is particularly striking considering that the pan-European Water Framework Directive sets common demands for the presence and abundance of seagrasses and related disturbance-sensitive species. The diversity of indicators reduces the possibility to provide pan-European overviews of the status of seagrass ecosystems. The diversity can be partially justified by differences in species, differences in habitat conditions and associated communities but also seems to be determined by tradition. Within each European region, we strongly encourage the evaluation of seagrass indicator-pressure responses and quantification of the uncertainty of classification associated to the indicator in order to identify the most effective seagrass indicators for assessing ecological quality of coastal and transitional water bodies.

AB  - The importance of Laguna de Bay in Luzon, Philippines as a natural resource necessitates routine monitoring of its environmental quality. In addition to water quality tests, however, there should also be a focus on the impact of existing conditions on the aquatic biota. There is currently a paucity of published data on the biologic impact of pollutants in the lake. The present study measured the biomarkers of exposure to pollution, namely, hepatic :melanomacrophage centers (MMCs) and hepatosomatic index (HSI), in male common carps (Cyprinus carpio, Linnaeus, 1758) caged for 30 days along the east and west bay of the lake. In comparison to the reference group, caged fish exhibited a greater number of MMCs (p<0.01) that were also of bigger size (p<0.05). Further evaluation revealed the presence of lipofuscin, hemosiderin and melanin pigments in the treatment groups although a greater percentage of the last two pigments was noted in caged fish. HSI, which is also used as an indicator of nutritional and energy status in fish, was also low in this group (p<0.05). The results suggest differences in the environmental quality to which the treatment groups have been subjected with observations in caged fish potentially attributable to pollutant exposure.

AB  - The article substantiates the essence and necessity of the use of innovative approaches to the formation and implementation of public policies of urban revitalization in the context of the latest concepts of urban development, namely: Compact City, Green City, Smart City, Creative City, Inclusive City, Cittaslow, Happy City, Learning City. The relevant proposals on the innovation policy of revitalizing cities are brought forward based on the analysis of the provisions of each of the chosen concepts. It is determined that there does not exist a single city where only one of the latest concepts of city development was implemented. In practice, we observe the multi-vectorness and combination of urban policies, which came to replace traditional sectoral views. Regarding the policy of urban revitalization, innovative approaches focus on the transformation of degraded areas into urban environments favourable for human life and activities in line with the needs and interests of their inhabitants. Revitalization should be considered both in terms of its impact on a specific degraded area and as having long-term synergetic effects on the city as a whole. It was found that the basis for innovative policies of urban revitalization is laid by human-oriented programmes of sustainable renewal of areas. The programmes are premised on taking into account a variety of concepts and combining a number of activities, specifically: organization of a compact multifunctional environment (Compact City); formation of an ecologically friendly environment for human life and activities (Green City); arrangement of urban space taking advantage of modern technologies and innovations (Smart City); creating conditions for life, activities and cooperation of creative people (Creative City); ensuring a full-fledged multidimensional inclusion of all the inhabitants (Inclusive City); realization of the internal potential of an area depending on local identity (Cittaslow); raising the level of public and individual happiness (Happy City); promotion of the culture of lifelong learning of all the inhabitants (Learning City). It is noted that innovative solutions for overcoming the crisis phenomena of degraded urban areas should be individualized depending on the local specificity and potential, the state of economic, physical, human and other capital of a particular city. In this case, the development of human capital of an area is increasingly becoming the key factor of its renewal, which presupposes organization of the inhabitants' training, improving their qualifications and skills. It was substantiated that the revitalization policy is expedient to develop from the perspective of ensuring multiplicative impact on the development of a city as a whole. The efficiency of the policy implementation depends on the leveraging of resources (financial, intellectual, etc.) from different sources through partnerships. The main criterion of policy effectiveness is the ability of a revitalized urban area to develop sustainably, satisfying the needs of all stakeholders. Indicators of the policy success is not only the living standards and quality of life of the inhabitants, but also the condition of the natural environment, levels of tolerance, trust, empathy, social cohesion, education, happiness, etc.

AB  - The Arctic has warmed significantly over the past decades. However, the evolution of Arctic climate during the Holocene remains to be clarified in more detail, and regional factors controlling aquatic ecosystem evolution need to be better defined to grasp the sensitivity of lakes to rapid environmental change. Nettilling Lake was studied for changes in sedimentary diatom assemblages over the last 5 000 years. Lake water pH was reconstructed by applying a diatom-based lake water pH inference model. We hypothesized that the changes in diatom assemblages were driven by variations in lake water transparency and attendant water turbidity associated with the input of fine suspended solids from glacial meltwaters. Reduced underwater light resulted in greater abundance of planktonic over benthic taxa from ca. 5 000 to 3 000 yrs. cal. BP, followed by less turbid conditions and proliferation of benthic taxa during regional cooling. The lake water was slightly alkaline throughout the Holocene, ranging between pH 7.1 and 7.7. Our results support the notion that hydrological processes, dependent on climate variations, have a first-order influence on the regulation of the lake water pH through glacial meltwater inputs, which will likely continue to control the lake's long-term chemical and biological evolution.

AB  - In China, developing industries based on the regional resource endowment is an important approach to increase GDP in many regions in the past few decades. However, the extensive development pattern results in excessive consumption of natural resources and severe environmental pollution. Therefore, the concept of eco-industry and the theory of system engineering are combined and applied in this study. A new interactive inference method to construct industrial ecosystems is proposed. Firstly, a node information database is set up, and a.material group is established according to the resource endowments in the selected region, and the construction rules are defined, such as the termination conditions. Then the structure of the ecosystem is obtained by an interactive inference process between the node information database and all possible combinations in the material group. After the supplement and elimination of nodes, an industrial ecosystem containing 34 nodes is obtained in a certain western region in China. After the industrial ecosystem constructed, a mathematical model is established to optimize the industrial ecosystem, and four aspects of objective functions, including resource efficiency, economic profit, environmental effect and comprehensive benefit, are optimized. After that, four scenarios are analyzed, and the indexes in each scenario are analyzed comparatively. Policy implications for China are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whole sediment toxicity tests play an important role in environmental risk assessment of organic chemicals. It is not clear, however, to what extent changing microbial community composition and associated functions affect sediment test results. We assessed the development of bacterial communities in artificial sediment during a 28 day bioaccumulation test with polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorpyrifos, and four marine benthic invertebrates. DGGE and 454-pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes were used to characterize bacterial community composition. Abundance of total bacteria and selected genes encoding enzymes involved in important microbially mediated ecosystem functions were measured by qPCR Community composition and diversity responded most to the time course of the experiment, whereas organic matter (OM) content showed a low but significant effect on community composition, biodiversity and two functional genes tested. Moreover, OM content had a higher influence on bacterial community composition than invertebrate species. Medium OM content led to the highest gene abundance and is preferred for standard testing. Our results also indicated that a pre-equilibration period is essential for growth and stabilization of the bacterial community. The observed changes in microbial community composition and functional gene abundance may imply actual changes in such functions during tests, with consequences for exposure and toxicity assessment.

AB  - CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in deep geological formations is one option currently evaluated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, the impact of a possible CO2 leakage from a storage site into surface environments has to be evaluated. During such a hypothetical leakage event, the CO2 migrates upwards along fractures entering surface soils, a scenario similar to naturally occurring CO2 vents. Therefore, such a natural analogue site at the Laacher See was chosen for an ecosystem study on the effects of high CO2 concentrations on soil chemistry and microbiology. The microbial activities revealed differences in their spatial distribution and temporal variability for CO2-rich and reference soils. Furthermore, the abundance of several functional and group-specific gene markers revealed further differences, for example, a decrease in Geobacteraceae and an increase in sulphate-reducing prokaryotes in the vent centre. Molecularbiological fingerprinting of the microbial communities with DGGE indicated a shift in the environmental conditions within the Laacher See soil column leading to anaerobic and potentially acidic microenvironments. Furthermore, the distribution and phylogenetic affiliation of the archaeal 16S rRNA genes, the presence of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea and the biomarker analysis revealed a predominance of Thaumarchaeota as possible indicator organisms for elevated CO2 concentrations in soils.

AB  - Environmental policy and legislation pursuing the protection of marine ecosystems have commonly considered pollutant content in abiotic matrices. Nevertheless, this approach does not describe the eventual effects on living organisms. The aim of this study was to couple two monitoring tools for environmental diagnostics: the chemical tool, metal concentrations in hard-bottom sediments; and the ecological tool, observations of invertebrate communities inhabiting Lessonia trabeculata holdfasts. The study was conducted during austral summer, in central Chile, in a subtidal ecosystem threatened by a sewage outfall, and was compared with a nearby control zone. Environmental assessment was conducted at three different sites with distances ranging from the outfall to 60m (there was similar site disposal in control zone). Metal levels in sediments were highest in the site closest to the outfall, decreasing with distance, and were also low in control sites. Changes found in community taxonomic diversity were consistent with the presence of the outfall, especially at 30m away. The subtidal ecosystem was polluted. It is important to incorporate these multi-and interdisciplinary approaches to environmental research and legislation in order to obtain information that represents effects at different timescales, improves field logistics and truthfully characterises environmental conditions.

AB  - Ecosystems and underlying biodiversity frequently ensure sustained welfare by reducing the risk associated with detrimental biological agents. This attribute is commonly termed biological control, but its valuation is usually underrepresented in the ecosystem services literature. In our study, a unique valuation method is applied, based on the natural insurance value of biological control and its contribution to expected welfare, evaluating its importance in mitigating ecosystem users' welfare loss under uncertain conditions. The study tests the feasibility of a conceptual valuation model using the Mediterranean Sea as a case study by assessing the properties of indigenous species to mitigate the impact of invasive species. The results show that varying the levels of indigenous ecosystem components governs the probability of potential welfare loss and its associated value to ecosystem users. While an increase in indigenous biomass levels results in an increase in the total value of biological control, positive values of insurance are achieved only at a certain biomass level, from which the welfare uncertainty of ecosystem users is gradually reduced. Below such levels, the ecosystem component responsible for mitigating risk does not supply any insurance values, as it increases the certainty of low welfare for ecosystem users.

AB  - Soil represents an important pool of biodiversity, hosting about a quarter of the living species on our planet. This soil richness has led to increasing interest in the structural and functional characteristics of its biodiversity. Studies of arthropod responses, in terms of abundance and taxon richness, have increased in relation to their ecological value as bioindicators of environmental change. This research was carried out over the 2014-2018 period with the aim to better understand arthropod taxa responses in vineyard soils in Franciacorta (Lombardy, Italy). To determine the biological composition in terms of arthropod taxa presence, one hundred soil samples were analysed. Environmental characteristics, such as chemical composition, soil moisture and temperature, and soil management were characterized for each soil sample. A total of 19 taxa were identified; the NMDS model analysis and the cluster analysis divided them into five groups according to their co-occurrence patterns. Each group was related to certain abiotic conditions; of these, soil moisture, temperature and organic matter were shown to be significant. A decision tree analysis showed that a longer period since conversion from conventional to organic farming lead to a higher arthropod biodiversity defined as a higher number of taxa.

AB  - Cultural eutrophication, the process by which pollution due to human activity speeds up natural eutrophication, is a widespread and consequential issue. Here, we present the 85-year history of a small, initially Lobelia-Isoetes dominated lake. The lake's ecological deterioration was intensified by water pumping station activities when it received replenishment water for more than 10 years from a eutrophic lake through a pipe. In this study, we performed a paleolimnological assessment to determine how the lake's ecosystem functioning changed over time. A multi-proxy (pollen, Cladocera, diatoms, and Chironomidae) approach was applied alongside a quantitative reconstruction of total phosphorus using diatom and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen with chironomid-based transfer functions. The results of the biotic proxy were supplemented with a geochemical analysis. The results demonstrated significant changes in the lake community's structure, its sediment composition, and its redox conditions due to increased eutrophication, water level fluctuations, and erosion. The additional nutrient load, particularly phosphorus, increased the abundance of planktonic eutrophic-hypereutrophic diatoms, the lake water's transparency decreased, and hypolimnetic anoxia occurred. Cladocera, Chironomidae, and diatoms species indicated a community shift towards eutrophy, while the low trophy species were suppressed or disappeared.

AB  - Water quality monitoring (WQM) is crucial for managing and protecting riverine ecosystems. Current WQM network design practices often rely on unsubstantiated criteria rather than accountable algorithms. Water managers face difficulties to relate the impact of local boundary conditions on the choice of appropriate WQM network design methods. After reviewing the commonly used design methods and their resulting monitoring setups, it was evident that multivariate statistical analysis is the most frequently used method for designing WQM networks in rivers. The majority of studies reported in the literature were conducted on very large rivers and originated from high- to middle-income countries. Most commonly monitored water quality parameters cover the general physicochemical characteristics and organic pollutants, without considering the ecological quality of the river. In most studies, decision on sampling frequencies depended on expert's judgements. Data availability and expertise seem to affect the selection of design methods rather than river size and the extent of the monitoring networks. Findings from this study support that future research should simultaneously consider all relevant aspects at watershed scale and focus more on biological indicators. In addition, comparative studies with several design methods could also help identify better selection principles.

AB  - Bacterial communities play a central role in ecosystems, by regulating biogeochemical fluxes. Therefore, understanding how multiple functional interactions between species face environmental perturbations is a major concern in conservation biology. Because bacteria can use several strategies, including horizontal gene transfers (HGT), to cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions, potential decoupling between function and taxonomy makes the use of a given species as a general bioindicator problematic. The present work is a first step to characterize the impact of a recent polymetallic gradient over the taxonomical networks of five lacustrine bacterial communities. Given that evolutionary convergence represents one of the best illustration of natural selection, we focused on a system composed of two pairs of impacted and clean lakes in order to test whether similar perturbation exerts a comparable impact on the taxonomical networks of independent bacterial communities. First, we showed that similar environmental stress drove parallel structural changes at the taxonomic level on two independent bacterial communities. Second, we showed that a long-term exposure to contaminant gradients drove significant taxonomic structure changes within three interconnected bacterial communities. Thus, this model lake system is relevant to characterize the strategies, namely acclimation and/or adaptation, of bacterial communities facing environmental perturbations, such as metal contamination.

AB  - Addressing environmental problems in estuaries is a worldwide problem. Establishing benchmarks and targets for management is critical, whether the aim is conservation, restoration or sustainable use. Palaeoecological techniques have rapidly improved during the past decade, particularly with advances in methods that allow high resolution quantitative assessments of environmental change. Palaeoecology is a useful tool in environmental management as it allows pre-impact conditions, the rate, extent, direction and cause of change, and range of natural variability to be determined. Australian estuarine ecosystems are qualitatively different from the often more well-studied estuaries in North America and Europe, which means site-specific studies of Australian estuaries are needed to inform management. While a potentially useful and valuable tool, palaeoecological techniques have not yet been widely adopted and practically implemented as part of estuarine management strategies and policy frameworks in Australia. We discuss the role palaeoecological techniques have to play in estuarine management by providing two case studies undertaken in Australia that have provided management information. We aim to encourage communication and dialogue between scientists and environmental managers about the potential for widespread practical adoption and implementation of palaeoecological techniques into Australian estuarine science, management and policy frameworks.

AB  - Energy derived from leaf litter decomposition fuels food webs in forested streams. However, the natural spatial variability of the decomposition rate of leaf litter and the relative contributions of its drivers are poorly known at the local scale. This study aims to determine the natural in-stream variability of leaf litter decomposition rates in successive riffles and to quantify the factors involved in this key ecosystem process at the local scale. Experiments were conducted on six successive riffles in nine streams in north-western France to monitor the decomposition rate in fine (microbial decomposition, kf) and coarse (total decomposition, kc) mesh bags. We recorded 30 +/- 2% (mean +/- S.E.) variation in kc among riffles and 43 +/- 4% among streams. kf variability was 15 +/- 1% among riffles and 20 +/- 3% among streams. However, in-stream variability was higher than between-stream variability in four of the nine streams. Streambed roughness was negatively related to decomposition and was the most important factor for both total and microbial decomposition. Our study shows that the natural variability of the decomposition rate resulting from the local morphological conditions of habitats could be very important and should be taken into consideration in studies using leaf litter assays as a bio-indicator of anthropogenic impacts in streams.

AB  - This study provides the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in waters of the Yangtze River basin, China, as well as the correlation of CA activity with HCO3- concentration and CO2 sink flux. Different degrees of CA activity could be detected in almost all of the water samples from different geological eco-environments in all four seasons. The CA activity of water samples from karst areas was significantly higher than from non-karst areas (PP3(-) concentration (r = 0.672, P2 sink flux (r = 0.602, P = 0.076) in karst areas. This suggests that CA in waters might have a promoting effect on carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2 in karst river basins. In conditions of similar geological type, higher CA activity was generally detected in water samples taken from areas that exhibited better eco-environments, implying that the CA activity index of waters could be used as an indicator for monitoring ecological environments and protection of river basins. These findings suggest that the role of CA in waters in the karst carbon sink potential of river basins is worthy of further in-depth studies.

AB  - The present study evaluated mutagenic and genotoxic effects and metal accumulation in the liver and musculature of Pterygoplichthys ambrosetti and Prochilodus lineatus in the Amambai River, a tributary of the Upper Parana River in Brazil. We also evaluated the potential for these fish species as environmental bioindicators and performed risk assessment for conservation purposes. We found that P. ambrosetti had a higher frequency of micronuclei compared to P. lineatus (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between species in other erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) (p > 0.05). For both species, the liver contained a higher concentration of metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Ni) than the musculature did (p < 0.0001). Of the two species, P. ambrosetti was more suitable to evaluate mutagenic and genotoxic effects and metal accumulation in the liver and musculature, likely due to its resident behavior; hence, we highlight the potential of this species for use as an environmental bioindicator. The concentrations of non-essential metals observed in the fish confirm conditions of environmental stress in the Amambai River, possibly related to the discharge of pollutants and exacerbated by lack of native vegetation cover along the watercourse.

AB  - Phytoplankton constitutes a diverse array of short-lived organisms which derive their nutrients from the water column of lakes. These features make this community the most direct and earliest indicator of the impacts of changing nutrient conditions on lake ecosystems. It also makes them particularly suitable for measuring the success of restoration measures following reductions in nutrient loads. This paper integrates a large volume of work on a number of measures, or metrics, developed for using phytoplankton to assess the ecological status of European lakes, as required for the Water Framework Directive. It assesses the indicator strength of these metrics, specifically in relation to representing the impacts of eutrophication. It also examines how these measures vary naturally at different locations within a lake, as well as between lakes, and how much variability is associated with different replicate samples, different months within a year and between years. On the basis of this analysis, three of the strongest metrics (chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton trophic index (PTI), and cyanobacterial biovolume) are recommended for use as robust measures for assessing the ecological quality of lakes in relation to nutrient-enrichment pressures and a minimum recommended sampling frequency is provided for these three metrics.

AB  - Carex aquatilis could be a suitable species for wetland reclamation in mined boreal landscapes as those of the oil sands industry (Northern Alberta). We compared the performance of C. aquatilis plants established in oil sands industrial wetlands (directly affected by processed materials), on-site indirectly affected wetlands, and off-site natural wetlands. We studied leaf chemistry, fluorescence, gas exchange rates (net photosynthesis and transpiration rates), and morphological features of plants. Despite higher photochemistry efficiency in oil sands populations, plants did not channelize surplus energy into increased carbon assimilation rates. Oil sands populations registered lower culm heights and leaf lengths than natural populations. Plants growing in industrial wetlands were shorter and accumulated more sodium in leaves than plants from indirectly affected wetlands. Evidence indicated that C. aquatilis was a promising species for reclamation as it was tolerant to pollution. Though it survived, C. aquatilis, showed a restricted growth in the oil sands wetlands thereby possibly limiting carbon assimilation at the stand level. Oil sands wetlands amended with freshwater and established over non-industrial materials provided better growing conditions for C. aquatilis and demonstrated management tools for local reclamation efforts.

AB  - One of the most urgent priorities in the conservation and management of biodiversity in Europe is the assessment of landscape conservation conditions, as well as the analysis of landscape changes. Europe is characterised by the heterogeneous nature of its cultural landscapes. We approached the monitoring and management of habitats and landscapes in the European Atlantic Biogeographical Region at landscape level, using a new methodology which integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, environmental variables and landscape ecology. The analysis focuses on the biosphere reserve known as Terras do Mino (NW Iberian Peninsula) using two main criteria: a classification scheme based on the pan-European system EUNIS (European Nature Information System) and ecologically meaningful units of analysis, and the assessment of landscape change based on landscape indicators and conservation criteria. Spatial indices, contagion, fractal dimension and dominance, reveal a fragmentation process, occurring at sub-regional level. This process has mainly affected forests and scrublands in the area under study. Our results show the traditional landscape is declining and there is a drop in the habitats of greatest environmental interest. The methodological approach proposed in this paper will facilitate comparative analyses with those changes that may occur in other natural regions within Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study presents the hybridization of global sensitivity analysis with data-driven techniques to evaluate the Mexican electricity market interaction and assess the impact of individual parameters concerning locational marginal prices. The study case pertains to Yucatan, Mexico's electricity grid and market characteristics. A comparison of three artificial intelligence techniques in the electricity market is presented to forecast electricity prices in real-time market conditions. The study contemplates exogenous input parameters classified as regional, operational, meteorological, and economic indicators. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to the model with the best performance of the Artificial Intelligence techniques. The results showed that the impact of the variables fluctuates according to market and consumption conditions. In this study, the most relevant variables were electricity generation (17.06%), fossil fuel costs (natural gas 12.54% and diesel 8.63%), load zone (11.17%), and the day of the year (8.51%). From the qualitative point of view, the complex behavior of the parameters was analyzed; moreover, the quantitative results weighted the relevance of the variables in the Locational Marginal Prices. The meteorological and economic parameters allow assessing the environment where it interacts and serves as an instrument for decision-making in the planning of the energy sector. The presented methodology can be implemented as an alternative tool for market participants to analyze electricity prices.

AB  - Macroalgal fouling communities are potentially useful as bioindicators in environmental monitoring as they are considered to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and the use of artificial substrata facilitates the implementation of standardized sampling strategies. The response of macroalgal fouling communities on buoys to changes in water quality was investigated with a view to the possible utilization of these assemblages in environmental monitoring programmes. Seven study sites were selected based on previously collected environmental data and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to order sites according to beam attenuation coefficient (BAC) and concentration of dissolved nitrates and phosphates, relative to a minimally impacted reference site. At each site, all fouling macroalgae were collected from 10 buoys of standard shape and size, and were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Species composition and species dominance were highly variable among impacted sites, indicating that qualitative aspects of community structure may not be useful as indicators of changes in water quality. However, higher levels of nutrient enrichment and turbidity were associated with lower macroalgal species richness, lower overall abundances, and decreased diversities, and therefore these quantitative aspects of community structure are potentially useful as indicators of environmental change. Intermediate levels of turbidity and nutrient enrichment were associated with lower evenness, but did not influence species richness, suggesting that macroalgal abundances respond to changes in environmental conditions before species replacement occurs.

AB  - Chemosensory active volatile organic compounds occur in the breathing air at many workplaces and it has been assumed that they are potent to impair workers' cognitive performance: however, the nature of this relationship is not understood. In the current study we investigated whether the combination of strong chemosensory potency and unpleasant odor valence is a sufficient predictor for the appearance of neurobehavioral impairment. Human volunteers were exposed to three workplace-relevant concentrations of the malodorant cyclohexylamine: 0.3 (odor control condition), 0-4 (varying condition), and 10 ppm (occupational exposure limit value, OEL, Sweden & Germany). The highest exposure evoked strong chemosensory sensations (annoyance), rather much olfactory related symptoms (bad air, stink), and increase in eye-blink frequency, which can be interpreted as indicator of trigeminal mediated adversity. Neurobehavioral performance measures (reaction times, accuracy) from three visual tasks requiring attention, motor inhibition and cognitive control did not show impairment in a consistent, dose-response related way and thus could not be related to cyclohexylamine exposure. Odorant characteristics of intensity and unpleasantness seem not sufficient to predict neurobehavioral impairment. Instead factors like participant selection bias, personality factors as well as effects related to the study design are discussed as contributing factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess soil fertility or quality three controlling components - its physical, chemical and biological nature - have to be considered. In this study a broad spectrum of agricultural soils from Sweden were cropped with ryegrass in pots under standardized conditions in climate chambers. Measurements of physical, chemical and biological attributes of soil were used to predict C and N yields by simple correlation and the multivariate calibration techniques, principal component analysis combined with multiple linear regression, and partial least squares (PLS) regression. The N yields were typically more accurately predicted than the corresponding C yields. The best single predictor of yields was always total soil N, but estimates produced by multivariate models including organic C, total N, C/N ratio, coarse silt, potential denitrification activity, N mineralization. substrate-induced respiration and sample site humidity were, in all cases, substantially more accurate. Coefficients of correlation bet it een predicted and measured C or N yields ranged between 0.61 and 0.80 with total N as predictor, and between 0.69 and 0.97 with the multivariate models. Both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the organic matter were considered to be important with respect to the predictive ability. Both these aspects were accounted for by the multivariate models. The multivariate technique, PLS regression, facilitated the classification of soils into categories of good, normal or poor fertility in relation to their organic matter content.

AB  - It is difficult to plan restoration projects or study the amount of disturbance in aquatic ecosystems if background conditions are not known. Zooplankton, especially cladocerans (water fleas), has proven highly useful as a reliable indicator of environmental change. Cladocerans preserve well in sediments and thus allow for the analysis of historical communities. To assess the stability of cladoceran communities in lakes with low human impact, we compared pre-industrial and modern cladoceran assemblages (top-bottom analysis) in 32 sub-Arctic lakes in NW Finnish Lapland. We used a dataset of measured environmental variables to determine their explanatory power on cladoceran assemblages. While cladoceran assemblages at the community level have remained relatively stable between the pre-industrial and modern samples, a clear change at the genus level was observed with a significant proportional increase in Bosmina (Eubosmina) spp. (Wilcoxon signed-rank test z = 2.75 p = 0.006). The amount of organic matter in the sediment [measured as loss on ignition (LOI)] explained the largest proportion of the variation in the cladoceran community. Since LOI is strongly correlated to climatic factors, the increased abundance of B. (Eubosmina) spp. may ultimately be related to climate warming. As the top-bottom approach is comprised of two temporal snapshots, it cannot provide the exact time of community change. This shortcoming is of special importance for restoration and management planning.

AB  - The inner Tagus estuary is essentially a sedimentation basin that receives cohesive sediment from terrestrial, marine, biological and anthropogenic sources. Three short cores from one site in a marsh area of this estuary (Seixal Bay) were analysed for sedimentary, geochemical and micropalaeontological contents (benthic foraminifera and nannoplankton). The length of the cores represents about half a millennium of sedimentation. Textural analysis suggests a highly uniform mud sedimentation for most of the cores but geochemical, mineralogical and micropaleontological results indicate climatic and environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbance. Three Foraminifera zones were identified. The lower part of the lower zone indicates sedimentation in an open channel or a lower domain of an exposed high-energy sandflat. Sediments of the upper part of the lower zone and of the middle zone were deposited in a lower-energy environment, probably associated with a sheltered, vertically aggrading mudflat located within the Seixal Bay. Biological and mineralogical indicators suggest that periods of total or partial closure of this bay occurred. Clay minerals indicate that drier and colder conditions prevailed in the lower half of this zone evolving gradually to a wetter and warmer environment towards the top. The upper zone indicates persistence of low-energy sedimentation and evolution towards the present salt-marsh conditions. Anthropogenic pollution is clear in geochemical proxies at the top of the sedimentary column and was used for dating purposes.

AB  - Wetlands provide many essential ecosystem services for human well-being. The ecological assessment of wetland ecosystem services is problematic and thus is an important focus in the field of ecological research. In this study, an ecological assessment system containing the ecosystem product value, ecosystem regulation service value, and ecosystem cultural service value was established to calculate the gross ecosystem product in the Nansi Lake Wetland, China. Based on remote sensing images, field studies, and literature reviews, the gross ecosystem product was estimated for the years 1985, 1992, 2005, 2011, and 2017. The results showed that the gross ecosystem product of the Nansi Lake Wetland increased from 40.91 x 10(8) USD in 1985 to 46.28 x 10(8) USD in 2017. The gross ecosystem product of the altered wetlands increased by about 8.5 times with a rising linear relationship, while natural wetlands presented a nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, except for the changes in climatic condition, anthropogenic interference factors such as coal mining activities, farming practices, and government policies have promoted significant services in the Nansi Lake Wetland over the past 30 years. This study could provide important insight into the ecological assessment of wetland ecosystems and thus inform policy for the protection and better use of wetland resources.

AB  - Single-trait analyses are used to select the most appropriate species characteristics for an effective indication of changes in multiple stressors, but they are robust to detect fine-scale functional changes in biofilms. The combination of single traits may appropriately reflect ecological properties of changing benthic assemblages. We studied colonisation processes of benthic algal assemblages focusing on the changes in trait composition using life forms, type of attachments, cell size and mobility as single traits in a small lowland stream. We tested the descriptive power of single-trait groups (STGs) and also combined trait groups (CTGs). We assumed that STGs would be significantly affected by environmental factors, but compositional changes in biofilms would be described more easily by using CTGs rather than STGs. Our hypotheses were confirmed by the results. While some STGs correlated positively to environmental factors indicating disturbances, others correlated to environmental factors indicating the stable conditions. The fast settlement of large-sized groups was also relevant determining the compositional changes in the studied benthic community. Despite the strong correlation between STGs and environmental variables, CTGs analyses revealed important functional relations in the ecosystem, since CTGs display more sophisticated functional features of the organisms, which may provide more realistic responses.

AB  - As an important composition component of river ecosystems, river habitats must undergo quality assessment to potentially provide scientific basis for river ecological restoration. Substrate composition, habitat complexity, bank erosion degree, river meandering degree, human activity intensity, vegetation buffer width, water quality, and water condition were determined as indicators for river habitat assessment. The comprehensive habitat quality index (CHQI) was established for the Wei River Basin. In addition, the indicator values were determined on the basis of a field investigation at 12 national hydrological stations distributed across the Wei, Jing, and Beiluo Rivers. The analytic hierarchy process was used to determine the indicator weights and thus distinguish the relative importance of the assessment indicator system. Results indicated that the average CHQIs for the Wei, Jing, and Beiluo Rivers were 0.417, 0.508, and 0.304, respectively. The river habitat quality for the three rivers was well. As for the whole river basin, the river habitat quality for 25% of the cross section was very well, the other 25% was well, and the 50% remaining was in critical state. The river habitat quality of the Jing River was better than that of the Wei and Beiluo Rivers.

AB  - Diatoms recovered from archaeological features on a Viking Age farmstead excavation in the Mosfell Valley in southwestern Iceland are utilized as microscopic indicators of turf-based structures. Eroded turf can be difficult to distinguish macroscopically from naturally occurring sediments because turf foundations erode and melt into the landscape over time, leaving minimal evidence of site use. Turf was a principle building component in Iceland until the early 20th century. Turf strips and blocks were harvested from lowlands where organically rich peat and abundant water contributed to the development of bog plants with thick root mats that produced premium turf. Diatoms embedded in turf reflect the ecological conditions of the peat-bog at the time of deposition. Turf was cut from the bog and transported to higher elevations where drainage was more conducive to house construction. Siliceous diatom frustules are resistant to decay and preserve well archaeologically. The presence of diatoms in archaeological sediments is considered a marker of sediment provenience and an indication of human site use and anthropogenic modification of natural substrates. This paper demonstrates how diatom analysis can determine the presence and delimitation of archaeological features otherwise difficult to distinguish with the naked eye. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - CHANGES IN THE PELAGIC CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON OF HIGH-BOREAL ISLAND LAKE, SASKATCHEWAN, ASSOCIATED WITH URANIUM MINING
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Island Lake, Saskatchewan, has become eutrophic, subsaline (salinity between 0.5 and 3.0 g l(-1)) and contaminated with several metals over the last decade. In this study, the crustacean zooplankton community in the lake in early summer 1989 is compared to the community during the early summers of the baseline years 1978 and 1979, based on archived environmental impact assessment samples. Community composition has changed, probably because of salinization and perhaps, to a lesser extent, eutrophication. Calanoid copepods have disappeared, while the numbers of species of cyclopoid copepods and cladocerans have increased. Ceriodaphnia reticulata, present in 1988 only, was more numerous than any other species during all three years. Densities of all other species were very low in 1989, which has led to lower diversity (Simpsons Index). Predation by Chaoborus probably contributed to the low abundances in 1989. The characteristics of the zooplankton community in 1989 were very similar to those of zooplankton in culturally acidified lakes, and indicate that Island Lake is in poor health. The success of Ceriodaphnia, a standard toxicity bioassay genus, is noteworthy under such contaminated conditions. While the taxonomic changes are obvious, the zooplankton data are limited; therefore causes can only be inferred. The study demonstrates the need for more and better ecosystem-specific biological information in order to do environmental impact assessments, in this case for mining in the north.

AB  - Lakes of the Andean paramo are critical water reservoirs for millions of people. Paramo ecosystems have experienced anthropogenic warming faster than the global average. Recent paleolimnological work from Cajas National Park (southern Ecuador) revealed striking shifts in diatoms and Cladocera linked to climate change. However, the impacts on shallow lakes (< 5 m deep), which are numerically dominant on the landscape, remain poorly understood. Here, we use paleolimnology to investigate cladoceran species changes and responses to climate change in three shallow waterbodies from Cajas. Each system supported abundant littoral Cladocera. The deepest site (similar to 4 m) contained the highest proportion of pelagic taxa, while the shallowest (similar to 0.3 m) contained almost exclusively littoral taxa. Cladoceran assemblages in these shallow lakes reflect littoral habitat, likely partly influenced by shifting precipitation, and in one site, construction of a small rock dam. The cladoceran assemblage shifts do not align with regional temperature increases and reduced wind speeds, contrasting the ecological responses previously recorded in nearby deeper lakes. Although these polymictic, ice-free shallow systems are not immune to climate-related change, algal and cladoceran assemblages in nearby deeper lakes are responding earlier and more sensitively to recent climate changes, largely through changes to lake thermal stratification regimes.

AB  - Conventional banana cultivation in Costa Rica relies on heavy pesticide use. While pesticide residues in exported bananas do not generally represent a safety concern for consumers abroad, ecosystem and human health in producing regions are not likewise protected. In Costa Rica, most studies on pesticide residues in the environment are snapshots, limiting our ability to identify temporal dynamics that can inform risk mitigation strategies. To help bridge this gap, we created a dynamic multimedia model for the Cano Azul River drainage area, which is heavily influenced by banana and pineapple plantations. This model estimates chemical concentrations in water, air, soil, sediments, and banana plants through time, based on pesticide properties and emission patterns and on variable environmental conditions. Case studies for three representative chemicals-the herbicide diuron, the nematicide ethoprofos, and the fungicide epoxiconazole-show that concentrations in fruit remain below EU and US maximum residue limits set to ensure consumer health, while those in the environment are highly variable, reaching peak concentrations in water that can exceed thresholds for ecosystem health. Critical research needs, including incorporating sediment dynamics and the effects of adjuvants on the properties and transport of active ingredients into multimedia models, were identified.

AB  - Research on toxicant-responsive genes is providing new and important bioindicators for environmental biologists. Identifying genes whose expression is modulated by toxicant exposure provides important clues into the mechanisms underlying toxicity. In addition, toxicant-responsive genes can be developed as molecular end points that are likely to be sensitive tools for environmental assessment. Differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a useful approach for screening and analyzing the expression of genes. A ddPCR protocol was optimized to investigate gene expression in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The modified protocol requires submicrogram quantities of total RNA (from <10 animals) and utilizes a sensitive fluorescent tagging system. By reverse-transcribing total RNA with arbitrary 18-nucleoticle primers and PCR-amplifying the cDNA using the same arbitrary primers under low-stringency conditions, reproducible and consistent ddPCR profiles were generated. Minimal variability was introduced by reaction differences or biological variability. A trial stress (starvation) was found to generate modest differences in the ddPCR profiles. This technique promises to significantly advance knowledge regarding gene expression during toxicant insult. Furthermore, this represents the first step in the development of a novel gene fingerprinting technique that can be applied to any compound and organism of interest. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change poses a significant threat to Texas' coastal habitats and in the Galveston Bay region, there is just under 1200 square miles of freshwater marsh and undeveloped dry upland. These habitats provide residents with a variety of key ecosystem services but are threatened by global climate change. Effective management of these resources requires multidisciplinary knowledge, combining an understanding of the potential biophysical habitat alterations associated with sea level rise with the measurement of residents' value for coastal resources. In this study, we utilize a discrete choice experiment to investigate individuals' preferences for future conditions of Texas habitats within the Galveston Bay region. Utilizing modeled output for coverage of freshwater marsh and undeveloped dry upland in the year 2050, respondents are asked to make trade-offs between coastal conditions with no further management actions and outcomes associated with specific management interventions. From this framework, we estimate Galveston Bay regional residents' value for freshwater marshes and undeveloped uplands. Our results indicate that individuals are willing to conserve habitat under threat from sea level rise, but that they are likely unaware of the dynamic nature of that change. As a result, residents may place less emphasis on the role of the habitat migration in response to sea level rise.

AB  - Human activities can generate a wide variety of direct and indirect effects on animals, which can manifest as environmental and genetic stressors. Several phenotypic markers have been proposed as indicators of these stressful conditions but have displayed contrasting results, depending, among others, on the phenotypic trait measured. Knowing the worldwide decline of multiple bumblebee species, it is important to understand these stressors and link them with the drivers of decline. We assessed the impact of several stressors (i.e. natural toxin-, parasite-, thermic- and inbreeding-stress) on both wing shape and size and their variability as well as their directional and fluctuating asymmetries. The total data set includes 650 individuals of Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Overall wing size and shape were affected by all the tested stressors. Except for the sinigrin (e.g. glucosinolate) stress, each stress implies a decrease of wing size. Size variance was affected by several stressors, contrary to shape variance that was affected by none of them. Although wing size directional and fluctuating asymmetries were significantly affected by sinigrin, parasites and high temperatures, neither directional nor fluctuating shape asymmetry was significantly affected by any tested stressor. Parasites and high temperatures led to the strongest phenotype modifications. Overall size and shape were the most sensitive morphological traits, which contrasts with the common view that fluctuating asymmetry is the major phenotypic marker of stress.

AB  - High-resolution palaeolimnological analysis was implemented on a sediment core from Lough Muckno, a historically polluted inter-drumlin lake located in northeast Ireland. Focusing on chironomid and fossil pollen analyses, catchment conditions and human impacts on the lake environment during the last c. 200 years are identified and characterized. Chironomid community response to historical land-use change, reconstructed through a combination of pollen analysis and documentary evidence is evaluated in detail. The results provide insights into lake ecological conditions from a meso-eutrophic state in a nineteenth century agricultural setting to a highly eutrophic system in a landscape under modern pastoral management. Increasing livestock numbers and concomitant land fertilization are considered to be the main drivers affecting chironomid assemblages. Redundancy analysis indicates that grassland-based agriculture, inferred from Poaceae (grasses), the dominant component of palynological pastoral indicators, was the main variable controlling chironomid community composition. Lake resilience to nutrient abatement is reflected in a limited chironomid response to declining agricultural activity during the Great Irish Famine (c. 1846) and attempts at point and non-point pollution controls. Integrated interpretation of chironomid, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs is shown to be a powerful tool for assessing the impacts of modern land-use change on lake ecology through time.

AB  - Seabird abundance is an important indicator for assessing impact of human activities on the marine environment. However, data collection at sea is time consuming and surveys are carried out over several consecutive days for efficiency reasons. This study investigates the validity of aggregating those data over time to estimate a spatial variogram that is representative for spatial correlation in species abundance. For this purpose we simulate four-day surveys of seabird count data that contain spatial and temporal correlation arising from temporal changes in the spatial pattern of environmental conditions. Estimates of the aggregated spatial variogram are compared to a variogram that would arise when data were collected over a single day. The study reveals that, under changing environmental conditions over surveys days, aggregating data over a four-day survey increases both the non-spatial variation in the data and the scale of spatial correlation in seabird data. Next, the effect of using an aggregated variogram on the statistical power to test the significance of an impact is investigated. The impact concerns a case of establishing an offshore wind farm resulting in seabird displacement. The study shows that both overestimation and underestimation of statistical power occurs, with power estimates differing up to a factor of two. We conclude that the spatial variation in seabird abundance can be misrepresented by using temporally aggregated data. In impact studies, such misrepresentation can lead to erroneous assessments of the ability to detect impact.

AB  - Aim This paper aims to project areas of olive cultivation into future scenarios. Accordingly, we first asked the question whether global circulation models (GCMs) are able to reproduce past climatic conditions and we used historical ranges of olive cultivation as a palaeoclimate proxy. Location The Mediterranean basin. Methods We used an ecological model, calibrated and validated for modern times, to test the reliability of a general circulation model (NCAR-CSM GCM) in reproducing past ranges of olive tree cultivation inferred from the literature, archaeo-botanical investigations and fossil pollen analyses. Results The re-constructions of olive growing areas, obtained for the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 1200-1300 AD) and the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1600-1700 AD) by coupling the outputs of NCAR-CSM to the ecological model, were in agreement to those observed. Simulations of olive growing areas for future time-windows showed that a northwards expansion of the species is expected to occur by 2100. Main conclusions These results demonstrate that the NCAR-CSM can provide an accurate reconstruction of past climate with results sensitive to climate forcing factors and thus, it is more likely to give reliable projections for the future. Additionally, the warming and drying conditions expected in the coming decades may determine changes across the Mediterranean basin that is unprecedented.

AB  - Eutrophication in marine ecosystems is an important problem that requires an accurate assessment. Although Basque estuaries (northern Spain) have historically been under high anthropogenic pressure, no specific eutrophication assessment method had been applied in these waters. In this study, a method employed in the Basque Country (BC) to assess the "risk of failing to achieve good ecological status" under the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adapted to exclusively assess the risk of eutrophication. This method is based on the driver-pressure-state-impact-response approach. The results from this method (called WFD-BC method) were compared to the results from Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS; a specific method developed in the US to assess estuarine trophic status in a pressure-state-response approach). The nutrient pressure was better characterized with the WFD-BC method due to the local hydrographic conditions (i.e., small and river-influenced estuaries) that were not well accommodated by the ASSETS method. In contrast, the WFD-BC results for assessment of state generally reflected worse conditions than the results from the ASSETS method due to the different indicators employed and the way these are integrated in the WFD-BC method. Overall, the WFD-BC method showed a good potential to assess eutrophication. However, to improve it, a lower weight for the benthos and macroalgae is recommended for evaluating state.

AB  - Wind energy is among the fastest-growing renewable energy source. Although not as controversial as fossil fuel-based energy projects, wind energy projects can be contested. Understanding common environmental assessment issues surrounding wind energy projects is important for addressing the transaction costs for renewable energy projects. This research examined 16 environmental assessments (EAs) for wind energy projects in Western Canada to identify the recurring issues and concerns raised by government reviewers, project interveners, and other affected interests. Fifty different issues were identified. Although variability existed among the number and diversity of issues by jurisdiction and by project, depending on location and size, concerns about land use, impacts on human well-being, impacts on natural ecosystems, and economic opportunity, represented nearly 80% of all issues and concerns. The majority of issues reflect project-specific impacts and concerns, but many issues including impacts to other land tenure holders or licensees (such as other utilities and industries) are issues that are beyond the scope and scale of what can be resolved at the time wind energy projects are proposed. Understanding and addressing recurrent issues and concerns and shifting the bigger issues to the planning and strategic process, are important conditions for the energy transition.

AB  - In this paper, systematic studies on the changes in concentrations of the environmental factors and the net-phytoplankton community, and the relationship between them in the Liaodong Bay, Bohai Sea during 2013 are presented. The PCA results showed that higher levels of nutrients and dissolved heavy metals in the river-estuary-bay system were closely related to the river runoff. Since the influences of industrial and anthropogenic activities, the Liaodong Bay coastal areas are facing a huge environmental challenge of nutrients and heavy metal pollution. Net-phytoplankton community structure showed obvious seasonal succession, among which the dominant and (or) key species were the main factors affecting community structure change and stability. Under certain environmental conditions, the dominant species and (or) key species dominated the phytoplankton community structure succession. The Bio-ENV results suggested that the seawater temperature, nutrient, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd in Liaodong Bay are important environmental variables that affect the phytoplankton community structure. Anthropogenic activities have significantly contributed to the changes in concentrations of environmental factors and the net-phytoplankton community structure and stability, and the relationship between them.

AB  - The article is devoted to substantiation of the forecast scenarios of development of the internal consumer organic products market in Ukraine. The essence of organic agriculture as a complete system and management of agro-ecosystems, including the assessment of environmental threats and risks of environmental safety in the agricultural sector, and establishes the relationship between economic actors in the agricultural organic production. The current state and trends of the main indicators of organic agriculture development in Ukraine are analyzed. Taking into account probable economic changes and possible variants of the transformation of market conditions, we have grounded three basic adaptation scenarios for the development of domestic organic agriculture for the future: inertial, moderate and innovative. The prognostic model of indices of the internal consumer market of organic produce is suggested, which provides for their modeling based on multiple regression. The study of trends and the calculation of predictive values of independent variables of the model for the near future are based on the extrapolation method. Based on the model data of organic farming, a forecast of the internal consumer market in this area for the period up to 2022 has been made. The use of the proposed model will enable the formation of credible prospect balances of demand and supply on the organic market, depending on the factors of influence and scenarios of its development.

AB  - Several lines of evidence show that climatic variation and global warming can have a major effect on fisheries production and replenishment. To prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks under changing and uncertain environmental conditions, new research partnerships between fisheries scientists and climate change experts are required. The International Workshop on Climate and Oceanic Fisheries held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, 3-5 October 2011, brought representatives from these disciplines together to consider the effects of climate variability and change on oceanic fisheries, the tools and strategies required for identifying potential impacts on oceanic fisheries, and the priority adaptations for sustaining future harvests, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Recommendations made by the workshop included (1) development and implementation of sustainable management measures for fisheries; (2) long-term commitment to monitoring necessary to assess stock status and to conduct integrated ecosystem assessments; (3) process oriented research to evaluate the potential of marine species for adaptation to a changing ocean environment; (4) provision of improved national meteorological and hydrological services to fisheries agencies, enterprises and communities; (5) continuing communication of potential impacts and adaptation strategies to stakeholders to reduce the threats to oceanic fisheries and capitalise on opportunities; and (6) continued collaborative efforts between meteorological, oceanographic, biological and fisheries researchers and management agencies to better monitor and understand the impacts of short-term variability and longer-term change on oceanic fisheries.

AB  - Bioindicators are biological systems which can be used to indicate the presence of certain elements. The basis of indication are the changes that occur either in their metabolism or in phenotype of the organisms due to the uptake and accumulation of these elements. The threat of environmental pollution due to enhanced availability of both essential and toxic metals is a matter of great concern. Application of any remedial measure requires proper assessment of the contaminated sample. We used a multimetal-resistant organism, Pseudomonas stutzeri RS34, to indicate the presence of Cu2+ and Co2+, in solution as well as in an industrial effluent. Metal resistance mechanism in this organism is based on biosorption and strain RS34 showed preferential adsorption for Cu2+. This accumulation imparted green colour to the biomass in a concentration-dependent manner (2.0 ppm and higher concentration). The colour is seen even in bimetal or multimetal conditions, where Co2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ were present along with Cu2+ and is also observed in an effluent. Co2+ could also be detected by the biomass acquiring a characteristic pink colour. We thus propose that strain RS34 can be employed as bioindicator of certain metals simply based on appearance of colour. This method is not only economical, but also quick and easy to operate.

AB  - Agriculture, mainly biogenic compounds (nitrogen and phosphorus) and plant protection products are one of the sources of environmental pollution. The sources of pollution are both farm buildings and intensively used agricultural land. Therefore, a crucial element of the environment contributing to the improvement of surface water quality are the aforementioned shallow reservoirs covered by vegetation that act as biofiltres or reservoirs such as dammed reservoirs. The analysed reservoir is located in the Greater Poland Province, about 25 km to the north from Poznan, in Murowana Goslina commune. The research on the analysed reservoir was conducted during the growing seasons, from 2016 to 2018, at three measurement and control points: at the Przebedowo reservoir inflow, it the Przebedowo reservoir and at the Przebedowo reservoir outflow. They included determining 4 groups of physico-chemical indicators supporting biological elements, including indicators characterising aerobic conditions, salinity, acidification (pH) and indicators characterising biogenic conditions. Based on the conducted research, a great influence of the reservoir was proven, especially in the context of the concentration of dissolved oxygen at the outflow, where, concerning this indicator, the reservoir was classified as water quality class I. The presented research results also confirmed that in the context of the complexity of hydrological and physico-chemical processes taking place in dammed reservoirs, it is necessary to continuously control them both in terms of water quantity and quality.

AB  - In nature conservation, providing new, advanced knowledge of protected habitats and biota often requires extensive sampling, which contradicts the main goal of minimizing damage and disturbance. How to avoid this innate collision was the main concern in our study. Highland habitats are suitable for addressing this problem, since they are relatively species-poor and therefore easier to analyze. Invertebrate distributions are, to some extent, expected to vary congruently with habitat type (HT) distributions. However, studies of such effects are scarce. In this study we researched harvestmen (Opiliones) in highland habitats above 1,800 m in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, a Natura 2000 area in Slovenia. The question was whether mapping of HT distributions could predict the presence of the harvestman species and replace their laborious mapping. For this purpose, we studied relationships between the HT distributions and the harvestman species distributions with respect to environmental conditions. Chao2 and Jackknife1 were found to provide the best estimates of total species diversity. In assessing the species richness, the incidence-based approach was applied. No indicator harvestman species for the HTs, and no statistical difference was found in the harvestman community structure of three most frequently inhabited HTs. Most HTs and harvestman species responded gradually and in parallel to the changing environmental conditions along the altitudinal gradient, revealing covariation of their distributions. Hence, knowledge of highland HT distributions cannot replace the mapping of harvestmen.

AB  - The objective of this study is the analysis of damaging frost events in agriculture, by examining the relationship between the daily minimum temperature in the lower atmosphere ( at an isobaric level of 850 hPa) and crop production losses. Furthermore, the study suggests a methodological approach for estimating agriculture risk due to frost events, with the aim of estimating the short-term probability and magnitude of frost-related financial losses for different levels of 850 hPa temperature. Compared with near-surface temperature forecasts, temperature forecasts at the level of 850 hPa are less influenced by varying weather conditions or by local topographical features; thus, they constitute a more consistent indicator of the forthcoming weather conditions.
   The analysis of the daily monetary compensations for insured crop losses caused by weather events in Greece shows that, during the period 1999-2011, frost caused more damage to crop production than any other meteorological phenomenon. Two regions of different geographical latitudes are examined further, to account for the differences in the temperature ranges developed within their ecological environment. Using a series of linear and logistic regressions, we found that minimum temperature (at an 850 hPa level), grouped into three categories according to its magnitude, and seasonality, are significant variables when trying to explain crop damage costs, as well as to predict and quantify the likelihood and magnitude of damaging frost events.

AB  - Although dispersal is often considered to be a plastic, condition-dependent trait with low heritability, growing evidence supports medium to high levels of dispersal heritability. Obtaining unbiased estimates of dispersal heritability in natural populations nevertheless remains crucial to understand the evolution of dispersal strategies and their population consequences. Here we show that dispersal propensity (i.e. the probability of dispersal between habitat patches) displays a significant heritability in the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, as estimated by within-family resemblance when accounting for environmental factors. Offspring of dispersing mothers or fathers had a higher propensity to disperse to a new habitat patch themselves. The effect of parental dispersal status was additional to that of local habitat quality, as measured by local breeding population size and success, confirming previous results about condition-dependent dispersal in this population. The estimated levels of heritability varied between 0.30+/-0.07 and 0.47+/-0.10, depending on parent-offspring comparisons made and correcting for a significant assortative mating with respect to dispersal status. Siblings also displayed a significant resemblance in dispersal propensity. These results suggest that variation in between-patch natal dispersal in the collared flycatcher is partly genetically determined, and we discuss ways to quantify this genetic basis and its implications.

AB  - Nannoplankton abundance data has revealed significant and systematic population fluxes through all representative lithologies and cycle types of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF), and also through intervals in which lithology is visually homogeneous. The majority of KCF samples yielded nannofossil assemblages of low species richness (1 to 10) and marked unevenness, independent of preservational state. All samples were dominated by coccoliths of one family, the Watznaueriaceae. While assemblage unevenness is characteristic of nannofossil populations, such low species richness is atypical, particularly when compared with coeval assemblages of similar latitude. Such anomalously low nannofossil diversity may be explained as a response to nutrient-rich euphotic environments. We postulate that consistently high trophic conditions supported the eurytopic watznaueriaceans but excluded most normal open-ocean taxa. The switching of dominance within this group most likely reflects different adaptations within an r-selected ecological strategy, related to nutrient concentration. Lowest diversities were recorded in mudstone/oil-shale lithologies where Watznaueria britannica is the dominant species, suggesting adaptation to the highest nutrient concentrations. Watznaueria barnesiae/fossacincta is particularly dominant in coccolith stone bands, where diversity is slightly higher, suggesting adaptation to lower high nutrient levels. Cyclagelosphaera margerelii appears to be the most extremely r-selected species, exploiting unusual (very high trophic/lowered sea-level?) conditions that excluded even W. britannica.

AB  - In an effort to understand the relationship between surface water processes and seafloor sediment characteristics in the Southern California Bight, opal concentrations, organic carbon weight percent measurements, diatom abundances and assemblages, and living benthic foraminiferal abundances were examined in surface sediments from two sites along the continental margin of Southern California. Although opal and organic carbon weight percentages in the top 1 cm of surface sediments reflect spatial changes in productivity between sites, our results indicate that they are not sensitive indicators of seasonal changes in surface water productivity at either site. The close correspondence between seasonal diatom flux in the adjacent Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), abundances of diatoms indicative of upwelling conditions, and opportunistic benthic foraminifera indicate that there is a rapid, (weeks to months) opportunistic response of the benthic species, Nonionella fragilis, to input from changes in surface water characteristics. These results highlight the close association of surface water conditions and preservable microfauna and flora, and confirm the influence of surface characteristics on seafloor ecosystems in bathyal environments on the California margin, Additional information on these associations will further improve our ability to discern seasonal and spatial changes in paleoproductivity from the geologic record.

AB  - We report results of noncellular tests, revealing the occurrence of photocatalytic interactions between titanium dioxide (TiO2, titania) nanoparticles and the MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide] cytotoxicity indicator. These interactions induce the reduction of MTT and formation of purple formazan under biologically relevant conditions. Classical MU assays have been performed to evaluate the production of formazan in DMEM-F12 and RPMI-1640 cell culture media (containing 10% fetal bovine serum-FBS) treated with Degussa-P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, in the absence of cells. The colorimetric determinations revealed the noncellular MU to formazan transformation induced by TiO2 nanoparticles, under conditions commonly used for in vitro cytotoxicity testing of nanomaterials. The formazan precipitation was found to be proportional to the TiO2 concentration, being enhanced under laboratory daylight exposure. The photocatalytic nature of the studied effect was assessed under UV irradiation at 365 nm. The biological significance of the reported reaction was established with respect to cellular reference experiments performed on V79-4, HeLa and B16 cell lines. The results show false viability increases with up to 14% (for TiO2 concentrations generally higher than 50 mu g/ml), induced by the TiO2-MTT reaction. This type of artifacts may lead to underestimated toxicity or false proliferation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study uses the interpretation of paleosol features at Kanapoi, Kenya (4.2-3.4Ma) to reconstruct the ecosystem occupied by Australopithecus anamensis. The paleosols at Kanapoi provide a unique and fortuitous opportunity, in that the bulk of the hominid specimens derive from paleosols, providing direct evidence of the environment that the Kanapoi hominids occupied. Seven named types of paleosols are recognized at Kanapoi, each representing a trace fossil of the local ecosystem during soil formation. The hominid-bearing Dire paleosols provide evidence that A. anamensis inhabited areas of semi-arid, seasonal climate regimes with mean annual precipitation ranging from about 350-600 mm. The in situ hominid collections from Dire paleosols show that A. anamensis at least occasionally occupied relatively open low tree-shrub savanna vegetation formed in well drained settings, and may have preferred these conditions over other poorly drained soils. The relatively open conditions of Dite paleosols existed within a spatially variable ecosystem, characterized by a mosaic of environments, ranging from forb-dominated edaphic grassland to gallery woodland, providing a larger view of the mixed ecosystem in which A. anamensis lived. Synthesis of paleoenvironmental indicators of A. anamensis at Kanapoi and Allia Bay, Kenya suggests that as early as 4 Ma hominids thrived in varied ecosystems. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY

CP  - Summer Symposium on E Coli in the Food Industry
KW  - COLIFORMS
KW  - BACTERIA
AB  - Public health protection requires an indicator of fecal pollution. It is not necessary to analyse drinking water for all pathogens. Escherichia coli is found in all mammal faeces at concentrations of 10 log 9(-1), but it does not multiply appreciably in the environment. In the 1890s, it was chosen as the biological indicator of water treatment safety. Because of method deficiencies, E. coli surrogates such as the 'fecal coliform' and total coliforms tests were developed and became part of drinking water regulations. With the advent of the Defined Substrate Technology in the late 1980s, it became possible to analyse drinking water directly for E. coli (and, simultaneously, total coliforms) inexpensively and simply. Accordingly, E. coli was re-inserted in the drinking water regulations. E. roll survives in drinking water for between 4 and 12 weeks, depending on environmental conditions (temperature, microflora, etc.). Bacteria and viruses are approximately equally oxidant-sensitive, but parasites are less so. Under the conditions in distribution systems, E. coli will be much more long-lived. Therefore, under most circumstances it is possible to design a monitoring program that permits public health protection at a modest cost. Drinking water regulations currently require infrequent monitoring which may nor adequately detect intermittent contamination events; however, it is cost-effective to markedly increase testing with E. coli to better protect the public's health. Comparison with other practical candidate fecal indicators shows that E. coli is far superior overall.

AB  - Soil erosion by water is one of the main environmental problems of mountainous Mediterranean agriculture. The Common Agricultural Policy in the EU attempts to favor soil conservation through regulations of cross-compliance, which should establish good agrarian and environmental conditions of land (GAEC) adapted to the environment where they ate applied. The objective of this study was to assess the potential capacity to establish GAEC adapted to olive groves (Olea europaea) in mountainous areas, in southern Spain, through a method of soil erosion analysis that uses visual indicators. The hypothesis was that the analysis method did adapt to the conditions of the study zone and to the objectives of establishing GAEC. The study was carried out in 36 plots of 15 olive plantations with the same soil characteristics and in systems of ecological and conventional cultivation, with conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT). The ecological cultivation system with no-tillage was the most effective to reduce erosion, with 23.19 % of the surface affected compared to the conventional and ecological productive systems with tillage, with rates higher than 80 %. Tillage or its absence and the plant coverage were the most statistically significant erodibility factors, with goodness of fit of 0.90 in the regression equation, from which the GAEC adapted to the study area were established.

AB  - Estuarine marshes are known as suitable nursery areas for many marine migrant fishes, such as flounder. The potential nursery value of such habitats was investigated in the Venice lagoon, by using growth and production of 0-group flounder as indicators. Size-frequency distribution analysis was performed on fish samples collected fortnightly, from March 2004 to June 2005, in two marsh sites, Dese and Tessera, differing in their origin and environmental conditions. Samples were mostly composed of juvenile individuals, belonging to 0- and 1-group cohorts (the latter being present in Tessera only). A higher total production, either annual or monthly, and faster growth of 0-group flounder was observed in Dese, associated to a higher ecological performance of 0-group individuals in this site, as indicated by the higher P:B ratio values. Dese is a site located in a marsh complex characterized by the relevant influence of a nearby river, and the observed higher potential nursery value of this marsh area with respect to the other is discussed in the light of the higher trophic status and other environmental conditions in this site. The production results were also compared to those from other estuarine environments commonly acknowledged as important nurseries for European flounder. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A crayfish is a pivotal aquatic organism that serves both as a practical biological model for behavioral and physiological studies of invertebrates and as a useful biological indicator of water quality. Even though crayfish cannot directly specify the substances that cause water quality deterioration, they can immediately (within a few seconds) warn humans of water quality deterioration via acute changes in their cardiac and behavioral activities.
   In this study, we present a noninvasive method that is simple enough to be implemented under various conditions due to a combination of simplicity and reliability in one model.
   This approach, in which the biological organisms are implemented into environmental evaluation processes, provides a reliable and timely alarm for warning of and preventing acute water deterioration in an ambient environment. Therefore, this noninvasive system based on crayfish physiological and ethological parameter recordings was investigated for the detection of changes in an aquatic environment. This system is now applied at a local brewery for controlling quality of the water used for beverage production, but it can be used at any water treatment and supply facility for continuous, real-time water quality evaluation and for regular laboratory investigations of crayfish cardiac physiology and behavior.

AB  - The potential use of antioxidant system parameters has gained considerable interest due to their pivotal role of detoxification mechanisms in environmental studies and culture fish point of view. Fish with different ecological needs may have different antioxidant capacity and response to environmental contaminants. Thus, the optimal working conditions and specific enzyme activities (V-max and K-m) of antioxidant system parameters (Superoxide dismutase, SOD; Catalase, CAT; Glutathione peroxidase, GPX; Glutathione reductase, GR and Glutathione S-transferase, GST) and glutathione (GSH) were determined in four commonly cultured freshwater fish species (tilapia; Oreochromis niloticus, carp; Cyprinus carpio, trout; Onchorhynchus mykiss and catfish; Clarias garipienus). Data showed that optimal concentrations of different buffers, pH and specific chemicals for each enzyme and GSH were similar in most cases for all fish species, except a few differences. The highest Vmax and Km values were found in carp for GPX and GST, though these values were the highest in tilapia, catfish and trout for CAT, SOD and GR, respectively. As a conclusion, optimization assays of these parameters in different bioindicator organisms based on their physiological and ecological differences may be useful for the aquatic ecosystem biomonitoring studies and also present fundamental data for utilization in aquaculture.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to detect the alterations of Pseudoplatystoma corruscans parasite infracommunity structure, after the construction of the Porto Primavera dam on the high Parana River floodplain. The execution of this research was based on 119 host specimens collected between March 2011 and September 2012, and the results were compared to studies performed on periods before the reservoir's construction, when 110 fishes were collected between March 1992 and February 1993. Five parasite species still remain on the environment, despite the environmental modifications: Choanoscolex abscissus, Spasskyelina spinulifera, Nomimoscolex pertierrae, Harriscolex kaparari and Contracaecum sp 2. The Berger-Parker dominance index, calculated to the parasite fauna of 1992, did not show the dominance of any species, while, on the present days, this same index accused the dominance of Nomimoscolex pertierrae (49%) and Choanoscolex abscissus (50%). The present study reports the disappearance of Megathylacus travassosi, Contracaecum sp. 1, Contracaecum sp. 3, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. and Cucullanus pseudoplatystomae, suggesting the possibility of a local extinction or a host switch of these species. It has also been registered an Acanthocephala specimen, a genus not observed on this host yet. The results here presented show that the antropic influences on natural systems alter the environmental conditions, what is reflected on the richness and diversity parasite levels.

AB  - Research indicates that natural resources managed in common, resembling traditional commons such as the Swedish forest commons, could be a type of regime with the potential to stimulate successfully sustainable use conditions. This is supported by findings regarding the characteristics of Swedish forest commons, their claimed concern for the environment and relatively high proportion of old forest in two out of three regions. Swedish environmental policy is directed towards environmental quality objectives and the Sustainable Forests objective states, among other things, that biological diversity must be maintained and enhanced. Swedish National Forest Inventory data for the period 2003-2006 were used to analyse differences between forest commons in northern Sweden and other ownership categories regarding the proportion of forestland with a large deciduous element, the proportion of forest older than 80 years with a large (> 25%) deciduous element, the volume of dead wood and the proportion of forest older than 140 years, parameters corresponding to the interim targets for enhanced biological diversity. The results show no consistent differences in indicator variables between the forest commons and other ownership categories, signifying that forests managed in common have been conducted in ways promoting biodiversity more effectively than in other ownership categories. Further studies of different ownership categories regarding driving forces and forest status are warranted.

AB  - Evidence-based responses to climate change by society require operational and sustained information including biophysical indicator systems that provide up-to-date measures of trends and patterns against historical baselines. Two key components linking anthropogenic climate change to impacts on socio-ecological systems are the periodic inter- and intra-annual variations in physical climate systems (seasonality) and in plant and animal life cycles (phenology). We describe a set of national indicators that reflect sub-seasonal to seasonal drivers and responses of terrestrial physical and biological systems to climate change and variability at the national scale. Proposed indicators and metrics include seasonality of surface climate conditions (e.g., frost and freeze dates and durations), seasonality of freeze/thaw in freshwater systems (e.g., timing of stream runoff and durations of lake/river ice), seasonality in ecosystem disturbances (e.g., wildfire season timing and duration), seasonality in vegetated land surfaces (e.g., green-up and brown-down of landscapes), and seasonality of organismal life-history stages (e.g., timings of bird migration). Recommended indicators have strong linkages to variable and changing climates, include abiotic and biotic responses and feedback mechanisms, and are sufficiently simple to facilitate communication to broad audiences and stakeholders interested in understanding and adapting to climate change.

AB  - Epiphytic (tree inhabiting) lichens, well-known biomonitors of atmospheric pollution, have a great potential for being used in environmental forensics. Monitoring changes in biodiversity is a useful method for evaluating the quality of an ecosystem. Lichen species occurring within an area show measurable responses to environmental changes, and lichen biodiversity counts can be taken as reliable estimates of environmental quality, with high values corresponding to unpolluted or low polluted conditions and low values to polluted ones. Lichen diversity studies may be very useful in the framework of environmental forensics, since they may highlight the biological effects of pollutants and constitute the base for epidemiological studies. It is thus of paramount importance that great care is taken in the interpretation of the results, especially in the context of a rapidly changing environment and facing global change scenarios. For this reason, it seems advisable to produce several zonal maps, each based on different species groups, and each interpreted in a different way. This exercise could also be a valid support in the framework of a sensitivity analysis, to support or reject the primary results. In addition, a clear and formal expression of the overall uncertainty of the outputs is absolutely necessary.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are key microbes in topsoil communities that have important roles in preventing soil erosion, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and influencing soil hydrology. However, little is known regarding the identity and distribution of the microbial components in the photosynthetic assemblages that form a cohesive biological soil crust (biocrust) in drylands of Europe. In this study, we investigated the cyanobacterial species colonizing biocrusts in three representative dryland ecosystems from the most arid region in Europe (SE Spain) that are characterized by different soil conditions. Isolated cyanobacterial cultures were identified by a polyphasic approach, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, phylogenetic relationship determination, and morphological and ecological habitat assessments. Three well-differentiated groups were identified: heterocystous-cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune, Nostoc calicola, Tolypothrix distorta and Scytonema hyalinum), which play an important role in N and C cycling in soil; nonheterocystous bundle-forming cyanobacteria (Microcoleus steenstrupii, Trichocoleus desertorum, and Schizothrix cf. calcicola); and narrow filamentous cyanobacteria (Leptolyngbya frigida and Oculatella kazantipica), all of which are essential genera for initial biocrust formation. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of cyanobacterial species composition in biocrusts from important and understudied European habitats, such as the Mediterranean Basin, a hotspot of biodiversity, where these species are keystone pioneer organisms.

AB  - The Klisova lagoon aquatic system belongs to the wetland of Messolonghi - Aetoliko - Klisova Lagoon Complex, located in the western Greece and represents one of the most important Mediterranean lagoon systems, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients definition, TOC, TN and bacteriological indicators (E.coli and Enterococcus spp.) were analyzed in a time period of 1 year monthly monitoring in five sampling sites along the lagoon. The geographical distribution of these parameters show a clear zonation and partition of the lagoon as the result of: (a) the discharging of poorly treated wastes into the lagoon of Mesolonghi city waste water treatment plant and (b) the interplay between sea water influence via the lagoon inlet and the fresh water inflow via lagoon's perimeter channels. The lagoon is characterized by seasonal hypoxic conditions, which are responsible for several ecological socks in the past including fish mortalities. The system is threatened by human interference and sedimentological processes such as the longshore drifting and siltation of the lagoon inlet. Measurements should immediately be taken in order to prevent further downgrading of the water quality.

AB  - Sustainable water management (SWM) requires allocating between competing water sector demands, and balancing the financial and social resources required to support necessary water systems. The objective of this review is to assess SWM in three sectors: urban, agricultural, and natural systems. This review explores the following questions: (1) How is SWM defined and evaluated? (2) What are the challenges associated with sustainable development in each sector? (3) What are the areas of greatest potential improvement in urban and agricultural water management systems? And (4) What role does country development status have in SWM practices? The methods for evaluating water management practices range from relatively simple indicator methods to integration of multiple models, depending on the complexity of the problem and resources of the investigators. The two key findings and recommendations for meeting SWM objectives are: (1) all forms of water must be considered usable, and reusable, water resources; and (2) increasing agricultural crop water production represents the largest opportunity for reducing total water consumption, and will be required to meet global food security needs. The level of regional development should not dictate sustainability objectives, however local infrastructure conditions and financial capabilities should inform the details of water system design and evaluation.

AB  - Our ann was to ascertain whether changes in plant species richness and other vegetation features occur in heathland dominated by Erica scoparia L. (besom heath) through the impact of cattle grazing and oak colonization. Our study took place in the Brenne Regional Natural Park (center of France) where this cricaceous species, locally called 'brande', is now considered of patrimonial interest and protected at regional and European level. We selected 10 sites in a private property, covering I wide range of ecological conditions (shallow and deep soils, grazed and non-grazed besom heath, pure and oak-colonized besom heath). Vegetation (percent Occupancy of plant species) wits sampled in May-June 2006 (105 samples, lm(2) each) and the impact of shrub and tree vegetation on plant biodiversity was assessed by correspondence analysis (CA) and total and partial Mantel tests (Monte-Carlo procedure). An environmental gradient of decreasing light incidence from grazed heath to old heath to oak-wood was depicted, along which a number of ecological, morphological and physiological plant traits (growth habits, Ellenberg values, Grime strategies, Tolerance Index of the plant community) were observed to vary. Species richness decreases when cricaceous or, although to a lesser extent, oak cover increases and it increases under low to moderate cattle grazing. Consequences for the sustainable management of 'brande' are discussed.

AB  - The mussel, Brachidontes variabilis, and the limpet, Patella sp., were used as indicators to monitor cadmium, lead and mercury concentrations along the Lebanese coast. Studies were carried out in order to define the best strategy for assessing and minimizing the effects of size and physiological condition on the metal contents of the molluscs, and corrective models were constructed. Metal concentrations in surface water were measured to estimate bioconcentration factors (BCFs). The BCFs varied from 8.3 x 10(3) to 3.4 x 10(4), from 7.5 x 10(3) to 8.0 X 10(3) and from 3.0 x 10(4) to 3.2 x 10(4), for Cd, Pb and Hg, respectively. For limpets, BCFs varied from 1.7 x 10(4) to 7.4 x 10(4) for Cd, from 2.5 x 10(3) to 6 x 103 for Pb and remained fairly constant at around 104 for Hg. The highest BCFs were associated with lowest contamination levels. The results of the geographical survey exhibited a similar large-scale spatial pattern for the two species and followed the metal concentration distributions measured in the waters.

AB  - Transboundary protected areas (PAs) currently represent nearly 10% of the world's network of PAs. The protection of their biological wealth poses special challenges because of the need for cooperation among sovereign states. Adaptive management strategies offer hope for a more accurate assessment of ecological conditions within PAs, and have the potential for furthering one of the major objectives of these PAs, namely enhancing environmental cooperation between countries across whose boundaries the protected area complex is situated. This paper examines the implications of adaptive management for transboundary PAs by using the Polish/Belarusian Bialowieza PAs as a case study. Managers of PAs have conventionally aimed at accurate predictions and short-term system equilibrium through 'top-down' policies of control and exclusion. In the case of PAs, these objectives have meant limiting use and employing models of linear growth. Adaptive management strategies rely instead on long-term experience, assessment of experimental interventions, and collection of greater amounts of information to assess future outcomes. They aim at the satisfaction of objectives that may include equilibrium changes. These features of adaptive management imply attention over time to the interactions between different key species, greater involvement of local populations in the collection of information about the resources, and experimenting with different levels of use to infer the most suitable protection strategies.

AB  - High resolution airborne digital video image data, biomass measurements and spatial statistics were used to map above-ground biomass for the five major semi-arid plant communities in the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site (southern New Mexico). The two principal objectives were to determine: (1) spatial characteristics of arid shrub versus semi-arid grassland vegetation; and (2) a suitable image spatial resolution and ground sampling interval to map above-ground biomass spatial distribution for these vegetation types. The spatial characteristics of each plant community were established by analyzing digital images at varying pixel sizes using semi-variograms. As pixel size increased from 0.5 m to 16 m, little information on vegetation pattern and abundance was lost in grassland and playa grassland sites. In comparison, the pattern and abundance of vegetation became indistinct in shrubland sites once pixel size exceeded mean shrub diameter. This work illustrates the utility of variograms from remotely sensed data for two applications: (1) determining a suitable scale to examine an ecosystem's spatial structure; and (2) providing information on the spatial pattern of vegetation as an indicator of ecosystem condition in the context of a model for desertification.

AB  - Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet however they have undergone progressive environmental changes due to anthropic pressures. Information on phenological behavior can be used as an instrument in the construction of conservation projects of natural resources. The present study was carried out in four estuarine areas in Acarau, Ceara, Brazil, with the aim of analyzing of phenological behavior regarding reproductive components of three mangrove species in different areas subject to different environmental impacts (solid waste, deforestation and shrimp farm effluent) and a low impacted area, during a period of one year. patterns of flowering and fruiting: Fournier Index (percentage of intensity) and the index of activity. The flowering of Avicennia spp. and Rhizophora mangle, under natural conditions, occurred all year round, and it showed irregular patterns. Regarding fruiting, Laguncularia racemosa was the species that presented the highest values for the two phenological indices analyzed. Rainfall and salinity seemed to exert a more selective force when species were subjected to an anthropic impact. The comparative analysis of the different phenological evaluation methods carried out in this study indicated that they provide different and complementary data about the reproductive behavior of the plant and how the impacts to which these environments are subjected may be negatively interfering with the flora of this ecosystem.

AB  - South Brazilian grasslands are at risk due to climate change and activities that convert native vegetation into agricultural lands. We used 12 native palm species as ecological indicators of these ecosystems to evaluate the impact of climate and land-use changes on their geographical distribution. We estimated the potential distribution of species for current and future (year 2050; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) climate and land-use conditions considering two dispersal scenarios. We also assessed the coverage of protected areas (PAs) for current and future species distribution. Our results indicated that the future distribution of all species will decrease under scenarios with no dispersal and increase under scenarios with dispersal; however, a dispersal scenario might be unlikely considering species dispersal ability and the increased pressure on grasslands. A comprehensive strategy is fundamental to ensure species conservation and recovery since the current PAs network covers less than 2% of the current distribution for nine out of the 12 species. Assessing the synergy of trends in climate and land-use changes is essential to improve conservation strategies for these emblematic species.

AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has emerged as a technology capable of generating descriptors of vegetation structure and best available terrain information. Research and operational implementations of ALS data have highlighted their value for characterizing forest structure and generating spatially explicit and objective spatial coverages and mapping products for forest management. Continued emphasis to enhance forest stewardship is promoting novel methods to integrate ALS to detail non-timber ecosystem values like habitat, soil, and water. Standardized criteria and indicator frameworks such as the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers provide a reliable starting point for where ALS has opportunities to characterize ecosystems objectively regardless of location. In this review of primarily Canadian work, we highlight how ALS is becoming an increasingly viable technology for deriving meaningful indicators to meet sustainable forest management criteria. We review and highlight the value of ALS for quantifying indicators of biological diversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil and water, and the role of forests in global ecological cycles. We conclude by highlighting the need for increased education, tech transfer, flexible software, and reporting frameworks alongside five key considerations for using ALS to derive meaningful indicators of sustainable forest management.
