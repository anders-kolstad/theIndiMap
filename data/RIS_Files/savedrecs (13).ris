AB  - Sweet chestnut agroforestry systems make valuable contributions to the landscape and environment, fulfilling fundamental functions and processes. Net primary production (NPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) are commonly used as ecological indicators to evaluate the responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change. Nonetheless, although climate-induced primary production changes have been widely documented at the global scale, few studies have addressed this issue at local scale in relation to sweet chestnut forests. Data from 65 climate maps and MODIS remote-sensed data captured in the Iberian Peninsula between 2000 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Different statistical methods (Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Trees) were used to analyse the potential influence of climate change on sweet chestnut primary production, thus enabling assessment of ecosystem and ecosystem service (ES) supply and of the resilience of these systems in a future scenario of climate change in the Iberian Peninsula. The findings for the whole of the Iberian Peninsula show that NPP and CUE are negatively correlated with temperature variables and positively correlated with latitude. High NPP values mainly corresponded to northern Spain, which is characterised by cold, humid conditions. The CUE values were highest in northern Portugal, mainly in managed, monospecific forest. Overall, the fitted models showed a temporary response in which the monthly variables were particularly important and water availability was more important than temperature. The findings suggest that precipitation is not a limiting factor in Atlantic areas, but that water availability tends to be a limiting factor in Mediterranean areas. However, mean annual temperature (MAT) is also an important driver of sweet chestnut production and may be a limiting factor in a future scenario of climate change. Regions of Provenance (RoP) proved useful for explaining NPP and CUE and classifying the sweet chestnut agroforestry systems. Finally, the study findings also revealed that Iberian sweet chestnut ecosystems and the associated ES supplies are at risk of being seriously affected or even disappearing as a result of climate change, especially in some Mediterranean areas of southern and central Spain.

AB  - The quality of aquatic systems is threated by the huge amount of chemicals dispersed in the environment. Anthropogenic activities are one of the main causes of pollution by metals, water sewage, pesticides, pharmaceutical drugs and other contaminants. These substances have consequences on the environment bringing abiotic and biotic deterioration. Global Climate change (GCC) also affects the dynamics of aquatic communities affecting the toxicity of pollutants by altering their physiochemical properties and the adaptive capacity of organisms. Damages in ecosystems and thus in aquatic communities have consequences in functional and physiological roles, with impacts along the trophic food web and thus, in the food quality. The degradation and loss of the goods and services provided by theses ecosystems affect human population. To safeguard the environmental status, the European Union has implemented the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; 2008/56/EC) legislations, which allow the use of biological tools to detect the quality of aquatic systems. The following review highlights the use of these biological tools to achieve the objective of both legislations that assures the good quality of the aquatic environment. The biological groups most used for the assessment of aquatic systems are: phytoplankton, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish, with several authors also consider zooplankton due to the sensitiveness of this community to stressors, although this group is not identified as a biological quality element (BQE) of WFD. Relying on bioindicators and biomarkers as supporting on chemical analyses, researchers should have a clear overview of environmental conditions. To ensure that biological tools are valid, they must deal with some criteria: they must be cheap and easy to perform; be sensitive to pollutant exposure; be reliable, with a short life span and easy to collect.
   Although bioindicators and biomarkers may be used as early-warning indicators of the presence of stressors, they have limitations in their applications. Thus, should be assessed and identified the most accurate and suitable biomarker to be used as endpoint in ecotoxicological studies and the assessment of the environmental status.

AB  - In the context of an ongoing monitoring study of the Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park (SE of Spain), we explored the use of soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem functioning reflecting changes in ecological processes in semiarid environments. With this purpose, we measured soil CO2 efflux in six different and representative ecosystems of the Natural Park, with different land uses (forest and agricultural sites) and under different soil covers (under plant and bare soil) in two distinctive periods of the year: summer (dry period) and spring (growing season). We also measured the main soil properties and environmental variables. Soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.40 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the dry period to 1.93 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the growing season. Soil CO2 efflux showed a large spatial variability, with different behaviour between the measured periods. Whereas in the dry period differences among ecosystems were larger (CVs 75-80%) than within them (CVs 40-55%), in the growing season the CVs were smaller (40-50%) and no differences were observed between or within ecosystem. The factors controlling soil CO2 efflux also differed in the two measurement occasions. Whereas in the dry period soil CO2 efflux was mainly the result of transport processes in the soil and therefore related to local factors (OC content, CN ratio, clay, rock outcrop, etc.) assigned to ecosystem conditions, in the growing season soil CO2 efflux was dominated by soil CO2 production and thus related only to organic carbon content and plant cover. In the growing season environmental variables explained ca. 10% of the variation in soil CO2 efflux. In order to capture these different processes in different times of the year, i.e., diffusion versus production processes we calculated a new index, normalised seasonal difference in soil respiration (SDSR), which is proposed as a good indicator of the state and functioning of the ecosystem.

AB  - Alaska's North Slope is especially vulnerable to climatic change because higher latitudes are subject to positive snow- and sea ice-atmosphere feedbacks under warming conditions and because the dynamics of frozen seascapes and landscapes are tightly determined by thermal regime. Shifts in timing and magnitude of freeze-thaw processes are observed to have or expected to have non-linear, threshold-crossing impacts on sea ice, landforms, and biota. Observed changes in North Slope surface air temperatures and precipitation were non-monotonic over the last century, but have trended upward for the last several decades. These changes are linked to hemispheric climate dynamics, reflected in North Pacific and Arctic Oscillation circulation indices. Projected anthropogenic climate changes-with the possibility of continued warming, increased storm frequency and intensity, and decreased insulating snow cover-portend an uncertain future for this domain. Current or foreseen physical system shifts include: (1) declining seasonal and permanent sea ice extent and character, (2) rapid coastal erosion due to storm exposure over a longer near-shore ice-free season, (3) deeper soil active layer over warmer permafrost, along with altered thermokarst processes-contributing to thaw lake expansion, surface drainage re-organization, and hillslope instability. Biogeophysical responses encompass (1) modified surface-atmosphere energy balance from snow cover, vegetation, and hydrologic change and (2) shifted soil and wetland biogeochemical dynamics, including accelerated carbon efflux. Climate-driven plant community shifts on the North Slope result from the interplay of climate, vegetation response, and landscape processes. Some transitions involve stabilizing, others destabilizing plant-permafrost feedbacks. Impacts on caribou, migratory avifauna, and freshwater biota are through direct effects of climate on organism physiology and reproductive biology and indirectly through disruption of habitat mosaics (including along migratory routes) and shifts in competition and trophic linkages. The North Slope's physical and biological vulnerabilities to shifting climate and observed leading indicators of change are compelling reasons for land managers to consider climatic instability as a threat in conjunction with other known stressors while seeking strategies for protection of this domain's natural heritage and ecosystem services.

AB  - The results of studying the morphological and biochemical parameters of plants of sea buckthorn are presented. For the first time, genotypes of sea buckthorn ranked by ontogenetic and morphological characteristics and ecological features (relation to the level of soil moisture and humidity air, providing soil nutrients, its.., amount and mode of precipitation, lighting, positive and negative temperatures) natural, semi-natural and anthropic coenopopulations genotypes of sea buckthorn be ranked by ecomorphic affiliation to certain climate ecotypes (polissia, forest-steppe) and subecotypes (western-forest-steppe, northern-forest-steppe, polissia-forest-steppe, central-forest-steppe).
   Biotypes, that have been a limited ability to carry soil and atmospheric drought (in which the root system is well developed, ground part with copious leaf cover), selected in natural and semi-natural places of growth appertain to mesophytes (Ms). The genotypes, selected in catchment areas, the lowlands of Forest-Steppe, Polissia of Ukraine, appertain to mesohygrophytes (MsHg) (by morphological and physiological features characterized by weak drought and heat resistance - 6 points, require sufficient moisture and sufficient provision of organic and mineral substances, are weak frost resistant, but very resistant to temperature changes during the winter). A special group makes up widely ecological flexibility mesophyte plants of sea buckthorn - mesoxerophytes (wfMsKs) - are presented polissia-forest-steppe subecotype, characterized by wide environmental plasticity, due to the high winter, drought and frost resistance, compared to others subecotype. Its have adapted to withstand prolonged of soil and air in the extreme phases of ontogeny, in particular, in the phase of fruit filling and ripening, giving high stable harvest. Particular breeding and economic value in terms of formation stably high yields under conditions of global climate change, its aridization and displacement borders zoning of fruit crops have xeromesophytes (KsMs) presented central forest-steppe subecotype - in view of the its relatively average demanding to soil and air moisture and resistance to moisture deficiency.

AB  - Alternative futures analysis can inform community decisions regarding land and water use. We conducted an alternative futures analysis in the Willamette River Basin in western Oregon. Based on detailed input from local stakeholders, three alternative future landscapes for the year 2050 were created and compared to present-day (circa 1990) and historical (pre-EuroAmerican settlement) landscapes. We evaluated the likely effects of these landscape changes on four endpoints: water availability, Willamette River, stream condition, and terrestrial wildlife. All three futures assume a doubling of the 1990 human population by 2050. The Plan Trend 2050 scenario assumes current policies and trends continue. Because Oregon has several conservation-oriented policies in place, landscape changes and projected environmental effects associated with this scenario were surprisingly small (most less than or equal to10% change relative to 1990). The scenario did, however, engender a debate among stakeholders about the reasonableness of assuming that existing policies would be implemented exactly as written if no further policy actions were taken. The Development 2050 scenario reflects a loosening of current policies, more market-oriented approach, as proposed by some stakeholders. Estimated effects of this scenario include loss of 24% of prime farmland; 39% more wildlife species would lose habitat than gain habitat relative to the 1990 landscape. Projected effects on aquatic biota were less severe, primarily because many of the land use changes involved conversion of agricultural lands into urban or rural development, both of which adversely impact streams. Finally, Conservation 2050 assumes that ecosystem protection and restoration are given higher priority, although still within the bounds of what stakeholders considered plausible. In response, most ecological indicators (both terrestrial and aquatic) recovered 20-70% of the losses sustained since EuroAmerican settlement. The one exception is water availability. Water consumed for out-of-stream uses increased under all three future scenarios (by 40-60%), with accompanying decreases in stream flow. Although the conservation measures incorporated into Conservation 2050 moderated the increase in consumption, they were not sufficient to reverse the trend. Results from these analyses have been actively discussed by stakeholder groups charged with developing a vision for the basin's future and a basin-wide restoration strategy.

AB  - Of late there have been several syntheses that consider the biological effectiveness of fishways. These syntheses emphasize the importance of generating estimates of attraction and passage efficiency, using electronic tagging techniques, as the "gold standard" for determining if a fishway is indeed successful at passing target species upstream to meet ecological, management, and conservation goals. Such an emphasis on efficiency is potentially problematic if estimates of attraction and passage efficiency are biased or otherwise fail to reliably represent the true biological effectiveness of a fishway. Indeed, erroneous estimates could lead to management decisions (in terms of both design criteria and operational decisions) that are costly in terms of economic expenditures and failed conservation outcomes for populations, species and ecosystems. Here we review the factors that are necessary to consider when determining the reliability of efficiency estimates for fishways and provide suggestions for improving such estimates. Clearly there is need for greater attention to the effects of various capture (including gear and the timing and location of capture), handling, and tagging protocols on fish necessary to monitor individual passage success given the potential for procedures to influence organismal condition and behavior. In addition, there is need for more long-term tagging studies (monitoring individuals across multiple seasons), mechanistic studies to understand the biological basis for differences in efficiency estimates, greater use of control studies to account for natural levels of migration failure/behavioral heterogeneity, technical validation of electronic tagging equipment (to account for tag failure and detection efficiency), and the use of approaches that combine individual monitoring with population-level studies (including modeling exercises). Also relevant is the need to better understand the proportion of fish that need to pass a fishway to address ecological, management and conservation targets, as well as identify the proportion of a population that is actually motivated to attempt passage in a given season. Failure to think critically about the factors for a given study/site that have the potential to influence estimates of passage and attraction efficiency will impede the ability of science and monitoring activities to inform fishway design and operation and ultimately improve aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Water-level fluctuations (WLF) in lakes and rivers, especially their extent, frequency and duration, are dominant forces controlling the functioning of these ecosystems. In particular, WLF play an important role in the lake's littoral and aquatic-terrestrial interface processes. WLF may take place on different spatial and temporal scales under natural conditions but water levels have been artificially modified in regulated lakes, and their impacts are expected to be enhanced within the actual global change scenarios with forthcoming management problems. This article presents an overview on the literature published on this important topic since 1991 by using journals indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge. The overall objective was to examine temporal and spatial trends in publications on WLF, the specific aspect of WLF concerned and their main effects. Throughout the article we have used case studies to illustrate different effects of WLF on the variety of lake habitats and indicators that have been studied. Overall, the number of papers published on the subject since the 1990s has risen steadily, when less than ten papers were published each year; until 2006 and peaking in 2005. The greatest number of papers on WLF has been carried out in Europe and North America (c. 73%). These data also showed that the effects of WLF have not been studied equally for different groups of organisms. There is a greater interest on macrophytes, which are the most studied group of organisms (18.4% of the papers). Nearly 7% of the papers deal with algae, and zooplankton and invertebrates account for a 7% followed by fish. WLF effects on ecosystems are very complex, and the biological effects in lakes are greatest in shallow water and littoral areas, where even small changes in water levels can result in the conversion of large areas of a standing-water environment in air exposed habitats. Finally, these data might serve to highlight knowledge gaps still existing on this topic and, in particular, some of the approaches that can potentially contribute to solve several of these lacunae are explored.

AB  - Background. The pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (L.), is one of 23 introduced fish species in Bulgarian fresh-waters. With this study we attempt to contribute to clarifying the factors that effect pumpkinseed abundance and demographic structure in water bodies differing in macro-and microhabitat parameters.
   Materials and methods. Fish were collected during the breeding period of pumpkinseed (May-June 2010) by minnow traps arranged in 31 sites in the littoral zone of 13 fresh water bodies (former-and active sand-pit lakes, reservoirs, adaptive ponds of refineries). Demographic structure (length and age) and abundance (Catch Per Unit Effort; CPUEN; fish per trap per hour) of pumpkinseeds from different sites were compared to provide information about ecological requirements of this species.
   Results. L. gibbosus dominated at 24 sites and comprised 86.7% of all fish caught. The mean pumpkinseed abundance was 6.35 +/- 7.2 fish per trap per hour (mean +/- SD). Pumpkinseeds were most numerous in the littoral zones of the former sand-pit lakes, where pumpkinseed's CPUEN achieved values of 20 fish per trap per hour. Water body use had a significant effect on pumpkinseed abundance and the statistical analyses revealed that the littoral zones in the active sand-pit lakes were characterized by the lowest number of pumpkinseeds than the other types. Microhabitat parameters such as silt and sand bottom substrate also significantly affected pumpkinseeds abundance, size, and age, while gravel significantly affected body length but not abundance and age. Aquatic vegetation also had a significant impact on the abundance and at sites with dense vegetation pumpkinseeds were more abundant than at the sites with sparse vegetation. At the sites where piscivore fish occurred, the mean length and mean age of pumpkinseed were lower.
   Conclusion. Human activities facilitate establishment of the pumpkinseed population, mainly by extending suitable breeding places for pumpkinseed and eliminating its natural competitors and predators. Some parameters as sand or silt bottoms in littoral area and dense submerged vegetation may use as indicator of suitable conditions for pumpkinseed.

AB  - European settlement of New England brought about a novel disturbance regime that impacted rivers and estuaries through over. shing, deforestation, dams, and water pollution. The negative consequences of these activities intensified with industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries, often resulting in ecosystem degradation. Since environmental legislation was implemented in the 1970s, improvement in water quality has been tangible and widespread; however, ecological recovery can require substantial amounts of time and may never be complete. To document the natural baseline conditions and investigate the recovery of a severely degraded river-estuary complex in mid-coast Maine, we examined diatoms, pollen, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, stable isotopes, total phosphorus, biogenic silica, and trace metals in intertidal sediments and established a chronology with C-14, Pb-210, and indicator pollen horizons. Both climate variability and human effects were evident in the sedimentary record of Merrymeeting Bay, the freshwater tidal portion of the Kennebec estuary. Natural climate variability was apparent in an episode of high sedimentation and altered diatom abundance during the 12th and 13th centuries and in changing pollen abundances between the 16th and 19th centuries, indicative of regional cooling. During the 18th century, colonial land clearance began an era of high sedimentation and eutrophication that strongly intensified with industrialization during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Improvements in water quality over the past 30 years in response to environmental regulation had little effect on ecosystem recovery as represented by the sedimentary record. Diatom composition and productivity and high fluxes of organic C, total P, and biogenic Si in recent sediments indicate that rates of nutrient loading remain high. These environmental proxies imply that aquatic productivity in Merrymeeting Bay was originally nutrient limited and water clarity high, relative to today. Further recovery may require more stringent regulation of nutrient inputs from industrial and municipal point sources. This historical study can contribute to public debate about the environmental management of this unusual river estuary complex by describing its long-term natural baseline, thereby illustrating the upper limit of its potential for recovery.

AB  - Cold-water coral ecosystems building cold-water carbonate mounds occur worldwide and are especially developed along the European margin, from northern Norway to the Gulf of Cadiz. A remarkable mound province is documented southwest of Ireland along the Porcupine and Rockall Banks. In this area carbonate mounds are formed in water depths between 500 and 1200 m and are often densely settled by cold-water coral ecosystems offering many ecological niches for benthic foraminifera. We investigated total (unstained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages from surface sediments (0-1 cm, > 63 mu m size fraction) of this region with the aim to trace their distribution patterns and to test if they can be used as bioindicators for facies characterization in different parts of carbonate mound systems. Our quantitative data were further statistically treated with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) based on Bray-Curtis similarity matrix to highlight community patterns that were not readily apparent. Our results indicate that different benthic foraminiferal assemblages characterize different facies along coldwater carbonate mounds and are related to the environmental conditions and available substrates. The following facies can be described: (1) the Off-Mound Facies is dominated by uvigerinids and other infaunal species; (2) the Dropstone Facies is characterized by infaunal Globocassidulina subglobosa and attached-epifaunal Cibicidoides sp.; (3) the Dead Coral Facies is characterised by epifaunal species (e.g., Planulina ariminensis, Hanzawaia boueana) and infaunal species (Spiroplectinella wrightii, Angulogerina angulosa, Epistominella vitrea); (4) the Living Coral Facies includes both infaunal and epifaunal species, but is dominated by the epifaunal Discanomalina coronata; and (5) the Sandwave Facies contains high abundances of epifaunal species including D. coronata. Based on this distribution, we propose D. coronata, as an indicator species to identify active mounds and/or living cold-water coral ecosystems. Our results also emphasise the importance of studying the small size fractions that yield many infaunal species. A causal link exists between distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera and coldwater coral facies, thus providing an independent tool to identify and describe the different facies in this setting.

AB  - Oil sands development in the lower Athabasca River watershed has raised considerable public and scientific concerns regarding perceived effects on environmental health. To address this issue for tributaries and the mainstem of the Athabasca River in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, the Water Component of the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM) plan produced monitoring assessments for seven integrated themes: atmospheric deposition, tributary water quality, river mainstem water quality, groundwater quality and quantity, water quality and quantity modelling, benthic invertebrate condition, and fish health. Our review integrates and synthesizes the large and diverse datasets assembled in the seven JOSM theme assessments to (i) evaluate possible environmental effects based on known sources and candidate proximal causes and (ii) determine the importance of cause-and-effect pathways related to contaminant, sediment, and nutrient inputs. Although JOSM research identified ecological effects that appear to be associated with contaminant exposure, the source of this exposure is confounded by co-location of, and inability to differentiate between, oil sands operations (principally released by atmospheric emission) and inputs from the natural bitumen outcrops (e.g., erosional material transported by surface and groundwater flows). Nutrient enrichment from treated municipal sewage effluent was the dominant ecological effect observed for the mainstem Athabasca River, associated with increased fish size and changes in invertebrate assemblages, likely because this pollution source is discharged directly into the river. If the direct release of treated oil sands process water occurs in the future, then the potential ecological impact of these direct industry releases will need to be evaluated carefully. The ecological causal assessment method proved to be a useful tool for better understanding how stressor sources relate to ecological effects through candidate proximate causes. Factors that confound our ability to assess the ecological effects of oil sands development focus on our inability to adequately differentiate between contaminants supplied from natural and anthropogenic contaminant sources. Our causal synthesis identifies options for changes in future monitoring to better anticipate and detect degradation in the ecosystem health of the lower Athabasca River and its tributaries.

AB  - Seagrasses are rapidly losing their ability to serve ecosystem services (ESs) with the loss of global biodiversity and coastal habitat degradation over the past few decades. Monitoring ESs is therefore important for tracking subsequent decline or recovery. The development of new Earth Observation (EO) technologies and approaches involved in observing and analyzing data collected from remote sensing (RS) satellite/aircraft would make for a useful application: monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of ESs that seagrasses provide to marine ecosystems and human well-being. Unfortunately, current approaches greatly rely on spatial proxy measures to map distribution of ESs. Many of biophysical parameters are currently detectable by EO instruments, with relevance to ESs. This paper review the capabilities of advanced RS techniques for informing species diversity, growth traits, health condition, ecological processes, and water quality variables linking ESs and describe how these EO products can contribute to ES assessments. Incorporation of both the direct (seagrass extent) and indirect (water related ESs) estimates derived from EO data can now provide more direct estimates of seagrass ecosystem properties (seagrass habitat quality and biodiversity) influencing ESs than the spatial proxies presently in use and they can support in developing more mechanistic models in GIS framework and spatially explicit maps of ESs. The increasing range of EO system and data sets suitable for measuring ES indicators has potential to supporting integrated coastal land use planning. Because each ES indicator and service responds to the environment, there is no 'one approach fits all' solution. Selecting EO products, with required resolution to be analyzed will guide to improving mapping efforts. This work also shed lights to sensitize discussion about need of holistic methodologies, challenges, and to motivate an enhanced use of EO-based technology and data. The need for a multidisciplinary project team of ecologists, sociologists, biologists and RS experts has been suggested for proper identification of ES indicators and advanced analysis of EO data. By doing so, we anticipate rapid progress in satellite based ES assessment and characterization of ESs and, in turn, supporting conservation and management of coastal ecosystem.

AB  - In this Citation Classics commentary, we reflect upon a paper that we published in Soil Biology & Biochemistry in 1995 and that provided a critical assessment of the use of the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2) or the ratio of microbial respiration to biomass) as a bioindicator of soil quality. This quotient is based on Eugene Odum's 'Theory of Ecosystem Succession' published in 1969 and has been widely used in soil ecology for over 30 years; a higher qCO(2) value is reflective of greater energetic inefficiency of the soil microbial biomass. At the time of our study a strong demand was emerging for easily measured soil quality bioindicators and qCO(2) was an obvious candidate. In our paper we drew on the plant ecological strategy theory of J. Philip Grime by highlighting that, in addition to the two major types of ecosystem identified in Odum's theory ('disturbed' and 'developed'), there is a third type, 'stressed' that is characterized by persistently harsh conditions (e.g., nutrient poor, cold, dry). We measured qCO(2) for soils collected from along the Franz Josef Glacier chronosequence in New Zealand that spans 120,000 years and which includes all three types of ecosystems, going from disturbed to developed to stressed. We found that qCO(2) was least for the developed stage and was similarly high for the disturbed and stressed stages; it was not possible to discriminate between early successional stages characterized by high disturbance and high quality resource inputs from late successional stages characterized by substantial nutrient limitation and poor quality resource inputs. We further reanalyzed data from several publications from which qCO2 could be calculated and these reinforced our empirical findings. Upon reflecting on our earlier work, we conclude that highly contrasting types of ecosystems that vary in their disturbance regime and stress cannot be arranged to any satisfaction along a unidimensional axis, and that no simple, unidimensional bioindicator (including qCO2) is capable of adequately summarizing variation of soil quality among ecosystems. However, we also emphasize that despite its limitations as a bioindicator of soil quality, the qCO(2) concept has proven to be highly useful for advancing conceptual understanding of the functioning of the soil microbial community and its contribution to ecosystem processes.

AB  - Recent studies have shown the potential of entomopathogenic fungi (EF) for the biocontrol of tephritid puparia in soil treatments beneath the tree canopy. The soil is the natural ecosystem of these fungi, and the soil environment provides protection against UV. Furthermore, the fungi may recycle in the soil, providing a long term control of the puparia. However, such soil applications could have a negative impact on non-target soil arthropod fauna. In particular, ants play an important role in olive grove soil fauna because they are biological indicators of the soil condition. Thus, the aims of this study were to (i) determine the persistence of Metarhizium anisopliae EAMa 01/58-Su isolate in the soil when applied beneath olive trees for controlling olive fly puparia, (ii) elucidate its possible effect on non-target soil dwelling arthropod communities and (iii) evaluate the effect of soil treatment with M. anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana on Tapinoma nigerrimum colonies. Our results indicate that the soil ecosystem favors the persistence of this autochthonous isolate, maintaining levels of 10(5) CFUg(-1) of soil. This level allows long-term protection of the crop against the olive fly puparia. Furthermore, in pitfall traps, no infected insects were found in field as a result of the fungal treatment. The most abundant arthropods trapped were formicidae species. In laboratory assays, no significant differences in mortality were found between fungal treatments and control. The mean mortality values were between 41.0% and 64.7%. However, a significant reduction in average survival time was observed with 16.9 days in control to 15.6 days in the treatment with B. bassiana and 14.8 days in the treatment with M. anisopliae. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in ant activity before and after fungal treatment. The soil samples were also evaluated to determinate if these ants distribute conidia from treated soils to non-treated soils without being able to notice the presence of EF. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A series of bioindicator organisms for aquatic ecosystems are being maintained under laboratory conditions in order to analyze effects of pollution on aquatic wildlife and potential effects on human health. Growth kinetics of algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was used to evaluate effects of the surfactant nonilphenol (NP). Brachionus calyciflorus was used to set up a model of endocrine disruption using the fungicide vinclozolin (Vc). We exposed salamanders from the genus Ambystoma sp., to different concentrations of both the aneugen colchicine (COL) and the clastogen cyclophosphamide (CP) and we determined the frequency of micromicleated cells (MNC) in their shed skin. The presence of spontaneous micronuclei in peripheral blood erythrocytes from 10 fish species in Lake "La Alberca," Michoacan (Mexico), was evaluated as a possible biological indicator of genotoxic agents. Results confirm the sensivity of Pseudokirchnericlla subcapitata to growth kinetics: the range of concentration of NP (20, 200 and 2000 mu g L-1) shows an inverted U shape in its maximum growth rate; Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used as a positive control and to solvate NP induced an inverse stimulatory effect on growth rate in the range of concentrations analyzed (0.0023, 0.023 and 0.23% v v(-1)). In the use of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, the range of Vc from 0. 185 mg L-1 to 3 mg L-1 clearly showed an inverted U shape characteristic of endocrine disruptions. We were able to use shed skin from Ambystoma sp., to measure MNC frequencies induced either by an aneugenic or a clastogenic compound. The MNC frequency was increased significantly by all doses of COL and CP, administered either as single or repeated exposures. The presence of MNC in the shed skin and the speed of sloughing lead us to propose that the sheds of Ambystoma sp., or other amphibians that slough their skin, as suitable alternative models for detecting genotoxic exposures relevant to aquatic environments. In the survey to determine potential biological fish indicators for genotoxic agents, the frequency of spontaneous micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE) found in the goodeid Xenotoca melanosoma (3.7 +/- 1.6 MNC) and the cichlid Oreochromis aureus (2.0 +/- 1.0 MNC) suggests that these species can be considered as potential biological indicators.

AB  - Environmental science has benefited a great deal from omics-based technologies. High-throughput toxicology has defined adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), prioritized chemicals of concern, and identified novel actions of environmental chemicals. While many of these approaches are conducted under rigorous laboratory conditions, a significant challenge has been the interpretation of omics data in "real-world" exposure scenarios. Clarity in the interpretation of these data limits their use in environmental monitoring programs. In recent years, one overarching objective of many has been to address fundamental questions concerning experimental design and the robustness of data collected under the broad umbrella of environmental genomics. These questions include: (1) the likelihood that molecular profiles return to a predefined baseline level following remediation efforts, (2) how reference site selection in an urban environment influences interpretation of omics data and (3) what is the most appropriate species to monitor in the environment from an omics point of view. In addition, inter-genomics studies have been conducted to assess transcriptome reproducibility in toxicology studies. One lesson learned from inter-genomics studies is that there are core molecular networks that can be identified by multiple laboratories using the same platform. This supports the idea that "omics-networks" defined a priori may be a viable approach moving forward for evaluating environmental impacts over time. Both spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem structure is expected to influence molecular responses to environmental stressors, and it is important to recognize how these variables, as well as individual factor (i.e. sex, age, maturation), may confound interpretation of network responses to chemicals. This mini-review synthesizes the progress made towards adopting these tools into environmental monitoring and identifies future challenges to be addressed, as we move into the next era of high throughput sequencing. A conceptual framework for validating and incorporating molecular networks into environmental monitoring programs is proposed. As AOPs become more defined and their potential in environmental monitoring assessments becomes more recognized, the AOP framework may prove to be the conduit between omics and penultimate ecological responses for environmental risk assessments.

AB  - To recover the structure and functionality of a deforested ecosystem, two strategies of ecological restoration are considered: active restoration, which eliminates the disturbance agents and implements strategies to accelerate site recovery, and passive restoration, which eliminates disturbance agents, allowing natural regeneration to occur. Prior to choosing passive restoration, a field evaluation of the potential for natural regeneration is important. In this context, seedling and sapling density as well as patterns of recruitment and survival are appropriate indicators of restoration potential. In the present study, we deduced the potential of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) forest of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve to recover by natural regeneration through seedling and sapling density and mortality, since A. religiosa is the dominant tree species in wintering sites of monarch butterfly. In 2015, we evaluated seedling density in 53 sites along an elevational gradient (3050-3550 m above sea level; m a.s.l.). There was a higher density of seedlings and saplings established in canopy gaps, compared to sites under dense forest canopy. Seedling recruitment was higher in sites at intermediate elevations (3050 to 3300 m a.s.l.) than in those at higher elevations. In a second survey, we studied A. religiosa seedling mortality over the dry season of 2016 to identify the environmental variables that cause the high seedling mortality and very low recruitment. Recently emerged seedling mortality was 49.2% at the end of the dry season (June 2016). The highest monthly mortality (14.3%) was recorded in April, a dry and warm month with the lowest values of moss thickness and soil moisture. We found no negative effects of moss layer on seedling mortality; indeed, moss appears to slow soil moisture reduction at the critical end of the warm and dry season. Soil and moss moisture values in April seem to be a critical factor for A. religiosa seedling recruitment, and we expect this condition will deteriorate under projected climatic change scenarios. Thus, the potential of MBBR A. religiosa forest to recover by passive restoration is highly constrained and will require management actions to achieve successful restoration outcomes.

AB  - Identifying ecological response variables sensitive to hydrological change is a key step in determining the impacts of river flow alterations on aquatic ecosystems and in setting environmental flows that sustain certain ecological values. Building on the successful use of flow regime sensitive aquatic invertebrate indices in other countries, particularly the UK based Lotic Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE), we provide two variants of a similar index for use in New Zealand (LIFENZ and a weighted variant: LIFENZ_W). As in the original LIFE, the New Zealand indices were based on water velocity preference categories assigned to aquatic invertebrate taxa using professional judgement. To calculate the indices a lookup table is used to assign a score to each taxon based on their velocity category and abundance. For the LIFENZ_W variant an additional step down weighted the scores if the taxon has a general compared to a more specific velocity preference. The two index variants were correlated with each other and to similar environmental parameters. Across a total of 74 sites, both indices were correlated with depth-averaged water velocity. Changes in index values, both between sites and temporally within sites, were predominantly associated with changes in hydrological parameters, such as the magnitude and length of time since a recent high flow, and to a lesser degree with other physico-chemical parameters. Commonly used indices in New Zealand designed to respond to nutrient enrichment (MCI and variants) were not correlated with local water velocity, but were correlated with antecedent flow conditions and were likely influenced by effects of flow stability on algal growth. Further testing of LIFENZ and LIFENZ_W in combination with MCI is recommended, particularly in rivers subject to more extreme hydrological and water quality stresses and with regard to other physical parameters such as hydraulic habitat. However, the LIFENZ and its weighted variant (LIFENZ_W) appear to be useful tools for understanding and managing the effects of hydrological alteration on aquatic invertebrate communities in New Zealand. As LIFENZ and LIFENZ_W were strongly correlated and only showed a relatively small deviation from a slope of 1 we recommend the use of the more straightforward LIFENZ in almost all circumstances.

AB  - Although periphytic protozoan communities have long been used for the bioassessment of water quality, their utility is hampered by functional redundancy, leading to high "signal-to-noise" ratios. In this study, a 1-year baseline survey of periphytic protozoan communities was carried out in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China, in order to determine redundancy levels in conditions of differing water quality. Samples were collected at four sampling sites along a pollution gradient. Environmental variables such as salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), soluble reactive phosphates (SRP), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) were measured to compare with biotic factors. A total of 53 functional units (FUs) were identified from 144 observed protozoan species based on four biological traits, i.e., feeding type, body size, movement type, and source of food supply. For reducing the "signal-to-noise" ratios of species-abundance/biomass data, the peeling procedure was used to identify the bioindicator redundancy levels based on these FUs. Three consecutive subsets of response units (RU1-RU3) with correlation coefficients > 0.75 of the full FU dataset were identified, comprising 12 FUs, 21 FUs, and 9 FUs, respectively. Algivores and bacterivores were dominant in RU1 and RU2 among the polluted sites, whereas raptors were dominant in RU3 at the unpolluted site. In terms of relative abundance, RU1 was the primary contributor to the protozoan communities during the 1-year cycle and its relative abundance increased with the increasing pollution, whereas RU2 and RU3, with complementary temporal distributions, generally decreased with increasing pollution. Ordinations based on bootstrapped average analyses revealed a significant variation in the functional pattern of all three RUs among the four sampling sites. Biological-environmental match analysis demonstrated that the variability was driven by the increasing concentrations of nutrients (e.g., NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P) and decreasing concentrations of DO (P < 0.05). There were high levels of functional redundancy among periphytic protozoan communities which could be used as bioindicators of marine water quality.

AB  - Despite their socio-economic and ecological importance, rivers are among the most threatened ecosystems. As a result, reliable and affordable monitoring system is fundamental for their effective management and conservation. The utility of Biological Monitoring Working Party, BMWP (England, E) index developed for the temperate region and BMWP-CR modified for Costa Rica, the tropics, were compared for assessing water quality of River Aturukuku in Eastern Uganda. Benthic macroinvertebrates were used in the biomonitoring study because of their wide spectrum of sensitivity to changes in water physico-chemical characteristics. The riverine water quality at upstream site (rural area), four sites in mid-stream (urban area) and one site downstream (rural area), were evaluated using the BMWP indices from February to October, 2018. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and selected physico-chemical variables were used to validate performance of the BMWP indices. Although BMWP-CR included more local macroinvertebrate taxa for pollution sensitivity scores than BMWP (E), the performance of both indices was similar. The BMWP (E) and BMWP-CR classified river water quality as bad to moderate, whereas the associated Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), from England, ASPT (E) and ASPT-CR from Costa Rica indicated moderate to very good category, across seasons. The H' and physicochemical variables classified river water quality as bad to moderate. The BMWPs and associated ASPTs allotted sites at urban effluent sources as moderate to very good, while those in rural settings as bad to good, contrary to allocations by H' and physico-chemical variables. The two BMPs failed to reliably separate sites based on pollution gradient, attributable to biogeographical differences in environmental conditions and pollution tolerances among macroinvertebrates. There is need to adapt a biotic index such as BMWP-CR or develop an indigenous one for Uganda, through an intensive study on local macroinvertebrate assemblages. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare effects of two biostimulating substances (compost and bird droppings) on the proliferation of microorganisms, enzymatic activity, and resistance of spring barley in soil exposed to tebuconazole fungicide. Both biostimulating substances were also assessed for their efficacy in tebuconazole degradation in soil. Materials and methods A pot vegetation experiment was performed with soil belonging to the Eutric Cambisols to test the effect of tebuconazole on the biological activity of soil. Its adverse effect on the biological properties of soil was minimized through the use of biostimulating substances (compost and bird droppings), the effect of which was expressed with the IFC/BD index. The RCh index was used to determine the effect of tebuconazole on the proliferation of soil microorganisms and enzymes, the BA(21) index was used to express soil fertility based on the activity of soil enzymes, whereas the RS index-to express the resistance of spring barley to the administered doses of tebuconazole. Finally, analyses were conducted to determine the efficacy of soil amendment with biostimulating substances in tebuconazole degradation. Results and discussion Study results demonstrate that tebuconazole caused significant changes in the proliferation of the tested groups of microorganisms, in the activity of soil enzymes, and in spring barley yield. It was especially noticeable in pots in which the soil was exposed to its highest dose, i.e., 2.499 mg kg(-1). Soil supplementation with bird droppings had a positive effect on the development of soil microorganisms and on the enzymatic activity in the soil. In turn, compost addition to soil exerted various effects on the biological properties of soil. Both biostimulating substances failed to improve spring barley yield. Tebuconazole degradation was more intense in the soil fertilized with bird droppings than with compost. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that tebuconazole can affect the stability and health status of soil ecosystems by modifying their biological properties. The high sensitivity of soil microorganisms and enzymes to stress conditions makes them reliable environmental bioindicators. The strive for eliminating the adverse impact of fungicides on soil microbiome through the use of appropriate remediation methods, like, e.g., biostimulation, is of greater concern from the ecological perspective.

AB  - Question: Functional plant traits often express consistent changes along ecological gradients and, hence, are often used as indicators of environmental change (e.g. nutrient availability, temperature changes). Besides being driven by edaphic conditions, functional plant composition is filtered by herbivory, and traits responsive to nutrient availability often coincide with those related to palatability or resistance to browsing. We hypothesized that herbivory may distort the ways in which traits are expressed along environmental gradients.
   Location: Bialowieza National Park, Poland.
   Methods: We used a long-term controlled, exclosure experiment in the Bialowieza National Park to study tree functional trait expression and plant indicator values, with and without large ungulate browsing, along a natural soil fertility gradient.
   Results: Browsing largely reduced the functional diversity of regenerating trees, indicated by multivariate analysis and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), and altered how several traits change with increasing fertility. Browsing led to an increase in specific leaf area (SLA) on poorer sites. RQE showed a hump-backed trend along the fertility gradient, indicating the largest functional diversity at intermediate fertility. However, this pattern was not affected by browsing. Unlike the morphological tree traits, trends of light and N plant indicator values along the gradient were unaffected by browsing.
   Conclusions: These results highlight how the expression of plant traits resulting from one driver (soil fertility) can be modified by another driver (herbivory,) and stress the importance of taking herbivory into account when using plant traits as indicators of large-scale processes (e.g. climate change). Furthermore, the results suggest that plant indicator values may be more robust towards these effects, while compiled indices such as RQE could mask considerable functional turnover. Several traits (e.g. SLA) are strongly connected to nutrient cycling. The development, driven by browsing, towards higher SLA on poorer sites may thus cause a positive feedback effect on site fertility that drives an increase in nutrient availability. This may in turn have implications for ecosystem functionality. Hence, the large reduction in functional diversity revealed at the scale of this study may in the long term have implications on multiple ecosystem processes.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, increased fire frequency, and pollution drive shifts in ecosystem function and resilience. Scientists generally rely on biological indicators of these stressors to signal that ecosystem conditions have been altered. However, these biological indicators are not always capable of being directly related to ecosystem components that provide benefits to humans and/or can be used to evaluate the cost-benefit of a change in health of the component (ecosystem services). Therefore, we developed the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to link changes in a biological indicator of a stressor to final ecosystem services. The STEPS Framework produces "chains" of ecological components that explore the breadth of impacts resulting from the change in a stressor. Chains are comprised of the biological indicator, the ecological production function (EPF, which uses ecological components to link the biological indicator to a final ecosystem service), and the user group who directly uses, appreciates, or values the component. The framework uses a qualitative score (high, medium, low) to describe the strength of science (SOS) for the relationship between each component in the EPF. We tested the STEPS Framework within a workshop setting using the exceedance of critical loads of air pollution as a model stressor and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) to describe final ecosystem services. We identified chains for four modes of ecological response to deposition: aquatic acidification, aquatic eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and terrestrial eutrophication. The workshop participants identified 183 unique EPFs linking a change in a biological indicator to a FEGS; when accounting for the multiple beneficiaries, we ended with 1104 chains. The SOS scores were effective in identifying chains with the highest confidence ranking as well as those where more research is needed. The STEPS Framework could be adapted to any system in which a stressor is modifying a biological component. The results of the analysis can be used by the social science community to apply valuation measures to multiple or selected chains, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of anthropogenic stressors on measures of human well-being.

AB  - The control of vector mosquitoes is one of the biggest challenges facing humankind with the use of chemical pesticides often leading to environmental impact and the evolution of resistance. Although to a lesser extent, this also holds for Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), the most widely used biological pesticide to control mosquito populations. This raises the need for the development of integrated pest management strategies that allow the reduction of Bti concentrations without loss of the mosquito control efficiency. To this end, we tested in a laboratory experiment the combined effects of larval exposure to a sublethal Bti concentration and predation risk cues on life history and physiology of larval and adult Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Besides natural predator kairomones and prey alarm cues, we also tested synthetic kairomones of Notonecta predators. Neither Bti nor predation risk cues affected mortality, yet when both stressors were combined mortality increased on average by 133% compared to the treatment with only predation risk cues. This synergistic interaction was also present when Bti was combined with synthetic kairomones. This was further reflected in changes of the composite index of population performance, which suggested lowered per capita growth rates in mosquitoes exposed to Bti but only when Bti was combined with synthetic kairomones. Furthermore, predation risk cues shortened larval development time, reduced mass at metamorphosis in males, and had an immunosuppressive effect in larval and adult mosquitoes which may affect the mosquito vector competence. We provide the first demonstration that synthetic kairomones may generate similar effects on prey as natural kairomones. The identified immunosuppressive effect of synthetic kairomones and the novel lethal synergism type between a biological pesticide and synthetic predator kairomones provide an important proof of principle illustrating the potential of this combination for integrated mosquito control and should in a next step be evaluated under more natural conditions. It may guide novel integrated pest management programs with Bti that incorporate synthetic kairomones and thereby can reduce environmental impact and evolution of resistance creating more efficient and sustainable mosquito control.

AB  - Eutrophication leading to hypoxic water conditions has become a major problem in aquatic systems worldwide. Monitoring the levels and biological effects of lowered oxygen levels in aquatic systems may provide data useful in management of natural aquatic environments. Fishes represent an economically important resource that is subject to hypoxia exposure effects. Due to the extreme diversity of fish species and their habitats, fishes in general have evolved unique capabilities to modulate gene expression patterns in response to hypoxic stress. Recent studies have attempted to document quantitative changes in gene expression patterns induced in various fish species in response to reduced dissolved oxygen levels. From a management perspective, the goal of these studies is to provide a more complete characterization of hypoxia-responsive genes in fish, as molecular indicators (biomarkers) of ecosystem hypoxic stress. The molecular genetic response to hypoxia is highly complex and overlaps with other stress responses making it difficult to identify hypoxia-specific responses using traditional single gene or low throughput approaches. Therefore, recent approaches have been aimed at developing functional genomic (e.g. high-density microarray and real-time PCR) and proteomic (two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry based peptide identification) technologies that employ fish species. Many of the fish species utilized in these studies do not have the advantages of underlying genome resources (i.e., genome or transcriptome sequences). Efforts have attempted to establish correlations between discreet molecular responses elicited by fish in response to hypoxia and changes in the genetic profiles of stressed organs or tissues. Notable progress in these areas has been made using several different versions of either cDNA or oligonucleotide based microarrays to profile changes in gene expression patterns in response to hypoxic stress.
   Due to these efforts, hundreds of hypoxia-responsive genes have been identified both from laboratory reared aquaria fish and from feral fish derived from both fresh and saltwater habitats. Herein, we review these reports and the emergence of hypoxia biomarker development in aquatic species. We also include some of our own recent results using the medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model to define genetic profiles of hypoxia exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planktivorous undesirable fish may threaten both fishpond ecosystem functioning and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) farming. The present study revealed a mechanistic understanding of the adverse ecosystem and pro-duction impacts that topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), an invasive omnivorous fish species from Asia, could represent for eutrophic fishponds in South Bohemia (Czechia). In an outdoor experiment conducted under natural conditions, six similar ponds of small size (ca. 1 ha) were similarly stocked with the same size-class common carps (1+ year-old age cohort). Three ponds were additionally stocked with heterogenous size-class of topmouth gudgeon, other three were control ponds (stocked solely with common carp). Our sampling covered one vegetation season from March to September 2020. Environmental parameters, fish and zooplankton assemblage were sampled monthly, while zoobenthos bimonthly (in April, June and August). To assess the potential effect of overall fish predation and its change during the season, we calculated a fish stock index combining fish density and biomass at the time, referred as FSIC for stocked fish (common carp) and FSIU for undesirable fish (topmouth gudgeon). Some tenfold increase in FSIU reflected an overall effect of topmouth gudgeon predation. Significantly (p < 0.05) lower FSIC indeed indicated the adverse effect of topmouth gudgeon on the carp populations compared to the control ponds since August. Our results clearly showed a significant top-down effect of topmouth gudgeon on planktonic crustaceans, especially large Daphnia spp. and other cladoceran species. The complete elimination of cladocerans in the second half of the growing season probably contributed to impaired growth of carp and increased consumption of zoobenthos observed in the undesirable fishponds. Our study suggested indeed that water transparency, often used as a simple indicator of water quality in fishponds, did not correspond well with the ecological status, not even biodiversity, of the fishponds under study. The voracious undesirable fish overexploited zooplankton and significantly out-competed commercially reared common carp, which then switched more to foraging on zoobenthos. Thus, efficient eradicating undesirable fish seems to be a superior tool for overall restoring the eutrophic fishpond ecosystems and improving their ecological status.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the ambient atmosphere is strongly associated with detrimental health effects. However, these particles from various sources and regions are unlikely equally toxic. While animal studies are impractical for high-throughput toxicity testing, appropriate in vitro models are urgently needed. Co-culture of A549 and THP-1 macrophages grown at air-liquid interface (ALI) or under submerged conditions was exposed to same concentrations of ambient PM2.5 to provide accurate comparisons between culture methods. Following 24-h incubation with PM2.5 collected in Harbin in China, biological endpoints being investigated include cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and pro-inflammatory mediators. The co-culture grown under submerged condition demonstrated a significant increase in ROS levels and all tested pro-inflammatory indicators [interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha] in mRNA expression and released protein levels. Similar but a declining response trend was observed using the same PM2.5 incubation after grown at ALI. We further observed a significant increase of PM2.5-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and activation of NF-kappa B p65 in a dose-dependent trend for co-cultures grown under submerged condition. These results provide important implications that culture conditions (ALI versus submerged) can induce different extents of biological responses to ambient PM2.5; the co-culture grown at ALI is less likely to produce false-positive results than submerged culture. Hence, culture conditions should be discussed when comparing in vitro methods used for high-throughput PM2.5 toxicity assessment in future.

AB  - Here we present an almost complete and integrated Holocene record of marine and terrestrial palaeoenvironmental change from the NE shelf of the Black Sea. A dinoflagellate cyst record used to reconstruct Holocene sea-surface conditions highlights that the NE shelf was a brackish water environment, with a minimum salinity of 7 psu in the early-Holocene before changing at a gradual rate to a more saline environment with maximum salinities of similar to 18 psu being reached around 3 cal. ka. A warming phase was detected from 6 cal. ka BP, with warmest conditions between 3 and 2.5 cal. ka BP. A pollen record is used to examine the major climate and land-use changes in the eastern Black Sea region. Biome reconstructions show that the temperate deciduous forest dominates throughout the record, although with an overall decline. From early-Holocene to the first hiatus around similar to 9 cal. ka BP, Pinus pollen dominates, while taxa representing a mixed oak-hornbeam-beech forest are less abundant, indicating relatively cool and dry conditions. Between similar to 7.9 and similar to 6.1 cal. ka BP, a thermophilous deciduous forest established, suggesting an overall warming trend and humid conditions. From 4 cal. ka BP, Pinus dominates the pollen record, accompanied by an increase of herbs, implying an opening of the landscape, which would coincide with the beginning of the Meghalayan Age. The integrated record of the marine and terrestrial climate indicators supports the notion that this change in landscape may have been triggered by a combination of warmer and drier conditions and human activities in this region.

AB  - The task performance can be analyzed though various indices related to cognitive tasks, but few studies have been conducted to analyze various indices of task performance considering both the indoor air pollutants and the climate factors. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an integrated task performance score for 22 building occupants based on the IEQ condition changes. The experiment was designed with three scenarios simulating the IEQ condition changes during an 8-hour work period. In each scenario, six cognitive tasks were performed before and after the occurrence of IEQ condition changes. The relationship between cognitive task and IEQ condition was analyzed using a paired t-test. In addition, an integrated task performance score of the building occupants was developed with the use of a weighted Euclidean distance to utilize the results of this study in building design and operation. As a result, when the operative temperature is changed from 18.70 degrees C (cold) to 25 degrees C (neutral), the best task performance score was calculated as 0.187. The noticeable fact is that although scenario 1-1 was worse than scenario 2-1 based on the predicted percentage of dissatisfaction, a better occupants' task performance score was obtained from scenario 1-1 (0.271) than from scenario 2-1 (0.346). Through the results of this study, the building occupants' task performance according to the IEQ condition considering both the CO2 concentration and the indoor climate can be expressed as a single index. Thus, it is expected that using this single index, decision makers, including facility managers, building occupants, and mechanical system designers, will be able to manage the IEQ conditions of buildings based on the quantitative indicators of the building occupants' task performance.

AB  - We examined how differences in local forest-management institutions relate to disparate anthropogenic forest disturbance and forest conditions among three neighboring montane forests in Tanzania under centralized, comanaged, or communal management. Institutional differences have been shaped by decentralization reforms. We conducted semistructured interviews with members of forest management committees, local government, and village households and measured anthropogenic disturbance, tree structure, and species composition in forest plots. We assessed differences in governance system components of local institutions, including land tenure, decision-making autonomy by forest users, and official and de facto processes of rule formation, monitoring, and enforcement among the three management strategies. We also assessed differences in frequencies of prohibited logging and subsistence pole cutting, and measures of forest condition. An adjacent research forest served as an ecological reference for comparison of forest conditions. Governance was similar for comanaged and centralized management, whereas communal managers had greater tenure security and decision-making autonomy over the use and management of their forest. There was significantly less illegal logging in the communal forest, but subsistence pole cutting was common across all management strategies. The comanaged forest was most disturbed by recent logging and pole cutting, as were peripheral areas of the larger centralized forest. This manifested in more degraded indicators of forest conditions (lower mean tree size, basal area, density of trees >= 90 cm dbh, and aboveground biomass and higher overall stem density). Greater tenure security and institutional autonomy of the communal strategy contributed to more effective management, less illegal logging, and maintenance of good forest conditions, but generating livelihood benefits was a challenge for both decentralized strategies. Our results underscore the importance of well-designed institutional arrangements in forest management and illustrate mechanisms for improved forest governance and conservation in the context of Tanzanian decentralization reforms.

AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination was used to stress ecosystem functioning and the activity of five soil enzymes were used to measure the level of stress: beta-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase. Two consecutive field experiments were conducted based on differences in rice agroecosystems during the monsoon (wet) and the post-monsoon (dry) seasons: one measured the impact of As stress on anaerobic rice agroecosystem and the other under aerobic; each receiving soil amendments (including organic manure, vermicompost, NPK, silicon, iron). Aerobic treatment significantly reduced soil As (P <0.05) as compared to anaerobic conditions. The activity of beta-glucosidase increased the highest under aerobic conditions (30%-34%), ranging from 52.64-194.15 mu g rho-nitrophenol g(-1) of dry soil h(-1) relative to anaerobic conditions. Enzyme activities also increased under aerobic conditions, ranging from 24%-29%, 21%-22%, 12%-18%, and 14%-16% for alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, acid phosphatase and urease, respectively. The incorporation of organic manure under aerobic conditions resulted in significant increases in enzyme activities relative to control and NPK. Differences in As concentrations between each of the agroecosystem caused significant inhibitory effects on most soil enzyme activities; however, urease activity was not impacted. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of enzyme activities indicated that urease activity had the lowest factor loading on PCA in wet and dry seasons. Overall, the aerobic system was better to strengthen soil ecosystem health by increasing enzyme activities, while the activity of beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and arylsulfatase can serve as potential indicators of soil biochemical functionality in As contaminated soils under study conditions.

AB  - Rodents are a very useful tool in reconstructing the environment of the past, especially owing to their rapid response to climate change, their small home range, and their restricted habitat requirements. They are a highly diverse group of mammals, which have high reproduction rates and as a result can evolve rapidly. The abundance of their microfossil remains in archaeological and paleontological sites permits robust statistical analyses to reconstruct the past climate and environment. Recently, a number of studies have affirmed the need to deepen the climatic characterization of the European Quaternary, the Middle Pleistocene being an important stage for ascertaining how our hominin ancestors lived. The aim of this study is to characterize the climatic conditions in which hominins lived in southwestern Mediterranean Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. To reconstruct these climatic conditions, we apply the bioclimatic model to rodent assemblages from Middle Pleistocene sites with human remains (Caune de l'Arago, Sima de los Huesos, Aroeira cave, Visogliano, Trinchera Galeria, and Mollet cave). Based on the percentage distribution of the species in different climate types and applying multiple linear regressions, we estimated the mean annual temperature, the mean temperature of the coldest month, and the mean temperature of the warmest month. We compared these estimates with data collected over the last 30 years from nearby meteorological stations to obtain the differences with current climate and observe the fluctuations. The climatic conditions obtained from the results of this study show that, while in Iberia mild climatic condition prevailed, in southern France and northeastern Italy harsher weather conditions were indicated.

AB  - Riparian restoration is an important objective for landscape managers seeking to redress the widespread degradation of riparian areas and the ecosystem services they provide. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of one-off' restoration activities undertaken in the Upper Murrumbidgee Catchment, NSW, Australia. The objective of the restoration was to protect and enhance riparian vegetation and control erosion, and consequently reduce sediment and nutrient delivery into the Murrumbidgee River. To evaluate the outcomes 10 years after restoration, rapid riparian vegetation and geomorphological assessments were undertaken at 29 sites spanning the four different restoration methods used (at least five replicates per treatment), as well as at nine comparable untreated sites. We also trialed the use of aerial imagery to compare width of riparian canopy vegetation and projective foliage cover prior to restoration with that observed after 10 years. Aerial imagery demonstrated the width of riparian canopy vegetation and projective foliage cover increased in all restored sites, especially those with native plantings. The rapid assessment process indicated that 10 years after riparian restoration, the riparian vegetation was in a better condition at treated sites compared to untreated sites. Width of riparian canopy vegetation, native mid-storey cover, native canopy cover and seedling recruitment were significantly greater in treated sites compared to untreated sites. Geomorphological condition of treated sites was significantly better than untreated sites, demonstrating the importance of livestock exclusion to improve bank and channel condition. Our findings illustrate the value of one-off' restoration activities in achieving long-term benefits for riparian health. We have demonstrated that rapid assessments of the vegetation and geomorphological condition can be undertaken post-hoc to determine the long-term outcomes, especially when supported with analysis of historical aerial imagery.

AB  - Different phosphate-, acetate- and formate buffers in the pH range 2.0-6.8 were tested for electromembrane extraction (EME) in a 96-well system. The five basic drugs haloperidol, loperamide, methadone, nortriptyline, and pethidine were selected as model analytes. The EME performance was tested with respect to extraction recovery, extraction current and pH-stability. The analytes were extracted from 200 mu L buffer, through a 100 mu m thick supported liquid membrane (SLM) of 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) immobilized in the pores of filters in a 96-well plate, and into 100 mu L buffer acceptor phase. The extraction voltage was 50 V and the extraction time was 10 min. The acceptor phase was analyzed by HPLC-UV. The extraction current was <= 6 mu A with all buffers, and pH was effectively stabilized during EME using buffers as donor (sample) and acceptor phase. For buffers with pH <= 4.8 as acceptor phase, the extraction recoveries were in the range 66-97% and with RSD <15%. With pH in the range 5.8-6.8 in the acceptor phase, the extraction recoveries decreased and were in the range 21-62%. This was attributed to elevated pH conditions in the acceptor/SLM interface. The presence of elevated pH conditions was visualized with phenolphthalein as pH sensitive color indicator. Increasing the buffer strength from 10 to 500 mM in an attempt to offset the elevated pH conditions gave no improvement, and elevated pH conditions remained. Elevated pH conditions in the acceptor/SLM interface were also observed when voltage was increased, and when NPOE was replaced with tributyl phosphate as SLM. The presence of elevated pH conditions close to the SLM in EME was discussed for the first time, and this information is highly important for future development of EME. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The adobe mission church (circa 1801) at Tumacacori National Historical Park in Arizona was damaged in an intense winter storm in 2010. To mitigate the damage and to address building envelope vulnerabilities, investigators completed a study of the hygrothermal behavior of the dome, including characterization of soluble salts and environmental conditions that result in salt damage, identification of structural and seismic vulnerabilities, performance testing (lab and in situ) of lime-based renders for exterior surfaces of the church, and an assessment of structural wood. Hygrothermal modeling of the dome indicates that heavy rain events that occur every 5-10 years result in moisture infiltration and damage to the decorated plasters on the dome interior. The structural assessment identified conditions requiring repair, strengthening, and/or improvements that will result in improved ductility of building assemblies. The wood assessment identified species and grade of structural wood members that require repair, reinforcement, or replacement for developing seismic retrofit designs. Natural hydraulic lime (NHL)-based stuccos offer the best combination of performance properties, resistance to erosion, low absorption and debonding, and acceptable flexural strength and water vapor transmission.

AB  - Freeze-thaw (FT) and moisture dynamics within the soil active layer are critical elements of boreal, arctic and alpine ecosystems, and environmental change assessments. We evaluated the potential for detecting dielectric changes within different soil layers using combined L- and P-band radar remote sensing as a prerequisite for detecting FT and moisture profile changes within the soil active layer. A two-layer scattering model was developed and validated for simulating radar responses from vertically inhomogeneous soil. The model simulations indicated that inhomogeneity in the soil dielectric profile contributes to both L- and P-band backscatter, but with greater P-band sensitivity at depth. The difference in L-and P-band responses to soil dielectric profile inhomogeneity appears suitable for detecting associated changes in soil active layer conditions. Additional evaluation using collocated airborne radar (AIRSAR) observations and in situ soil moisture measurements over alpine tundra indicates that combined L- and P-band SAR observations are sensitive to soil dielectric profile heterogeneity associated with variations in soil moisture and FT conditions.

AB  - The bioaccumulation ability of radionuclides (51)Cr, (54)Mn, (57)Co, (60)Co, (65)Zn, (85)Sr, (109)Cd, (110m)Ag, (113)Sn, and (137)Cs and (241)Am in two red algae species from the southern Baltic Sea - Polysiphonia facoides and Furcellaria lumbricalis - was determined under laboratory conditions. P. facoides demonstrated better bioaccumulative properties towards most of the investigated radionuclides. As a result, P. fucoides can be recommended as a good bioindicator of radioactive environmental pollution. The bioaccumulation of radionuclides in F. lumbricalis was studied during an extended laboratory experiment. The initial extensive uptake of radioisotopes was followed by the rapid removal of cations; in general, concentrations tended to decrease with time. (137)Cs displayed a different behaviour, its concentration in the algae increasing over time mainly clue to its large ion radius; this is a factor that could be responsible for the stronger mechanical and chemical bonding of Cs(+) and that could hamper the movement of ions in both directions.

AB  - Soil quality indices are attempts to classify soil conditions and to compare these conditions to their historical use. From this information it may be possible to determine which uses of soils are better for the long-range goals of agriculture and society. With many factors involved in the profitable production of safe foodstuffs without significant degradation of the environment and soils, an indicator that represents a broad biological perspective of quality is appropriate. Among a group of biological indicators, the ratio of crop N uptake to mineralized N as determined by microbial respiration plus net mineralized N found over a growing season is an useful indicator of soil quality. An evaluation of the 12-year-old Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research Center indicated that soils in plots that had been conventionally managed were of lower quality than soil treated with manure or planted with legume-cash grain crops.

AB  - This study provides a methodology that can be utilised for identifying pipe sections, which can be considered under high risk of failure. Application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study involving an in-service large (similar to 1.7 km) critical water main in Sydney, Australia. Geospatial features from Google Earth Pro (TM) and Google Street View (TM) were used to assess and quantify typical urban environmental attributes, which can be used for identifying pipe failure hotspot locations. Failure history was used to verify the basis of the methodology developed. It was demonstrated that a sound assessment of the pipe conditions is possible through inexpensive geospatial feature analysis. This development can greatly enhance and reduce costs associated with current pipe condition assessment processes.

AB  - Temperature is the main driving force of most ecological processes on Earth, with temperature data often used as a key environmental indicator to guide various applications and research fields. However, collected temperature data are limited by the hardware conditions of the sensors and atmospheric conditions such as clouds, resulting in temperature data that are often incomplete. This affects the accuracy of results using the data. Machine learning methods have been applied to the task of completing missing data, with mixed results. We propose a new data reconstruction framework to improve this performance. Using the MODIS LST map over a span of 9 years (2000-2008), we reconstruct the land surface temperature (LST) data. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional reconstruction method of LST data, the proportion of effective pixels of the LST data reconstructed by the new framework is increased by 3%-7%, and the optimization effect of the method is close to 20%. The experiment also discussed the influence of different altitudes on the data reconstruction effect and the influence of different loss functions on the experimental results.

AB  - Periphytic diatoms were studied to evaluate the water quality of a newly created lake, formed by the enclosure of the formerly tidal Cardiff Bay (Wales, UK), and the effects of two inflowing rivers which drain densely populated and industrialised catchments. Seven sites in Cardiff Bay and two locations on the inflowing rivers were monitored for diatoms and water chemistry over 2 years. Water quality was assessed using a revised UK trophic diatom index (TDI) and new methods to determine ecological quality ratios and ecological status classes as required by the EU Water Framework Directive. Diatom assemblages reflected spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions between the rivers and Cardiff Bay and within the bay. In the bay, diatoms reflected differences in river quality and possibly local pollution in certain areas of the lake. High values of the TDI indicated eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions in both rivers and in the bay and diatoms indicated poor ecological status.

AB  - Wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) are threatened by habitat degradation associated with suburbanization. Suburban development near pools may affect larvae with ramifications for population persistence and vitality. We studied larval development and documented key vernal pool and terrestrial characteristics within 1000 m of 43 pools across the suburban development gradient near Bangor, Maine, USA. Specifically, we examined how survival and morphological characteristics (e.g., developmental phenology, condition, body length, and tail length and shape) varied with characteristics at pool and landscape scales. Secondarily, we explored associations between morphology and survival. Differences in tadpole morphology were associated with suburban land development, hydrology, within-pool vegetation indicative of light availability at the water's surface, and density of pool-breeding amphibian egg masses. Across all pools, tadpoles had delayed development and were larger in pools with longer hydroperiods, while tadpoles in suburban pools developed earlier and were larger than those in rural pools with comparable hydroperiods. Tadpoles developed later and had longer tails in pools with greater canopy cover. Morphology profiles also differed between rural and suburban sites and among years. Survival in suburban pools was predicted to be 15 times greater than in rural pools, but across all pools (including those at intermediate intensities of suburbanization), survival was not predicted to vary with either morphology or site characteristics. No strong relationship existed between developmental phenology and any condition or size metric. Because rural and suburban tadpoles responded similarly to within-pool conditions, our results support the need to maintain natural hydrology and vegetation conditions in pools even in developing areas. Although we detected benefits to tadpoles with increasing suburbanization, suburbanization is well known to extirpate breeding populations; thus, it is likely that wood frog population declines associated with suburbanization are responding to stressors beyond the pool at terrestrial life stages.

AB  - In the Mexican Pacific, Dendraster excentricus, a common estuarine echinoderm, is subject to daily environmental variations in tidal fluxes. Little is known about its ecophysiological response when individuals are exposed to temperature and oxygen changes. This study evaluates their thermal stress response under normal and reduced oxygen conditions using the RNA/DNA ratio and hsp70 gene expression. We exposed sand dollars to different temperature and oxygen conditions. Three experimental temperatures were similar to the ones that organisms experience during one annual cycle and two were considered extreme. Reduced oxygen conditions were considered when levels dropped below 4 mg L-1. To estimate variations in the stress-induced RNA/DNA ratio, we determined the value for males and females during a daily cycle. We also analyzed the hsp70 expression. Under stress conditions, a significant decrease was observed in the RNA/DNA ratios. The lowest values were detected after 6 h under normoxic conditions and high temperatures seemed to induce a major effect on the RNA/DNA ratios during the first hour of stress. Analysis of the hsp70 expression showed significant differences. According to our results, thermal and reduced oxygen stress induces a reduction in the general metabolism of the organisms. These metabolic changes were observed by the decrease in the RNA/DNA ratios and expression levels of hsp70 (at high temperatures). We conclude that RNA/DNA ratios are a useful ecophysiological tool to evaluate the effect of particular stressors on the physiology of D. excentricus, and seem to be more sensitive to oxygen levels than to thermal stress, in contrast to the hsp70 expression, which was more sensitive to extreme temperatures.

AB  - Body condition is an indicator of health, and it plays a key role in many vital processes for mammalian species. While evidence of individual body condition can be obtained, these observations provide just brief glimpses into the health state of the animal. An analytical framework is needed for understanding how health of animals changes over space and time. Through knowledge of individual health we can better understand the status of populations. This is particularly important in endangered species, where the consequences of disruption of critical biological functions can push groups of animals rapidly toward extinction. Here we built a state-space model that provides estimates of movement, health, and survival. We assimilated 30+ years of photographic evidence of body condition and three additional visual health parameters in individual North Atlantic right whales, together with survey data, to infer the true health status as it changes over space and time. We also included the effect of reproductive status and entanglement status on health. At the population level, we estimated differential movement patterns in males and females. At the individual level, we estimated the likely animal locations each month. We estimated the relationship between observed and latent health status. Observations of body condition, skin condition, cyamid infestation on the blowholes, and rake marks all provided measures of the true underlying health. The resulting time series of individual health highlight both normal variations in health status and how anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and, ultimately, the survival of individuals. This modeling approach provides information for monitoring of health in right whales, as well as a framework for integrating observational data at the level of individuals up through the health status of the population. This framework can be broadly applied to a variety of systems - terrestrial and marine - where sporadic observations of individuals exist.

AB  - The article analyzes and compares the existing quantitative norms of green space in different cities of Ukraine and other countries. It is substantiated that the index of provision of green space per capita is significandy more informative under the condition of equal density of the urban population and must necessarily be supplemented by the indicator - the level of greening. The comparison of data relative to Ukrainian cities is complicated by the categorization of green plantings adopted in the country, rather than the green spaces, as practiced in most countries. Despite the relatively low density of settlements, the provision of green space per capita in Ukrainian cities often does not meet the requirements of EU and UN. The primary use of the recreational function of green plantations in modern conditions is appropriate to reorient to the ecological function of green spaces and sustainable urban development. We consider necessity to introduce a minimal environmental norm for the total number of green spaces within the city territory regardless of the form of ownership.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical comorbidity is commonly encountered in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The presence of medical comorbidity has diagnostic, prognostic, treatment, and etiologic implications underscoring the importance of timely detection and treatment.
   METHODS: A selective review of relevant articles and reviews published in English-language databases (1968 to April 2011) was conducted. Studies describing epidemiology, temporality of onset, treatment implications, and prognosis were selected for review.
   RESULTS: A growing body of evidence from epidemiologic, clinical, and biologic studies suggests that the relationship between medical illness and mood disorder is bidirectional in nature. It provides support for the multiplay of shared and specific etiologic factors interlinking these conditions.
   CONCLUSION: This article describes the complex interactions between medical illness and mood disorders and provides a meaningful approach to their comorbid clinical diagnosis and management.

AB  - Some human parasites originated in prehominid ancestors in Africa. Nematode species, such as Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), hookworms and Trichuris trichiura are shared by humans and other close phylogenetic primates (Pan and Gorilla), showing that they infected a common ancestor to this group. When humans migrated from Africa to other continents they carried these parasites wherever climate conditions allowed parasite transmission from host to host. Other parasites, however, were acquired throughout human biological and social evolutive history when new territories were occupied. Paleoparasitology data is a valuable source to recover emergence and disappearance of parasite infections through analysis of archaeological remains. Parasites can be used as biological markers of prehistoric human migrations. They are also indicators of diet, as parasite life cycles are related to specific kinds of food consumed by human groups in the different habitats they occupied. We review paleoparasitological findings in South America, comparing human-host and intestinal parasites with life conditions and environmental relationships through time.

AB  - Mass transport and mixing of perfused scalar quantities in the NASA Rotating Wall Perfused Vessel bioreactor are studied using numerical models of the flow field and scalar concentration field. Operating conditions typical of both microgravity and ground-based cell cultures are studied to determine the expected vessel performance for both flight and ground-based control experiments. Results are presented for the transport of oxygen with cell densities and consumption rates typical of colon cancer cells cultured in the RWPV. The transport and mixing characteristics are first investigated with a step change in the perfusion inlet concentration by computing the time histories of the time to exceed 10% inlet concentration. The effects of a uniform cell utilization rate are then investigated with time histories of the outlet concentration, volume average concentration, and volume fraction starved. It is found that the operating conditions used in microgravity produce results that are quite different then those for ground-based conditions. Mixing times for microgravity conditions are significantly shorter than those for ground-based operation. Increasing the differential rotation rates (microgravity) increases the mixing and transport, while increasing the mean rotation rate (ground-based) suppresses both. Increasing perfusion rates enhances mass transport for both microgravity and ground-based cases, however, for the present range of operating conditions, above 5-10 cc/min there are diminishing returns as much of the inlet fluid is transported directly to the perfusion exit. The results show that exit concentration is not a good indicator of the concentration distributions in the vessel. In microgravity conditions, the NASA RWPV bioreactor with the viscous pump has been shown to provide an environment that is well mixed. Even when operated near the theoretical minimum perfusion rates, only a small fraction of the volume provides less than the required oxygen levels. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A sediment record from Lake Chalco, Basin of Mexico, revealed the presence of two endemic ostracod species during the latter part of Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 6 (146-130 ka) and MIS5 (130-72 ka), namely Candona alchichica and Limnocytherina axalapasco. Higher abundance of C. alchichica was found during MIS6, when prevailing conditions were cold, lake waters were fresh, and relatively deep bottom waters were anoxic. The species is typically associated with saline environments today, consistent with its presence in MIS5 sediments. The Chalco record, however, reveals that it coexisted with freshwater diatom species during MIS6. Thus, we suggest that C. alchichica had a wider salinity tolerance, ranging from freshwater to more saline environments. Examination of MIS5 substages provides further insights into ostracod species responses to changing lake conditions. During MIS5e, the lake water level declined and salinity and dissolved oxygen in the water column increased, thereby favouring L. axalapasco productivity, whereas C. alchichica productivity decreased. Enhanced runoff and lower than average evaporation during MIS5d coincided with the increasing abundance of C. alchichica, suggesting a period of relatively high lake level and more dilute waters. These environmental conditions, however, changed during MIS5c when lake stage dropped once again and L. axalapasco abundance increased. Shallow conditions during this substage were optimal for L. axalapasco. Subsequently, as the lake level continued to decline during MIS5b, both ostracod species disappeared from the sediment record. Finally, during MIS5a, runoff increased and both ostracod species reappeared in the record, with L. axalapasco dominating, suggesting another period of lake level recovery. Increased evaporation rates during the last part of this substage (75-72 cal ka BP) may have led to disappearance of ostracods from the sediment record. Overall, during MIS5, we detected higher L. axalapasco, which represent relatively shallow lake conditions.

AB  - The importance of riparian vegetation to support stream function and provide riparian bird habitat in semiarid landscapes suggests that standardized assessment tools that include vegetation criteria to evaluate stream health could also be used to assess habitat conditions for riparian-dependent birds. We first evaluated the ability of two visual assessments of woody vegetation in the riparian zone (corridor width and height) to describe variation in the obligate riparian bird ensemble along 19 streams in eastern Oregon. Overall species richness and the abundances of three species all correlated significantly with both, but width was more important than height. We then examined the utility of the riparian zone criteria in three standardized and commonly used rapid visual riparian assessment protocols-the USDI BLM Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) assessment, the USDA NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP), and the U.S. EPA Habitat Assessment Field Data Sheet (HAFDS)-to assess potential riparian bird habitat. Based on the degree of correlation of bird species richness with assessment ratings, we found that PFC does not assess obligate riparian bird habitat condition, SVAP provides a coarse estimate, and HAFDS provides the best assessment. We recommend quantitative measures of woody vegetation for all assessments and that all protocols incorporate woody vegetation height. Given that rapid assessments may be the only source of information for thousands of kilometers of streams in the western United States, incorporating simple vegetation measurements is a critical step in evaluating the status of riparian bird habitat and provides a tool for tracking changes in vegetation condition resulting from management decisions.

AB  - Glucosamine measurement has been tested as the indirect method to estimate the biomass produced by Cunninghamella elegans during solid state cultivation (SSC). The independence of this cell constituent content from the age and the conditions of the culture have been verified. The influence of the medium composition, in particular the nature of the carbon source on glucosamine amount is presented. Glucosamine can be considered as a well-adapted biomass indicator, with the necessity to establish for each medium tested a prior correlation between biomass and glucosamine amount. This correlation should be defined in submerged conditions before applying the biomass estimating method in SSC. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Establishing reference conditions is essential for performing ecological status assessments of surface waters according to the EU Water Framework Directive. Ecological status is described as the deviation from undisturbed (reference) conditions. This paper presents the process of establishing preliminary reference values for chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and Secchi disc readings in different types of Polish lakes. This was done by selecting potential reference lakes and performing statistical analysis of the values of the main eutrophication parameters. The preliminary reference values for total phosphorus, chlorophyll, and Secchi disc depth were defined as 0.033 mgP dm(-3), 3.75 mu g dm(-3), and 3.6 m for stratified lakes, and 0.048 mgP dm(-3), 5.80 mu g dm(-3), and 2.5 m. for polymictic lakes, respectively.

AB  - We fed Herring Clupea pallasi to pairs of Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla throughout the breeding season in two years at a colony in the northern Gulf of Alaska. We measured responses to supplemental feeding in a wide array of breeding parameters to gauge their relative sensitivity to food supply, and thus their potential as indicators of natural foraging conditions. Conventional measures of success (hatching, fledging and overall productivity) were more effective as indicators of food supply than behavioural attributes such as courtship feeding, chick provisioning rates and sibling aggression. However, behaviour such as nest relief during incubation and adult attendance with older chicks were also highly responsive to supplemental food and may be useful for monitoring environmental conditions in studies of shorter duration. On average, the chick-rearing stage contained more sensitive indicators of food availability than prelaying or incubation stages. Overall, rates of hatching and fledging success, and the mean duration of incubation shifts were the most food-sensitive parameters studied.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explored physiological resilience to and recovery from saline exposure inPelophylax nigromaculatus, a semi-aquatic frog that is widely distributed in East Asia. Analysis of 11 serum components revealed the physiological response of frogs to either severe saline exposure for six days or moderate saline exposure for forty days, followed by a twenty day recovery period. During exposure to both severe and moderate saline conditions, serum electrolytes increased, protein concentrations in serum decreased, and creatinine, an indicator of renal function, sharply increased. However, renal tissue sampled after the study did not show renal dysfunction. Moreover, serum components that changed during exposure to salinity returned to their initial values during the recovery period. Adult anurans seem capable of resilience, to some extent, to saline conditions. Many freshwater ecosystems are becoming more saline, and amphibians, which have permeable skin, are sensitive to this change. We studied the physiological responses to high salinity and recovery from saline exposure in adult frogs (Pelophylax nigromaculatus). Frogs that experienced severe salinity were exposed to saline conditions for 6 days, while those in the moderate group were exposed to saline conditions for 40 days, followed by a recovery period in freshwater for 20 days. Our data showed that during exposure to saline conditions of severe and moderate groups, serum electrolytes increased, protein concentrations decreased, and creatinine, an indicator of renal function, sharply increased. However, renal tissue sampled after exposure did not show renal dysfunction. In addition, serum components that changed during exposure to salinity returned to their initial values during the recovery period. Thus, adult anurans can be resilient, to some extent, to saline conditions in habitats that experience either rapid or slow salinity changes.

AB  - Pursuit of the triple bottom line of economic, community and ecological sustainability has increased the complexity of fishery management; fisheries assessments require new types of data and analysis to guide science-based policy in addition to traditional biological information and modeling. We introduce the Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs), a broadly applicable and flexible tool for assessing performance in individual fisheries, and for establishing cross-sectional links between enabling conditions, management strategies and triple bottom line outcomes. Conceptually separating measures of performance, the FPIs use 68 individual outcome metrics-coded on a 1 to 5 scale based on expert assessment to facilitate application to data poor fisheries and sectors-that can be partitioned into sectorbased or triple-bottom-line sustainability-based interpretative indicators. Variation among outcomes is explained with 54 similarly structured metrics of inputs, management approaches and enabling conditions. Using 61 initial fishery case studies drawn from industrial and developing countries around the world, we demonstrate the inferential importance of tracking economic and community outcomes, in addition to resource status.

AB  - We suggest that a diagnostic procedure, not unlike that followed in medical practice, provides a logical basis for stream channel assessment and monitoring. Our argument is based on the observation that a particular indicator or measurement of stream channel condition can mean different things depending upon the local geomorphic context and history of the channel in question. This paper offers a conceptual framework for diagnosing channel condition, evaluating channel response, and developing channel monitoring programs. The proposed diagnostic framework assesses reach-level channel conditions as a function of location in the channel network, regional and local biogeomorphic context, controlling influences such as sediment supply and transport capacity, riparian vegetation, the supply of in-channel flow obstructions, and disturbance history. Field assessments of key valley bottom and active channel characteristics are needed to formulate an accurate diagnosis of channel conditions. A similar approach and level of understanding is needed to design effective monitoring programs, as stream type and channel state greatly affect the type and magnitude of channel response to changes in discharge and sediment loads. General predictions are made for five channel types with respect to the response of various stream characteristics to an increase in coarse sediment inputs, fine sediment inputs, and the size and frequency of peak flows, respectively. These predictions provide general hypotheses and guidance for channel assessment and monitoring. However, the formulation of specific diagnostic criteria and monitoring protocols must be tailored to specific geographic areas because of the variability in the controls on channel condition within river basins and between regions. The diagnostic approach to channel assessment and monitoring requires a relatively high level of training and experience, but proper application should result in useful interpretation of channel conditions and response potential.

AB  - Harvested wheat is a complex ecosystem with a rich enzymatic activity, located in the germ, contaminated with microorganisms and potentially infested with insects. Wheat quality assurance during storage represents a set of technical measures which are applied to direct the physical-chemical and biological processes within the mass of grains, to the purpose of maintaining them under good conditions, with minimum quality and quantity losses.
   This work presents a study on the influence of common wheat (Triticum aestivum, ssp. vulgare) belonging to the Romanian variety Dropia, intended for the obtaining food-grade flour. The prophylactic treatments were conducted using groups from the T+ toxicity group (K-obiol EC 25), in view of preserving the wheat under optimal conditions. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the post-harvest prophylactic treatments, which contribute to the preservation of wheat quality during extended storage. The applied treatment ensured protection from pests and, according to the determinations, it did not significantly change the initial values of the quality indicators for the stored wheat.

AB  - Reactivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the subsurface is of importance to environmental assessment, as they constitute a highly toxic hazard. Understanding their reactivity in the long term in natural recovering systems is thus a key issue. This article describes an experimental investigation on the air oxidation of fluoranthene (a PAH abundant in natural systems polluted by industrial coal use) at 100 degrees C on different mineral substrates commonly found in soils and sediments (quartz sand, limestone, and clay). Results demonstrate that fluoranthene is readily oxidized in the presence of limestone and clay, leading to the formation of high molecular weight compounds and a carbonaceous residue as end product especially for clay experiments. As demonstrated elsewhere, the experimental conditions used permitted the reproduction of the geochemical pathway of organic matter observed under natural conditions. It is therefore suggested that low-temperature, mineral-catalyzed air oxidation is a mechanism relevant to the stabilization of PAHs in sediments and soils.

AB  - The present study is a summary of recent findings concerning the desmid flora of the Swamp Nature Reserve and a small neighbouring bog. A total of 203 desmid taxa belonging to 22 genera were found, including 39 taxa that are considered very rare in the Czech Republic. Of this number, 46 taxa were found in the Swamp and 203 taxa in the neighbouring bog.
   The ecological condition of both localities was assessed on the basis of the species composition of the desmid Communities encountered. The results indicate that the present overall ecological situation of the Swamp is favourable for the development. of a characteristic, acidophilous desmid community. They also document quite an exceptional natural value of the second site studied, fully justifying its recent designation as part of the Swamp Nature Reserve. The results presented here may also be used in the future as a basis for comparative ecological studies tracing the development of both these sites.

AB  - A new method has been developed to perform environmental assessment at regional scale. This involves a combination of a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and principal component analysis (PCA). The method is capable of clustering ecosystems in terms of environmental conditions and suggesting relative cumulative environmental impacts of multiple factors across a large region. Using data on land-cover, population, roads, streams, air pollution, and topography of the Mid-Atlantic region, the method was able to indicate areas that are in relatively poor environmental condition or vulnerable to future deterioration. Combining the strengths of SOM with those of PCA, the method offers an easy and useful way to perform a regional environmental assessment. Compared with traditional clustering and ranking approaches, the described method has considerable advantages, such as providing a valuable means for visualizing complex multidimensional environmental data at multiple scales and offering a single assessment or ranking needed for a regional environmental assessment while still facilitating the opportunity for more detailed analyses.

AB  - Determining the environmental health status of the Strait of Malacca is crucial to prevent further deterioration of its unique marine ecosystems. A total of 18 surface sediment samples were collected from the northern sector of the strait for sediment quality analyses and assessment of the benthic Foraminiferal Stress Index (FSI). The results indicated that heavy metal enrichment has resulted in shifts in benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Canonical correspondence analyses confirmed that dissolved oxygen, heavy metal concentrations, and water depth were major factors influencing benthic foraminiferal distributions in the study area. Q-mode cluster analyses classified benthic foraminiferal assemblages into three groups based on environmental conditions: Group A represented very poor environmental conditions (FSI < 2) and was distributed closer to the coastline, where Pb and Al enrichment has reduced foraminiferal diversity. This study shows the value of using FSI as a monitoring tool in shallow tropical marine environments along the Strait of Malacca.

AB  - Cladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) quickly respond to changes in environmental conditions and their remains are usually found in large amounts in lacustrine sediments, which make them an important biological proxy in paleolimnological studies. Variations in species composition have been used to infer paleo-climate and paleo-environmental variables including lake depth, eutrophication, and deforestation. However, despite their advantages as bioindicators in the study of past conditions, they are underutilized in paleolimnological research in Central America due to limited knowledge about their diversity and the morphological differences between the subfossil remains of different taxa. In order to address this issue, we described and analyzed cladoceran remains from 56 waterbodies located in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Here, we provide a description of the remains from 10 different taxa that belong to the Sididae, Bosminidae, Daphniidae, Macrothricidae, and Ilyocryptidae families.

AB  - Ecosystems can experience catastrophic transitions to alternative states, yet recent results have suggested that slowing down in rates of recovery after a perturbation may provide advance warning that a critical transition is approaching. Perturbation experiments with microbial populations have supported this hypothesis under controlled laboratory conditions, but evidence from natural ecosystems remains rare. Here, we manipulated rocky intertidal canopy algae to test the hypothesis that the spatial scale at which the system recovers from a perturbation in space should increase as the system approaches the tipping point, marking the transition from a canopy-dominated to a turf-dominated state. Empirical estimates of recovery length, a recently proposed spatial indicator of an approaching tipping point, were obtained by comparing the spatial scale at which algal turfs propagated into canopy-degraded regions with decreasing canopy cover. We show that recovery length increased along the gradient in canopy degradation, providing field-based evidence of spatial signatures of critical slowing down in natural conditions.

AB  - The goal of this work was to study long-term behavior of anaerobically digested and dewatered sludge (biosolids) in a lagoon under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to determine the stability of the final product as an indicator of its odor potential. Field lagoons were sampled to estimate spatial and temporal variations in the physical-chemical properties and biological stability characteristics such as volatile solids content, accumulated oxygen uptake, and soluble protein content and odorous compound assessment. The analyses of collected data suggest that the surface layer of the lagoon (depth of above 0.15 m) undergoes long-term aerobic oxidation resulting in a higher degree of stabilization in the final product. The subsurface layers (depth 0.15 m below the surface and deeper) are subjected to an anaerobic environment where the conditions favor the initial rapid organic matter degradation within approximately the first year, followed by slow degradation.

AB  - In a survey for conservation of non-marine aquatic systems, the ostracod compositions of 43 water bodies sampled in central Spain were analysed by multivariate ordination (DCA) and classification (TWINSPAN) methods, showing a clear division in lake typology. The wide variety of life modes and habitat requirements of non-marine ostracod species yields assemblages of species of value as ecological indicators. Endorheic shallow lakes, highly temporary, are characterized by an assemblage of circum-Mediterranean and endemic species. Karstic and more stable lakes are inhabited by northern Holarctic or Palaearctic species, depending on the history and environmental conditions of the water body. Between these two extremes, the study of ostracod assemblages permits the distinction, on a finer scale, of a gradient of lake types with different disturbance conditions, resulting from a combination of hydrological, climatic, chemical and anthropogenic factors. At the extreme of that gradient, highly tolerant cosmopolitan species play an important role in the ostracod community of sites severely affected by human activities.

AB  - Catchment impacts on downstream ecosystems are difficult to quantify, but important for setting management targets. Here we compared 12 years of monitoring data of seagrass area and biomass in Cleveland Bay, northeast Australia, with discharge and associated sediment loads from nearby rivers. Seagrass biomass and area exhibited different trajectories in response to river inputs. River discharge was a slightly better predictor of seagrass indicators than total suspended solid (TSS) loads, indicating that catchment effects on seagrass are not restricted to sediment. Linear relationships between Burdekin River TSS loads delivered over 1-4 years and seagrass condition in Cleveland Bay generated Ecologically Relevant Targets (ERT) for catchment sediment inputs. Our predicted ERTs were comparable to those previously estimated using mechanistic models. This study highlights the challenges of linking catchment inputs to condition of downstream ecosystems, and the importance of integrating a variety of metrics and approaches to increase confidence in ERTs.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology that combines the power of an Artificial Neural Network and Information Theory to forecast variables describing the condition of a regional system. The novelty and strength of this approach is in the application of Fisher information, a key method in Information Theory, to preserve trends in the historical data and prevent over fitting projections. The methodology was applied to demographic, environmental, food and energy consumption, and agricultural production in the San Luis Basin regional system in Colorado, U.S.A. These variables are important for tracking conditions in human and natural systems. However, available data are often so far out of date that they limit the ability to manage these systems. Results indicate that the approaches developed provide viable tools for forecasting outcomes with the aim of assisting management toward sustainable trends. This methodology is also applicable for modeling different scenarios in other dynamic systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we assessed, under laboratory conditions, the toxicity of an active substance on solitary bee larvae of Osmia cornuta (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). A field-realistic dose of the systemic insecticide spirotetramat was applied to the mass provisions. The insecticide's effects on several life-cycle parameters were studied in males and females. Our results showed a significantly shorter post-emergence longevity in bees exposed to spirotetramat during the larval stage, compared to the control. The observed reduction in longevity was 18 and 15%, respectively, in males and females. Mortality rate and other biological traits (larval and spinning duration, emergence time, food/body conversion rate) did not show significant differences between the two treatments. The method described in this study can be used to test the effects of toxic substances (i.e. agrochemicals) on bees. Moreover, it can constitute a basis for the development of a standardised protocol in the first tier of the Environmental Risk Assessment for solitary bees.

AB  - Galena can be easily weathered under acid rain conditions and causes environmental issues. This process, in nature, is an electrochemical process. In situ electrochemical technology and surface analysis technology were combined to investigate this weathering process. The experimental results showed that galena weathering under simulated acid rain (SAR) could cause an initial increase in Pb2+ ions and result in the formation of a passive S-0 film, and the terminal product was SO42-. Increased acidity stimulates galena weathering, and the promotion efficiency was 2208% as the pH of the SAR decreased from 5.2 to 4.2. The presence of pyrite is favourable for galena weathering, and the promotion efficiency was 150% when contained 25% (wt%) pyrite. Galena will release 1.7 g per m(2) per year Pb2+ to solution when the pH of acid rain is 5.2, and the released Pb2+ will reach 95.7 g per m(2) per year when the pH of acid rain is 4.2 plus the galvanic effect of pyrite.

AB  - A nomogram is developed to show that pH, redox potentials (Eh(NHE)) and measures of dissolved sulfides (H2S + HS- + S2-)(total free S2-) can be used to classify organic enrichment impacts in marine sediments. The biogeochemical cycle of sulfur in marine sediments is described to show that changes in macrobenthic infauna community structure associated with high levels of organic matter supply result from stress due to oxygen deficiency (hypoxia and anoxia) and toxic effects of S2-. The changes reflect enhancement of microbial sulfate reduction under conditions of high organic matter sedimentation and the progressive formation of hypoxic-anoxic conditions measured by decreased EhNHE and increased concentrations of S2-. The nomogram provides a basis for classification of the oxic status of marine sediments based on changes in inter-related biological and biogeochemical variables along an organic enrichment gradient.

AB  - Collaborative management has gained popularity across the United States as a means of addressing the sustainability of mixed-ownership landscapes and resolving persistent conflicts in public lands management. At the same time, it has generated skepticism because its ecological and social outcomes are seldom measured. Evaluating the success of collaborative efforts is difficult because frameworks to assess on-the-ground outcomes are poorly developed or altogether lacking. Ecosystem health indicators are valuable tools for evaluating site-specific outcomes of collaboration based on the effects of collaboration on ecological and socioeconomic conditions. We present the holistic ecosystem health indicator, a promising framework for evaluating the outcomes of collaborative processes, which uses ecological, social, and interactive indicators to monitor conditions through time. Finally, we draw upon our experience working with the Diablo Trust, a community-based collaborative group in northern Arizona, USA, to illustrate the development of an indicator selection model generated through a stakeholder-driven process.

AB  - Marine birds are sensitive indicators of the condition of marine ecosystems in the Arctic, partly because they feed at the top of the arctic food chain. The Northern Ecosystem Initiative (NEI) recently supported four separate studies that investigated aspects of Arctic marine bird science which simultaneously addressed goals of the NEI to better understand northern ecosystems and their response to environmental stressors. The projects used both scientific and traditional knowledge to examine the relationship between sea-ice, contaminants, and the ecology of marine birds, and to transfer environmental knowledge to students. Results from these investigations confirm that changes are occurring in Arctic environments, and that these are captured through marine bird research. Collectively these studies provided new data that supported NEI objectives of monitoring the health of the Arctic ecosystem, and contributed to Canada's international obligations for Arctic science.

AB  - Variation in environmental conditions at a foraging area or at a nesting rookery has the potential to impact reproductive output of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) by affecting food resources or the nesting substrate. In this paper we test whether turtles' physiological characteristics reflect variation in relevant environmental conditions. We did this by profiling metabolic and hormonal markers among (1) non-vitellogenic females from three different foraging areas and (2) nesting females from different rookeries and breeding seasons. Among the non-vitellogenic females, the highest plasma triglyceride concentrations (4.29 mmol/l) and the lowest plasma cholesterol concentrations (1.27 mmol/l) were found in non-vitellogenic females residing in Moreton Bay during the El Ni (n) over tildeo year of 1997. Furthermore, during 1997, these Moreton Bay females had higher plasma triglyceride and lower cholesterol concentrations than those recorded in non-vitellogenic females foraging at Heron Reef (triglyceride 1.22 mmol/l and cholesterol 4.53 mmol/l) and Shoalwater Bay (triglyceride 1.69 mmol/l and cholesterol 3.50 mmol/l) in the same year. Among nesting turtles, those nesting at Raine Island had low mean plasma triglyceride concentrations during the high density 1996 nesting season. For those nesting at Heron Island, the mean triglyceride concentrations were the lowest during the 1997 nesting season. This is the first time that hormone and metabolic markers have been used in concert to compare the physiological condition of nesting and foraging sea turtles and its relationship with the environment. Collectively, our data indicate that variation in the environmental conditions at both foraging and nesting areas are reflected at a physiological level. Moreover, our study indicates that turtles feeding during El Ni (n) over tildeo years are able to attain higher levels of body condition, and that physiological data combined with morphometric data is a useful proxy for assessing the condition of turtles in foraging areas.

However, little is known about quantitative relationships between transpirational demand and multiple meteorological factors, and how plants respond to short-time (day-to-day) changes in transpirational demand at the gene and molecular levels. We used a physical-based model of heat balance and transfer at a saturated surface to quantify the sensitivity of potential evaporation (Ep; a hydrometeorological indicator of transpirational demand) to each meteorological factor under a wide range of climatic conditions. Sensitivity analysis showed that Ep varies dynamically in time and space with meteorological conditions. That is, Ep changes commensurately with solar radiation Sd, somewhat increases with wind speed WS, while somewhat decreases with increasing relative humidity Rh. The sensitivity of Ep to WS and Rh increases with decreasing Sd. The logarithm of Ep decreases approximately linearly with increasing inverse absolute temperature. The validity of use of Ep as the transpirational demand under natural field conditions was confirmed by high correlation between hourly based Ep and hourly evapotranspiration in the flooded rice paddy fields. We also examined the effects of short-term changes in Ep on transpiration (ET) and transcriptomes of rice at the heading stage by altering meteorological conditions on sunny days for four hours. ET changed commensurately with Ep, and the expression levels of numerous genes, including those encoding aquaporins in rice leaves and roots, showed a significant positive or negative correlation with ET, especially in leaves. The present study suggests that rice plants may adjust their physiological condition, such as hydraulic conductivity and mesophyll conductance, through dynamic transcriptome changes in response to transpirational demand under fluctuating meteorological conditions.

AB  - This research focuses on coral reef health in the South Pacific region, an area of high global coral diversity. Coral reef health surrounding two study sites in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, has been assessed in areas that have not been previously surveyed. Each study site has distinct differences based upon marine management practices. Marine management practices are identified and described and some historical reasons as why they exist are discussed. Data are also presented on the ecological condition (coral coverage, number of coral species, clonal condition, disease, and presence and absence of bioindicators). This interdisciplinary research methodology includes both ecological and social data collection to further understand human-environment interactions. In comparing the reefs with different management practices, I argue that the implementation of traditional marine social institutions as exemplified in this case study of the Ra'ui in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, is an effective conservation management tool and is improving coral reef health. The Ra'ui site has significantly higher species diversity/Mortality Index (F = 2.63).

AB  - During the last decades, energy and process integration have become the most spread practices to optimize chemical processes both from economic and environmental perspectives. While the design of the integrated and conventional configurations are usually compared by referring to nominal operating conditions, assessing the implications of process integration on system flexibility could be of critical importance, especially when considering the uncertain nature of renewables. This paper aims then at the comparison of different integrated and conventional unit design performances under uncertain conditions by means of a biorefinery Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol separation case study. An indirect distillation train and different configurations of Dividing Wall Column have been designed and compared to assess the environmental and economic advantages for different flexibility ranges. The proposed methodology allows to select the most suitable configuration for the required performance and to have more conscious expectations about investment costs and emissions when flexibility is taken into account.

AB  - Effects of pollutants on the morphological parameters of Pelophylax ridibundus populations were examined at two sites in southern Bulgaria: the Rice Fields Tsalapitsa (RF) and the river Vacha (Reference site, RS). Morphological analysis showed significantly different values of the index for fluctuating asymmetry (FAMI) and body condition factor (CF) in frogs from RF compared to those from RS. These findings provide information on the long-term background pollution of RF. The lower values of body CF and the high levels of FA of P. ridibundus populations from RF are considered as a consequence of the negative effects of the presence of xenobiotics in paddy cages probably pesticides and fertilizers. The present result prove the potential for practical application of integral indicator for developmental stability, i.e. the fluctuating asymmetry in the P. ridibundus populations, in bioindication analyses for assessment of the ecological status of agroecosystems.

AB  - The article summarizes the influence of farm conditions on sows blood morphological parameters. Our research was carried out in the farms of Zolochiv and Starosambir districts of the Lviv region (Ukraine) and revealed strong violations of animals feeding, both in terms of nutrition, and on the macro- and microelement composition. In all the farms, there was practically no appropriate way to feeding sows from different physiological groups, which may further adversely affect the growth and development of the resulting offspring. The parameters of the microclimate in the premises were invested in the limits of permissible norms. The differences between farms were production process and pigs keeping. Animals of the Zolochiv region were not registered and had the opportunity to move freely, to nest before the farrowing, to satisfy their physiological needs for food search (to dig, to throw the bedding), without barriers to consume food and water. In the farm of the Starosambir district the sows were kept in individual fixing machines, they were restricted in movement, free choice of place for rest, manifestation of natural behavior, the ability to satisfy the instinct of nesting and show the instinct of caring for the offspring. Free holding of sows have a positive effect on the processes of hematopoiesis. The blood of these animals had more red blood cells and the hemoglobin concentration was higher. It was also proved that the most susceptible to the conditions of containment were farrowing sows from both farms, as evidenced by the morphological indices of blood. Thus, the number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit magnitude and red blood indices in animals of this physiological group are recorded at the lower limit of the physiological norm.

AB  - Phytolith assemblages in plant leaf tissues can vary in response to seasonal climatic conditions and to their bio-synthetic formation mechanisms. They therefore have potential ecological and environmental significance. Bamboo, a widely distributed plant, is an important ecological indicator because it produces some characteristic phytoliths. Assemblages of phytoliths in fresh leaves of the bamboo Dendrocalamus ronganensis were studied over a 21-month period to explore for links between them and plant growth and investigate their responses to seasonal climate changes. The results show that phytolith assemblages vary throughout the growing season, that the variations in phytolith assemblages are related to the age and/or maturity of plant leaves, and that leaf phytolith assemblages are influenced by physiology of cells and/or seasonal climatic changes. This work is helpful to understand the mechanisms of phytolith formation and to provide a theoretical basis for using phytoliths as a tool in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - Random deviations from the perfect symmetry of normally bilaterally symmetrical characters exist during individual development as a result of various environmental conditions. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often used as a measurement of developmental instability, and within-environmental variation (CVe) is also considered as an indicator of developmental deviations. These two parameters may indicate the quality of the environmental habitat of organisms. For herbivore insects, such as aphids, any change in their host plants conditions is important and directly affects their development. The presented investigation revealed that both Lead (Pb) and Copper (Cu) accumulation in different host plants resulted in a significant amount of deviations from bilateral symmetry in cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae). Cabbage aphid populations showed higher FA and CV, on heavy metal accumulated cabbage and radish than on non-contaminated cabbage and radish plants. However, the pattern between developmental instability and fitness measurements was inconsistent. Thus, this study does not support the hypothesis that asymmetry is a valuable bioindicator of developmental instability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the number of fires in the Split-Dalmatia County area has increased rapidly, especially in the summer. The fire may occur naturally (a stroke, a volcanic eruption) or intentional or unintentional human action. In addition to economic losses, a fire may cause people to be killed, animal and plant deaths, destruction of housing and economic facilities, as well as environmental pollution that surrounds us. For these reasons, it is very important to develop an efficient management and response system in such exceptional situations. The Copernicus program, developed within the European Union, helps us greatly. This paper reviews the Sentinel-2 satellite missions. The area around Split was selected, affected by a catastrophic fire in July 2017. A normalized index of flared vegetation was used as an indicator for assessing the condition and size of the affected area. Also, mapping of areas affected by fire as well as analysis of vegetation status before and after the fire were made.

AB  - Arthrobacter is a dominant aerobic bacterium under the class Actinobacteria, known for its nutritionally versatile nature and wide prevalence in stressful environments. In the current study representative two strains of Arthrobacter, ERGS1:01 and ERGS4:06, with efficient survivability under high altitude stress conditions were selected for comparative genomic studies with their mesophilic counterparts. Physiological analysis and genome insights supported the survival of these strains under multiple high-altitude stress conditions. Molecular cold adaptation and substitution analysis of the studied strains supported the incidence of more cold-adapted proteins for functionality at low temperatures. Studied strains preferred amino acids like serine, asparagine, lysine, tryptophan for favoring increased flexibility supporting their broad temperature survivability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular cold adaptation analysis performed for the genus Arthrobacter and has revealed that 'aromaticity', one of the cold-adaptor indicators, should be carefully considered while evaluating cold adaptation strategies in psychrotrophic/psychrophilic bacteria.

AB  - Echolocating bats are regularly studied to investigate auditory-guided behaviors and as important bioindicators. Bioacoustic monitoring methods based on echolocation calls are increasingly used for risk assessment and to ultimately inform conservation strategies for bats. As echolocation calls transmit through the air at the speed of sound, they undergo changes due to atmospheric and geometric attenuation. Both the speed of sound and atmospheric attenuation, however, are variable and determined by weather conditions, particularly temperature and relative humidity. Changing weather conditions thus cause variation in analyzed call parameters, limiting our ability to detect, and correctly analyze bat calls. Here, I use real-world weather data to exemplify the effect of varying weather conditions on the acoustic properties of air. I then present atmospheric attenuation and speed of sound for the global range of weather conditions and bat call frequencies to show their relative effects. Atmospheric attenuation is a nonlinear function of call frequency, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. While atmospheric attenuation is strongly positively correlated with call frequency, it is also significantly influenced by temperature and relative humidity in a complex nonlinear fashion. Variable weather conditions thus result in variable and unknown effects on the recorded call, affecting estimates of call frequency and intensity, particularly for high frequencies. Weather-induced variation in speed of sound reaches up to about +/- 3%, but is generally much smaller and only relevant for acoustic localization methods of bats. The frequency- and weather-dependent variation in atmospheric attenuation has a threefold effect on bioacoustic monitoring of bats: It limits our capability (1) to monitor bats equally across time, space, and species, (2) to correctly measure frequency parameters of bat echolocation calls, particularly for high frequencies, and (3) to correctly identify bat species in species-rich assemblies or for sympatric species with similar call designs.

AB  - The present work aims to provide insight into interactions between trace metals and higher plants, focusing on nickel uptake and its effects in seagrasses at environmentally relevant concentrations. Total and intracellular nickel accumulation kinetics, nickel effects on structural cell components, oxidative stress marker and cellular viability, and the accumulation kinetics-toxic effects relationship were investigated in leaves of Halophila stipulacea plants incubated in seawater under laboratory conditions containing nickel ions at 0.01-10 mg L-1 for 14 days. Nickel accumulation kinetics in H. stipulacea young and older apical leaves followed a Michaelis-Mententype equation, allowing the calculation of uptake parameters; uptake rate (V-c) and equilibrium concentration (C-eq) tended to increase with the increase of nickel concentration in the medium. A doseand uptake parameter dependent actin filament (AF) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) impairment was observed, whereas no effects occurred on microtubules and cell ultrastructure. AF disturbance and ER aggregation were firstly observed in differentiated cells at the lowest concentration on the 12th and 14th day, respectively, while AF disruption in meristematic cells firstly occurred at 0.05 mg L-1; the effects appeared earlier and were more acute at higher concentrations. Increased H2O2 levels were detected, while, at the highest exposures, a significant reduction in epidermal cell viability in older leaves occurred. The lowest total nickel concentrations in young leaves associated with AF disturbance onset at nickel exposure concentrations of 0.01-1 mg L-1 varied between 18.98 and 63.93 mu g g(-1) dry wt; importantly, they were comparable to nickel concentrations detected in seagrass leaves from various locations. The relationships between exposure concentration, uptake kinetic parameters and toxic effect onset were satisfactorily described by regression models. Our findings suggest that (a) nickel may pose a threat to seagrass meadows, (b) H. stipulacea can be regarded as an efficient biomonitor of nickel, (c) AF and ER impairment in seagrass leaves can be considered as early biomarkers of nickel-induced stress, and (d) the regression models obtained can be used as a tool to evaluate ambient nickel levels and to detect ecotoxicologically significant nickel contamination. The data presented can be utilized in the management and conservation of the coastal environment.

AB  - Elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) as a concomitant of global climate change may facilitate the establishment of future seagrass meadows and subsequently its benefit could be incorporated into techniques to increase restoration success. In five manipulative experiments, we determined how increased CO2 affects the maturation of flowers, and the development of seeds and seedlings for the foundation species Zostera marina. Experiments tested the development from both seeds collected from non-treated flowering shoots (direct) and seeds harvested from flowering shoots after CO2 exposure (parental carryover). Flowering shoots were collected along the western coast of Sweden near the island of Skafto. The seeds produced were used in experiments conducted at Kristineberg, Sweden and Dauphin Island, AL, United States. Experiments varied in temperature (16, 18 degrees C) and salinity (19, 33 ppt), as well as duration and magnitude of elevated CO2 exposure. Environmental conditions among experiments, such as temperature (16, 18 degrees C) and salinity (19, 33 ppt), as well as duration and magnitude of pCO(2) exposure differed. Flowering maturation, spathe number, seed production, and indicators of seed quality did not appear to be affected by 39-69 days of exposure to CO2 conditions outside of natural variability (pCO(2) = 1547.2 +/- 267.60 mu atm; pH(T) = 7.53 +/- 0.07). Yet, seeds produced from these flowers showed twofold greater germination success. In another experiment, flowering shoots were exposed to an extreme CO2 condition (pCO(2) = 5950.7 +/- 1,849.82 mu atm; pH(T) = 6.96 +/- 0.15). In this case, flowers generated seeds that demonstrated a fivefold increase in an indicator for seed viability (sinking velocity). In the latter experiment, however, germination appeared unaffected. Direct CO2 effects on germination and seedling production were not observed. Our results provide evidence of a parental CO2 effect that can benefit germination or seed viability, but early benefits may not lead to bed establishment if other environmental conditions are not well suited for seedling development. Outcomes have implications for restoration; CO2 can be supplied to flowering shoot holding tanks to bolster success when the purpose is to redistribute seeds to locations where beds are extant and water quality is adequate.

AB  - While marine sediments have been used to constrain a history of redox chemistry throughout the Precambrian, far fewer data have been generated from lakes. With major biological innovations thought to have occurred in Proterozoic lakes, understanding their chemistry is critical for understanding the evolution of eukaryotic life. We use sediment geochemistry to characterize the redox conditions of the Nonesuch Formation (similar to 1.1 Ga) and a modern analogue for the Proterozoic: the Middle Island Sinkhole in Lake Huron (USA). Iron speciation, Mo contents, and Mo-U covariation demonstrate oxic and anoxic-not euxinic-environments, with no clear indicators of enhanced biological productivity in the Nonesuch Formation. Moderate Mo enrichments observed in the Nonesuch Formation are not attributed to euxinia, but instead to an authigenic particulate shuttle. We suggest that the Fe and Mo sediment geochemistry of these lacustrine systems reflect only local water column and sediment burial conditions and not atmospheric oxygenation.

AB  - This article focuses on the diatom assemblages and geochemical composition of sediment cores retrieved from the Pomeranian Bay. We also discuss similarities and differences in the diatom assemblages and the palaeogeographic development of nearby regions. Our main objective was to determine the characteristics and rate of the Littorina transgression in the Pomeranian Bay area. Sediments were divided into units based on differences in the distribution of diatom ecological groups and in geochemical ratios, such as Mg/Ca, Na/K and Fe/Mn. This study identified lacustrine sediments deposited during the time of the Ancylus Lake. This lacustrine-period sedimentation took place in a shallow lake under aerobic conditions. The record of the onset of marine environment dates to 8900-8300 cal BP and corresponds to the Littorina transgression. After about 8300 cal BP, sedimentation took place in a deeper marine environment with higher biogenic production and anaerobic conditions. The abrupt appearance of marine diatom species and increased geochemical salinity indicators reflect the large impact of the Littorina transgression on the Pomeranian Bay environment.

AB  - Salt marshes are worldwide recognized for their unique and important ecological role. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC), the frequency and intensity of warming events will rise due to global changes. Halophyte plants, inhabiting salt marshes are known for being highly tolerant to various abiotic stresses, nonetheless, although it has been acknowledged that the tolerance response is species specific there could also be differences at the population level. The present work aims to determine if the life history of two halophytes (Halimione portulacoides and Spartina patens), namely in terms of contaminant exposure, influences inter-populational heat tolerance. For this purpose, individuals from both species collected at pristine and contaminated sites were exposed to normal and increased temperature conditions, and its physiological fitness evaluated throughout biochemical and biophysical analysis. The photobiological traits, pigment and fatty acid profiles and oxidative stress biomarkers analyses of warming treated individuals, indicate that chronic heavy metal pre-conditioning significantly influences the heat stress tolerance of the native halophyte plants. Halimione portulacoides individuals collected at heavy metal contaminated salt marsh appeared more tolerant to heat stress. On the other hand, the invasive S. patens from the pristine site showed higher tolerance to heat stress. Thus, the pre-conditioning influences the tolerance mechanisms can affect the way in which salt marsh communities will evolve in the future, possibly being different through salt marshes. The contaminated marsh can be more resilient to invasion than the non-contaminated marsh, since the native species has benefited from this pre-conditioning. Moreover, and from the ecophysiological point the set of biophysical and biochemical indicators were tested, show a high efficiency in describing the ecophysiological traits, both between species and populations, facing different pre-conditioning histories.

AB  - Anatomical characteristics and hydrologic signals in tree-rings of oaks from areas with regular flooding may vary, even within the same forest stand, and largely depend on the micro-environmental conditions.
   Q. robur decline in European floodplain forests in recent years seems to be strongly associated with the deteriorating hydrological regime. We investigated the influence of the Krka River flow on tree-ring patterns of Q. robur from the Krakovo floodplain forests (Slovenia) to assess the effect of micro-location conditions on hydrological signals in wood-anatomical characteristics. We selected two groups of Q. robur trees growing at nearby locations with different hydrological conditions, resulting in frequent autumn and spring flooding at the wetter site (=W oaks) but no flooding at the other, drier site (=D oaks). We found differences between the two groups in the anatomical structure of tree-rings; however, ring width proved to be the main variable determining the anatomical structure of oak wood. D and W oaks responded differently to the Krka River flow in the studied period. Radial growth of D oaks was negatively influenced by spring flow, but positively influenced by minimum summer flow. In W oaks, ring width was positively correlated with mean summer flow. Thus, environmental information stored in wood-anatomical features may vary, even within the same forest stand, and largely depends on the micro-environment. Reduced wood increments of D oaks suggest that growth conditions are less favourable, implying a link between the health state of oaks from lowland forest and hydrological conditions. Trees intended for hydrological reconstruction must therefore be carefully selected to avoid the possibility of error and potential loss of information. Anatomical characteristics and hydrological signals in tree-rings of oaks from areas with regular flooding may vary, even within the same forest stand, and largely depends on the micro-environmental conditions.

AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHSP) are ubiquitously found in all organisms, and with other heat shock proteins (HSP) such as HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, HSP100 made up the molecular chaperone family. They are involved in a wide range of biological processes which include among others cell resistance to biological and environmental stress conditions. In this study, we show by western blotting that CeHSP17, an sHSP of Caenorhabiditis elegans, is significantly induced by high temperatures. Furthermore, in response to metal stress, the CeHSP17 protein expression was significantly induced by cadmium and zinc at high concentration of clearly cytotoxic range in wild-type C. elegans. Altogether, our results show the involvement of CeHSP17 protein in both environmental and biological stresses in C. elegans and establish for the first time the expression pattern of the CeHSP17 protein in response to thermal and metal stress conditions in C. elegans. The responses of CeHSP17 protein expression may serve as potential sensitive biomarker for metal-induced toxicity monitoring and environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Associations between delta C-13 values and leaf gas exchanges and tree-ring or needle growth, used in ecophysiological compositions, can be complex depending on the relative timing of CO2 uptake and subsequent redistribution and allocation of carbon to needle and stem components. For palaeoenvironmental and dendroecological studies it is often interpreted in terms of a simple model of delta C-13 fractionation in C-3 plants. However, in spite of potential complicating factors, few studies have actually examined these relationships in mature trees over inter- and intra-annual time-scales. Here, we present results from a 4 years study that investigated the links between variations in leaf gas-exchange properties, growth, and dated delta C-13 values along the needles and across tree rings of Aleppo pine trees growing in a semi-arid region under natural conditions or with supplemental summer irrigation. Sub-sections of tissue across annual rings and along needles, for which time of formation was resolved from growth rate analyses, showed rapid growth and 6 C responses to changing environmental conditions. Seasonal cycles of growth and delta C-13 (Up to similar to 4%.) significantly correlated (P<0.01) with photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit, air temperature, and soil water content. The irrigation significantly increased leaf net assimilation, stomatal conductance and needle and tree-ring growth rate, and markedly decreased needle and tree-ring delta C-13 values and its sensitivity to environmental parameters. The delta C-13 estimates derived from gas-exchange parameters, and weighted by assimilation, compared closely with seasonal and inter-annual delta C-13 values of needle- and tree-ring tissue. Higher stomatal conductances of the irrigated trees (0.22 vs. 0.08 mol m(-2) s(-1) on average) corresponded with similar to 2.0% lower average delta C-13 values, both measured and derived. Derived and measured delta C-13 values also indicated that needle growth, which occurs throughout the stressful summer was supported by carbon from concurrent, low rate assimilation. For Aleppo pine under semi-arid and irrigated conditions, the delta C-13 of tree-ring and needle material proved, in general, to be a reasonable indicator of integrated leaf gas-exchange properties.

AB  - Coasts are increasingly subject to the pressure of human activities, thus bioindicators of stress are also becoming necessary. We tested whether the otolith shape of Oblada melanura juveniles could be used as indicator of anthropic impacts. Otolith shapes, defined by Fourier elliptic analysis, were compared using canonical analysis of principal coordinates. In this three-year study, we compared two geographically close sites: one with low-level pollution and one near a recreational harbour. Determining the minimum fish standard length at which the influence of fish size on otolith shape does not occult other influences, 11mm in this study, is a prerequisite for the study of otolith shape variation in juveniles. Inter-annual environmental variations interfere with local conditions and delays between samplings are also important considerations. We have demonstrated that the comparison of O. melanura juvenile otolith shape is an effective method to compare the short-term influence of different environmental conditions.

AB  - The review examines a range of global literature concerning the beetle families Staphylinidae and Tenebrionidae, to evaluate their potential as indicators of sustainable landscape management in the Australian context. Both beetle families are diverse, widespread, easily collected and functionally important in a wide range of habitats in Australia. Both families are responsive to changes in environmental conditions, although the nature of the response depends on the environmental condition and often on the individual species. The response of staphylinids and tenebrionids to environmental change has reflected that of other invertebrate species or groups in some instances. Sustainability indicators need to be linked to management objectives and land managers need to be involved in the indicator selection process. Sampling, identification and assessment methods designed to match land managers' capabilities should result in an increase in the use of staphylinids and tenebrionids as sustainability indicators.

AB  - Total heavy metal concentrations in marine sediments are not sufficient to reliably predict detrimental biological effects. Here we provide evidence that only bioavailable heavy metals have a significant impact on benthic microbial loop functioning. Sediment samples collected along 250 km of the Apulian coast (Mediterranean Sea) were analysed for total and bioavailable heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Ph and Cu), organic matter content, bacterial abundance, biomass and carbon production and beta-glucosidase activity. Sampling strategy was specifically designed to cover a wide range of environmental conditions and types of anthropogenic influences. Total heavy metal concentrations in the sediments were tightly coupled with organic matter content, whereas bioavailable heavy metal concentrations displayed an opposite pattern. Bioavailable Cr concentrations were up to 10-fold higher than values observed for the other bioavailable metals and significantly inhibited benthic bacterial metabolism and turnover. Results from this study suggest that functional microbial variables are highly sensitive to heavy metal contamination and could be used as bioindicators of stress conditions in coastal sediments.

AB  - Following the upsurge of Q fever epidemic in the village Jedlove Kostolany, Nitra district, Slovakia, in April 1993, the possibility of the penetration of coxiellae into free nature was investigated for the next two years. Micromammals and their ectoparasites, primarily ticks, were employed as indicators of the presence of the infection in nature. The infestation of mammals and their ectoparasites was followed in J. Kostolany on the farm where the goats were housed as well as in its close proximity. The infestation of ticks with coxiellae was further followed in four localities of the Rimavska Sobota district, where the goats after the eradication of Q fever outbreak in J. Kostolany were transferred for breeding. The presence of coxiellae was not proved in these investigated localities. It is suggested that the pathogenicity of imported C. burnetii strains through Bulgarian goats was decreased under local environmental conditions including the ability to circulate freely in nature or these strains found inconvenient conditions for maintaining their viability.

AB  - If restoration is to become effective, able to compete for limited funds and truly adaptive, it must become evidence-based. Three of the conditions essential for the establishment and advancement of evidence-based restoration are (1) collection of baseline information; (2) setting clearly defined goals; and (3) relevant and adequate monitoring. Using a literature review, complemented with an online survey, we reviewed 10 restoration programs in South Africa to assess whether current restoration practice meets these conditions. The review showed good collection of baseline information and the setting of restoration goals that span ecological and socioeconomic considerations. However, to a large extent goals were poorly defined, there was more monitoring of inputs than outcomes, and monitoring of ecological indicators was inconsistent. These shortcomings can undermine restoration impacts, as well as the future sustainability of these expensive programs. We conclude with recommendations on how to mainstream the requirements of evidence-based restoration into current and proposed restoration programs.

AB  - The metabolic regulations of evergreen Mediterranean Quercus ilex trees growing at extra-urban and urban sites with different percentages of surrounding impervious pavements and distance to major traffic roads were investigated at the peak of the summer drought season. Plants from extra-urban site experienced lower water stress due to a fine regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, concomitant rise of anion superoxide and hydrogen peroxide content, +55 and +44%), abscisic acid and water soluble carbohydrates (+111 and +9%). The level of ROS was kept under the injury threshold by both enzymatic and metabolic antioxidants. Plants from the sub-urban site followed a different strategy, with a lower production of ROS and the concomitant reduction in phenols and carotenoids. Despite these differences, indications for stress-induced injury were not observed in any of the sites. Our work shows new relations between urban stress conditions and metabolic regulations of trees growing under such harsh environments.

AB  - Wildlife managers have little or no control over climate change. However, they may be able to alleviate potential adverse impacts of future climate change by adaptively managing wildlife for climate change. In particular, wildlife managers can evaluate the efficacy of compensatory management actions (CMAs) in alleviating potential adverse impacts of future climate change on wildlife species using probability-based or fuzzy decision rules. Application of probability-based decision rules requires managers to specify certain probabilities, which is not possible when they are uncertain about the relationships between observed and true ecological conditions for a species. Under such uncertainty, the efficacy of CMAs can be evaluated and the best CMA selected using fuzzy decision rules. The latter are described and demonstrated using three constructed cases that assume: (1) a single ecological indicator (e.g., population size for a species) in a single time period; (2) multiple ecological indicators for a species in a single time period; and (3) multiple ecological conditions for a species in multiple time periods.

AB  - Testate amoebae (Protozoa: Testacea) were studied in the Late Quaternary permafrost deposits in the Siberian Arctic (Bykovsky Peninsula of the Laptev Sea coast, 71degrees40'-71degrees80'N and 129degrees-129degrees30'E). The Testacea associations studied reflect specific environmental conditions in paleocryosols, which were controlled by the local micro-relief as well as by regional climate conditions. In total, 86 species, varieties, and forms of testate amoebae were found in 38 Pleistocene and Holocene samples. The rhizopods indicate that soil conditions at ca. 53,000 C-14 years BP were probably rather similar to the modem cold and wet arctic tundra environment. More moisture and warmer soil conditions were relatively favorable for rhizopods ca. 45,300-43,000 C-14 years BP, but it was significantly drier at about 42,000 C-14 years BP. Drier and colder environmental conditions were also present about 39,300-35,000 C-14 years BP. The Late Pleistocene samples, radiocarbon dated to 33,000-12,000 years BP, are characterized by a low species diversity and density indicating that this period may have been extremely cold and dry. This conjecture is also supported by the polymorphism of some species. Hydrophilic Difflugia species (mostly obligate hydrobiotes) are broadly represented in the studied Holocene samples. The species composition and density of rhizopods in the majority of Holocene samples suggest wet and relatively warm conditions. Changes in rhizopod assemblages during the last 53,000 years were not very dramatic, mostly consisting of rare species and changes in the dominant species complexes during the Pleistocene and Holocene. However, these changes were more drastic during the Pleistocene. They were probably at least partly responsible for the disappearance of some rare testacean species such as Argynnia sp.

AB  - The article proposes methods for determining the optimal thermal insulation thickness for economic and ecological reasons, depending on the number of degree days of the heating period. Life cycle assessment was used for the ecological analysis. Analyses were performed for selected variants typical of Polish conditions. The optimal thermal insulation thickness as well as the amount of economic and ecological benefits depends very much on the condition of the building without thermal insulation, but also on the heat source used and the thermal insulation material to be used. For each variant, the optimal thermal insulation thickness for ecological reasons is much greater than the optimal for economic reasons. Taking into consideration the climatic zone and the associated number of degree days of the heating period, the colder the zone, the greater the optimal insulation thickness, as well as economic and ecological benefits.

AB  - Several virulence factors are involved in Listeria monocytogenes pathogenicity. L. monocytogenes internalins, particularly internalin A, are required for bacterial adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells. The expression of internalins is thus related to virulence. Identification of conditions involved in regulating the expression of L. monocytogenes virulence factors is essential for developing targeted strategies to control listeriosis incidence and improving therapeutic approaches. The primary aim of this study was to develop a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR platform to study the impact of environmental factors on L. monocytogenes Scott A virulence factor expression, particularly in potentially complex ecosystems. A Taqman PCR-based, rapid quantitative gene expression evaluation method was established with the L. monocytogenes ribosomal protein L4 encoding gene used as an internal standard. Our data suggest that inlA expression is influenced by food composition and temperature, indicating that certain food processing or storage conditions, such as the use of lactic and acetic acids at common storage temperatures, could affect the expression of L. monocytogenes virulence factor.

AB  - An objective index, the Sludge Biotic Index (SBI), based on the microfauna associated with activated-sludge mixed liquor, has been devised to monitor activated-sludge plant performance. The proposed method makes it possible to define the biological quality of the sludge using numerical values (biotic index) of 0-10, and to group SBI values into four quality classes. The method is based on two principles. First, the dominance of the microfauna keygroups changes in relation to the environmental and operational conditions of the plant. In particular, some protozoa such as small flagellates and the ciliates Vorticella microstoma and Opercularia spp have a negative influence on the index value. Secondly, the number of morphological species is reduced as the performance of the plant gets worse. The advantage of this method over other schemes is that it provides numerical values which enable the operator to monitor the prevalent plant operating conditions on a daily basis.

AB  - Background: Sensory bias models explaining the evolution of sexually selected traits predict that trait preferences evolve as an artifact of a pre-existing preference for certain components of the environment such as specifically coloured prey. Indicator models, in contrast, predict that sexually selected traits indicate mate condition. We investigate the potential for sensory exploitation and condition indication models to explain the evolution of what appears to be a recently evolved sexually selected trait.
   Question: Did red pelvic spine coloration in male Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge (TNWR) brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) evolve to exploit a pre-existing sensory bias for red prey, thus helping males draw females to the nest? Or, did it evolve as an intersexual signal indicating male condition to females?
   Methods: We recorded the frequency of red pelvic spine coloration in males versus females and in breeding versus non-breeding males. We measured the condition factor of males with and without red coloration on their pelvic spines. We presented fish with a paired choice between a red versus an orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple bead, and recorded the proportion of bites at each colour.
   Results: Red coloration was significantly more common in males than in females and in males during the breeding season than outside the breeding season. Males with strongly red pelvic spines have a significantly higher mean condition factor than those with plain spines. TNWR brook stickleback prefer red to other colours in a predation context.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that TNWR brook stickleback red pelvic spine coloration is a secondary sexual character that may exploit a pre-existing sensory bias for red prey while also indicating condition to females.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have propelled the exploitation of natural environments, which along with climate change have resulted in salinity intrusion to freshwater ecosystems worldwide. To determine the extent the hypersalinity stressor has on freshwater ecosystems, physiological cardiac responses in the freshwater gastropod Melanoides tuberculata were analysed during an acute exposure to varying salinity concentrations. A non-invasive method was used to monitor the cardiac activity of the organisms. The mean heart rate (bpm) of M. tuberculata declined significantly between 20 ppt and 30 ppt. Melanoides tuberculata exhibited a hypersalinity threshold of 25 ppt and tolerated salinity concentrations up to 50 ppt. Data collected provide background data for the use of M. tuberculata as a bioindicator organism to assess the effects of hypersalinity on cardiac response of organisms in a freshwater ecosystem.

AB  - Sustainable forest management is described, in theory and in practice, especially in the regions where the forest resources have been damaged seriously for economic development. It emphasizes the need to exert the multi-functions of forest ecosystems. The paper analyses the main benefits and constraints of sustainable forest management with regard to the special natural and economic conditions of China. According to the basic principles of sustainable forest management, China has been taking the relevant actions. Six national programmes and participatory forest management for forest resources utilisation and conservation are operative as regional implementation strategies. Demonstrations, with 13 sample sites in different typical regions, and 8 Criteria and 80 Indicators based on the Montreal Process for monitoring and assessment of sustainable forest management at the national level, have been established and tested. Biological diversity conservation, plantation management for timber production natural forest protection, non-wood products and technical training will become the priorities for sustainable forest management in China.

AB  - Geochemical and palynological investigation of the Lower to Middle Frasnian reef-to-basin succession at the well-known Kowala Quarry (Holy Cross Mountains) demonstrates the variable character of organic matter (OM) deposited in different oxidative-reductive conditions. During sedimentation of the basinal deposits, anoxic conditions in the water column prevailed. In the organic-rich sediments deposited during the Palmatolepis punctata Zone (set D), anoxia occurred in the photic zone, as inferred from the presence of isorenieratane, aryl isoprenoids and gammacerane. In the same kind of deposits, but occurring during the Palmatolepis hassi Zone (set F), anoxia apparently occurred mainly in the deeper parts of the basin and only sporadically reached the photic zone. This interpretation is based on the lack of isorenieratane, traces of aryl isoprenoids and the presence of gammacerane in the investigated samples. The basinal clay-enriched sediments of sets D and F are divided by an organic-poor set E, typical for the carbonate platform (fore-reef) environment characterized by oxic conditions. A palynostratigraphical study of the Frasnian section from the Kowala Quarry allowed recognition of two miospore zones: Geminospora semilucensa-Perotrilites donensis (SD) and Archaeoperisaccus ovalis-Verrucosisporites grumosus (OG). Relatively small quantitative and qualitative changes of the organic particles (miospores, tracheids, prasinophytes and acritarchs) are interpreted primarily in terms of sea-level fluctuations and enhanced productivity. In particular, the appearance of abundant, abnormally large mature leiospheres in set D can be the result of progressive eutrophication, related to environmental changes recorded in the recently detected major positive carbon isotope anomaly. As during the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction interval, this eutrophication could have been stimulated by a rapid increase in primary production and subsequently expanding anoxic conditions, but it is evident only in the early phase of the Middle Frasnian delta C-13 excursion. The processes of the secondary hydrothermal fluid migration, taking place after the lithification of the sediments, caused partial OM oxidation. The products of these processes are such phenyl derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons as phenylphenanthrenes, terphenyls, phenyldibenzothiophenes and phenyldibenzofurans. Moreover, an oxygen compound rarely described from sedimentary OM, dibenzo-p-dioxin and its methyl- and dimethyl-derivatives, seems to be the additional product of hydrothermal OM oxidation.

AB  - Water is essential for the maintenance of human, animal and plant life. In many developing countries, there is a permanent degradation of freshwater resources - in terms of quantity and quality - and the aquatic ecosystems as well. The increase of pollutants in the water is increasing due to anthropogenic activities. The evaluation of the quality of a river can be carried out using indexes, which are characterized by synthesizing a large amount of information that is easy to understand and interpret. The objective of this investigation was to establish the procedure for the calculation of the SI for several indicators taking into consideration the national regulations and the environmental conditions of the country. Mathematical formulas are included to transform the concentration of 20 quality indicators to their respective sub-indices and to use the new proposed quality index. The importance of this new methodology is that it will allow the creation of new ICAs applicable to the environmental conditions of each country and adapted to its own legislation.

AB  - This paper presents the results of 20-year studies into the impact made by an experimental high-intensity fire on ecosystem components and postfire succession in a middle-taiga pine forest. About 44% of forest fuel loads burned down during the fire, and the emission of carbon was more than 18 t C/ha. As a result of the fire impact, trees died within 3 years after the fire, and this resulted in a significant accumulation of fuel loads. Twenty years after the fire, the biomass of forest fuel loads surpassed the prefire values 4 times, which led to the possibility of the origin of a repeated high-intensity fire. The initial stage of postfire succession in the pine forest is determined by forest vegetation conditions and takes place with the replacement of dominant grass and shrubs. The agrochemical and hydrothermal soil indicators were revealed to be changed after the fire, and this promoted improved conditions for the origin and development of natural regeneration sufficient for the formation of forest stand.

AB  - Female birds are exceptionally consistent in laying rather uniform and individually specific eggs, so that variation in eggs of individual females is low, while variation among females is high. Repeatability is a population-level parameter used in quantitative genetics to quantify the level of intraindividual consistency in relation to interindividual variation in phenotypic traits, in this case, the egg traits. The statistical measure of repeatability is intraclass correlation of particular egg traits clustered in clutches. This study is based on a long-term dataset on repeatabilities of the length, breadth, volume and shape of eggs of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus investigated in two ecologically varying sites (an urban parkland versus a mature deciduous forest) around the city of Lodz, central Poland in 1999-2013. Coefficients of repeatability of egg length, breadth, volume and shape in the study populations of Blue Tits showed some variation between years and study sites, but were generally very high, on average 0.7 or more, and did not significantly differ between the traits within years. The observed differences between repeatabilities do not seem to be strongly associated with year-specific weather indicators for the first half of April. Only coefficients of variation in mean daily temperature influenced repeatabilities of egg length and breadth, whereas effects of mean temperature were non-significant. Repeatability of egg length in the forest and breadth in both sites increased with increasing variation in daily temperature, whereas repeatability of egg length in the urban park site showed a reverse relation with variation in temperature. Year-site-specific mean laying dates, clutch sizes and egg volumes, considered as indicators of breeding conditions, tended to negatively affect the repeatabilities. However, in general, repeatabilities of different egg traits were not consistent in their variation between years and sites, which suggests an important role of stochastic factors in shaping this variation. External factors that are able to force females to diversify traits of eggs in a particular laying sequence do not seem to directly result from the environmental conditions prevailing during a spring period critical for laying eggs in a population in a given year (the first half of April), but seem to be linked to more subtle aspects of variation in the conditions for egg laying, as shown by links with the mean values of basic breeding parameters.

AB  - Marine ecosystem assets accounting is a cornerstone of the marine resource assets management; however, it is facing an imperfect accounting system in the current situation. Based on the System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) Experimental Ecosystem Accounting, this paper initially combines the key concepts, the objectives, the extent, and the tabular structure in measuring the ecosystem assets. Subsequently, with the marine ecosystems as the research object, this paper attempts to design the accounting tables for the marine ecosystems extent, marine ecosystems conditions and the expected service flows of the marine ecosystems in physical terms. Furthermore, the technical issues such as trade-off, pricing and the choice of asset discount rate on expected marine ecosystem services are explored. With the accounting of the expected marine ecosystem services in monetary terms, the calculation of the marine ecosystem assets using the net present value method is possible, and the marine ecosystem assets accounts can be compiled. Finally, this paper proposes the existing challenges and directs the need for further research in designing the framework of marine ecosystem assets accounts.

AB  - The stock of the Senegalese flat sardinella, Sardinella maderensis, is highly exploited in Senegal, West Africa. Its growth and reproduction parameters are key biological indicators for improving fisheries management. This study reviewed these parameters using landing data from small-scale fisheries in Senegal and literature information dated back more than 25 years. Age was estimated using length-frequency data to calculate growth parameters and assess the growth performance index. With global climate change there has been an increase in the average sea surface temperature along the Senegalese coast but the length-weight parameters, sex ratio, size at first sexual maturity, period of reproduction and condition factor of S. maderensis have not changed significantly. The above parameters of S. maderensis have hardly changed, despite high exploitation and fluctuations in environmental conditions that affect the early development phases of small pelagic fish in West Africa. This lack of plasticity of the species regarding of the biological parameters studied should be considered when planning relevant fishery management plans.

AB  - Small headwater lakes reflect the changes in atmospheric pollution, and are also indicators of climate change. This study examined water chemistry changes in a pristine small lake in southern Finland during the period 1990-2009. Recovery from acidification was indicated, while no major changes in trace metal concentrations were found. In the course of the study, total phosphorus concentration was fluctuating in deteriorated oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion. However, total and organic nitrogen remained stable, but inorganic nitrogen concentration increased during the period, and was more dependent on the hydrology and in-lake processes than nitrogen deposition. Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations also increased, presumably due to decreasing acidity and changes in runoff, and increased alkalinity and decreased phytoplankton production, respectively. The results emphasise the importance of integrated intensive long-term monitoring of physical, chemical and biological variables for detecting impacts of changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The present paper reports on an observation that dendrite-like polycrystalline structures from evaporating droplets of wheat grain leakages exhibit bilateral symmetry. The exactness of this symmetry, measured by means of fluctuating asymmetry, varies depending on the cultivar and stress factor influence, and seems to correspond to the seed germination rate. In the bodies of plants, animals, and humans, the exactness of bilateral symmetry is known to reflect the environmental conditions of an organism's growth, its health, and its success in sexual selection. In polycrystalline structures, formed under the same conditions, the symmetry exactness depends on the properties of the crystallizing solution such as the composition and viscosity; however, it has never been associated with sample quality. We hypothesize here that, as in living nature, the exactness of approximate bilateral symmetry might be considered a quality indicator also in crystallographic methods applied to food quality analysis.

AB  - The level and distribution of tropospheric ozone in remote and wildness areas of the Maurienne valley, a main axis in European transport, were determined during summertime 2004 and 2005. A comprehensive distribution of biological and chemical sensors based on the commonly used ozone sensitive Bel-W3 tobacco and the passive sampling system, was set up. A significant positive correlation was observed between the two methods and the continuous ozone monitors set in three instrumental co-locations. Moreover, results from this air quality network showed that, within a natural pathway of mass airflow, altitude and climate induced variations in plant responsiveness to ozone. Three different ozone diurnal patterns could thus be clearly identified. Biological sensing to determine ozone levels in regional-scale air quality assessment proved to be accurate at low altitudes. However, Tobacco response was limited in harsh mountainous conditions. This was probably due to a decrease of plant sensitivity.

AB  - Aquatic sediments record past climatic conditions while providing a wide range of ecological niches for microorganisms. In theory, benthic microbial community composition should depend on environmental features and geochemical conditions of surrounding sediments, as well as ontogeny of the subsurface environment as sediment degraded. In principle, DNA in sediments should be composed of ancient and extant microbial elements persisting at different degrees of preservation, although to date few studies have quantified the relative influence of each factor in regulating final composition of total sedimentary DNA assemblage. Here geomicrobiological and phylogenetic analyses of a Patagonian maar lake were used to indicate that the different sedimentary microbial assemblages derive from specific lacustrine regimes during defined climatic periods. Two climatic intervals (Mid-Holocene, 5 ka BP; Last Glacial Maximum, 25 ka BP) whose sediments harbored active microbial populations were sampled for a comparative environmental study based on fossil pigments and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The genetic assemblage recovered from the Holocene record revealed a microbial community displaying metabolic complementarities that allowed prolonged degradation of organic matter to methane. The series of Archaea identified throughout the Holocene record indicated an age-related stratification of these populations brought on by environmental selection during early diagenesis. These characteristics were associated with sediments resulting from endorheic lake conditions and stable pelagic regime, high evaporative stress and concomitant high algal productivity. In contrast, sulphate-reducing bacteria and lithotrophic Archaea were predominant in sediments dated from the Last Glacial Maximum, in which pelagic clays alternated with fine volcanic material characteristic of a lake level highstand and freshwater conditions, but reduced water column productivity. Comparison of sedimentary DNA composition with that of fossil pigments suggested that post-depositional diagenesis resulted in a rapid change in the initial nucleic acid composition and overprint of phototrophic communities by heterotrophic assemblages with preserved pigment compositions. Long DNA sequences (1400-900 bp) appeared to derive from intact bacterial cells, whereas short fragments (290-150 bp) reflected extracellular DNA accumulation in ancient sediments. We conclude that sedimentary DNA obtained from lacustrine deposits provides essential genetic information to complement paleoenvironmental indicators and trace post-depositional diagenetic processes over tens of millennia. However, it remains difficult to estimate the time lag between original deposition of lacustrine sediments and establishment of the final composition of the sedimentary DNA assemblage.

AB  - While scleractinian coral populations continue to diminish throughout the Caribbean, gorgonian corals are showing signs of resilience and in some areas are thriving. Despite their prominence on reefs, gorgonian species are notoriously difficult to field identify and as such have been underrepresented in most monitoring efforts. However, with reports of increased resistance to elevated temperatures, ocean acidification, and nutrient enrichment, there is now a growing interest in the ecological and physiological mechanisms that contribute to their success in changing environmental conditions. Here, we compile widely scattered taxonomical, biological, and ecological research on shallow-water symbiotic gorgonians in the wider Caribbean into a comprehensive resource document that can be used by researchers and managers to inform and promote future studies. Each section provides a brief summary of past research, accessible bibliography, and suggestions for future work.

AB  - Today, radioecology covers a broad scientific field; from the source to long term environmental impact from ionizing radiation. To summarize key challenges within radioecology, the present paper focuses upon knowledge gaps related to processes, mechanisms and variables contributing most to the overall uncertainties in environmental impact assessments. A series of sources related to the nuclear weapon cycle and the civil nuclear cycle has contributed, is still contributing or can potentially contribute to release of radionuclides to the environment in the future. The speciation of most radionuclides depends on the source and release conditions, and will influence ecosystem transport, biological uptake, doses and effects in flora and fauna. Radionuclides may also co-occur in contaminant mixtures (e.g., metals, organics), which potentially could lead to synergisms or antagonisms. Thus, challenges associated with the links between the source or release term - radionuclide speciation - ecosystem transfer - exposure response relationships are highlighted. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Community classification enables us to simplify, communicate, track and assess complex distribution patterns. Yet, the distribution of organisms may not coincide with predefined geographical and environmental boundaries, and therefore, biology itself should be leading the classification. In this study, we showed how to arrive at such a biology-based classification by clustering locations based on similarity in species composition. A hierarchical classification structure allowed for the selection of classification levels that suit multiple scales of analysis. We also showed how to objectively identify the number of clusters present in a dataset based on the distribution of specific indicator species, allowing to identify clear boundaries in species composition on multiple scales. The resulting biology-based clusters were identified and characterized by local and regional environmental conditions, showing the limited explanatory power of these environmental conditions and the added value of taking biology itself as a starting point of the classification. By departing community classification from species composition, the unknown environmental, geographical, and biotic drivers influencing species composition are accounted for.

AB  - Sedimentary metal indicators were used to assess the environmental 'health' of 38 estuaries on the central Australian east coast. Unlike many environmental indicators, the mean enrichment quotient (MEQ) provides the pristine condition and magnitude of anthropogenic change in estuarine condition, not confounded by natural spatial and temporal variation. MEQis the mean normalised surficial concentration of Cu, Pb and Zn divided by their normalised background concentration. MEQs, identified from an extensive sedimentary database (n = 2269), were used to derive a Metal Enrichment Index (MEI) comprising five impact categories. Population density and proportion of urbanised catchment were consistent with increased sedimentary metal concentrations, whereas estuarine sensitivity and metal enrichment were poorly correlated. No correlation was established between metal enrichment and estuary type or sedimentary facies. MEI can be used as a tool to meet the needs of policy-makers and estuarine managers by providing a tool by which human-induced change may be measured. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The research realised in this paper was based on ecologic principles such as: stimulating forestry and hunting funds to participate in the rural tourism market, protecting game species through improving life conditions, strict control of the number of pests and combating illegal hunting (poaching); encouraging biodiversity conservation through sustainable nature-based tourism. The paper argues the necessity of conforming hunting tourism to modern tendencies which involve responsible travelling to natural areas. The study of the reliability of the main game species, quantitative and, qualitative value indicators, as well as the optimal number of animals, the influence of the anthropic factors reflected in how to manage the hunting fund, the theoretical calculation of harvesting quotas and the comparison of the real and optimal ones, the combating of game pests are all elements that we consider to be extremely important in solving the proposed objectives, in order to create the best premises and conditions for rural tourism practices specializing in image hunting.

AB  - The brown algae species, Cystoseira spp., forms an important habitat for many marine species. Changes in ecological conditions as salinity, seawater temperature and other factors such as urbanization, costal development, domestic and chemical pollutions effect the distribution and existence of these species. To protect and maintain their existence it is needed to identify and monitor Cystoseira spp. accurately. For this reason the distribution of the Cystoseira species in Northern Aegean Turkish Coasts were compared with previous data. The species were identified by both morphologically and phylogenetically. 35 Cystoseira samples were collected from 20 stations. Morphological features were used to identify 29 samples out of 35. From these species 10 of them gave appropriate results with sequence analysis.
   The genus Cystoseira has been identified as a potential indicator of water quality in Mediterranean waters, and our preliminary results suggest that Cystoseira species may also be good bioindicators for ecological conditions.

AB  - The destruction and damage of fossils in palaeontological collections through pyrite (FeS2) oxidation is a major and well-known issue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this reaction on the conservation of Xiaheyan fossil entomofauna (Tupo Formation; Late Carboniferous; Ningxia, China) through three steps. First, we examined and characterised the elemental and mineralogical composition of newly excavated specimens, of museum specimens, and of weathering products at the outcrop (using SEM-EDX, Raman microspectroscopy and XRD). Second, in order to determine the potential reactivity of newly excavated fossils, we performed artificial ageing experiments, a technique recently applied in palaeontology that can offer valuable insights into long-term conservation of fossils. Finally, we designed and applied a protocol aiming at forcing the formation of gypsum outside the fossils so as to preserve the fossil integrity, namely 'crystallisation pits'. Our data demonstrate that the depositional environment at Xiaheyan was rich in sulphur and devoid of oxygen, with perhaps oxygen-rich microenvironments, which led, respectively, to the precipitation of framboidal pyrite and of primary iron oxyhydroxides. The further chemical palaeo-weathering led to an extensive oxidation of pyrite in the outcrop, resulting in the precipitation of secondary iron oxyhydroxides, and of jarosite and gypsum, both sulphates. The low abundance of iron oxyhydroxides and the poor diversity of sulphates, compared to analogous localities, indicate a distinct weathering scenario, with a persistence of acidic water and an extensive leaching leading to the maintenance of only insoluble sulphates. Despite the extensive in situ pyrite oxidation, artificial ageing experiments demonstrated a remaining weak degradation potential. Gypsum (a calcium sulphate) is the near exclusive efflorescence to develop within artificially aged fossils, contrary to the most commonly encountered efflorescence on pyritised fossils, namely iron sulphate. This instance can be attributed to the complete mobilisation of iron through iron oxyhydroxide precipitation and the availability of calcium ions induced by the dissolution of calcium carbonates present on Xiaheyan outcrops during palaeo-weathering. Unfortunately, the recourse to crystallisation pits failed to prompt gypsum crystallisation. We further suggest preventive storage conditions and prospects for investigation on the gypsum precipitation process at work, notably the role of organic compounds.

AB  - National ocean parks are important resources of China's ecological civilization and environmental planning for sustainable development. In order to properly examine the protection and sustainable development of national ocean parks, an index of various elements (area, location, resources, economy, and environment) was created to evaluate the sustainable development conditions of 16 national ocean parks in the East China Sea coast between 2011 and 2017. Using the principle component analysis and cluster methods, this study comprehensively investigated the different characteristics and attributes of these parks. The results showed that a three-level classification system for national ocean parks is proposed based on the evaluation indicator system, which classifies these parks into three categories: ecosystem protection, tourism, and sustainable fisheries. Each category of park is featured by its own particular characteristics. Last, suggestions are given for future ecological protection and appropriate development of national ocean parks.

AB  - Historical records are an important resource for understanding the biological impacts of climate change. Such records include naturalists' journals, club and field station records, museum specimens, photographs, and scientific research. Finding records and overcoming their limitations are serious challenges to climate change research. In the present article, we describe efforts to locate data from Concord, Massachusetts, and provide a template that can be replicated in other locations. Analyses of diverse data sources, including observations made in the 1850s by Henry David Thoreau, indicate that climate change is affecting the phenology, presence, and abundance of species in Concord. Despite recent work on historical records, many sources of historical data are underutilized. Analyses of these data may provide insights into climate change impacts and techniques to manage them. Moreover, the results are useful for communicating local examples of changing climate conditions to the public.

AB  - Within two coastal shallow lagoons, trophic state was assessed by integrating water and sediment chemical indicators such as the TRIX and the benthic biopolymeric carbon (BPC) trophic indicator, altogether with biological environmental indicators (diatom species characterization). Spatial and temporal behavior of TRIX and BPC indices suggest that water column trophic indicators reflect rather short-term variations in water quality changes, while benthic trophic indicators rather reflect consistent long-term trends which make them useful as enduring indicators of eutrophication. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that both sediment and transitional water trophic state indices increased eutrophic conditions with a decreasing salinity and increasing total nutrients. Diatom species associated with elevated eutrophic condition such as Staurosirella martyi, Staurosira breviestriata, Amphora copulata, Amphora veneta, Nitzschia sp., and Bacillaria paradoxa, showed a positive correlation with both trophic indices. We highlight the need for considering sediment eutrophication indicators towards in monitoring programmes within shallow coastal lagoons.

AB  - In the intensive beef production system, the living space allocated in the feedlot is fundamental for cattle to show their natural behavior, establish a hierarchical order and express their productive potential. If living space in the feedlot is reduced, the available area for shade and feeders is also reduced, compromising productive indicators and modifying cattle behavior by increasing agonistic behavior to define hierarchies within the pen. For the allocation of living space, it is necessary to consider the climatic conditions of each region, especially in areas with high rainfall, or high environmental temperature and relative humidity; on the one hand, the excess of mud generates problems in the extremities, hinders the displacement of cattle inside the corral and decreases the feed conversion, as it requires more energy expenditure to facilitate the displacement. Increasing the living space in the pen improves cattle welfare, decreases morbidity and increases weight gain. It is therefore important to consider the environmental setting and the physical characteristics of the pens to provide optimal housing conditions.

AB  - Introduction:
   Evacuees' quality of life can be improved by investigating both their health problems and the conditions of evacuation centers during natural disasters.
   Study Objective:
   This study aims to develop new evacuee and evacuation center information sheets that focus on infection control, oral health and dentures, mental health, and rehabilitation during natural disasters.
   Methods:
   The analysis was conducted with the Delphi method by questioning doctors from various fields (infectious disease, psychiatry, rehabilitation, and dentistry) about the information that may be needed for evacuees and in the evacuation center environment.
   Results:
   Two information sheets were created in this study. One is an evacuation center environmental health assessment sheet that includes information about the overview of evacuees' health and the evacuation center environment. The other is an evacuee registration sheet that would be completed by the evacuees themselves.
   Conclusion:
   The information sheets developed in this study will be useful in times of disaster because they have the potential to improve evacuee health conditions, as well as evacuation center environments.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the problem of assessing the sustainability of enterprises in the oil and gas sector, taking into account the nature of the processes of improving the energy efficiency of a company. Modern requirements for business on the part of the state, the consumer, and other members of the business community pose many different kinds of challenges to companies. The effectiveness of decisions depends on the quality of management of enterprises and companies. Under these conditions, the basic processes for the efficient management of enterprises can be the formation of estimate indicators of the level of sustainability achieved and their monitoring. The assessment of the sustainable development of an oil and gas company under these conditions should cover all aspects of sustainable development. The article proposes and approves the author's methodology for assessing the energy efficiency of all aspects of the sustainable development of oil and gas enterprises based on the statistical data of companies and calculated integral indices.

AB  - Euglena pascheri is not an abundant species in water habitats, with no previous reports of bloom formation for this species. In 2005, we observed a spring bloom of E. pascheri with Lepocinclis ovum as a subdominant species in a shallow oxbow lake located within the Niepolomice Forest of southern Poland. Rapid increases in the populations of both species were accompanied with low pH values, oxygen deficits, and high concentrations of nitrogen compounds, chlorides, Fe. Mn, Zn, and Cd, but with low concentrations of easily assimilated orthophosphates. Water properties within the habitat were extremely different during and after the bloom. E. pascheri and L ovum have not previously been considered as index species of any specific water condition or environmental requirements. However, according to our observations, they are organisms tolerant to water acidification, increased salinity, and the presence of heavy metals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental engineering is a new interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of developmental neuroscience and biomedical engineering, mainly concerned with quantitative analysis and modeling of human behaviour during neural development. Along such a line, our research focuses on early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, typically diagnosed after 2-3 years of age. With the purpose of beating new paths in the emerging field of neurodevelopmental engineering, we propose a novel approach to the assessment of basic patterns of goal-directed actions in developing babies, in the 0-24 months of age range, both under laboratory and naturalistic conditions. In particular, we propose novel mechatronic devices, either wearable or embedded into toys, for ecological, unobtrusive assessment of infant behavior. Guidelines for the design of a particular toy embedding both kinematics and force-sensing capabilities as well as of experimental scenarios where similar instrumented toys can be deployed are provided. Preliminary experiments for the technical validation of an early prototype in ecological conditions are also presented.

AB  - Simple Summary Horses are frequently transported and exposed to a new environment for sport competition or working tasks and must readapt to their original conditions after a temporary relocation. The objective of this study was to determine if a temporary relocation, and multiple factors associated with a rest period, affect the adrenal response through the analysis of hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) in horses. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid released after the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and its assessment is being increasingly used as a bioindicator of stress response. Results showed that changes in the daily routine of the animals, including a supposed rest period, increased the HCCs. However, the risk of using low statistical power due to the small sample size cannot be completely ruled out. The elevation in HCCs could be a consequence of the change in the horses' environmental and routine conditions, which could, in turn, have an impact on their welfare.
   Abstract Horse transportation for temporary relocation during rest periods is a common and widespread practice among horse owners, either from sport competition or working tasks. This study aimed to determine the effect of a relocation period and the multiple factors associated with a rest period on hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) in horses. Additionally, this study reports the seasonal effect on HCCs and hair growth over a year. Thirteen police horses, Pure Spanish stallions of various ages (5-13 y), were selected to participate in this study. Hair sample collection was carried out approximately every 30 d for seven months (Study 1) and a year (Study 2). Cortisol determinations were performed by enzyme immunoassay. Interestingly, Study 1 revealed that relocated horses (n = 4) exhibited elevated HCCs compared with control horses (n = 4) after the relocation period (p < 0.05). Study 2 (n = 5) showed higher HCCs during summer compared with autumn and winter, and higher hair growth rates in winter compared with the other seasons (p < 0.05). Relocated horses had higher HCCs, suggesting a change in their welfare status, probably related to the sudden change in their surrounding conditions. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the low sample size used. The nature of the relationship between HCCs and horse welfare needs to be further examined.

AB  - The radioecological situation on the territory of the Bryansk region, especially in the South-Western areas, as a result of the Chernobyl accident, is still remains difficult and unfavorable for people's life and activity. The situation has not been stabilized completely in this zone. Large areas of forest lands (more than 42 % (493.9 thousand hectares) of the region's forest fund) are contaminated with radionuclides, which has led to significant changes in the conditions of management. The priority directions of rehabilitation of territories contaminated by radioactive fallout are afforestation and reforestation. In this regard, the evaluation of the soil characteristics in felling, burned areas and unused agricultural lands and the identification of specific features of radionuclide behavior in the forest plantations allow us to make the right choice of technology for the creation of forest cultures that ensures the radiation and environmental safety, as well as the forestry and economic efficiency. The research aimed to finding promising technologies for the creation of forest cultures in different categories of lands contaminated with radionuclides, based on an assessment of the forest-growing properties of soils and the specific behavior of radionuclides in forest plantations, is timely and relevant. The goal of research is to study the peculiarities of Scotch pine growing in the coniferous-deciduous forest zone and to develop the promising technologies for their creation in various categories of lands contaminated with radionuclides. In the conditions of radioactive contamination on sod-podzolic sandy soils of different degrees of gleization and presence of podsol in felling, burnt areas and agricultural lands, the relationship between the silvicultural soil characteristics and the biometric indicators of Scots pine is first established. The results of the work allow expanding the scientific base in the field of radioecological monitoring in different categories of forest lands contaminated with radionuclides. The obtained data confirm the close relationship of soil-ecological conditions with biometric indicators of Scots pine, regardless of the category of lands, and can be used in the development of promising technologies for the creation of forest cultures. The reliability of the study results is confirmed by a sufficient amount of experimental material collected and processed with the use of modern statistical methods. Monitoring of the radioecological situation in forests and the assessment of soil and ecological conditions allow us to solve the issues of the safe forestry management in an integrated manner.

AB  - Understanding the processes that control the preservation of paleoceanographic proxies is of clear importance. Surface sediments from the Peru Margin oxygen-minimum zone are subject to lateral and downslope transport by bottom currents that decrease organic matter (OM) quality. Indicators of bulk OM quality (pyrolysis hydrogen index, pyrolysis S1 + S2 and C/N) demonstrate significant degradation between 150 and 400 m water depth, within the oxygen-minimum zone. Concentrations of the three most abundant chlorins (chlorophyllone, pheophytin and pyropheophytin) decrease from 750 to 150 nmol g TOC-1 from 150 to 400 m water depth though the relative abundances of the chlorins in an individual sample do not change. This suggests that the three chlorins have similar reactivity over the ambient conditions. Values for delta N-15 of bulk sediments (delta N-15(bulk)) decrease by 3 parts per thousand from the inner shelf to the upper slope (1000 m) but co-occurring compound-specific delta N-15 values (delta N-15(chlorin)) do not decrease downslope. The low variability of delta N-15(chlorin) values supports a single source for the chlorins, and demonstrates the recalcitrance of delta N-15(chlorin) values despite degradation. This set of observation raises questions about which type of OM fraction best records 'primary' signatures. We assess two possible models to guide our interpretation of these disparate datasets (1) that decreasing delta N-15(bulk) values are the result of degradation of a 15 N-enriched fraction during downslope transport, and that delta N-15(chlorin) values reflect primary values; (2) that delta N-15(bulk) values are primary and that chlorins are derived from material transported from upslope. These data reaffirm that in active sedimentary environments such as the Eastern Tropical Pacific, transport of OM can significantly alter bulk geochemical parameters of OM integrity, but the impacts on the delta N-15 record of bulk sediments and chlorins are less clear, and require more study to be thoroughly understood.

AB  - The amount, spatial distribution and composition of the connective tissue within muscle vary with muscle position in the carcase and with animal age. This has long been recognised to influence the tenderness of cooked meat. This paper builds upon some historical perspectives with a review of some recent clarifications of the biological function of intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) and of its contribution to meat texture, which is clearly multifactorial. The perimysial component of IMCT varies most in amount between muscles and is also the IMCT structure most involved in defining the mechanical integrity of cooked meat. The distribution of perimysium defines muscle fascicle size (muscle "grain" size), which is also still regarded as an indicator of tenderness. Postmortem conditioning of meat has consistently been shown to reduce the strength of intramuscular connective tissue in the raw state, but with equal consistency, this has been shown not to affect the toughness of cooked meat. Cooking increases IMCT strength in the range 20-50 degrees C and decreases its contribution at higher temperatures and longer cooking times. Crosslinking of collagen in older animals is generally considered to result in tougher meat, although definitive links between mature crosslink content and cooked meat toughness have been difficult to prove. In the last quarter-century, IMCT has been increasingly viewed as a "background" contributor to meat texture, which is difficult to change. However, the large variation in perimysial content of muscles in one animal represents an incredible range of expression. This appears to be firmly fixed to the functional properties of different muscles. In particular, it is hypothesised that definition of muscle fascicle size and shape by the bounding perimysium is related to the need for subsections of the whole muscle to slip past each other in the normal contractile function of the tissue. Despite this, the amounts and composition of IMCT can be manipulated by animal nutrition and exercise, and factors affecting the turnover of IMCT may especially be a future target for manipulation of meat texture.

AB  - Lichens are unique organisms, valued for their pharmacological activity, but also well known as bioindicators of environmental pollution, key determinants for some natural ecological habitats, or just popular elements of decoration. High morphological similarity between lichen species makes their recognition complicated, especially under in-field conditions. Thus, there is a need for a quick and easy method that can help with the preliminary classification of selected lichen species. This paper presents a tool that can facilitate the recognition of Cladonia lichen species, based on a deep convolutional neural network, a model which has nowadays reached a classification level often comparable to humans. The network was trained and tested on twelve Cladonia species using a total of 1164 images, downloaded from various websites. The trained model achieved 60.94% accuracy, which is satisfactory for this novel, but still preliminary, automated classification of lichen species.

AB  - The horizontal and vertical distribution of dolichopodid flies in a deciduous woodland ecosystem was investigated by means of white-water traps during a nearly 8-month period. Eighteen traps were installed along a light intensity/soil humidity gradient (three zones) and from 0 to 80 cm high (six levels). Six environmental features were recorded on several occasions. The dolichopodid data were analysed by means of two multivariate techniques, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). The DCA revealed four distinct species groups, which also proved to be clearly different on a broader ecological basis. The horizontal distributions in many species could be explained by the different environmental conditions in the zones. Although nearly all species were unequally distributed over the traps, their stratification patterns generally showed no significant correlation with the recorded biotic and abiotic features. It is therefore suggested that the observed vertical distributions are the results of a combination of specific and environmental characteristics.

AB  - Despite decades of research demonstrating links between many agricultural practices and water quality, the ability to predict water quality on the basis of changes in soil health remains severely limited. By better understanding how soil health affects downstream water quality, researchers and policymakers could prioritize different conservation practices while exploring more innovative soil health management strategies. Focusing on the Great Lakes region, we describe the value and challenges of different approaches to linking soil health and water quality, specifically applying nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances and adapting simulation models to better incorporate changing soil health conditions. We identify critical research needs, including paying greater attention to a broad suite of conservation practices and to biological indicators of soil health. We also discuss key barriers to farmer adoption of conservation practices from field to national scales, highlighting that improved scientific understanding alone is insufficient to drive widespread change.

AB  - During the past century, traditional ownership, control, and use of coral reef habitats in the US.-affiliated islands in the Pacific have declined, exposing them to increased construction for plantation, transportation, military, urban, aquaculture, fisheries, mineral, and resort development. Dredging, filling, and other construction in coral reef and related ecosystems are expected to continue at high levels. Collectively, these activities have resulted in major adverse ecological impacts, many of which can be avoided or reduced to minor levels. Improvements in the design, siting, and construction of coastal projects can be accomplished by early integration of environmental objectives. Ecological baseline surveys; environmental impact assessments; regulatory conditions: guidelines and standards during construction; monitoring of construction; post-construction evaluation; and long-range research, planning, and management are among the most useful of the environmental tools to describe reefs and to identify measures to reduce or avoid adverse impacts on coral reefs.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition and climate change are considered the main factors accelerating the long-term growth of forests. Quantification of changes in growth rate can be extremely useful in monitoring and assessing the impact of climate change on site productivity.
   In this study, we carried out a country-wide analysis of long-term (100 years) dynamics and changes in the height growth rate and site index (SI) of Scots pine in Poland. To ensure representativeness we used a large sample of stem analysis trees collected on 312 plots selected using stratified sampling. To control the effect of site fertility and thus avoid the over-representation of older stands on infertile sites, we measured a range of soil properties that, together with environmental indicators characterising climatic conditions and topography, were used in growth trend modelling as explanatory variables. We found that trees planted in successive years have grown faster. The SI calculated for individual trees is linearly dependent on the year of germination and with increasing age of germination, the SI at the base age of 100 years has increased by 8.4 cm per year. Despite the differences in the growth dynamics of pines planted in different germination years, tree growth follows the same growth pattern. The observed continuous changes in site productivity correspond to an increase in the SI by over 29% between 1900 and 2000. A consequence of continuous changes in site conditions and height growth rate is ambiguity in derived SI values. Under changing site conditions, SI values calculated based on stand height and age depend not only on site productivity but also the year of germination. As a consequence, stands growing under identical site conditions show different SIs, which should be acknowledged if the SI is to be used in forest management. Therefore, determining the SI of newly established stands based on the SI of older generations requires the application of an amendment to account for stand age.
   Continuously improving our understanding of potential climate change impacts on forest ecosystems is essential and provide information to support forest managers seeking to develop effective adaptation measures and determine sustainable forestry production. As such, our results provide valuable support when making longterm decisions and developing effective adaptation strategies in forest management.

AB  - The status of the environment in the development area of oil and gas condensate fields (OGCFs) in the north of Western Siberia (the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrug (YNAO)) has been evaluated on the basis of long-term investigations (1993-2016). The content of oil hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, Cd, Ni, Co, Cr, Ba, Cd, and Mn) is determined in soils, natural waters, bottom sediments, and indicator plants (Larix sibirica, Betula nana, Salix lanata, Ledum decumbens, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, and Cladonia alpestris). Species pleiads, corresponding to the ecological conditions of habitats and the intensity of technogenic impact, are specified with the use of the coefficients of interspecies conjugation of plants. A complex of indicators of the transformation of natural complexes under the effect of oil and gas extraction is proposed.

AB  - The legal requirements stated in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) have led to increased activity concerning macrophyte indicator metrics in Europe. Nevertheless in Bulgaria such indexes are still under consideration because of the lack of official methodologies. The macrophyte surveys undertaken as a part of two EU-funded projects are a unique resource allowing aquatic plant communities to be studied. The Reference Index (RI) was chosen as macrophyte assessment method since classifies rivers by using regional approach and reflects different kinds of environmental pressures. RI was implemented on 73 sampling sites in Bulgaria. On the basis of this dataset, our attempt to redesign the RI by the addition of further species, and the re-grouping of existing species, resulted in a considerable improvement in relation with regional conditions. The chosen macrophyte method can be applied at Bulgarian rivers in order to assess their ecological status.

AB  - The semienclosed marine water bodies of the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago (N of Cuba) are the locations of extensive tourism development projects. Highways and bridges across these water bodies are being planned and constructed for the purpose of reaching and interconnecting outer bordering keys. In order to evaluate any possible ecological impact and to elaborate recommendations to avoid or minimize it, a multidisciplinary research was carried out. In some places, high organic matter contents in sediments due to the weak circulation regime which enhances accumulation processes, and high microbial mineralization rates, impoverish benthic assemblages. In some cases, salinity reaches very high values, sediments are dominated by silt or both conditions are met, situation that also lead to ecosystem constraints. Phyto and zooplankton show lower concentrations than expected in supposedly fertile semienclosed water bodies. Precipitation deficit during many years combined with damming for fresh water storage, and natural limited exchange between inshore and oceanic water are responsible for the observed ecological features.

AB  - The noble pen shell Pinna nobilis L. is the largest, endemic, critically endangered, and protected bivalve of the Mediterranean Sea. Effective conservation and management strategies for this species highly depend on understanding how environmental change and anthropogenic pressures impact its physiology and thereby ecological function, population persistence, and survival. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory offers a valuable mechanistic modelling framework for capturing how an organism acquires and utilizes available energy for growth, maturation, development and reproduction throughout its life cycle, while accounting for environmental conditions. In this study we parameterized and compared two types of DEB models using limited literature data: a standard model that accounts for morphological metamorphosis only, and a model that through metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis captures physiological changes occurring in the larval life stage. The model with metabolic acceleration performed better, successfully simulating life history traits, growth, and reproduction of P. nobilis. We used the model to predict how food availability implemented through functional response affects growth, maturation, and reproduction of the species throughout its lifespan. We found that (i) abundant food had little effect on the size at maturation, (ii) maximum fecundity at ultimate age doubled compared to typically lower food availability in the wild, (iii) puberty could not be reached below the food availability corresponding to functional response value of 0.164, and (iv) energy allocated to reproduction was positively correlated with both bivalve size and food availability. Accounting for allometric growth observed in P. nobilis did not affect the findings, prompting us to recommend that isometric growth be assumed when modelling the bivalve using DEB. The model presented here is the first full-life cycle bioenergetic model made for P. nobilis. It can be used standalone for predicting energy budget of individuals at specific environmental conditions, or as a building block for modeling populations and ecosystems under various environmental scenarios. The model can readily incorporate other environmental factors relevant to changes in physiology and energy allocation, such as oxygen and pH.

AB  - A fuzzy rule-based approach was applied to a macroinvertebrate habitat suitability modelling problem. The model design was based on a knowledge base summarising the preferences and tolerances of 86 macroinvertebrate species for four variables describing river sites in springs up to small rivers in the Central and Western Plains of Europe. As the modelling problem asked for a model with an interpretable structure and a shaded indication of the river habitat suitability for a macroinvertebrate species, we opted for fuzzy classifiers. For each species, four different types (A, N, P, C) of habitat suitability models were developed, including 'ammonium concentration', 'nitrate concentration', 'phosphate concentration' or,electrical conductivity', as third input variable in addition to the primary two input variables 'stream width' and 'stream velocity'. The models were evaluated on field data collected at 445 sites in the Province of Overijssel (the Netherlands). For the majority of the 86 species, the significance of the model validation is biased by the highly non-uniform distribution of the data points over the input and output space, due to the fact that sites of high ecological quality are largely outnumbered by sites at deteriorated conditions. The evaluation by the validation data set was regarded objective for 12 species, only one of them being an indicator for reference conditions. Given the present environmental conditions of rivers in EU Member States, shifts in abundance levels of more common species are as such more suitable to detect gradual changes in water quality than shifts in abundance levels of species characterising reference conditions. Good scores were obtained with the performance measure 'percentage of correctly fuzzy classified instances' for the 12 corresponding N- and P-models, whereas the A- and C-models showed a low to moderate performance. This work illustrates that fuzzy rule-based models, designed using a comprehensive knowledge base, have properties that are of great interest for river management tools. The main components of a fuzzy rule-based model are the if-then rules, allowing for the expression of non-linear relations and the fuzzy sets, guaranteeing gradual transitions between classes. Due to the fact that these model components can be understood intuitively, the fuzzy rule-based approach results in highly transparant habitat suitability models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trees provide environmental benefits while vacant lots may pose environmental threats. Citizen requests for street trees may indicate positive attitudes toward improving local environmental quality. Each of these three indicators is evaluated to explore socio-spatial shifts and environmental variability using historic demographic data for New Haven, CT. Techniques include exploring bivariate correlations and performing ordinary least squares regressions with socio-economic data at the Census block group scale. Spatial lag and spatial error models are also estimated to control for and elucidate the spatial patterning. Because present day built and environmental conditions are the result of former actions, historic socio-economic data help enumerate temporal lags that create landscape legacies. This methods paper suggests a presence of distributional inequity, and reveals that different socio-economic variables have varied temporal lags.

AB  - An approach is presented for desktop-level environmental flow requirement (EFR) determination that is aligned with the Habitat Flow-Stressor Response (HFSR) method which evolved in South Africa over recent years. The HFSR method integrates hydrological, hydraulic and ecological habitat data, involves ecological and hydraulic specialists and is data-intensive and time-consuming. The revised desktop method integrates hydrological information with estimates of channel hydraulic cross-sectional characteristics to generate habitat-type frequencies under changing flow conditions. This information is used with the expected natural habitat requirements to determine acceptable habitat availability under different levels of ecological protection, which is then used with the hydraulic data to define flow regime characteristics that meet the ecological objectives. The paper describes the model components, discusses the assumptions, data requirements and limitations and presents some example results. The revised desktop approach uses approaches that are aligned with the more complex methods and generates results that are similar.

AB  - The coral Acropora cervicornis is considered a modern environmental indicator species, vulnerable to anthropogenic stress and rapidly disappearing throughout the Caribbean. Causes for its decline have been attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Physical and geochemical data are used to explore conditions under which this species thrived in early to middle Holocene reef deposits (ca. 9.4-5.4 ka) of the Enriquillo Valley, southwestern Dominican Republic. This study shows that A. cervicornis flourished during a 4000 yr period spanning the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and high-resolution radiocarbon dating reveals continuous growth for at least 2000 yr. Holocene A. cervicornis survived large-scale climate and environmental changes that included high temperatures, variable salinity, hurricanes, and rapid sea-level rise with remarkable resilience. Our data suggest that the recent decline in A. cervicornis is anomalous and likely tied to ecosystem change beyond natural causes.

AB  - Cattle ranching is a typical disturbance factor in the North Patagonian forests. The selection of modal areas having similar natural environmental conditions enabled the analysis of the response of the system to exploitation.
   Different structural parameters in the vegetal community were studied and secondary data on fire frequency and livestock censuses were compiled. An area gradient showing different degrees of degradation was defined, which was presumed to show the stages an area goes through when under livestock farming. Three ecological indicators were defined: key species, as indicators of the occurrence of a degradation process, vegetal cover, as an indicator of the stage a degradation process is going through and vegetal biovolume, as an indicator of when the degradation process has become critical. These indicators must be used together in order to obtain a good diagnosis of the state of the area under exploitation.

AB  - A survey of 218 woody vegetation plots at 109 streamside sites was undertaken to describe anthropogenic degradation of riparian zone woodlands in the mountains of mainland Greece. Two assessment indices and specific anthropogenic pressure variables were employed and they showed good correlations at both the site and river segment scales. It was demonstrated through the Spanish Riparian Forest Quality Index (Qualitat de Bosc de Riber: QBR) that most riparian zones were in moderate or good condition, although extremely few sites were of high ecological status. Most riparian sites were affected by several anthropogenic pressures, some pressures produce notable degradation beyond the site-scale (i.e. at the river segment scale). This work provides a summary of the first wide-ranging vegetation-based assessment of montane riparian zones in Greece; the results support the use of site-based rapid assessment protocols along-side aquatic ecological status surveys.

AB  - This quality assessment of the Skagerrak-Kattegat is mainly based on recent results obtained within the framework of the Swedish multidisciplinary research projekt 'Large-scale environmental effects and ecological processes in the Skagerrak-Kattegat' completed with relevant data from other research publications. The results show that the North Sea has a significant impact on the marine ecosystem in the Skagerrak and the northern Kattegat. Among environmental changes recently documented for some of these areas are: increased nutrient concentrations, increased occurrence of fast-growing filamentous algae in coastal areas affecting nursery and feeding conditions for fish, declining bottom water oxygen concentrations with negative effects on benthic fauna, and sediment toxicity to invertebrates also causing physiological responses in fish. It is concluded that, due to eutrophication and toxic substances, large-scale environmental changes and effects occur in the Skagerrak-Kattegat area.

AB  - Many ecologists express difficulty with the concept of ecosystem health. Ecosystem health must have definable and objective norms that allow for rigorous hypothesis testing for it to be acceptable to those ecologists. One step toward objective measurement of ecosystem health is to characterize ecosystem health by diversity-abundance relationships. The log-normal relationship between diversity and abundance characterizes taxocenes (i.e., taxonomically related groups that have similar ecological functions). Under conditions of stress, the patterns of diversity and abundance often change and are no longer log-normal. This change in patterns has been shown for some, but not all, marine and terrestrial taxocenes tested. The interdisciplinary possibilities for using log-normality, and deviation from it, as a measure of natural and anthropogenic ecosystem health are discussed. The interdisciplinarity of ecosystem health is illustrated with an example of blueberry pollinator decline caused by insecticide spraying in New Brunswick, Canada, and related economic and human health costs.

AB  - Winter Stress Syndrome (WSS) is a condition of severe lipid depletion in fish brought on by external stressors in combination with normal reductions in feeding and activity during cold weather. Fish can develop this syndrome in response to chemical stressors such as water pollutants, or biological stressors such as parasites. Substantial mortality can result, potentially changing year-class strength and population structure of the affected species, and altering community-level 'ecological interactions. Aquatic contaminants should be evaluated in the context of seasonal metabolic changes that normally occur in test organisms. WSS could be an important, but as yet unquantified, cause of mortality in many circumstances. Wastewater discharges may pose a greater toxic threat to fish during winter than at other times of the year. A comprehensive protocol for aquatic hazard assessment should include testing for WSS.

AB  - Climate change, drought, and anthropogenic effects are among the main drivers causing alterations in natural resources one of which is the lake level (LL) of large saline lakes, which are mainly located in arid and semi-arid regions. As an urgent need to manage natural resources, this study focuses on determining the significant reasons for the shrinkage problem of saltwater lakes. To this end, the long-term severity and frequency of droughts from 2003 to 2020 and their spatiotemporal distribution in the Lake Urmia Basin (the second largest saline lake on Earth) were investigated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) anomaly. Thereafter, monthly soil moisture, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature (LST), LL, NDVI, and precipitation time series were collected, Boolean images were used to generate drought frequency maps, and Mann-Kendall trend test techniques and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) were used to determine the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on the region. The results indicated that the basin had only non-drought and mild drought conditions and did not experience moderate, severe, or very severe droughts. The results indicated that the mild drought indices covered 80% of the total area and were exposed for more than seven years. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the primary reason for the drought was temperature anomalies (r = -0.68) in the basin. The annually changing drought conditions in the basin revealed human effects on the basin. The results indicated a statistically significant positive trend in evapotranspiration time series, which was a reason for the LL decline. Thereafter, wavelet coherence was employed to delve deeper into the correlation between LL and the hydro-environmental datasets. The increasing vegetation cover in the situation that precipitation, land surface temperature, and soil moisture had stable conditions as well as common periodicities between the hydroenvironmental variables, and the abrupt change points in significant periodicities revealed that anthropogenic activities in terms of agricultural expansion had increased in the basin. Besides, the annually changing condition of drought in the basin is also an indicator of anthropogenic activities that affect the environment. The differences in the spatial distribution of the NDVI maps also indicated that people living in the western, eastern, and southern regions of the basin had cultivated more land.

AB  - With climate change, favorable growing conditions for tree species are shifting northwards and to higher altitudes. Therefore, local populations are becoming less adapted to their environment. Assisted migration is one of the proposed adaptive measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural populations and maintain forest productivity. It consists of moving genetic material to a territory where future climate conditions correspond to those of its current location. Eight white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seed sources representing as many seed orchards were planted in 2013 at three forest sites simulating a south-north climatic gradient of 1.7 degrees C in Quebec, Canada. The objectives were to (1) evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the different seed sources and (2) determine the role of genetic adaptation and physiological plasticity on the observed variation in morpho-physiological traits. Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and seed sources was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between seed sources. There was no change in the rank of seed sources and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation. Southern seed sources showed the best height growth, while optimum growth was observed at the central site. Juvenile height growth seems to be a good indicator of the juvenile carbon sequestration and could serve as a selection criterion for the best genetics sources for carbon sequestration. Vector analysis showed no nitrogen deficiency 4 years after planting. Neither seed sources nor planting sites had a significant effect on photosynthesis before bud break. The observed results during the establishment phase under different site conditions indicate that southern seed sources may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions further north. While northern seed sources are likely to benefit from anticipated local global warming, they would not match the growth performance of seedlings from southern sources.

AB  - When a population comes to occupy a new environment, phenotypically plastic responses alter the distribution of phenotypes, and hence affect both the direction and the intensity of selection. Rates of evolution can be accelerated or retarded compared to what would happen in the absence of plasticity. Plastic responses in one trait result in novel selection pressures on other traits, and this can lead to evolution in completely different directions than predicted in the absence of plasticity. In this paper I use the concept of the adaptive surface in order to identify conditions under which the various different outcomes are expected. I then discuss differences between sexually and naturally selected traits. Sexually selected traits are often expected to be plastic in their expression, with individuals in high condition developing greater elaboration. As examples of sexually selected traits I review the evolution of colour patterns in birds with a view to assessing the magnitude of plastic responses in their development, and to ask how such responses may have influenced genetic evolution. The common colour pigments in birds are carotenoids and melanins. Both are used in social signaling, and consequently are expected to evolve to be phenotypically plastic indicators of an individual's quality. Perhaps partly because they are condition indicators, the quantity of carotenoids in the plumage can be strongly influenced by diet. Examples are described where alterations of carotenoids in the diet are thought to have altered the phenotype, driving genetic evolution in novel directions. Melanin patterns seem to be less affected by diet, but the intensity of melanization after moult is affected by social interactions during the moult and by raising birds in humid conditions. Hormonal manipulations can have dramatic effects on both the kinds of melanin produced ( eumelanin or phaeomelanin) as well as the patterns they form. Differences between species in melanin patterns resemble differences produced by environmental manipulations, as well as those produced by simple modulations of parameters in computer simulations of pattern formation. While phenotypic plasticity is one way that genetic change in plumage patterns ( and other traits) could be driven, there are others, including the appearance of major mutations and selection on standing variation whose distribution is not altered in the new environment. I consider some evidence for the different alternatives, and ask when they might lead to qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents the varietal structure of rice crops and the results of ecological variety tests in the Krasnoarmeisky district of Krasnodar region for 2016-2019. It also identifies the promising varieties taking into account the acreage of sowing and crop productivity. A rice varietal complex has been developed for the conditions of the Krasnoarmeisky district.
   Despite certain external similarities and the same productive potential of the varieties offered for production, they differed in biological and technological indicators, i.e. in relation to environmental factors and responsibility to technologies. In this regard, the formation of the varietal structure of rice crops, the main thing is to identify the the most productive varieties for each district and farm, taking into account the agro-ecological quality of the land, the cultivation technology and the predecessor by making environmental and production tests.

AB  - Planning for and managing disturbances in protected areas requires governance arrangements that are both adaptive to changing conditions and effective in dealing with multiple challenges. This paper presents a framework composed of principles and criteria of good and adaptive governance that pays attention to inclusiveness, responsibility, fairness, strategic vision, performance orientation, and adaptiveness. The framework was empirically tested on fire management planning in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada, involving interactions between Parks Canada and Saskatchewan Environment. Our results suggest that while the principle of performance orientation was upheld, principles such as inclusiveness and adaptiveness were only partially supported. Additional testing beyond fire management planning can help determine the utility of the framework for other environmental management situations.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive requires ecological status classification and monitoring of surface and ground water bodies using biological indicators. To fulfill the demands of the Directive, a macrophyte-based assessment system was developed for application on four lake site types in Germany. Biological lake site types were established using differences in characteristic macrophyte communities, reflecting ecoregion, Ca2+ content, mixis and morphology. Ecological status classification of lake sites is based on macrophyte abundance along 275 transects in 95 natural German lakes and the calculation of a reference index value, in some cases supplemented by submerged vegetation data. The reference index quantifies the deviation of species composition and abundance from reference conditions and classifies sites to one of the five ecological quality classes specified in the Directive. Based on an example of Lake Chiemsee, Germany, the possibilities for a wholelake assessment are discussed.

AB  - Due to their sensitivity to environmental contamination and their link with fish health status, innate immunomarkers are of great interest for environmental risk assessment studies. Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge about the effect of confounding factors can lead to data misinterpretation and false diagnostics. So, the determination of reference values was of huge interest for the integration of biomarkers in biomonitoring programs. Laboratory immunomarker reference ranges (including cellular mortality, leucocyte distribution, phagocytosis activity, respiratory burst and lysosomal presence) that consider three confounding factors (season, sex and body size) were previously developed in three-spined stickleback. Gasterosteus aculeatus, from our husbandry. Usefulness of these reference ranges in biomonitoring programs depends on how they can be transposed to various experimental levels, such as mesocosm (outdoor artificial pond) and field conditions. Immunomarkers were therefore measured every 2 months over 1 year in one mesocosm and in one site assumed to uncontaminated (Houdancourt,field). Differences between immunomarker seasonal variations in mesocosm and field fish on one side and laboratory fish on the other side were quantified: in some cases, seasonal trends were not significant or did not differ between mesocosm and laboratory conditions, but overall, models developed based on data obtained in laboratory conditions were poorly predictive of data obtained in mesocosm or field conditions. To propose valuable field reference ranges, mesocosm and field data were integrated in innate immunomarker modelling in order to strengthen the knowledge on the effect of confounding factors. As in laboratory conditions, sex was overall a confounding factor only for necrotic cell percentage and granulocyte-macrophage distribution and size was a confounding factor only for cellular mortality, leucocyte distribution and phagocytosis activity. Confounding factors explained a large proportion of immunomarker variability in particular for phagocytosis activity and lysosomal presence. Further research is needed to test the field models in a biomonitoring program to compare the sensitivity of immunomarkers to the confounding factors identified in this study and the sensitivity to various levels of pollution.

AB  - The lacustrine shale in the Jurassic Da'anzhai Member is considered as an excellent source rock in the central Sichuan Basin. However, geochemical studies of lacustrine organic matter (OM) accumulation factors and mechanisms are scarce. This study investigated the variations in total organic carbon (TOC), major elements, trace elements (TEs), and delta C-13 and delta O-18 values to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions, biotic productivity, terrestrial inputs and other factors to improve the understanding of the controlling factors and dynamical formation models for lacustrine OM. The target shale was deposited in a fluctuating and complicated terrestrial open lake that exhibited oxic-suboxic oxygen levels, weak to moderate hydrodynamic conditions, a dry to humid climate, moderate weathering, and fresh to saline water conditions. The lake experienced moderate-high biotic productivity under a warm, humid climate and featured abundant flora and fauna. Compared to the Da(1)(3) shale, the Da1 shale featured higher salinity levels, a hotter and drier climate, greater weathering and more reduced conditions. The Da(1)(3) shale experienced stronger hydrodynamic forces and a more humid climate. Moreover, the TOC values of the Da(1)(3) correlate better with the indicators of redox conditions and exhibit little or no correlation with indicators of climate, weathering, salinity and biotic productivity, indicating that the lacustrine OM was mainly controlled by the redox conditions. Additionally, factors such as hydrodynamic conditions and terrestrial inputs exerted some degree of influence. Based on these factors and their relationships, two dynamical formation models are proposed: a high-salinity low-oxygen dynamical formation model (Model I) and a deep-water low-oxygen dynamical formation model (Model II). Model I stresses that the low oxygen levels were mainly caused by salinity, whereas Model II stresses that the low oxygen levels were mainly caused by deep depth. Both models can be classified as preservation models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The population level is often the biological endpoint addressed in ecological risk assessments (ERAs). However, ERAs tend to ignore the metapopulation structure, which precludes an understanding of how population viability is affected by multiple stressors (e.g., toxicants and environmental conditions) at large spatial scales. Here we integrate metapopulation model simulations into a regional-scale, multiple stressors risk assessment (Bayesian network relative risk model [BN-RRM]) of organophosphate (OP) exposure, water temperature, and DO impacts on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). A matrix metapopulation model was developed for spring Chinook salmon in the Yakima River Basin (YRB), Washington, USA, including 3 locally adapted subpopulations and hatchery fish that interact with those subpopulations. Three metapopulation models (an exponential model, a ceiling density-dependent model, and an exponential model without dispersal) were integrated into the BN-RRM to evaluate the effects of population model assumptions on risk calculations. Risk was defined as the percent probability that the abundance of a subpopulation would decline from their initial abundance (500 000). This definition of risk reflects the Puget Sound Partnership's management goal of achieving "no net loss" of Chinook abundance. The BN-RRM model results for projection year 20 showed that risk (in % probability) from OPs and environmental stressors was higher for the wild subpopulations-the American River (50.9%-97.7%) and Naches (39.8%-84.4%) spring Chinook-than for the hatchery population (CESRF 18.5%-46.5%) and the Upper Yakima subpopulation (21.5%-68.7%). Metapopulation risk was higher in summer (58.1%-68.7%) than in winter (33.6%-53.2%), and this seasonal risk pattern was conserved at the subpopulation level. To reach the management goal in the American River spring Chinook subpopulation, the water temperature conditions in the Lower Yakima River would need to decrease. We demonstrate that 1) relative risk can vary across a metapopulation's spatial range, 2) dispersal among patches impacts subpopulation abundance and risk, and 3) local adaptation within a salmon metapopulation can profoundly impact subpopulation responses to equivalent stressors.

AB  - The main goal of the study was to evaluate biogeochemical effects of particular factors changing the structure of landscapes due to enhanced mass migration and erosion of the outcropping rocks by studying transformation of chemical composition of the draining waters and flood plain soils; chemical composition of the solid and liquid phases of the Ardon River waters; and by assessing ecological consequences and risk of contamination of the area by heavy metals.
   Water, soil, and biota species (plants, algae, and amphibian) were sampled at the plots located up- and downstream the mining and industrial areas of North Ossetia (the Ardon River basin) before and after the mudflow that took place in 2002. The air-dried samples were decomposed in a mixture of mineral acids. Heavy metals were determined by means of AAS with the help of AAS-80 (Hitachi) or AAS-2A (KORTEC) using standard reference materials of hair (CRM 397), plant mixture (SBMT-02), and soil (SRM 2709). Hydrochemical and biochemical analyses were performed with the help of the known methods (Kraynov and Shvets 1992; Burtis et al. 2006).
   The study showed that activity of the Misur Mining Combine and its Ardon-Khost tailings caused a significant local increase of Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn content in soils, water, and biotic components as compared to the background values. The mudflow of 2002 changed the structure of landscapes and was followed by a considerable transformation of chemical composition of the downstream river waters and floodplain soils, and by invasion of particular hydrophyte species. Algae and amphibian adapted to the changed conditions and indicated both natural and anthropogenic transformation of the environment. A distinct relation between the particle size of the suspended matter in the Ardon River waters and water salinity was discovered.
   Therefore, the Unal basin presents a vivid example of modern natural and anthropogenic evolution of Pb-Zn biogeochemical province under conditions of the extreme and dynamic geochemical environment leading to enhanced risks of ecological damage. Algae species demonstrated high adaptive and indicative capacity in case of both the fast natural and man-made impact.

AB  - Information is a crucial currency for living organisms as it allows them to adjust their behaviour to environmental fluctuations. Thus, natural selection should have favoured the capacity of collecting information from different sources, including social interactions whereby individuals could quickly gain reliable information. However, such conditions may also favour the gathering of potentially detrimental information, such as false or misinterpreted accounts of environmental and social phenomena such as rumours, which may spread via informational cascades. We applied ecological and evolutionary principles to investigate how the propagation of social information at a populational level affects the propensity to assimilate it, here defined as the gullibilty. Our results show that the evolution of an individual's susceptibility to assimilate information strongly depends on eco-evolutionary feedbacks, in particular when both useful and detrimental information circulate. We discuss our results regarding the different information transmission mechanisms involved with particular attention to specific cases of social learning.

AB  - Assessing environmental condition is essential for the management of coasts and their resources, but better management decisions occur when large databases are simplified into more manageable units of information. Here we present the habitat structure index (HSI), which enables rapid assessment and direct comparison of seagrass habitat structure using scores of 0 (poor) to 100 (excellent) based on integrating five habitat variables: area, continuity, proximity, percentage cover, and species identity. Acquiring data to calculate the HSI can be done in situ or from video recordings, and requires relatively simple methodology of belt transects, estimating percentage cover, and basic taxonomy. Spatiotemporal comparisons can usefully identify locations and periods of seagrass habitat change, potentially providing an early warning indicator of habitat damage and decline in environmental quality. Overall, the integrative approach of the HSI represents a step toward simplifying the exchange of environmental information among researchers, coastal managers, and governing bodies.

AB  - The Chinese government has conducted the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project (RGLGP) across large portions of grasslands from western China since 2003. In order to explore and understand the impact in the grassland's eco-environment during the RGLGP, we utilized Projection Pursuit Model (PPM) and Geographic Information Systeni (GIS) to develop a spatial assessment model to examine the ecological vulnerability of the grassland. Our results include five indications: (1) it is practical to apply the spatial PPM on ecological vulnerability assessment for the grassland. This methodology avoids creating an artificial hypothesis, thereby providing objective results that successfully execute a multi-index assessment process and analysis under non-linear systems in eco-environments; (2) the spatial PPM is not only capable of evaluating regional eco-environmental vulnerability in a quantitative way, but also can quantitatively demonstrate the degree of effect in each evaluation index for regional eco-environmental vulnerability; (3) the eco-environment of the Xianshui River Basin falls into the medium range level. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use cover and change (LUCC) crucially influence the Xianshui River Basin's eco-environmental vulnerability. Generally, in the Xianshui River Basin, regional eco-environmental conditions improved during 2000 and 2010. The RGLGP positively affected NOVI and LUCC structure, thereby promoting the enhancement of the regional eco-environment; (4) the Xianshui River Basin divides its ecological vulnerability across different levels; therefore our study investigates three ecological regions and proposes specific suggestions for each in order to assist in eco-environmental protection and rehabilitation; and lastly that (5) the spatial PPM established by this study has the potential to be applied on all types of grassland eco-environmental vulnerability assessments under the RGLGP and under the similar conditions in the Returning Agriculture Land to Forest Project (RALFP). However, when establishing an eco-environmental vulnerability assessment model, it is necessary to choose suitable evaluation indexes in accordance with regional eco-environmental characteristics.

AB  - Nitrate resulting from nitrogen fertilisers used in Agriculture is a widespread contaminant of shallow groundwater and causes adverse effects on human, animal and ecosystem health. In order to evaluate the full extent of groundwater nitrate contamination, and how it might evolve in time, it is essential to understand controls on aquifer assimilative capacity. This level of understanding will also help to better target policies and incentives aimed at controlling the amount of nitrate entering downstream water systems.
   The potential for nitrate attenuation in groundwater was assessed by examining the concentration and distribution pattern of electron donors such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ferrous iron, and redox indicators such as dissolved oxygen (DO) and Eh in 57 monitoring bores on the lower Burdekin coastal floodplain, one of Queensland's and Australia's premier irrigation districts. Nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 14.4 mg/L NO3-N but were mostly undetectable in bores close to the coast. Groundwater age dates suggest that while there are nitrate 'hot spots' in certain areas, some or most of the nitrate is being consumed on its way to the ocean. Low nitrate concentrations were coupled with high ferrous concentrations. The low DO concentrations (< 2 mg/L) and high ferrous concentrations found in 55% of the bores indicate that redox conditions are suitable for nitrate attenuation by either denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. The reducing environment may be associated with the high DOC concentrations (up to 82 mg C/L) found in these groundwaters. Furthermore, high levels of ferrous iron found in the Ayr area combined with the wide spread geographical distribution of DOC indicate that these areas have a high potential for sustaining geochemical processes that reduces nitrate levels. The distribution of geochemical indicators also suggests that the shallower depths (< 15 m) of the groundwater systems have more potential for nitrate reduction than the deeper depths. The map identifying areas within the lower Burdekin with most potential for denitrification is a valuable first step in helping to understand and manage the fate of nitrate entering the groundwater.

AB  - Interactions between the diversity of primary producers (plants) and of decomposers (microbes and mesofaunal communities), the two key functional groups that form the basis of all ecosystems have major consequences on the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. Soil microorganisms control the transformation and mineralization of natural compounds and xenobiotics. The soil microbiota, existing in extremely high density and diversity, rapidly modify the energetic performance and activity rates to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the microbial consortium possesses the ability to accommodate environmental constraints by adjusting (i) activity rates, (ii) biomass, and (iii) community structure. These parameters are particularly important to take into consideration when evaluating soil quality. The present paper gives an overview about the possibilities to use bacterial and fungal populations as an indicator for soil quality. Furthermore also the applicability of nematodes for the determination of soil health will be discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An Important component of any ecosystem Is the species It contains. Species also serves as good Indicators of the ecological condition of a system. A list of all species collected during the three-year period was therefore compiled together with their life form spectra. The floristic composition of the ash disposal area at Hendrina Power Station was also compared with the floristic composition of an adjacent natural grassland. A total of 278 species were identified of which 151 occurred on the ash disposal sites and 163 in the natural grassland. Of all the species, 35 occurred In both areas of which most were annual pioneer species. The species composition and life form spectra of the two areas were considerably different. Therophytes were, for example, more abundant on the ash disposal areas. The reconstruction of an ecosystem on ash disposal sites with a species composition similar to that of the natural grassland will require far more financial Inputs and habitat amelioration than is presently the situation.

AB  - Improved soil productivity will be vital to meet expected food and fiber demands of growing populations. Concepts of soil health assessments focus on specific soil properties and determination of a soil's ability to maintain a range of ecological functions in its appropriate ecosystem, supporting long-term sustainability. Objectives of the investigation were to determine the influence of cover crop, soil depth, and landscape under varied management practices on biological soil health indictors. Four watersheds within the Chariton County Cover Crop Soil Health Farm, Missouri, United States, with Armstrong loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Hapludalfs, 5% to 9% slopes eroded) were used for the study. Two watersheds were managed with cover crops, rotational planting, and no-till applications. Initial cover crop planting occurred during the fall of 2012. Two control watersheds received no cover crop management. It is important to note drought conditions persisted over the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Soils were sampled in 2012 and 2014 by landscape and depth (0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 to 30 cm) from the watersheds. Analyses included soil enzymatic activity, soil microbial diversity, and soil nutrients. Enzyme activities and nutrient levels significantly decreased with soil depth. For example, beta-Glucosidase 0 to 10 cm depth values ranged from approximately 85 to 100 mu g of para-nitrophenol (PNP) per gram oven dry soil (gds(-1)), with 20 to 30 cm depth values ranging from approximately 35 to 40 mu g PNP gds(-1). Nutrient levels, enzyme activities, and water stable aggregates displayed various levels of significance across landscape positions (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Carbon (C) and select enzyme indicator parameter measurements significantly (p < 0.01 and p < 0.10) differed between sampling events.We expected to detect significant relationships between soil biological activities and land management practices to identify practices that lead to improving soil health. However, identifying cover crop effect between watersheds proved challenging due to poor stand establishment and the duration of the monitoring period, emphasizing the importance of extended monitoring to determine the effects associated with long-term management conditions and health assessment practices.

AB  - Industrial ecological system is a sustainable mode of modern industry development. Industrial symbiosis, a sub-field of industrial ecology, engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach, involving exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products, to enhance competitive ability and environmental performance. To construct a symbiosis analysis method, this article employs a number of parameters embodying information about materials, energy and economics as the main essential parameters in system analysis and introduces symbiosis profit and symbiotic consumption elements as the economic indicators. A modeling and simulation program is designed using the agent-based modeling approach to simulate the evolvement of a hypothetical coal-based industrial system and the change of symbiosis conditions in the process of construction is examined. The simulation program built using the Swarm library, which is a freely available multi-agent simulation package, provides a useful demonstration for the symbiosis analysis method.

AB  - This article focuses on possible geochemical consequences of potential industrial activities in the deep sea, such as manganese nodule mining, for the heavy metal cycle of the deep sea and possible reactions of the benthic ecosystem. The metal fluxes induced by sediment resuspension are compared with fluvial, atmospheric, and hydrothermal metal fluxes into the ocean. The results of geochemical laboratory experiments and analyses of deep-sea benthic organisms are discussed with respect to their ecological importance in case of a seabed disturbance.
   A limited short-term increase of heavy metal concentrations in the benthic layer will probably cause only negligible harmful effects on the biota. An essential precondition is that the geochemical milieu remains largely unchanged; especially variations of the redox conditions would result in changes in metal speciation, bioavailability, and toxicity.

AB  - Scale-up microcosm system consisting of producer, decomposer and predator was employed to assess effect of LAS on aquatic ecosystem. Effect of LAS was determined with not only population density but also chemical data such as ATP, nutrients, pH and DO, etc. Microorganism-such as bacteria, algae, protozoa and micrometazoa in the microcosm system proliferated and reached to stationary phase on day 16, In the stationary phase, values of biological and chemical factors were constant, supporting the dynamic equilibrium of scale-up microcosm No observed effect concentration (NOEC) of LAS on population density was less than 1.5 mg.1(-1). NOECs of LAS on ATP, DO and P/R (net photosynthesis/respiration) ratio were less than 2.5 mg.1(-1). It was suggested that scale-up microcosm system was useful for environmental assessment because it could provide precise assessment of chemical substances based on biological and chemical condition of ecosystem, (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB  - The influence of physicochemical parameters other than the nutrients load on the community structure of phyto- and zooplankton in lowland shallow lakes is still poorly understood. In this study we investigated the structure of the plankton community in Danube Delta (Romania) and the relationships with environmental variables. Among the 206 taxa observed, 33 species were dominant. Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that incident light, lakes depth, surface area and water conductivity were of significant importance in controlling the variation in the structure of the plankton assemblages. The resulted models from averaging regression and cross-calibration predicted the main environmental parameters and allowed the selection of phyto and zooplankton species as potential biological indicators. Weighted averaging regression and cross-calibration generated useful models for predicting the main four investigated environmental parameters, which contribute to the selection of phyto- and zooplankton species as potential biological indicators.

AB  - Models predicting the spatial distribution of wild animals are essential for conservation purposes (e.g. conservation plan formulation and reserve selection) and for assessment of ecological impacts of factors such as pollution and climate change. When a species' habitat use depends on highly dynamic environmental conditions, predictive models should be constructed for specific time periods, taking into account the existing spatial distribution of the relevant habitat conditions. In the case of ringed seals (Phoca hispida), habitat use is intimately connected with sea ice. In the High Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard, ringed seals have two different tactics for selection of large-scale summer habitat. Some individuals spend summer in coastal (inshore) areas, while others migrate offshore to the southern limits of the northern sea ice edge. The predicted decline of the sea ice extension in the Arctic is likely to critically affect the profitability of this latter foraging-migration tactic. Two modelling approaches were used in this study to explore when impacts are likely to occur. One approach explored small-scale habitat use within the two types of summer areas using habitat residency functions. These functions were empirically derived from statistical Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models fit to spatial data on seal residency times (i.e., first-passage times) and local habitat features such as ice conditions. These functions predict the probability of using a given area longer than a given time. They were subsequently used to produce cartographic predictions of habitat use intensity for different times of the year, under various scenarios for sea ice conditions. Such dynamic predictions of animal space use (in space and time), can have wide applications for studies of other marine and terrestrial species that are based on data collected from telemetry. In the second approach, data from satellite telemetry and ringed seals energetics during summer were combined to construct a model for ringed seal blubber mass gain during summer. This model was then used to predict the profitability of offshore migrations as a function of the distance to the sea ice edge. This distance is expected to increase in a warmer climate. Migrations to offshore ice edges were predicted to become energetically unprofitable for ringed seals if the sea ice retreats further than 600-700 km from Svalbard.

AB  - The microfauna communities present in aerobic granular sludge reactors (e.g., granule sludge batch reactor or GSBR) that are used to treat landfill leachate were studied to determine which taxons are useful as process performance indicators. Communities were analyzed during four periods: a stable reactor operation period at a temperature of 29 degrees C, a transitional period of biomass adaptation at a temperature of 25 degrees C, an additional period of stable reactor operation at 25 degrees C, and at 25 degrees C after a period of lowered dissolved oxygen concentration. The results indicate that Vorticella infusionum and telotrochs were the taxons most sensitive to environmental changes in the GSBR, showing potential as biological indicators of ammonium overload and process destabilisation. Other taxons had similar abundance, despite changing environmental conditions in the bioreactor.

AB  - The sustainable development of countryside requires an interconnection of the interests concerning social and economic development with the interests of environmental protection. At the same time, we may suppose that the current way of management in the landscape leading to environmental degradation and to the decrease in natural resources can hardly be a basis for sustainable economic development. In the Slovak conditions, mountain and submountain landscape ecosystems provide more cases of unsuitable management with natural resources. Regards rural areas, there exists a significant interrelation between economic activities and the quality of the environment. This interrelation should be reflected also with the creation of plans for the development of countryside. As an example of the inter-relation between the development of the country and the creation of plans we used a concrete model territory of the Sobotiste which is a wonderful example of the white-carpatian "kopanitsee" settlement.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in skin mucus production and composition offer a new means to study how fish cope with changes in the environment. We explored the utility of skin mucus as an indicator of physiological responses and energy use in a reference fish species, the European sea bass. We evaluated the exudation volume of skin mucus and the main stress- and osmoregulation-related biomarkers in both mucus and plasma. We demonstrate the viability to study the exuded volume of skin mucus composition and its parameters as an informative tool of the fish energy waste at different environmental salinities. This study is of great interest for both aquaculture and ecological studies. The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a euryhaline marine teleost that can often be found in brackish and freshwater or even in hypersaline environments. Here, we exposed sea bass juveniles to sustained salinity challenges for 15 days, simulating one hypoosmotic (3 parts per thousand), one isosmotic (12 parts per thousand) and one hyperosmotic (50 parts per thousand) environment, in addition to control (35 parts per thousand). We analyzed parameters of skin mucus exudation and mucus biomarkers, as a minimally invasive tool, and plasma biomarkers. Additionally, Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured, as well as the gill mucous cell distribution, type and shape. The volume of exuded mucus increased significantly under all the salinity challenges, increasing by 130% at 50 parts per thousand condition. Significantly greater amounts of soluble protein (3.9 +/- 0.6 mg at 50 parts per thousand vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg at 35 parts per thousand, p < 0.05) and lactate (4.0 +/- 1.0 mu g at 50 parts per thousand vs. 1.2 +/- 0.3 mu g at 35 parts per thousand, p < 0.05) were released, with clear energy expenditure. Gill ATPase activity was significantly higher at the extreme salinities, and the gill mucous cell distribution was rearranged, with more acid and neutral mucin mucous cells at 50 parts per thousand. Skin mucus osmolality suggested an osmoregulatory function as an ion-trap layer in hypoosmotic conditions, retaining osmosis-related ions. Overall, when sea bass cope with different salinities, the hyperosmotic condition (50 parts per thousand) demanded more energy than the extreme hypoosmotic condition.

AB  - Sponges play a vital role in the world's most complex and vulnerable marine ecosystems. Various in situ studies have suggested that sponge morphologies (developed from exposure to a range of biophysical factors) can be considered as ecological indicators to current detrimental environmental changes such as climate change, overfishing, pollution and dredging for coastal development. Regional and long-term taxonomic data on sponges within each geographic range is not always available, especially from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), due to dearth of sponge research. In this study, to understand large-scale variation and advance sponge research and knowledge, morphological characteristics were adopted as a rapid practical way to identify sponges from phototransect images of a long-term dataset from the GBR. Biennial surveys were carried out in 2008-2014 from 28 pairs of take and no-take zones of the GBR. To evaluate the temporal changes in sponge morphology and correlation between abiotic factors, remote-sensed data such as chlorophyll a, current, wave height and sea surface temperature (SST) during the survey period were analyzed. Results showed sponges were ubiquitous in all six surveyed locations and their distribution was spatially heterogeneous. Encrusting forms were dominant followed by upright, massive, cups and tabular growth forms. Sponges were more prevalent in Innisfail, Pompey and Townsville compared to Cairns, Swain and Capricorn Bunker. Biennial observations showed greater sponge coverage in 2010 and 2014, especially in the central GBR, which may be related to the geomorphology and habitat of reefs along with its influence by wind and wave action. Also, the aftermath of Cyclone Hamish (2009) and Yasi (2011) would have triggered suspended particulate matter that are beneficial to sponge growth. Geostrophic current showed a weak relationship on encrusting, upright and massive forms, whereas, chl-a, wave height and SST appeared to have no effect on sponge morphology, suggesting sponges may be resilient to adverse conditions in the GBR. Whilst selected sponge morphologies can act as environmental proxies to monitor adverse conditions, further in situ research on other environmental parameters such as turbidity, sedimentation, cyclone, tides are required to bring substantial conclusions on sponge morphologies as ecological indicators.

AB  - Soil security is an emerging multidisciplinary concept that provides a framework with the potential to support the sustainability of the agri-food sector while simultaneously supporting the other functions that soil provides. This framework considers the biophysical, economic, and social dimensions that impact this multifunctional system. Particular attention is given to describing the impact of the recent development in assessing the soil's capacity and how it affects its function, assessed through its capability and condition. Progress in placing value on the functions of soil is explored, and the opportunity to increase connectivity between soil and end users is developed through multidisciplinary educational strategies. The perspectives provided here lead to a set of recommendations that will guide the development of future strategies, the pressing need for a set of measurable indicators, and the development of incentive schemes to secure the soil's ability to support agrifood systems and its other ecosystem functions.

AB  - Diuron and copper pyrithione (CuPT) are two substances that have been used worldwide as alternatives to tributyltin (TBT) in antifouling paints for the protection of ship hulls. In this study their toxicity against the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana is examined under several combinations of salinity and temperature using the LC20, LC50 and LC80 values found for the 25C and 35 standard conditions. A significant interaction between temperature and salinity effects was observed for both chemicals. Decreasing temperature almost eliminated Diuron's toxicity, while a toxicity reduction was also observed for CuPT. Decreasing salinity decreased Diuron's toxicity, while for CuPT the effect of salinity was more complex. These two natural environmental parameters had a profound influence on the ecotoxicity of the two tested chemicals, and this highlights the importance of considering the implications of such factors when conducting ecological risk assessment.

AB  - In this study, a system was established to perform an initial environmental risk assessment of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) spill accidents. Initial environmental risk assessment was performed using exposure and hazard assessments. An integrated hydrodynamic and chemical fate model was used to predict HNS concentrations at harbors, taking into account local environmental conditions. To consider the worst case HNS spill accident, the spill amount of 10,000 tonnages, was used for this study. The results show that highly soluble HNS are fatal to marine organisms during the neap tide. The results were based on a hypothetical worst case FINS spill accident and, not any specific actual HNS spill accident. Nevertheless, the method and system developed in this study, which includes the physical/chemical properties of 158 priority FINS, can be readily used to perform an initial environmental risk assessment for future HNS spill accidents.

AB  - The evolution of the biophysical characteristics of the African Western Sahelian environment and the Senegalese Ferlo in particular is marked by strong fluctuations in the rainfall intervened during these last decades and which had important consequences on the biological potential of the region. The modifications that they have induced on the ecosystems are read through the floristic composition, the chorology of species found in the region and the contours of the landscapes; flora is a good indicator of the biophysical environment evolution during the last decades. So the phytoclimatic organization at the micro-regional scale deserves to be reviewed and updated in light of major changes. The floristic study of plant resource, seen through the prism of dual anthropogenic practices and changing environmental conditions, allows to understand better the complexity of the internal physical and societal dynamics.

AB  - An assessment of the socio-ecological system of the Nature Park "Numto" in West Siberia was carried out based on ecosystem services (ES) mapping, applying a "cascade approach" which was modified according to the specific conditions of low commercial land-use by Indigenous Peoples and adopted with a focus on making it practicable and understandable by decision-makers. The ES values were defined through stakeholder analysis, while the mapping was based on the biophysical traits of the ecosystems and related spatial distribution of ecosystem functions. The mapped ecosystem values differ from the perceived ones. The assessment identified conflicting land uses and groups of stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples vulnerable to future climate change-induced deficits in access to ES. The ES that are important for climate change mitigation and adaptation are not valued highly by Indigenous Peoples. ES mapping is suggested as an appropriate method for the development of straightforward recommendations for Nature Park management.

AB  - There are biological and environmental factors which lead to stereotypic behaviour in humans and animals. Abnormal, functionless repetitive behaviour may have a genetic or epigenetic background; however, in the case of farm animals it is often linked with maintenance in a barren environment. Stereotypies have been considered as an indicator of poor welfare. They may occur in chronic stress situations as an animal's way of coping. Stereotypies are often noticed in cattle, pigs and horses kept individually. This form of behaviour is generally associated with the situation when an animal cannot satisfy its natural needs. Taking into consideration the currently increasing concern about maintaining proper husbandry conditions, especially in intensive breeding systems, the environmental improvement has become an important issue. The objective of this review is to present a characteristic of stereotypies in cattle, pigs and horses and to show various methods of reducing the frequency of this behaviour.

AB  - Environmental pollution impacts the structure, species richness and abundance of arthropod communities in urban environments. Detailed quantitative tests with microarthropod communities are nevertheless missing. We assessed species richness and abundances of Collembola within patches of urban green spaces in the city centre of Warsaw, Poland, to ask whether and how soil and air pollution influence springtail communities and whether these arthropods are suited as bioindicators. Springtails did not react significantly to varying environmental soil conditions, including heavy metal concentrations. Species richness was also independent of site area and isolation. However, springtails were highly sensitive to air pollution, particularly to PM10 and NO2 concentrations. In sites having NO2 air pollution above thresholds set by the European commission, species richness generally decreased. Our results indicate that springtails might not be a candidate taxon for urban soil bioindication. However, even moderate degrees of air pollution might have destructive effects on soil ecosystems.

AB  - Benthic hydroids are an important component of the Antarctic benthic ecosystem. This is characterised by extreme environmental conditions that undoubtedly affect organism distribution. In some cases, these conditions are related to depth (e.g. anchor ice or iceberg scouring). The Antarctic depth profile has special characteristics that reflect the depression of the continental crust by isostatic loading as well as glacial erosion during ice sheet expansion. Indeed, the Antarctic continental shelf is much deeper than others elsewhere in the world. This fact, along with the dynamic ice formation, affects a priori the bathymetric distribution of Antarctic benthic hydroids. This was first studied by Stepanjants in 1979, and later by Pea Cantero, in 2004, who summarised all available bathymetric information for Antarctic benthic hydroids, and established a series of bathymetric groups according to ecological features. The aim of this study was to review and update the present knowledge of bathymetric distribution of Antarctic benthic hydroids with data gathered in recent years in order to define hydrozoan bathymetric assemblages and depth-indicator species. To this end, all the valid records from the Antarctic (including the Scotia Arc) were compiled. Using similarity matrices (Sorensen coefficient), hierarchical clusters with SIMPROF test were performed. The results of the present study provide the division of the bathymetric profile into three main zones. The first one, which corresponds to the Shelf, extends from 0 to 700 m, and is clearly characterised by Eudendriidae and Campanulinidae. The second one, named Slope, associated with the continental slope, extends from 700 to 1500 m, and is characterised by a few exclusive species, like Halisiphonia prolifica Pea Cantero, 2014. Finally, the third zone, here named Abyss, extends beyond 2000 m, and includes a few species [e.g. Clathrozoella abyssalis Pea Cantero, Vervoort & Watson, 2003 (3083 m)]. The results also indicate a further division of the Shelf into three sub-zones: the anchor ice, the upper shelf and the lower shelf. The results show distinct boundaries between divisions, which could be linked to environmental factors, some of them likely related to the influence of ice.

AB  - Question: Does the role of dispersal and light limitation for community assembly change in temperate semi-natural dry grasslands (SNDGs) post-abandonment?
   Location: Temperate calcareous semi-natural dry grasslands, western Estonia (58.642 N, 23.516 E).
   Methods: We compared taxonomic and functional community structure of semi-natural dry grasslands in Estonia at two time periods: first in 1975 when traditional grazing prevailed, and again in 2013 when management had ceased for at least 30 yr. In order to assess functional community structure, we used community-weighted mean trait values and mean pair-wise distance as metrics of functional diversity for traits related to plant dispersal and adaptations to reduced light availability. Successional shifts in functional community structure were examined using regression and multivariate analysis.
   Results: Changes in community assembly of SNDGs post-abandonment were largely driven by more closed vegetation structure and subsequently reduced light availability, as well as altered availability of dispersal vectors. Importance of long-distance dispersal via grazing animals decreased while importance of bird dispersal increased under abandonment. At the same time, the importance of competition for light increased under abandonment. Results indicate that typical SNDG species are especially susceptible to abandonment because they are light-demanding and depend on dispersal by wind or epizoochory (i.e. on the fur of animals), and their decline likely leads to reduced small-scale species richness.
   Conclusions: Vegetation changes in abandoned SNDGs show that regular-management, by creating characteristic light and dispersal conditions, is highly important for maintaining both taxonomic and functional diversity. In particular, typical grassland species might be prone to local extinction as taller vegetation develops post-abandonment. The importance of dispersal processes for community assembly observed in grazed SNDGs thus highlights that successful grassland conservation should include maintenance of dispersal conditions. Grassland conservation should aim to preserve the whole ecosystem and account for the multiple ecosystem processes (e.g. light availability, dispersal), which simultaneously structure plant community composition.

AB  - Increasing bio-terror attacks across the world have alarmed the environmentalist and epidemiologist about the impacts of bioaerosols, especially on human health, ecosystems, and live stocks. Further, its fate has also been linked with future sustainability of rural and urban societies. These concerns have led the researchers to have in depth understanding of their sampling approaches, enumeration techniques, and survival factors. In this view, the suitable methods, available for the bioaerosol sampling i.e. filtration, impaction, and impingement are analyzed within the scope of the specific studies. With regard to compositional analysis of bioaerosols, detailed assessment revealed that overall microbial taxonomy cannot be expressed alone by culture-dependent methods, as majority of the microbial species are not culturable. Further, the overall diversity of the bioaerosols may be significantly expressed by means of culture-independent methods, in which various advanced sequencing techniques have resulted into wide range of outcomes in branch of genomics and metagenomics. In particular, the community structure is greatly influenced by the combination of various factors such as the complex interrelations between bacteria and fungi in form of co-occurrence or co-exclusion patterns, air pollution levels, and seasonal variations etc. The important meteorological parameters, responsible for their survival, transport, and contribution to the suspended particulate, include relative humidity, air temperature, wind direction, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation. The correlation between these factors and bioaerosol concentration was observed to be either positive, negative, or non-significant as it is strongly governed by local weather conditions and seasonal changes of the investigated regions. Moreover, the complex inter-relationships between bioaerosols and environmental pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone also reported to influence the bioaerosol concentration. Overall, this review offers insight into the current state of bioaerosol sampling approaches, devised detection techniques, survival and transport factors, and associated health effects. Authors also encourage that future research should be pursued from a sustainability perspective with a vision of development of reliable sampling methods and detection techniques.

AB  - In advanced societies, a significant indicator of social and political maturity is the quality of working conditions such as length of working hours, the proportion of night work. The aim of the article is to examine the working conditions in EU countries in terms of the employed persons working at night as a percentage of the total employment and an average number of usual weekly working hours in the main job. We observe the specifics of EU countries and the trends of their development in terms of convergence. Descriptive statistics, the analysis of time series development, multi-criteria evaluation (weighted sum) and sigma convergence method approaches are used as the research methods. The results show that the share of night work decreases overall. High values are found in Slovakia and Malta. In the long run, Greece has been characterised by a high average weekly working time, while the lowest value has long been kept by the Netherlands. Within the indicator, sigma convergence occurred from 2013 until 2018 the differences among countries have diminished. This is the result of increasing work productivity, which makes it possible to reduce the working hours.

AB  - The present article investigates socio-psychological conditions for the formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal for children of primary school age. The criteria (value-positive attitude of the child to the ideals of Beauty and Good, identification with the ideal bearers, imitation of the behaviour of people and literary characters, understanding of children?s own ideas about the spiritual ideal), indicators and levels (high, average, low) for the formation of the idea of a spiritual ideal in children of elementary school age are established. The results based on age and gender specifics and levels of formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal of primary school children are obtained. The factors influencing formation of the spiritual ideal and socio-psychological conditions of its formation are revealed: the peculiarities of relationships with others (parents, teachers, friends, peers, acquaintances and strangers); influence of mass media (TV products, computer network, radio information, books, literary works, magazines, newspapers); artistic aesthetic influence (works of art and theatre, communication with nature, aesthetic priorities and preferences, artistic amateur activities).

AB  - There is a need for accurate and easily-measured indicators suitable for characterising and monitoring agroecosystem multi-functionality. This is particularly true in intensively-farmed landscapes where it is of interest to quantify the role of small, woody vegetation features in providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. However, soil variability introduced by natural and management processes can interact with sampling designs to result in inappropriate sampling intensities and high levels of uncertainty in measured indicators. This can have consequences for upscaling of ecosystem quantities and decision making. Here, we present results from a pilot study aimed at quantifying and understanding variation in ten common indicators of soil condition and function, within shelterbelt and adjacent field soils, at four dryland sheep farms in Canterbury, New Zealand. Our results demonstrate a high level of spatially-structured soil variability, driven by (1) the effects of woody vegetation on shelterbelt soils relative to field soils, (2) differences in underlying soil types among sites, and (3) possible effects of grazing animals within fields. This soil variability had clear knock-on impacts for appropriate sampling effort, depending on the soil indicator in question, the original soil sampling density, and whether the aim was to estimate population mean values or to detect differences among sites with confidence. On the whole, confidence in soil indicator estimates was highest for soil condition indicators (pH, soil moisture, bulk density), variable for carbon quantities, depending on the measure used, and lowest for soil biological process indicators (tea bag index decomposition rate, bait lamina probe micro-invertebrate activity, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity); estimation confidence was also mostly lower for shelterbelt soils due to the effect of woody roots and inputs on soil variability. Based on our results, we present indicative sample size requirements to estimate population means for these different soil indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for the use of pilot studies, such as the one presented here, to facilitate understanding of variability in soil function indicators within different agroecosystems, and how this variability is partitioned spatially within and among vegetated features.

AB  - Pteropods, a group of holoplanktonic gastropods, are regarded as bioindicators of the effects of ocean acidification on open ocean ecosystems, because their thin aragonitic shells are susceptible to dissolution. While there have been recent efforts to address their capacity for physiological acclimation, it is also important to gain predictive understanding of their ability to adapt to future ocean conditions. However, little is known about the levels of genetic variation and large-scale population structuring of pteropods, key characteristics enabling local adaptation. We examined the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and nuclear 28S gene fragments, as well as shell shape variation, across a latitudinal transect in the Atlantic Ocean (35 degrees N-36 degrees S) for the pteropod Limacina bulimoides. We observed high levels of genetic variability (COI pi = 0.034, 28S pi = 0.0021) and strong spatial structuring (COI phi(ST) = 0.230, 28S phi(ST) = 0.255) across this transect. Based on the congruence of mitochondrial and nuclear differentiation, as well as differences in shell shape, we identified a primary dispersal barrier in the southern Atlantic subtropical gyre (15-18 degrees S). This barrier is maintained despite the presence of expatriates, a gyral current system, and in the absence of any distinct oceanographic gradients in this region, suggesting that reproductive isolation between these populations must be strong. A secondary dispersal barrier supported only by 28S pairwise phi(ST) comparisons was identified in the equatorial upwelling region (between 15 degrees N and 4 degrees S), which is concordant with barriers observed in other zooplankton species. Both oceanic dispersal barriers were congruent with regions of low abundance reported for a similar basin-scale transect that was sampled 2 years later. Our finding supports the hypothesis that low abundance indicates areas of suboptimal habitat that result in barriers to gene flow in widely distributed zooplankton species. Such species may in fact consist of several populations or (sub)species that are adapted to local environmental conditions, limiting their potential for adaptive responses to ocean changes. Future analyses of genome-wide diversity in pteropods could provide further insight into the strength, formation and maintenance of oceanic dispersal barriers.

AB  - The unabated continuation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the lack of an international consensus on a stringent climate change mitigation policy underscore the importance of adaptation for coping with the all but inevitable changes in the climate system. Adaptation measures in forestry have particularly long lead times. A timely implementation is thus crucial for reducing the considerable climate vulnerability of forest ecosystems. However, since future environmental conditions as well as future societal demands on forests are inherently uncertain, a core requirement for adaptation is robustness to a wide variety of possible futures. Here we explicitly address the roles of climatic and social uncertainty in forest management, and tackle the question of robustness of adaptation measures in the context of multi-objective sustainable forest management (SFM). We used the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF) as a case study, and employed a comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework based on ecosystem modeling, multi-criteria decision analysis, and practitioner participation. We explicitly considered climate uncertainty by means of three climate change scenarios, and accounted for uncertainty in future social demands by means of three societal preference scenarios regarding SFM indicators. We found that the effects of climatic and social uncertainty on the projected performance of management were in the same order of magnitude, underlining the notion that climate change adaptation requires an integrated social-ecological perspective. Furthermore, our analysis of adaptation measures revealed considerable trade-offs between reducing adverse impacts of climate change and facilitating adaptive capacity. This finding implies that prioritization between these two general aims of adaptation is necessary in management planning, which we suggest can draw on uncertainty analysis: Where the variation induced by social-ecological uncertainty renders measures aiming to reduce climate change impacts statistically insignificant (i.e., for approximately one third of the investigated management units of the AFF case study), fostering adaptive capacity is suggested as the preferred pathway for adaptation. We conclude that climate change adaptation needs to balance between anticipating expected future conditions and building the capacity to address unknowns and surprises. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research evaluates the effect of ecosystem anomalies during El Nino 2009-2010 and the role of serotonin and the dopamine antagonist: spiperone over the male reproductive mechanism of three species of the sub-genus Litopenaeus from the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. Wild males of Penaeus (Litopenaeus) stylirostris and Penaeus (Litopenaeus) occidentalis were captured during 2009-2010 for spermatophore quality analysis, complemented with sexual performance under captivity. Additionally, these species and Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei were used to study the role of serotonin alone and in combination with spiperone on male sexual maturation, using spermatophore quality parameters as indicators. Our findings indicate that during El Nino 2009-2010 the adult male population of P. stylirostris and P. occidentalis suffered a distinctive reproductive declined of reversible nature since after moving males to a stable environment (maturation laboratory conditions), in the same geographical location, both species improved significantly their sexuality in a short period of time, particularly P. stylirostris. These findings suggest that environmental cues are a primary controlled mechanism for spermatophore production and that captivity do not affect negatively the sexual status of wild Litopenaeus. Therefore, it seems that both species are capable of reaching their optimum sexual potential under controlled reproduction conditions by managing the environment adequately. Comparative studies in following years will help to clarify the relative contributions of El Nino event and fishery overexploitation over male shrimp sexuality. Concerning the role of neurotransmitters, serotonin at 25 mu g g(-1) body weight (b.w.; 10(-6) mol animal(-1)) did not induce any improvement on spermatophore quality of P. stylirostris and P. vannamei. Moreover, serotonin plus spiperone (2 mu g g(-1) b.w.; 10(-7) mol animal(-1)) injection in P. stylirostris, P. vannamei and P. occidentalis, induced some degree of negative sexual response. These findings suggest that serotonin and dopamine play a different reproductive role in males and females of Litopenaeus; the relative importance of the major known endocrine pathways is discussed.

AB  - We assessed the potential for using optical functional types as effective markers to monitor changes in vegetation in floodplain meadows associated with changes in their local environment. Floodplain meadows are challenging ecosystems for monitoring and conservation because of their highly biodiverse nature. Our aim was to understand and explain spectral differences among key members of floodplain meadows and also characterize differences with respect to functional traits. The study was conducted on a typical floodplain meadow in UK (MG4-type, mesotrophic grassland type 4, according to British National Vegetation Classification). We compared two approaches to characterize floodplain communities using field spectroscopy. The first approach was sub-community based, in which we collected spectral signatures for species groupings indicating two distinct eco-hydrological conditions (dry and wet soil indicator species). The other approach was species-specific, in which we focused on the spectral reflectance of three key species found on the meadow. One herb species is a typical member of the MG4 floodplain meadow community, while the other two species, sedge and rush, represent wetland vegetation. We also monitored vegetation biophysical and functional properties as well as soil nutrients and ground water levels. We found that the vegetation classes representing meadow sub-communities could not be spectrally distinguished from each other, whereas the individual herb species was found to have a distinctly different spectral signature from the sedge and rush species. The spectral differences between these three species could be explained by their observed differences in plant biophysical parameters, as corroborated through radiative transfer model simulations. These parameters, such as leaf area index, leaf dry matter content, leaf water content, and specific leaf area, along with other functional parameters, such as maximum carboxylation capacity and leaf nitrogen content, also helped explain the species' differences in functional dynamics. Groundwater level and soil nitrogen availability, which are important factors governing plant nutrient status, were also found to be significantly different for the herb/wetland species' locations. The study concludes that spectrally distinguishable species, typical for a highly biodiverse site such as a floodplain meadow, could potentially be used as target species to monitor vegetation dynamics under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether introducing reclaimed water to the lower part of the Llobregat River has an effect on the macroinvertebrate community assemblage and the biomarker responses of the caddisfly larvae Hydropsyche exocellata. Therefore, a before-and-after experiment was carried out at two locations, upstream and downstream of the discharge effluent. At both of the stations, quantitative benthic samples were taken using a Surber net. Several biological metrics were calculated to evaluate the biological quality. For the biomarker study, the population condition of the caddisfly H. exocellata was analysed. In both sites, as a result of physicochemical water conditions, the macroinvertebrate communities are dominated by taxa that are tolerant to pollution, and the ecological status of both sites is always poor. The discharge of the reclaimed water did not affect the composition and abundance of the dominant taxa, but the few intolerant species that were found upstream before the experiment disappeared downstream. Consequently, most of the metrics indicating the level of biological impairment had slightly lower values after the introduction of the treated water, even though the ecological status was always poor. Nevertheless, significant and specific toxic effects on the collected H. exocellata larvae were observed using biomarkers. The effects included oxidative stress-related responses, such as decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, indications of additional stress to the populations of the caddisfly H. exocellata were found using several biomarkers, which can indicate a potential further deterioration of the ecological status of the river. In polluted rivers, such as the Llobregat, structural indicators are unable to indicate further impairment and biomarkers may be used as an useful tool to detect then the environmental impoverishment. The combination of both kinds of indicators is necessary for the establishment of the ecological status of a system, following the indications of the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB  - In the Mediterranean area land degradation phenomena are becoming more and more important due to future climate change and increasing climate variability, as highlighted in recent global assessment projects such as the "Millennium Ecosystem Assessment" or "The Dialogue on Water and Climate". Thus, there is consistent evidence that extreme events such as droughts and floods are more frequent than before. On the other hand the Mediterranean area is strongly influenced by human activities such as cultivation over hundreds of years. However, in the last decades the cultivation methods and techniques are subject to profound changes such as mechanization, use of fertilizers and pesticides, remodellation of entire hillslopes etc. This particular situation leads to, and aggravates the existing stress on land resources. As a result, land degradation and soil erosion phenomena are leading to decreasing soil productivity or the loss of fertile top soil and related water quality and quantity issues. The Centre for Soil Erosion Studies (CRES) in Grosseto, Tuscany recently started a study to identify and monitor changes of land-use in southern Tuscany, Italy. The aim of this study is to assess land degradation sensitivity by scenario analysis. As a proxi for land degradation surface wash erosion processes such as rill and interill erosion processes are chosen. These present day processes are identified by aerial photo interpretation and subsequently modelled with a simple RUSLE approach on a monthly basis. In this study boundary conditions such as future precipitation were taken from the A2 future climate scenario published by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Moreover, current land-use was identified from aerial photographs and future land-use scenarios were developed considering ecological and socio-economical issues for present day conditions of the test area. Subsequently, the different climate and land-use scenarios were analysed to study soil erosion susceptibility on the landscape scale. The study shows that even with a decline in precipitation volume until 2070, in some months higher erosion rates occur due to higher rainfall erosivity. Furthermore, land-use changes play an important role for soil erosion susceptibility. As shown, the various scenarios can effectively reduce or enhance soil erosion. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although organic farming was originally promoted as an alternative farming system to address agronomic, environmental and ecological issues, its conventionalisation has led to an intensification and specialisation of production. In the light of this, several studies have questioned the environmental benefits of organic farming as well as its agronomic viability. Thus, there is a need to improve organic vegetable systems to reduce their environmental impact without affecting their productivity. To tackle this challenge, European farmers and researchers have recently started to focus on agroecological service crops (ASCs). However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the agronomic, environmental and ecological aspects of ASC management under different European pedo-climatic conditions. We evaluated effects of the ASC management strategies-no-till roller crimping (NT-RC) and green manuring (T-GM) on cropping system performance using agronomic, environmental and ecological indicators-to exemplify the need for multidimensional analysis to understand management implications for addressing environmental and agronomic challenges. We combined the results from 11 organic vegetable field trials conducted in seven European countries over a period of 2 years to test for general trends. Our results provide solid evidence that NT-RC management across different pedo-climatic conditions in Europe enhances the activity density of ground and rove beetles and improves both the potential energy recycling within the system and weed control. However, in NT-RC plots, lower cash crop yield and quality, energetic efficiency of production and activity density of spiders were observed compared to T-GM. Synthesis and applications. Multidimensional analyses using agronomic, environmental and ecological indicators are required to understand the implications of agricultural management in agroecosystem functioning. Introducing agroecological service crops combined with the use of no-till roller crimping is a promising strategy for improving agronomic performance (e.g. fewer weeds) and reducing environmental (e.g. increasing the potentially recyclable energy) and ecological (e.g. enhancing the activity density of beneficial taxa such as ground and rove beetles) impacts. However, our study also indicates a need for agronomic and environmental improvements while promoting a wider acceptance of this strategy.

AB  - To achieve agroecosystem conservation strategies while balancing the needs of people who live and work across rural landscapes, it is critical to understand what people need to improve and sustain their quality of life and well-being. Research that is designed to connect social-ecological dynamics, landscape change, and human impacts to human well-being and ecosystem health is well-suited to inform land management strategies and decision-making for agricultural production policies. We asked livestock producers, public land and resource managers, recreation users, conservationists, and wilderness advocates who live and work among rural communities in southwestern Idaho to describe social-ecological conditions that support and degrade their well-being. Using grounded theory methodology, we analyzed semi-structured interviews to discover meanings of well-being and to understand how people experience changes to their quality of life in an arid rangelands context. Our findings support previous research that suggests well-being is experienced at both individual and community scales, with sense of well-being influenced by ecological, economic, and socio-cultural processes. Specifically, our findings illuminate the role of social interactions as processes that support agroecosystem conditions and functions to the benefit or detriment of human well-being and ecosystem health. Community is not just a geographic territory; it is a process of social interactions through which people build, improve, or damage relationships that support or degrade well-being. By integrating scholarship on social change processes, ecosystem services, and impacts to human well-being, we contribute an integrated framework with a comprehensive set of social-ecological concepts to be used as a common language and synthesis guide for agroecosystem researchers and practitioners. We discuss our findings in the context of the USDA Agricultural Research Service's national network for Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR). The LTAR network is charged with identifying strategies for sustainable intensification that support agricultural productivity, environmental quality, and rural well-being. Our research sheds light on the functions of agroecosystem stakeholders and rural communities beyond their adoption (or not) of new technologies and management practices. Future assessments of environmental change and impacts must adequately address social processes that, alongside ecological processes, affect well-being for rural communities and landscapes.

AB  - The study of macroinvertebrate communities using a Reference Condition Approach (RCA) is a powerful tool for detecting the impacts of mining activities due to heavy metal contamination in rivers. However, studies on this topic based on an RCA fully satisfying the Water Framework Directive (WFD) criteria for reference site selection are still scarce. Following a WFD-compliant RCA design, a total of 14 reference and 15 test sites were intensively sampled during July 2015 in the Nalon River basin (Asturias, Northern Spain). Macroinvertebrate samples, water physicochemistry, metal concentrations in sediments and habitat quality were evaluated at each selected site. To determine whether increasing heavy metal levels in sediments have significant ecological impacts in the structure of macroinvertebrate communities in the study area, we applied a combination of non-parametric multivariate and univariate procedures, as well as gradient analysis and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) over the biotic and environmental datasets. We found significant alterations in the macroinvertebrate community structure with respect to the reference condition (REF group) for those test sites within mercury (HG group) and gold (AU group) mining areas, with Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) richness and abundance being the community descriptors showing the strongest alterations in relation to mining pressures in the studied area. Metal concentrations in sediments were significantly correlated to the metrics of community structure related to abundance, richness and biodiversity, with As and Hg being the two metals showing higher biological effects on macro-invertebrate assemblages. TITAN also allowed us to establish a set of macro invertebrate families specifically sensitive to metal concentrations in sediments, most of which corresponded to EPT families. Our results prove that determined sensitive taxa could be considered as reliable indicators of metal pollution in the mining areas of Northern Spain. From a WFD perspective, our study clearly indicates that the responsive community descriptors found in this study are actually key parameters in the evaluation of the ecological status in the rivers of Northern Spain. These data are highly relevant for the future development of environmental quality standards for river sediments in Spain.

AB  - Analysis of bivalve shell increments provides a means to reconstruct long-term patterns in growth histories and assess factors that regulate marine ecosystems, while tissue stable isotopes are indicators of food sources and trophic dynamics. We examined shell growth patterns and tissue stable isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of the hairy cockle (Ciliatocardium ciliatum) in the northwest Barents Sea to evaluate the influence of different water masses and the Polar Front on growth rates and food sources and to assess the influence of climatic variability on ecological processes over seasonal to decadal scales. Shell growth rates were highest in Atlantic water, intermediate in Arctic water, and lowest at the Polar Front. Temporal patterns of ontogenetically-adjusted growth (SGI) were negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), local precipitation and ice-free days. The highest growth occurred during colder periods with more sea ice, while lower growth was associated with warmer periods and less sea ice. Stable isotope values of lipid-extracted tissues from Atlantic water cockles were enriched in delta C-13 by up to 2.1 parts per thousand and delta N-15 by 1.5 parts per thousand compared to animals from Arctic waters. Distinct seasonal and water mass variations in stable isotopic values reflect spatial and temporal variability in food supplies to the bivalves in this region on small spatial scales. Overall, Atlantic waters supported the highest growth rates, the most complex trophic webs, and the greatest sensitivity to interannual variability in environmental conditions. Bivalves from Arctic waters were the most distinct of the three groups in their response to regional climate forcing and local environmental manifestations of those conditions. The Polar Front exhibits growth and isotopic characteristics predominantly of the Atlantic domain.
   These results demonstrate that integrating results of sclerochronological and stable isotopic analyses of benthic bivalves provide independent, corroborative lines of evidence and added insight into the ecological function of these systems when assessing potential effects of changes in water mass distributions in the Barents Sea.

AB  - Adaptation of nomadic groups of Kalmyks on the territory of the Russian Federation attracts the attention of researchers by the complexity and ambiguity of social and biological processes accompanied transition to a sedentary lifestyle in new environmental conditions. Analysis of the physical development of children and adults, fertility, morbidity, conditions of living, nutrition of the population of the Kalmyk Region in 1925 revealed a slow growth rate with a fluctuating level and some decrease in physical development. Taking these indicators as a starting point, we conduct a study of the dynamics of the formation of anthropogenetic features of physical development and parameters of the reproductive structure of rural populations of Kalmyks from 1925 to 2014. The analysis includes Torguts of Lagansky, Derbets of Tselinny, Buzays of Gorodovikovsky districts of Kalmykia Republic. The results indicate that there have been profound socio-economic changes, acceleration processes.Ageneral secular trend has been manifesting in a sharp increase in growth by 8.9 cm. and changes in other physical development indicators inKalmyks since the 1970s. In terms of weight and chest circumference, there is a tendency to increase, except for the chest indicator (the ratio of chest circumference to height). This indicates a harmonious growth and development that does not change the basics of the brachymorphic type of body structure. In rural populations, there was a demographic transition from the natural mode of reproduction to a regulated birth rate. The average age of the onset of menarche is 13.9 +/- 0.07 years old, the age of the first child birth is 23.5 +/- 0.18, of the last child birth is 31.3 +/- 0.26, climacterium comes at 47.8 +/- 0.23 years old. A pronounced gap between socially determined boundaries and the physiological duration of the reproductive period is revealed. In populations, there is a regulated type of birth rate, which is more characteristic for the urban population, with social pressure associated with the proportion of abortions. The authors propose a hypothesis that explains the reproductive compensation, which proceeds according to the type of reduction of embryonic losses, developed in generations by the evolutionary trend of biological fitness for nomadic life.

How to best manage semi-natural grasslands for maintaining biodiversity is still unclear in many cases because land-use processes may depend on environmental conditions and the indirect effects of land-use on biodiversity mediated by altered abiotic and biotic factors are rarely considered. Here we evaluate the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along an elevational gradient on a large topographic scale in the Eastern Carpathians in Ukraine. We sampled for two years 31 semi-natural grasslands exposed to cattle grazing. Within each grassland site we measured plant community properties such as the number of species, functional groups, and the proportion of species undesirable for grazing. In addition, we recorded cattle density (as a proxy for grazing intensity), soil properties (bare soil exposure, soil organic carbon, and soil pH) and densities of soil decomposers (earthworms and soil microorganisms). We used structural equation modelling to explore the direct and indirect effects of grazing intensity on plant communities along the elevation gradient. We found that cattle density decreased plant species and functional diversity but increased the proportion of undesirable species. Some of these effects were directly linked to grazing intensity (i.e., species richness), while others (i.e., functional diversity and proportion of undesirable species) were mediated via bare soil exposure. Although grazing intensity decreased with elevation, the effects of grazing on the plant community did not change along the elevation gradient. Generally, elevation had a strong positive direct effect on plant species richness as well as a negative indirect effect, mediated via altered soil acidity and decreased decomposer density. Our results indicate that plant diversity and composition are controlled by the complex interplay among grazing intensity and changing environmental conditions along an elevation gradient. Furthermore, we found lower soil pH, organic carbon and decomposer density with elevation, indicating that the effects of grazing on soil and related ecosystem functions and services in semi-natural grasslands may be more pronounced with elevation. This demonstrates that we need to account for environmental gradients when attempting to generalize effects of land-use intensity on biodiversity.

AB  - Background: Diverse wellness-promoting mobile health technologies, including mobile apps and wearable trackers, became increasingly popular due to their ability to support patients' self-management of health conditions. However, the patient's acceptance and use depend on the perceived experience and the app appropriateness to the patient's context and needs. We have some understating of the experience and factors influencing the use of these technologies in the general public, but we have a limited understanding of these issues in patients.
   Objective: By presenting results from an explorative study, this paper aims to identify implications for the design of mobile apps and wearables to effectively support patients' efforts in self-management of health with a special emphasis on support for self-efficacy of activities contributing to health.
   Methods: An explorative mixed-method study involving 200 chronically ill patients of Stanford Medical Center (Stanford, CA, United States) was conducted between mid-2016 and end of 2018. Amongst these, 20 patients were involved in a 4-weeks study, in which we collected the underlying wearable device use logs (e.g., Fitbit) and subjective use experience [via an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)], as well as patients' momentary perception of general self-efficacy in their natural environments and different daily contexts.
   Results: The results indicate that mobile apps for health and wearables have the potential to enable better self-management and improve patients' wellbeing but must be further refined to address different human aspects of their use. Specifically, the apps/wearables should be easier to use, more personalized and context-aware for the patient's overall routine and lifestyle choices, as well as with respect to the momentary patient state (e.g., location, type of people around) and health(care) needs. Additionally, apps and devices should be more battery efficient and accurate; providing timely, non-judgmental feedback and personalized advice to the patients anywhere-anytime-anyhow. These results are mapped on major sources of the individuals' self-efficacy.
   Conclusion: Our results show how the apps/wearables that are aimed at supporting the patients' self-management should be designed to leverage and further improve the patients' general self-efficacy and self-efficacy of activities contributing to chronic disease management.

AB  - Understanding localized patterns and community compositions of vegetation in an environment is critical to the reconstruction of climatic and ecological conditions across all spatiotemporal scales. One of the most accurate and useful ways to characterize vegetation, and therefore to describe the climatic and ecological conditions of a location, is through the plant fossil record. Phytoliths (plant silica microfossils) are often preserved in the absence of other paleobotanical data and are becoming more widely used for deep-time vegetation reconstructions. Significant work has been done to standardize the analytical methodology of phytolith extraction, statistical analysis, and interpretation, but more detailed investigations are needed to understand how well a given soil assemblage represents the actual aboveground plant biomass for a given ecosystem.
   We present results from paired soil phytolith assemblages and local vegetation assemblages across the central United States, including temperate forest, grassland, and rangeland/scrubland ecosystems. Phytolith assemblages obtained via extractions from soil A-horizons were compared to percent cover of species and plant biomass estimates obtained via in situ field observations and aerial estimates of tree cover to analyze differences in the relative abundance of forest/woody vegetation vs. grasses. Soil phytolith assemblages from all sites average a 29% bias toward the grass morphotypes as compared to actual aboveground biomass observations, and comparisons to percent cover yielded broadly comparable bias figures. Percent bias estimates do not show significant correlations to most environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, local elevation), however, an extremely strong correlation (p<0.001) was observed with soil order type. This is likely due to the fact that soil order reflects both vegetation type and chemical factors known to affect overall phytolith assemblages; therefore, soil order is a proxy that aggregates several sources of bias. As a result, we suggest further research into the development of correction factors between phytolith sample assemblages and their interpreted past counterpart ecosystems based on estimates derived from modern analyses of each major soil order type. Such background corrections are essential to the continued use of phytoliths as a proxy for past vegetation and ecological reconstructions of temperate ecosystems throughout the Phanerozoic record.

AB  - Structural colors result from an interaction between light and the fine-scale physical structure of a surface, and are often extremely bright, chromatic, and iridescent. Given that these visual features depend upon the aggregate abundance and architectural precision of photonic structures, structurally colored sexual ornaments seem well placed to indicate a range of mate quality characteristics. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the signaling potential of structural coloration in the sexually dimorphic butterfly Colias eurytheme. Males of this species display iridescent ultraviolet (UV) markings (arising from multilayer thin films)that overlay a broad area of yellowish-orange pigmentation on their dorsal wing surface. Only the structural UV has demonstrated function as a sexual signal; hence we predicted that it should contain more reliable phenotypic and/or genetic quality information, which would be indicated by phenotypic and/or genetically mediated condition dependence. in two split-family breeding experiments we manipulated condition by exposing full siblings to different stressors at two different juvenile life-history stages: (1) reduced larval host-plant quality and (2) transient heat/cold shocks during metamorphosis. Both stressors had profound effects on key developmental and life-history traits. Each stressor also significantly affected male dorsal coloration; thus, the expression of both structural and pigmentary coloration is phenotypically condition dependent. As predicted, the strongest condition dependence was evident in the brightness and angular visibility (i.e., iridescence) of the UV. Characteristics of both the iridescent UV and pigmentary orange also exhibited moderate-high and significant heritability (H-2 similar to h(2) similar to 0.4-0.9). However, genetic and residual variances did not increase under stress; thus, the observed condition dependence was not genetically mediated as predicted if wing color trait signals "good" genes for the ability to either withstand or circumvent developmental stress. The heightened stress sensitivity of the iridescent UV suggests that it offers an informative lifetime indicator of juvenile environments and, henceforth, adult male phenotypic condition, which may be salient to females seeking a highly fertile and/or nutritious male ejaculate.

AB  - Urban forests are increasingly valued for multiple benefits such as amenity, cultural values, native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and carbon sequestration. Urban biodiversity in particular, is the new focus although global homogenisation is undermining regional differentiation. In the northern hemisphere (e.g., Canada and USA) and in the southern hemisphere, particularly in countries like South Africa, Australia, South America and New Zealand, local biodiversity is further impacted by historical colonisation from Europe. After several centuries, urban forests are now composed of synthetic and spontaneous mixtures of native species, and exotic species from around the temperate world (e.g., Europe, North and South America, South Africa, Asia). As far as we are aware no-one has carried out in-depth study of these synthetic forests in any Southern Hemisphere city. Here we describe the composition, structure, and biodiversity conservation imperatives of urban temperate forests at 90 random locations in Christchurch city, New Zealand.
   We document considerable plant diversity; the total number of species encountered in the 253 sampled urban forest patches was 486. Despite this incredibly variable data set, our ability to explain variation in species richness was surprisingly good and clearly indicates that total species richness was higher in larger patches with greater litter and vegetation cover, and taller canopy height. Species richness was also higher in patches surrounded by higher population densities and closer to very large native forest patches. Native species richness was higher in patches with higher soil pH, lower canopy height, and greater litter cover and in patches closer to very large native forest patches indicating dispersal out of native areas and into gardens. Eight distinct forest communities were identified by Two-Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis (TWINSPAN) using the occurrence of 241 species that occurred in more than two out of all 253 forest patches.
   Christchurch urban forest canopies were dominated by exotic tree species in parklands and in street tree plantings (linear parkland). Native tree and shrub species were not as common in public spaces but their overall density high in residential gardens. There was some explanatory power in our data, since less deprivation resulted in greater diversity and density, and more native species, which in turn is associated with private ownership. We hypothesise that a number of other factors, which were not well reflected in our measured environmental variables, are responsible for much of the remaining variation in the plant community structure, e.g., advertising, peoples choice. For a more sustainable asset base of native trees in New Zealand cities we need more, longer-lived native species, in large public spaces, including a greater proportion of species that bear fruit and nectar suitable for native wildlife. We may then achieve cities with ecological integrity that present multiple historical dimensions, and sequester carbon in legible landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban woodlands are significant as refugia for species of wild birds which contribute to provisioning a wide range of ecological services beneficial to nature and to humans. Due to the increasingly small and fragmental structure of these habitats, arising from constant expansion of city infrastructure, these birds are in increasing conservation peril with serious ramifications to the ecological and touristic values they represent. We assessed the alpha, beta and functional diversities of birds in three small woodland stands within the metropolis of Nairobi, Kenya and compared their variations along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (Low, Moderate; High) based on relative openness, vegetation cover and rate of human visitation. Birds were surveyed using timed species counts during six sampling periods and grouped into three diet-guilds and three vertical foraging strata to assess compositional and assemblage turnover responses to disturbance. Functional overlaps in birds' ecological roles were also evaluated, and potential candidate species for monitoring disturbance trends were identified. Alpha diversities were determined using Chao1 species estimator, and beta diversity evaluated through the PERMDISP function and main-test Permanova in PERMANOVA thorn add-on of Primer-E, to assess species turnovers. Parameters were compared cross-site using general linear models while indicator species were identified using Indval function in R. Significant responses to impacts of anthropogenic disturbance were observed in abundance of birds overall, abundance of upper stratum species, and in terms of alpha diversity of carnivores but not for other guilds. On the other hand, species turnovers occurred along the disturbance gradient for birds overall, in frugivores and also for both upperand lower-stratum species. Species functional redundancies, depicting diminished habitat complexities, were detected in the most disturbed site for birds overall, amongst carnivores, all herbivores combined, and among the lower and middle-stratum species, but were not evident for birds overall in the lowor moderately-disturbed sites, nor among upper-stratum bird species. Only two species, both carnivorous, qualified as potential candidates for monitoring disturbance trends across the three woodland sites. These results demonstrate negative effects of anthropogenic disturbance on peri-urban woodland bird assemblage and composition, and greater resilience of taxonomic over functional diversity in response to such disturbance, but also that while formal protection may enhance bird's community-level functional roles, not all guilds may benefit. Mitigating effects of disturbance requires measures for improving Ecology (2021) habitat structural heterogeneity to broaden birds' assemblage composition, diversify their ecosystem roles at all levels and promote their site-based avi-tourism potential.

AB  - Simple Summary Transport and lairage conditions can negatively affect pig welfare and carcass quality. The effects of transport and lairage conditions are not clear because some studies were focused on one or two main factors within a well-controlled environment, without considering the interaction of commercial conditions. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess pig welfare at the slaughterhouse based on the presence of skin damage and to evaluate the effects of transport and lairage conditions. For research purposes, 4507 pigs were transported from one farm to one slaughterhouse. On the slaughter line, skin damage was separately scored per carcass part (shoulder, middle, and ham). The incidence of skin damage was most prevalent in the shoulder region of the pig carcass. Sex, wind velocity, regrouping, transport combination, transport compartment, lairage time, and ham angle affected the skin damage incidence. In conclusion, the incidence of skin damage is influenced by many factors and is an indicator of the level of welfare exercised during transport and slaughterhouse conditions.
   Abstract Transport and associated handling can have adverse effects on pig welfare. The transport of fattening pigs can cause economic losses by virtue of mortality, skin damage, and the general deterioration of meat quality. A total of 4507 fattening pigs were transported from a farm to a commercial slaughterhouse (distance 110 km) in 128 transports. Skin damage was visually assessed in the slaughter line in different parts of the carcass, i.e., shoulder, middle, and ham, using a 4-point scale. The incidence of skin damage was most prevalent (31%) in the shoulder region of the pig carcass. Sex, wind velocity, regrouping, transport combination, transport compartment, lairage time, and ham angle affected the skin damage incidence. In conclusion, scoring the incidence of skin damage is an indicator of the level of welfare exercised during transport and the slaughterhouse conditions. Furthermore, skin damage monitoring can be used to determine critical control points in the transport procedure. Given the importance from both a commercial and welfare perspective, it should be a powerful incentive to handle fattening pigs with care during the transport process and the lairage period.

AB  - Desiccant air conditioning systems are considered as better alternatives to the conventional air conditioning system because Of the independent control of temperature and humidity and being environment friendly. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed to predict the performance of a rotary desiccant dehumidifier for different process air inlet conditions. Dry bulb temperature, humidity ratio and flow rate of the process as well as regeneration air streams of dehumidifier and regeneration temperatures are used as inputs to the model. The outputs of the model are outlet dry bulb temperature and humidity ratio of process as well as regeneration air streams of dehumidifier, the moisture removal rate and the effectiveness of the dehumidifier. Moisture removal rate and effectiveness of the dehumidifier are considered as the performance indicators of the system. Experiments are also conducted to investigate the performance of the desiccant wheel and the test results are used as target data to train the ANN model. Performance predictions through ANN are compared with the experimental test results and a close agreement is observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The problem of adaptive, prepathological and pathological reactions of the body to the action of exogenous chemicals is closely intersected with the assessment of the norm and its fluctuations. The imbalance of chemical elements in the human body directly affects the functioning of almost all organs and systems, causing significant stress of adaptation mechanisms. In this article we study the elemental state of the human body depending on the physiological state (endocrine pathology and professional contact with heavy metals), analyze the correlation between macro- and microelements and assess the degree of adaptability of the body. In the work the elemental state of the human body, taking into account not only the absolute values of the concentrations of elements in the hair and whole blood was studied, the adaptability of the body according to the indicators of elemental imbalance in the blood and hair of volunteers, individuals with endocrine pathology (autoimmune thyroiditis and type II diabetes mellitus) and for those working in conditions of contact with heavy metals (for jewelers, welders and batterymen) is analyzed. The results of the study indicate that various non-specific adaptation reactions are accompanied by changes in the elemental state of a person. Under the prevailing pathology of the endocrine system (diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroiditis), the adaptation of the body was determined as a stage of tension and is associated with the duration of the disease. In persons exposed to professional contact with heavy metals (Mn, Cr, Pb, Ag), adaptation depended on the nature and duration of professional contact with them: the highest tension of adaptation processes was found in jewelers, and the least in welders and batterymen, which is associated with the duration of professional contact with these metals. The high number of connections between the elements indicates the tension of adaptive reactions in people with endocrine pathology and especially in jewelry workers. Adaptation to the high content of metals in the air of welders and batteries due to the longer experience of these workers and adaptation to production conditions with a decrease in the number of correlations between the elements, as a means of reliable operation.

AB  - The bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gut symbionts that can be used as a model to understand the host-microbiota cross talk under unpredictable environmental conditions, such as wildlife ecosystems. The aim of this study was to determine whether viable LAB can be informative of the health status of wild boar populations. We monitored the genotype and phenotype of LAB based on markers that included safety and phylogenetic origin, antibacterial activity, and immunomodulatory properties. A LAB profile dominated by lactobacilli appears to stimulate protective immune responses and relates to strains widely used as probiotics, resulting in a potentially healthy wildlife population, whereas microbiota overpopulated by enterococci was observed in a hostile environment. These enterococci were closely related to pathogenic strains that have developed mechanisms to evade innate immune systems, posing a potential risk for host health. Furthermore, our LAB isolates displayed antibacterial properties in a species-dependent manner. Nearly all of them were able to inhibit bacterial pathogens, raising the possibility of using them as an a la carte antibiotic alternative in the unexplored field of wildlife disease mitigation. Our study highlights that microbiological characterization of LAB is a useful indicator of wildlife health status and the ecological origin from which they derive.
   IMPORTANCE The wildlife symbiotic microbiota is an important component for the greater diversity and functionality of their bacterial populations, influencing host health and adaptability to its ecosystem. Although many microbes are partly responsible for the development of multiple physiological processes, only certain bacterial groups, such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB), have the capacity to overpopulate the gut, promoting health (or disease) when specific genetic and environmental conditions are present. LAB have been exploited in many ways due to their probiotic properties, particularly lactobacilli; however, their relationship with wildlife gut-associated microbiota hosts remains to be elucidated. On the other hand, it is unclear whether LAB such as enterococci, which have been associated with detrimental health effects, could lead to disease. These important questions have not been properly considered in the field of wildlife and, therefore, should be clearly addressed.

AB  - Loss of knowledge about historical environmental conditions and species' abundances threatens how new generations potentially perceive their environment and take action. The intergenerational shift in perceptions of environmental thresholds is a phenomenon frequently termed shifting baseline syndrome (SBS). The goals of this study were (1) to determine relationships between ordinal scores (e.g., few, many) and quantitative measures (e.g., estimates of population size) used by members of a Maori community in New Zealand to score indicators for understanding the abundance of forest resources, and (2) to then analyze these relationships according to people's age to detect the effects of SBS and the rate that this shift was occurring for each indicator. We detected consistent relationships between the ordinal scores and quantitative measures for six forest indicators provided by community members. However, there was only a high degree of confidence about the direction of the age effect for three abundance indicators (Kereru [New Zealand Pigeon], Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae, 15% increase [CI = 5.1-27.1%] in flock size for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; long-finned eel, Anguilla dieffenbachia, 30% decrease [CI = -45.1% to -11.3%] in the distance (m) walked along a riverbank between observations of an eel for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; and Australian brush-tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, 27% decrease [CI = -38.9% to -13.9%] in the distance (m) walked through forest between observations of possum sign for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age), but the effect was statistically strong for all three. The decoupling of indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) from their traditional lands and biodiversity by an array of political, environmental, social and economic drivers and feedback mechanisms have contributed to and exacerbated the conditions for SBS. However, the protection of customary practices to engage with the environment, including the harvest of natural resources, community-based environmental monitoring initiatives, and cultural immersion education programs offer opportunities for IPLC to mitigate the often deleterious effects of SBS.

TI  - Models of joint distribution of species with benthic communities from the small rivers of the Volga basin as a case study
T2  - ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII

KW  - ORDINATION
AB  - Considered are the theoretical and practical aspects of building joint species distribution models, which are a modern tool for the analysis of ecological communities. It is shown that in the case when observational data are quantitative indicators of population density (in particular, the number of species in hydrobiological studies), it is inappropriate to use the MaxEnt method and others based on the concept of "pseudo-absence" points. Contemporary multidimensional models of the joint distribution of communities should include a set of parameters that assess the impact of the following groups of fixed and random factors on the species occurrence: (a) covariates and categorical variables describing environmental conditions and characteristics of biotopes, (b) main indicators characterizing each species, and phylogenetic structure of communities, (c) functions of spatial autocorrelation of data at observation points, (d) residual (i.e., not caused by external factors) associativity of species. The analysis of published data and the practical examples of implementation showed that the mentioned requirements, in general, are satisfied by the methodological platform and Rpackage HMSC (Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities), on the basis of which multidimensional hierarchical generalized linear models with mixed parameters, estimated by Bayesian procedure, are constructed. The main concepts and blocks of the HMSC platform are described and the results of models construction based on the authors' data long-term hydrobiological studies of benthic communities in 132 small and medium-sized rivers in the Middle and Lower Volga basin are discussed. The parameters of a set of one-dimensional candidate models for the abundance distribution of the subfamily Prodiamesinae (Diptera, Chironomidae) are analyzed and a forecast map of its range within the region is built. To illustrate the multidimensional case, a model of the joint spatial distribution of 31 species of chironomids is constructed and its coefficients are analyzed. A residual correlation graph of statistically significant interspecies interactions has been built. The conclusion is made that the HMSC method and software package can be effectively used to solve fundamental problems of communities ecology: how the areas of individual populations, the structure of their communities and the nature of interspecific interactions depend on environmental conditions, as well as to predict future trends of these processes in response to global changes.

AB  - Fast growing tree species such as Populus spp. in short rotation woody crop (SRWC) systems could be an environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach to ensure sustainable biomass production and mitigate the negative impacts on the environment caused by more intensive management aimed to promote additional biomass increment. Knowledge on variation of major biologically important elements' and toxic heavy metals' occurrence in fertilised hybrid aspen tree rings in marginal land may have important and relevant implications for the management practice and evaluation of element fluxes in SRWC ecosystems. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine the relative amount of major elements (K, Ca, Mg, P) and heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb) in stem wood plane on straight line trajectory starting from pith to bark with measurement step 0.1 mm. While inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine average content of the mentioned elements in mechanically separated tree rings to quantify data obtained using LA-ICP-MS method and expressed in relative units. Stem disc samples were collected from six year old hybrid aspen trees growing in marginal agricultural land in the central part of Latvia (hemi-boreal climate conditions) that were initially fertilised with biogas production residues, sewage sludge, and wood ash. We concluded that the content of analysed major elements and heavy metals in the hybrid aspen tree rings varied considerably not only within the analysed stem plane (across tree rings) of one sample tree, but also within one annual ring with significant differences between the content of major elements in earlywood and latewood. Nevertheless, the results of the content of major elements and heavy metals in hybrid aspen tree rings highlighted the significant impact of the initially used fertiliser (especially wood ash) on the average content of elements. Hybrid aspens can be considered bioindicators of both the management activities and general growing conditions even if soil pH is close to neutrality, suggesting a limited mobility of the heavy metals.

AB  - As the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization, there are many issues in the land space planning, and the utilization pattern is unreasonable. The conflicts' phenomenon of land utilization economic benefits and ecological benefits is also becoming more serious. In order to clarify the land utilization pattern of Hebei Province and provide direction for land utilization planning, this paper divides the land utilization function of Hebei Province into three top functions and six sub-functions, and three top functions are production function, life function and ecological function. In this paper, 21 evaluation indicators are selected, and the weights of indicators are determined by analytic hierarchy process. The evaluation system of land utilization multi-function indicators in Hebei Province is constructed. The municipal administrative area utilized as the evaluation unit to evaluate and analyze the land utilization multi-function in Hebei Province. The study concludes that the land utilization pattern in Hebei Province mainly influenced by natural resource conditions and political culture. As the provincial capital of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang is the region with the highest utilization level of life production and the most multifunctional utilization of land in Hebei Province. The completeness and centrality of politics led to this result. The versatility of land utilization in Hebei Province is highest in the northern part of Hebei Province, and the degree of versatility in the central and southern parts of Hebei Province is relatively low. The level of life function has related to the level of production function. The level of ecological function has closely related to the regional topographic climate factors. The land multi-functional utilization has affected by the regional development level and the rationalization of land utilization. Therefore, in the land utilization pattern planning, we should focus on its natural resource endowment and its economic and social conditions, pay attention to the healthy utilization of its ecological resources and environment by promoting economic development, and promote the multi-functional utilization of land to maximize benefits and sustainable utilization. Based on appropriate resource environmental protection and national land planning, scientific and orderly layout of ecological, agricultural, urban and other functional spaces, environmental protection, and space for sustainable development.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people - yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. SFM addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing SFM at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world's forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the SFM tools investigated in FRA 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains - only 6% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014.

AB  - We synthesized available information from ecological models at local and regional scales to obtain a global picture of the trophic position and ecological role of squids in marine ecosystems. First, static food-web models were used to analyze basic ecological parameters and indicators of squids: biomass, production, consumption, trophic level, omnivory index, predation mortality diet, and the ecological role. In addition, we developed various dynamic temporal simulations using two food-web models that included squids in their parameterization, and we investigated potential impacts of fishing pressure and environmental conditions for squid populations and, consequently, for marine food webs. Our results showed that squids occupy a large range of trophic levels in marine food webs and show a large trophic width, reflecting the versatility in their feeding behaviors and dietary habits. Models illustrated that squids are abundant organisms in marine ecosystems, and have high growth and consumption rates, but these parameters are highly variable because squids are adapted to a large variety of environmental conditions. Results also show that squids can have a large trophic impact on other elements of the food web, and top-down control from squids to their prey can be high. In addition, some squid species are important prey of apical predators and may be keystone species in marine food webs. In fact, we found strong interrelationships between neritic squids and the populations of their prey and predators in coastal and shelf areas, while the role of squids in open ocean and upwelling ecosystems appeared more constrained to a bottom-up impact on their predators. Therefore, large removals of squids will likely have large-scale effects on marine ecosystems. In addition, simulations confirm that squids are able to benefit from a general increase in fishing pressure, mainly due to predation release, and quickly respond to changes triggered by the environment. Squids may thus be very sensitive to the effects of fishing and climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Alps and their surroundings is a heterogeneous region, where different spatial conditions require appropriate research approaches as well as political and planning strategies. Researchers and decision makers are dependent principally on information relating to environmental and spatial characteristics in their area of interest. Up until now and following the call of Agenda 21, a significant amount of information has already been compiled in a variety of sustainability-indicator systems that also contain information on spatial conditions. The aim of the presented study was to develop a regional typology of the European Alps and their surroundings, on the basis of spatial-pattern indicators.
   In a first step, a set of 25 spatial-pattern indicators on topography, landscape composition, landscape pattern, and road accessibility were calculated for the 17,504 municipalities in the Alpine-Space cooperation area. The indicator results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) using Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. The PCA resulted in five components that explain 71.0% of the total variance. A PCA validation using a sub-sampling approach revealed that the PCA was valid. The PCA results were subsequently employed in a hierarchical clustering-approach using the Ward algorithm with squared Euclidean distance. The number of clusters was chosen by means of the dendrogram, according to the elbow criteria, and by reasons of interpretability.
   The hierarchical clustering resulted in 6 clusters. Cluster 1 represents "Non-mountainous cultural landscapes", cluster 2 "Poorly structured agricultural landscapes", cluster 3 "Agricultural landscapes, interspersed with highly structured semi-natural and natural areas", cluster 4 "Remote, highly structured cultural landscapes with a high level of insolation", cluster 5 "Mountainous, forested areas", and cluster 6 "Mountainous, semi-natural and natural open areas".
   Although the presented typology and its underlying analyses have some limitations, they can be applied for various purposes. The spatial-pattern indicators provide individual information for more than 17,000 municipalities in the Alpine Space. Supra-regional relationships of spatial-pattern types are offered by the five extracted components and the six clusters. The results can support researchers and stakeholders from the local to international level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As part of integrated biological-effect monitoring, the parasite fauna of the flounder Platichthys flesus (L.) was investigated at five locations in the German Bight, with a view to using parasite species as bio-indicators. Over a period of 6 years, parasites from 30 different taxa were identified, but only 7 taxa of the parasite community occurred regularly at all locations and in sufficient abundance that they could be considered as potential indicator species. These species were the ciliophoran Trichodina spp., the copepods Acanthochondria cornuta, Lepeophtheirus pectoralis and Lernaeocera branchialis, the helminths Zoogonoides viviparus and Cucullanus heterochrous and metacercaria of an unidentified digenean species. Infection characteristics of these parasites are presented, with a comparison of the results from individual sampling periods and those of the long-term data set. Natural influences on the infection levels, such as temporal variations, habitat conditions and host-related factors, were evaluated. All of these parasite species showed significant differences in their infection levels between the Elbe estuary, as the most polluted site, and the less polluted coastal and marine locations: Helgoland, Outer Eider estuary and Spiekeroog, especially in the long-term data set. Gradual differences between the Elbe, the Outer Eider and Helgoland, which were not detected in individual sampling periods, also became evident in the pooled-data set. These were found in the prevalence of Trichodina spp., A. cornuta, Z viviparus and C. heterochrous. Although salinity is considered as the most important natural factor, influencing the distribution pattern of the majority of the potential indicator species, infection levels of most of these species differed between locations with similar salinity conditions. Infection levels corresponded to a contamination gradient (Elbe > Inner Eider, Outer Eider > Helgoland) established across the locations. Seasonal variation in the infection parameters affected the spatial distribution of the copepod species Lepeophtheirus pectoralis and Lernaeocera branchialis. Annual variations are considered to occur in the range of natural variability, so no trend of increasing or decreasing infection levels of the parasites was found during the course of the study. This study underlined the idea that an analysis of fish-parasite fauna is very useful in ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - Stimulus to reach the millennium goals of poverty abatement and empowerment, including education and employment, for the large part of the population in the coastal zone can be found in the resources and services of oceans and coasts: the required financial means, given political will and right priorities, can be provided through implementation of the related international conventions, in particular UNCLOS with the EEZ, the Common Heritage of Mankind and other provisions, Agenda 21 [1] of UNCED and the WSSD 2002 Ocean Targets: the motivation is the necessity to address over-exploitation, depletion and destruction of resources, habitats and coastal ecosystem services, global changes, as well as economic transformations and social conditions of poverty, employment and unequity. Achieving adequate management and protection of natural assets as ecosystems and their services, habitats, biodiversity requires that the socio-economic and human security needs of the coastal populations are met. One way to reach the goal is to enable them, representing about 50% of the global population and increasing, to fight poverty and cope with uncertainties and changing conditions of employment, environment and sustainability through proper governance of the coastal and ocean assets. This includes provision of education and knowledge as regards these assets and their proper uses. They include energy, water, food, transportation and trade, communication, coastal developments, tourism, recreation and ecosystem services, as well as the need to properly manage them.
   The present economic system cannot fully harmonize with the required governance, partly since the ecosystem resources and services are not internalised in the market-oriented system. This calls for a revised education and training system, more comprehensive than the present, taking into account the social, cultural and environmental requirements, and stressing the sustainable development paradigm. In order to achieve ocean governance and comprehensive human security an understanding of the system is needed. This is substantiated through the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development as well as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
   The aim here is to discuss some of the issues in context of implementation of related ocean conventions and commitments, which include achieving ocean governance, and to elucidate opportunities given by oceans and coasts, also in generating employment and providing for basic human needs.

AB  - Net primary production (NPP) is an indicator of rangeland ecosystem function. This research assessed the potential of the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model for estimating NPP and its spatial and temporal changes in semi-arid rangelands of Semirom County, Iran. Using CASA model, we estimated the NPP values based on monthly climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from the MODIS sensor. Regression analysis was then applied to compare the estimated production data with observed production data. The spatial and temporal changes in NPP and light utilization efficiency (LUE) were investigated in different rangeland vegetation types. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) was also calculated at different time scales and the correlation of SPI with NPP changes was determined. The results indicated that the estimated NPP values varied from 0.00 to 74.48 g C/(m2 center dot a). The observed and estimated NPP values had different correlations, depending on rangeland conditions and vegetation types. The highest and lowest correlations were respectively observed in Astragalus spp.-Agropyron spp. rangeland (R-2=0.75) with good condition and Gundelia spp.-Cousinia spp. rangeland (R-2=0.36) with poor and very poor conditions. The maximum and minimum LUE values were found in Astragalus spp.-Agropyron spp. rangeland (0.117 g C/MJ) with good condition and annual grasses-annual forbs rangeland (0.010 g C/MJ), respectively. According to the correlations between SPI and NPP changes, the effects of drought periods on NPP depended on vegetation types and rangeland conditions. Annual plants had the highest drought sensitivity while shrubs exhibited the lowest drought sensitivity. The positive effects of wet periods on NPP were less evident in degraded areas where the destructive effects of drought were more prominent. Therefore, determining vegetation types and rangeland conditions is essential in NPP estimation. The findings of this study confirmed the potential of the CASA for estimating rangeland production. Therefore, the model output maps can be used to evaluate, monitor and optimize rangeland management in semi-arid rangelands of Iran where MODIS NPP products are not available.

AB  - The river basin of Siversky Donets is of great scientific interest since this river runs through a territory with heavy industry (in particular, coal mining, chemical processing and metal industries). Within the basin, rivers of different sizes were explored (small, medium, large and extra-large) that flow through siliceous and calcareous rocks on the same elevation (lowland-below 200 m a.s.l.). Phytoplankton, as one of the Biological Quality Element, was used to perform the assessment of ecological status of the water bodies within the Siversky Donets river basin in 2019. The state monitoring program based on the updated approaches has been implemented in the river basin for the first time. The composition of phytoplankton species in the basin comprised 167 species (168 intraspecies taxa), mainly Bacillariophyta (63%) and Chlorophyta (22%) with the presence of other species (Cyanobacteria, Charophyta, Chrysophyta, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta). High species diversity and divisions amount are a distinctive property of the smaller rivers, while the bigger rivers show lower number of divisions. The "bloom" events, which are important ecological factors, were not detected in the Siversky Donets river basin. Algal species composition in plankton samples of the basin was identified and series of ecological parameters, such as habitat preferences, temperature, pH, salinity, oxygenation and organic water pollution according to Watanabe and Slade
   c
   ek's index of saprobity (S) trophic state and nitrogen uptake metabolism were analyzed. The ecological conclusions were also verified by a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The significance of the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) results was estimated of by a Monte-Carlo permutation test. The high concentrations of inorganic phosphorus compounds (permanganate index (CODMn)) and nitrite ions favored the diversity of Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria diversity correlated with the levels of bicarbonate and CODMn. High diversity of diatoms was facilitated by the total amount of dissolved solids and chemical oxygen demand (COD). It was found that low water quality could be associated with conditions leading to predominant growth of the mentioned groups of algae. According to the analysis, the highest water quality was characterized by balanced phytoplankton composition and optimal values of the environmental variables. The sites with reference conditions are proposed for future monitoring.

AB  - Restoration of degraded ecosystems may take decades or even centuries. Accordingly, information about the current direction and speed of recovery provided by methods for predicting time to recovery may give important feedback to restoration schemes. While predictions of time to recovery have so far been based mostly upon change in species richness and other univariate predictors, the novel ordination-regression based approach (ORBA) affords a multivariate approach based upon species compositional change. We used species composition data from four alpine spoil heaps in western Norway, recorded at three time points, to predict time to recovery using ORBA. This approach uses distances between restored plots and reference plots along a successional gradient, represented by a vector in ordination space, to model linear or asymptotic relationships of compositional change as a function of time. Results from ORBA were compared with results from models of more generic univariate attributes, that is total cover, species richness and properties of the physical environment as functions of time. ORBA predictions of time to species compositional recovery varied from less than 60 years with linear models to 115-212 years with asymptotic models. The long estimated time to recovery suggests that the restoration schemes adopted for these spoil heaps are likely to be suboptimal. Much shorter time to recovery was predicted from some of the more generic univariate attributes, that is species richness and total cover, than from species composition. Given the current rates of recovery, most spoil heaps will reach reference levels for total cover and species richness within 50 years, whereas predictions indicate that 67-111 years are needed to restore levels of soil organic matter and pH. Synthesis and applications. Species composition and soil conditions provide information of generally higher relevance for evaluation of ecosystem recovery processes than the most commonly used metric to assess restoration success, species richness. Species richness is decoupled from species compositional recovery, and likely to be a generally poor measure of restoration success. We therefore encourage further improvement of methods like the ordination-regression based approach that use species compositional data to predict time to recovery.

AB  - Drought events occurring under warmer temperatures (i.e. "hotter droughts") have resulted in widespread tree mortality across the globe, and may result in biome-level vegetation shifts to alternate vegetation types if there is a failure of trees to regenerate. We investigated how overstorey trees, understorey vegetation, and local climatic and edaphic conditions interact to influence tree regeneration, a key prerequisite for resilience, in a region that has experienced severe overstorey tree mortality due to hotter droughts and beetle infestations.
   We used detailed field observations from 142 sites that spanned a broad range of environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of climate and recent tree mortality on tree regeneration dynamics in the spatially extensive pinon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma, Juniperus monosperma) woodland vegetation type of the southwestern USA. We used a structural equation modelling framework to identify how tree mortality and local climatic and edaphic conditions affect pinon and juniper regeneration and electivity analyses to quantify the species-specific associations of tree juveniles with overstorey trees and understorey shrubs.
   Pinon regeneration appears to be strongly dependent upon advanced regeneration, (i.e. the survival of juvenile trees that established prior to the mortality event), the survival of adult seed-bearing trees (inferred from basal area of surviving trees) and the facilitative effects of overstorey trees for providing favourable microsites for seedling establishment. Model results suggest that local edaphoclimatic conditions directly affected pinon and juniper regeneration, such that stands with hotter, drier local climatic conditions and lower soil available water capacity had limited tree regeneration following large-scale dieback.
   Synthesis. We identify four indicators of resilience to hotter drought conditions: (1) abundant advance regeneration of tree seedlings; (2) sufficient canopy cover for survival of emergent seedlings and existing regeneration; (3) sufficient seed source from surviving trees with high reproductive output; (4) areas with cooler and wetter local climates and greater soil available water capacity. In the absence of these conditions, there is greater likelihood of woodlands transitioning to more xeric vegetation types following dieback.

AB  - The Ebinur Lake watershed is an important ecological barrier for environmental changes in the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR). Due to the tremendous changes in the underlying surface environment of the watershed in the past few decades, the watershed has become a typical region of ecological degradation. Drought affects the surface dynamics and characterizes the regional dry and wet environments, while the dynamic variation in lakes and vegetation are indicators of dynamic changes in land surfaces. Thus, a quantitative assessment of the response of lakes and vegetation to drought conditions at multiple temporal scales is critical for assessing the potential impacts of regional climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and ecological restoration. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the spectral water index (NDWI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to analyse the evolution of drought, the variation in lake surface area and the sustainable variation in vegetation. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluated the response patterns of vegetation to droughts of multiple temporal scales (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-month). The conclusions showed that (1) overall, the area of Ebinur Lake experienced drastic fluctuations, and the lake area has decreased significantly since 2003, with a dynamic area of 817.63 km(2) in 2003 and 384.60 km(2) in 2015, and the lake area had shrank severely. (2) The interannual variation of wet and dry changed alternately during the observation period, and persistent drought events occurred from 2006 to 2010 across the Ebinur Lake watershed. (3) The vegetation area of cultivated land expanded continuously across the watershed, and the grassland degraded severely. (4) The changes in lake surface area are significantly correlated with the inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.64, P < 0.01). (5) The vegetation of different terrestrial ecosystems exhibited heterogeneous responses to multiple temporal scales of drought in different seasons. The percentage was 72.78% of the total area, which showed a correlation between vegetation and drought conditions during the growing season period, and there were more impacts of drought on vegetation, with values as high as 64.33% of the area in summer, than those in other seasons.

AB  - A fundamental ecological trait of marine organisms is body size. Various theoretical models have used the size distribution of plankton communities to explain their trophic structure and functioning. Recent studies indicate that changes associated with global warming, eutrophication, and fisheries might have dramatically shifted the size structure of marine organisms and thus changed ecosystem functioning. Accordingly, size structure has been suggested as a useful indicator for monitoring ecosystem status. Here, we used three size metrics to represent mesozooplankton size structure: the slope of normalized biomass spectra (NB-SS), NB-SS linear fit, and size diversity. We analyzed the relationship between zooplankton size structure and environmental conditions in the very dynamic East China Sea (ECS). We tested four hypotheses predicted by theoretical studies: (1) a coastal-offshore gradient for NB-SS, (2) a negative relationship between temperature and NB-SS steepness, (3) a positive relationship between trophic status (i.e., chlorophyll a and inorganic-nutrient concentrations as a proxy) and NB-SS steepness, and (4) a positive relationship between oligotrophy and NB-SS linearity. Hypotheses 1-3 did not stand up to our analyses of the empirical data, while hypothesis 4 was supported. In the ECS, we found no clear spatial gradient for each of the three size metrics, where (i) size diversity was not correlated to temperature and significantly decreased with chl a and phosphate concentrations, (ii) the NB-SS slope showed no relationship with the environment, and (iii) NB-SS linearity tended to be higher in more oligotrophic offshore waters. Trophic status exerted a stronger effect than temperature on size distribution, but its effect was opposite to model prediction. Our results suggest that population dynamics (i.e., pulses of reproduction due to increased food availability) override metabolic scaling effects on mesozooplankton NB-SS at the mesoscale. In addition, the estimation of NB-SS slopes depends on NB-SS linearity and may therefore be less accurate than size diversity as a synthetic indicator of NB-SS changes. Our results highlight the need for caution when using size-based indicators for monitoring environmental forcing on communities in highly dynamic ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Canopy temperature (CT) is often related to potential yield and is a possible yield indicator in breeding programs. However, it is difficult to evaluate genetic variations of CT accurately in large-scale investigations, such as breeding programs, because CT is strongly affected by environmental conditions. In this study, to precisely evaluate these genetic variations, we determined the environmental factors that affect CT measurement and proposed a convenient normalization method to minimize their influence. We measured the CT of CT-high or CT-low cultivars in the field under various conditions. We found that as the sun and shade levels were alternated, the CT changed within seconds; the position in the field also critically affected the CT. However, even under these conditions, the differences between cultivars became clearer if CT was normalized by neighboring lines. Additionally, we revealed that CT measurements between 12:00 and 15:00 maximized the difference between cultivars. Using our normalization technique under the favorable conditions specified can help breeders select high-yield lines using CT in breeding programs.

AB  - This study is focused on the mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic characterization of pyrites from the rocks of the Bazhenov Formation (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous organic-rich shales, Western Siberia, Russia). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed pyrites of different morphologies: small and large framboids, small crystals, and large euhedral crystals; all morphotypes were usually combined into aggregates. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed that small framboids and microcrystalline pyrite are isotopically light, with delta(SCDT)-S-34 varying from -55 to -20 parts per thousand. Large framboids and euhedral crystals of pyrite are isotopically heavy with delta(SCDT)-S-34 up to +26 parts per thousand. Both morphology and delta S-34 were suggested to be controlled by the redox conditions and sedimentation regime. The abundance of small framboids suggests that pyrite sedimentation occurred under anoxic conditions; the presence of the large framboids and euhedral crystals of pyrite suggest the accumulation of sediments occurred at suboxic conditions, possibly in the presence of oxygen.

AB  - Environmental monitoring in the scope of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) is usually expensive and requires considerable human effort. In this study, we analyzed data obtained by a WFD coastal waters monitoring network over a three-year period (35 campaigns), with the aim to ascertain is it possible to increase the monitoring efficiency and obtain more accurate results. As the trophic condition of the coastal waters of Valencia is primarily, but not entirely, determined by continental loads and hydrodynamic conditions, additionally we analyzed related river basin pluviometry (daily frequency) and oceanographic (one hour frequency) data. Chlorophyll a, salinity, rain and wave data time series were analyzed separately, to identify any possible pattern. Analyzing coastal water bodies integrating all four parameters, it is found strong interactions between coastal waters trophic conditions, sea hydrodynamics and related basin pluviometry. Eight phytoplankton biomass scenarios associated to environmental conditions are identified and finally developed basis for a new efficient monitoring strategy and more accurate coastal waters assessment.

AB  - Summer heat can result in stressful conditions for Bos taurus feeder cattle, and in extreme instances these conditions can be fatal. The feedlot operator has management options available to him if he is aware of current and impending heat-stress events. Many livestock production facilities exist in environments that may differ significantly from the conditions at the closest weather station. There is a need to provide producers with heat stress information from an on-site real-time weather monitoring system. A monitoring device, referred to as a Livestock Safety Monitor (LSM), was designed around a commercial weather station (Vantage PRO by Davis Instruments, Hayward, Calif.) that was coupled to a microcomputer (TFX-11, by Onset Computer, Pocasset, Mass.). The weather station collects current weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. The weather information is transferred to the micro-computer where the weather data is used to generate a physiologically-based stress factor. The estimated values alert the operator of current conditions that include: (1) normal, (2) alert, (3) danger, and (4) emergency categories. This article will summarize development and operating experience using the LSM.

AB  - Background Health and growth of pigs are affected by the hygiene of housing. Lower growth performance observed in poor hygiene of housing conditions is explained by reduced feed intake and metabolic changes caused by the activation of body defences. In a previous experiment, we reported contrasted average values of body weight gain, concentrations of circulating metabolites, redox and immune indicators in blood of pigs housed in good or poor hygiene conditions during the growing period. This study addressed inter-individual variability in these responses to determine whether a particular blood profile explains average daily gain (ADG) of the pig. Results The data originated from 160 growing pigs, half of which subjected to a hygiene challenge for 6 weeks (W0 to W6) and the others housed in good hygiene conditions. Pigs originated from two lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI). Individual body weights were recorded during this period, and relative ADG (rADG(W0-W6)) was calculated as the ADG corrected by the initial body weight measured at W0. Blood samples were taken before (W0) and 3 weeks (W3) after the beginning of the challenge. The analysed dataset consisted of 51 metabolites and indicators of immune and inflammatory responses measured on 136 pigs having no missing value for any variables, when calculated as the differences W3 minus W0 in circulating concentrations. An algorithm tested all possible linear regression models and then selected the best ones to explain rADG(W0-W6). Six variables were identified across the best models and correlated with rADG(W0-W6) with a goodness of fit (adjusted R-2) of about 67%. They were changes in haptoglobin, global antioxidant capacity of plasma (Biological Antioxidant Power or BAP), free fatty acids, and 3 amino acids: leucine, tryptophan, and 1-methylhistidine. The effects of housing conditions and RFI lines were comprised in the variables of the selected models and none of these conditions improved accuracy of the predictive models, leading to genericity of the pinpointed metabolic changes in relation to variability of ADG. Conclusions This approach allows us to identify blood variables, whose changes in blood concentrations correlated to ADG under contrasted sanitary conditions.

AB  - Exotic invasive plant species (EIPS) may succeed in part because they release allelochemicals that are novel to native plants (Novel Weapons Hypothesis). Plant allelopathic effects may increase under abiotic and biotic stresses based on The Stress Hypothesis of Allelopathy (TSHA). Lonicera maackii is an aggressive EIPS in the Midwestern USA, able to affect native flora by means of allelopathy. We aimed to test the role of intraspecific competition, as biotic stress, and expected future climate conditions (i.e. intense floods in spring; hotter and drier conditions in summer), as abiotic stress, on the performance and allelopathic potential of L. maackii. We grew L. maackii plants, collected from the field (field plants) or germinated from seeds in a greenhouse (seedlings), with or without intraspecific competition and under simulated present and expected future (1) spring (intense flooding vs no flooding) and (2) summer conditions. We subsequently measured plant performance variables, such as F-v/F-m (an indicator of plant stress), plant biomass, and concentration of pigments, carbon and nitrogen; and allelopathic potential (i.e. the effect of L. maackii leaf extracts and conditioned substrates on the germination of two herb species). In accordance with TSHA, intense flooding stressed L. maackii (F-v/F-m < 0.7), reduced its biomass, and increased its allelopathic potential. In summer, L. maackii plants were more stressed (lower average F-v/F-m) under future summer conditions and intraspecific competition than under present conditions without competitors, but they had similar allelopathic potential. This suggests the presence of a stress threshold from which allelopathic potential does not increase further. Intraspecific competition more negatively affected the performance of seedlings (e.g. plant mass reduction) than field plants, but only increased the allelopathic potential of the latter. Our results indicated that the negative effects of intense flooding on L. maackii performance could be counteracted by the benefit gained in plant-plant competition by means of increased allelopathic potential. The complex role of abiotic and biotic conditions on L. maackii performance and allelopathy are also discussed.

AB  - Artificial reefs (ARs) have long been practiced to manage and enhance fisheries resources worldwide. Here, we aimed to identify relevant indicator species for the specific environmental conditions of ARs by comparing fish diversity against control sites (Conts). We used a combination of non-metric multidimensional scaling and indicator value analysis to identify the indicator species of the specific AR environments. More individuals and species of fish were present in ARs compared to Conts. Water temperature over the seasons was the most important environmental factor associated with the trophic group composition of fish. In particular, macrocamivores and benthic invertivores/cleaners closely reflected habitat conditions in a consistent manner. Some dominant fish species were detected at all sites, while the indicator species were more predominant under certain environmental conditions. Altogether, ARs should be monitored at regular intervals to optimize management of their health by detecting the community representativeness via indicator species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Cretaceous climatic reconstruction from Argentina based on palynological data
T2  - BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO
LA  - English
AB  - Paleoclimatic reconstructions have used different proxies as climate indicators. In this context, palynomorphs play a crucial role for making inferences about past climate changes because of their presence and distribution during the geologic history in almost all types of environments. Argentina has a wide latitudinal range in South America, with diverse cretaceous units yielding palynomorphs that represent different climatic conditions. The Cretaceous was a time when climate conditions showed some special variations. Different theories about the climate conditions at this time were postulated. The main aim of this contribution is to understand climate trends during the Cretaceous, based on the quantitative analysis of selected pollen and spores, considered as climate indicators, from different geological units in Argentina. The evaluation of the palynofloras has been undertaken mainly by reviewing published sources from cretaceous basins but also with our own unpublished data. The climatic trend during the Cretaceous showed that the Early Cretaceous is marked by aridity episodes with high values of Classopollis and Gnetales. In contrast, the Late Cretaceous showed warmer and more humid conditions indicated by increasing values of free-sporing plants (especially Bryophytes and ferns) and palm pollen grains, and the decrease until their absence of the aridity indicators.

AB  - A high voltage composite insulator showed severe degradation and failure of the silicone elastomer sheds following service in a sub-station environment. Sensitive analytical techniques were used to investigate the extent of degradation of the silicone elastomer (SiE). The polymer content of some surface regions decreased as degradation increased. This was quantified through observation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), weight loss upon heating using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), determination of surface "silica" levels in damaged areas by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman mapping through a cross-section of the elastomer producing a degradation depth profile. It is believed that due to the environmental conditions at the site of installation, the electric field may have reached corona onset threshold on parts of the elastomer surface. Because of the moist conditions the corona was maintained, effectively preventing the elastomer from regaining hydrophobicity and leading in time to severe degradation. This investigation has also identified techniques applicable to the assessment of condition of other, less damaged SiE insulators which may in turn lead to the prediction of the remaining useful lifetime.

AB  - Sled and box-corer samplings were performed at two sites in the Capbreton canyon in order to appreciate the influence of near-bottom environmental conditions on the structure of their macrobenthic communities (crustaceans). Although located at similar depths (ca. 1 000 m), these two sites were characterised by different physicochemical conditions at the sediment-water interface, probably related with the morphology of the submarine valley (reduced environment, oxygen depletion and stagnation of bottom water at site A; normal oceanic conditions on the near-bottom environment of site B). The analysis of the collected fauna revealed a low similarity between the two sites, mainly due to the unusual dominance of three epibenthic species in sled samples from site A: the amphipod Bonnierella abyssorum, the tanaid Apseudes spinosus and the isopod Arcturopsis giardi. Due to their apparent rarity or absence in adjacent non-canyon communities, such epibenthic crustaceans may be considered as 'canyon indicator species' able to exhibit abundant populations within the peculiar confinement area of this canyon.

AB  - Nucleic acid analysis has provided useful tools to study recent growth and mortality of young fishes and their responses to environmental variability. The ratio of RNA-DNA (R/D) has been shown to respond to changes in feeding conditions and growth after periods as short as 1-3 days in a variety of fish species. The earliest studies used primarily UV-based methods, but most investigators now use more sensitive, fluorometric dye-binding assays to estimate RNA and DNA in individual larvae. These newer methods are very sensitive to procedural details and choice of standards. Analytical methods, normalization and calibration procedures to optimize information obtained from nucleic acid analysis are discussed. We present examples illustrating the technique's utility, and problems encountered when applying nucleic acid-based indices to fish larvae and early juveniles. The wide use of R/D analysis in studies of fish early life stages, together with a proliferation of analytical methods, demands a major intercalibration exercise.

AB  - Purpurin (1,2,4-trihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone) is a natural red dye obtained from the red madder plant that is widely used in food and dyeing industries. The present study investigated the characteristics of purpurin and its application as a pH-sensitive probe to detect the pH of solutions and intracellular pH of mammalian and bacterial cells. Purpurin exhibited high pH-sensitive behavior, low analytes interference, high stability with pKa of 4.6 and visible colorimetric change. H-1 NMR and FTIR studies indicated protonation of phenolic hydroxyl group under acidic condition with hypsochromic shift in the absorption and fluorescence spectra relative to that of basic condition. Cell culture studies using HeLa cells revealed that purpurin is well tolerated by the cells and the fluorescent imaging result indicated excellent cell permeability with possible use of the dye to detect the pH fluctuations in living cells under various physiological conditions such as apoptosis. Microbiological studies indicated that the dye could be used for visualization of bacteria under acidic condition.

AB  - The change in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union from product to producer support, including requirements for 'good agricultural and environmental conditions' and 'greening', is excellent. However, these requirements are now defined in rather general terms. Questions can be raised about suitable indicators, and there is a recognized need for effective management recommendations to support farmers in achieving the required 'good' conditions. These recommendations are bound to be quite different for different soils in different countries. A study of Dutch clay soils was based on a storyline describing current problems and management options for improvement, which were quantified using a soil-water-crop simulation model. Indicators were defined for agricultural conditions and suggestions made for the use of the model in a predictive mode to help farmers improve their soil management. Environmental conditions were judged by current environmental guidelines for water and air. When modelling, implicit assumptions that soils are homogeneous were shown to be unrealistic for these clay soils, requiring development of innovative methods and procedures, presenting a challenge for soil research.

AB  - Transport networks are frequently exposed to geohazards, and losses can be observed frequently by notable disaster incidents such as landslides, earthquakes, and floods. Although losses due to natural disasters are frequently reported, limited attention is paid to assess the condition of strategic road networks in the Himalayas. Thus, to fulfill this gap, this study performs condition assessment of Asian Highway AH-48 in Bhutan and develops a system to rate the performance level of road assets. The assessment is conducted along a 157.6 km stretch of AH-48. The sum of findings highlights that about 55% of the road assets along the AH-48 are highly vulnerable to geohazards. Drains are observed to be the most vulnerable, with 52% drains lying below the standard rating among the considered assets followed by retaining walls and pavement. Landslide vulnerability function for highways that are situated in mountain regions is developed using the newly proposed landslide intensity scale. The sum of findings highlights that the Himalayan roads will be affected mostly by landslides and the drainage system is the most affected road asset showing the least serviceability among the common road assets.

AB  - Asset management of healthcare facilities utilizes technical and administrative strategies to extend the asset life cycle. This research aims to develop an asset condition assessment (ACA) model for a healthcare facility to predict and assess critical asset ratings considering various factors, especially patient risk space groups, and asset redundancy. Two modelling techniques were used to develop the ACA model. First, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate the weighting criteria and ranking the factors. Second, the AHP and regression analysis techniques were combined into a single model to evaluate healthcare facilities' asset condition assessment. The integrated model was validated with 88.32% average validity percent (AVP). The model was determined to be robust, and its results satisfactory. Finally, this research developed a numerical asset condition assessment (ACA) critical rating scale, which can guide capital renewals leaders in predicting and managing healthcare facilities' critical infrastructure needs. Ultimately, this tool can be used to improve the asset management of healthcare facilities, which is one of the nation's largest infrastructure sectors.

AB  - Ophrydium versatile (Muller 1786) Ehrenberg 1830 - a symbiotic ciliate that forms gelatinous colonies - is widely distributed in temperate lakes in Europe and America, but has not previously been recorded from rivers. In this paper we report the first record of O. versatile in an African river, based on an identity confirmed by molecular taxonomic identification. The limnological conditions within the Lephalala River during the sampling period were characterised as oligotrophic with low DOC concentrations, similar to the conditions observed in temperate northern hemisphere lakes where these organisms have been recorded previously. The majority of O. versatile colonies occurred in areas where thin orange-coloured films containing high concentrations of iron (>60% Fe) covered the substrate and bedrock of the river; this may be related to the abundant picophytoplankton that were associated with these films and oligotrophic conditions. The planktonic diatom Gomphonema venusta Passy was dominant in the water column throughout the study period and acted as an environmental indicator of low electrical conductivity (EC) conditions in the habitat where O. versatile colonies were recorded.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the butyltin bioaccumulation in a simple food chain under varied conditions. Significant trophic level magnification factors of tributyltin (21.5-1546) were observed in two filter-feeders, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna viridis), in an environment with low tributyltin pollution levels (0.4-13.1 ng L-1 as tin). Both of these bivalve species showed higher bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of tributyltin under low pollution levels, while smaller magnification factors (5.4-6.4), an up-regulated tributyltin metabolism and smaller BAFs of tributyltin were found in oysters at higher tributyltin pollution levels (39.6-99.3 ng L-1 as tin). Unlike oysters, mussels cannot up-regulate their tributyltin metabolism, which caused a dramatic change in butyltin accumulation between oysters and mussels as tributyltin pollution levels increased. In addition, higher BAF values of tributyltin were also obtained under the water summer conditions when higher temperatures and phytoplankton contents, and lower tributyltin pollution levels were observed.

AB  - Predictive microbiology can be used to determine and predict the shelf-life of perishable foods under commercial distribution conditions based on microbial growth kinetics.  This paper presents general microbial growth kinetics with the Monod model and the Gompertz function.  Additional models are given to describe effects of food composition (e.g. a(w)) and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, gas atmosphere) as well as their interaction on the growth kinetic parameters (lag time and specific growth rate).  These models can be used to predict the time to reach a critical level under any constant conditions within the range tested.  A combination of microbial kinetics with an engineering accumulation approach can be used to predict the final microbial level in a food, or the loss of shelf-life, for any known time-temperature sequence, if there is no history effect or the history effect is negligible.  A time-temperature indicator could be used for predicting the remaining shelf-life of perishable foods under any distribution condition based on microbial growth kinetics.

AB  - As a preliminary and major step for land use planning of the coming years, the study of variability of the past decades' climatic conditions with comprehensive indicators is of high importance. Given the fact that one of the affected areas by climatic change includes variability of thermal comfort, this study uses the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) to identify and evaluate bioclimatic conditions of 40 meteorological stations in Iran. In this study, PET changes for the period of 1960 to 2010 are analyzed, with the use of Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Pearson parametric method. The study focuses particularly on the diversity in spatio-temporal distribution of Iran's bioclimatic conditions. The findings show that the mean frequency percentage of days with comfort is 12.9 % according to the total number of selected stations. The maximum and minimum frequency percentage with values of 17.4 and 10.3 belong to Kerman and Chabahar stations, respectively. The findings of long-term trend analysis for the period of 1960-2010 show that 55 % of the stations have significant increasing trend in terms of thermal comfort class based on the Pearson method, while it is 40 % based on Mann-Kendall test. The results indicate that the highest frequency of days with thermal comfort in the southern coasts of Iran relates to the end of autumn and winter, nevertheless, such ideal conditions for the coastal cities of Caspian Sea and even central stations of Iran relate to mid-spring and mid-autumn. Late summer and early autumn along with late spring can be identified as the most ideal times in the west and northwest part of Iran. In addition, the most important inhibiting factors of thermal comfort prove to be different across the regions of Iran. For instance, in the southern coasts, warm to very hot bioclimatic events and in the west and northwest regions, cold to very cold conditions turn out to be the most important inhibiting factors. When considering the variations across the studied period, an increase in the frequency of thermal comfort condition is observed in almost half of the stations. Moreover, based on Pearson and Mann-Kendall methods, the trend of changes in monthly averages of PET has decreased in most stations and months, which can lead to different consequences in each month and station. Thus, it is expected that due to PET changes in recent decades and to the intensified global warming conditions, Iran's bioclimatic conditions change in a way that transfers the days with comfort to early spring and late autumn.

AB  - Sediment condition at an Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar) Culture site in S.E. Tasmania, Australia was evaluated to determine the rate and extent of recovery after removal of farmed fish. By local standards the cage sediment at the start of this Survey was markedly degraded but comparison with results from impact Studies in Scotland, Canada and Norway suggests that the sediments were considerably less impacted than in northern temperate areas. The impact at the cages diminished rapidly with both time and distance; after only 2 months conditions were markedly improved. The macrobenthos indicated a slower recovery than chemical measures, after 36 months the benthic faunal community structure under the cages still differed from reference conditions even though other sediment measures had recovered. This Study highlighted two other key issues in relation to monitoring and management of sediment recovery. First, techniques used to determine impact may not be appropriate for evaluation of recovery. Second, establishment of local baseline standards is extremely important to ensure appropriate evaluation of both impact and recovery. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress is a major problem for dairy cattle welfare, and it has several implications for milk production. In this work, automatic sensors were used to monitor cows' activity. Different behaviors were recorded for 40 animals at different heat stress conditions. The main aim of the study was to use automatic sensors to identify behavior changes caused by heat stress on dairy cows. All behaviors studied were affected by environmental conditions. Animals adapted to heat stress by modifying their behavior, and automatic sensors provided valuable information in this regard. These findings might be the early development of an automatic early warning system for heat stress based on the behavioral modifications of dairy cattle. Heat stress plays a role in livestock production in warm climates. Heat stress conditions impair animal welfare and compromise the productive and reproductive performance of dairy cattle. Under heat stress conditions, dairy cattle modify their behavior. Thus, the assessment of behavior alterations can be an indicator of environmental or physiological anomalies. Moreover, precision livestock farming allows for the individual and constant monitoring of animal behavior, arising as a tool to assess animal welfare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of heat stress on the behavior of dairy cows using activity sensors. The study was carried out in Tinajeros (Albacete, Spain) during the summer of 2020. Activity sensors were installed in 40 cows registering 6 different behaviors. Environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) were also monitored. Hourly data was calculated for both animal behavior and environmental conditions. Temperature and Heat Index (THI) was calculated for each hour. The accumulated THI during the previous 24 h period was determined for each hour, and the hours were statistically classified in quartiles according to the accumulated THI. Two groups were defined as Q4 for no stress and Q1 for heat stress. The results showed that animal behavior was altered under heat stress conditions. Increasing THI produces an increase in general activity, changes in feeding patterns and a decrease in rumination and resting behaviors, which is detrimental to animal welfare. Daily behavioral patterns were also affected. Under heat stress conditions, a reduction in resting behavior during the warmest hours and in rumination during the night was observed. In conclusion, heat stress affected all behaviors recorded as well as the daily patterns of the cows. Precision livestock farming sensors and the modelling of daily patterns were useful tools for monitoring animal behavior and detecting changes due to heat stress.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of a service routine mainly composed of external visual mental imagery (MI) focused on the trajectory of the ball and the target area to be reached before the actual strike on tennis service performance. Forty expert tennis players were randomly divided into two experimental groups: control and imagery. They performed a pre-test (i.e., 25 first serves in match conditions), 20 acquisition sessions (i.e., physical practice + IM or physical practice only), and a post-test similar to the pre-test in environmental conditions. The percentage of accurate first serves, their speed, and their efficiency scores, evaluated by experts observing the return of serves in match conditions, were used as performance indicators and dependent variables. The results of this experiment show an improvement in performance in the participants of the imagery group only. It therefore seems beneficial for expert tennis players to use routines based on breathing, ball bouncing, and mental imagery of the trajectory of the ball and the target to be hit before first serves in match conditions.

AB  - Soil quality indices based on soil characteristics can be used to assess the sustainability of soil and to assist in soil management decisions. Principal component analysis (PCA) technique was used to identify dominant soil characteristics in relation to soil erodibility in watersheds of submontane Punjab (India). Soil physical and chemical characteristics were evaluated for four locations with four land uses at each location whereas runoff, soil loss and soil erodibility were determined at two locations under natural rainfall conditions and at four locations under simulated rainfall conditions. PCA was performed on 22 physical and chemical soil characteristics, which grouped these soil characteristics into five distinct principal components (PCs). These five PCs namely soil hydraulic factor, density factor, structural factor, sand factor and cation factor, explained 86% variability in data. These PCs also explained 86, 96 and 93% variability under natural rainfall conditions and 75, 76 and 77% variability under simulated rainfall conditions in relation to runoff, soil loss and soil erodibility, respectively. Soil total organic carbon content can be considered as dynamic soil physical quality indicator and can be used to monitor temporal and spatial changes in soil quality.

AB  - The properties of forty naturally aged papers taken from books dating from 1477 to 1793 were assessed using two indicators of paper condition: degree of polymerization and yellowness index. These data were interrelated with three variables that may impact long-term paper stability: pH, gelatin content, and residual metals content. More stable specimens (high degree of polymerization and low yellowness index values) were strongly associated with high pH. High pH specimens were found to contain lower amounts of aluminum, and sulfur. as well as higher amounts of calcium and magnesium. Papers with more dian 5.5% w/w gelatin content exhibited high pH, while those containing less than 5.5% w/w gelatin content showed both a range in pH and a broad range of aluminum, potassium, and sulfur content. Consequently:. high gelatin content specimens were in good condition while low gelatin content specimens ranged in condition from poor to good. Results Suggest that pH is the controlling factor in long-term stability and that gelatin needs to be present above some content level to provide long-term stability. The origin of high pH may lie in the alkaline calcium and magnesium residues.

AB  - Haematological indices have been frequently used to investigate the physiological condition of wild birds. In this respect, among many blood parameters, haematocrit has been considered to be a valuable indicator. Many studies, mostly conducted on adult birds, have discussed possible causes of haematocrit variation, pointing out several factors both natural and anthropogenic as being crucial. In this study, we examined the level of haematocrit for Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus nestlings in relation to habitat type and inter-year sources of variation. We found that the haematocrit of Blue Tit nestlings varied significantly between study years, showing an increasing trend. We explain this variation by changeable weather conditions, pointing out that temperature is a possible factor. The increase in haematocrit in subsequent study years was accompanied by a decline in the ambient temperature. No significant effect of habitat type was noted in the haematocrit variation. We also found that haematocrit values tended to be positively associated with fledging success. All this confirms that haematocrit may be reasonably used as a one of the indicators of nestling condition.

AB  - Simulations of open pit mines dewatering, their flooding, and environmental impact assessment are performed using groundwater flow models. They must take into consideration both regional groundwater conditions and the specificity of mine dewatering operations. This method has been used to a great extent in Polish opencast mines since the 1970s. However, the use of numerical models in mining hydrogeology has certain limitations resulting from existing uncertainties as to the assumed hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions. They include shortcomings in the identification of hydrogeological conditions, cyclic changes of precipitation and evaporation, changes resulting from land management due to mining activity, changes in mining work schedules, and post-mining void flooding. Even though groundwater flow models used in mining hydrogeology have numerous limitations, they still provide the most comprehensive information concerning the mine dewatering and flooding processes and their influence on the environment. However, they will always require periodical verification based on new information on the actual response of the aquifer system to the mine drainage and the actual climate conditions, as well as up-to-date schedules of deposit extraction and mine closure.

AB  - Drought stress is one of the major constraints limiting the production and productivity of barley. We tried to identify some indicators related to plant productivity by analyzing some agro-morphological and physiological traits in recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Plants were exposed to three water treatments: well-watered at 70% available water content (AWC), mild drought stress at 35% AWC, and severe drought stress at 10% AWC. Our results revealed that drought significantly affected most of the studied morpho-physiological traits resulting in strong decreases in yield and the studied traits. We did not observe a significant difference in water-use efficiency between severe and mild drought conditions. Therefore, the mild stress treatment was considered as the most suitable water level in our study. Genotypes with the most tillers and spikes, the highest 1,000-grain mass, and biological yields achieved higher grain yields under all water stress conditions. Therefore, these traits could be considered as useful tools in breeding programs.

AB  - Inverse transient analysis (ITA) is a powerful tool for pipeline condition assessment, where the concerned parameters are decided by matching the measured transient signal with its physical model. This scheme is computationally expensive because, in the optimization procedure, the model has to be evaluated many times via time-domain full-wave numerical simulations. To address this problem, a fast algorithm of ITA is proposed, where the role of the numerical model is replaced by an easy-to-evaluate surrogate model. The Kriging method is employed to build the surrogate model of transient wave, given a series of samples of concerned parameters and the associated numerical model outputs. Considering the sparse nature of the high-dimensional pipe condition parameters, a sparse sampling strategy is proposed to optimize the samples of parameters. Two application examples, i.e., pipe viscoelastic parameter estimation and leakage identification, are introduced to demonstrate that the proposed method is as accurate as the traditional ITA but has a much lower computational cost.

AB  - Effects of storms on the water quality of Hilo Bay, Hawaii, were examined by sampling surface waters at 6 stations 10 times during low-flow and 18 times during high-flow (storms) river conditions. The direction of a storm's impact on water quality parameters was consistent among storms and most stations; however, direction of the impact varied with the parameter. High river flow conditions increased concentrations of nitrate and decreased those of dissolved organic nitrogen (N); effects on ammonium and particulate N were station specific. Storms also increased dissolved organic and particulate carbon (C) concentrations. Dissolved phosphorus (P) concentrations were not affected by high river flow events. Dissolved organic forms dominated the N, C, and P pools under both low- and high-flow river conditions. Soil-derived particles and fecal indicator bacteria increased during storms, while chlorophyll a concentrations and bacterial cell abundances decreased. Our results suggest that an increase in storms with global warming could impact water quality of tropical estuaries.

AB  - The reconstruction of redox conditions in ancient environments is difficult in the absence of authigenic Fe and Mn phases as indicators. The Miocene sepiolite beds in the Madrid Basin (central Spain) that were formed in closed systems under arid to semiarid climate are examples of an environment poor in Fe and Mn phases. In this paper, a new approach is presented that uses structure-bound transition metal ions in sepiolites from two localities (Vallecas and Valdemoro) to deduce redox conditions during their formation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that most of the sepiolite is fibrous and that a subordinate part has a spheroidal morphology. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy showed Fe(III), V(IV), and V(III) located in octahedral sites of the sepiolite structure. Bound V(III) indicates sulfidic conditions during the crystallization of the sepiolite fibers that form the major part of the deposits. The cessation of the formation of sepiolite deposits is indicated by the poorly crystallized spheroidal morphotype. The occurrence of Mn-oxides in the pore space of the sepiolite deposits indicates later oxic conditions that led to a partial oxidation of the metal centers in the sepiolite structure.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate vaginal temperature as a thermoregulatory response of Nellore heifers under different microclimatic conditions. The study was conducted during one year in an experimental area located at 54 37'W, 20 27'S, and 530 m of altitude in Brazil. Twenty-four Nellore females were reared in integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems with different shading patterns. The randomized complete block experimental design was utilized with a sub subdivided plots scheme, with plot corresponding to the production systems, the subplot to the season of the year, and the sub subplot, the hours of the day. To characterize the microclimate, data regarding air and black globe temperatures, and air relative humidity were collected and from them, temperature-humidity index was calculated. Vaginal temperature was obtained by using a bottom-type temperature logger (i-button) attached to an adapted intravaginal device. The black-globe temperature explained the variation on vaginal temperature. Increases on vaginal temperature were only observed, on average, two hours after the increase of black-globe temperature. The microclimatic conditions found in the systems, resulting from the various tree densities, modify the vaginal temperature in different degrees, demonstrating that the shading effect is not always accompanied by improvements in thermal comfort. The system with intermediate density showed a better microclimatic condition and, consequently, a lower increase in vaginal temperature. The interaction between air temperature, humidity and solar radiation resulted in adverse environmental conditions, however, Nellore heifers showed good adaptation to the environment. In conclusion, vaginal temperature is a good indicator to evaluate the thermoregulatory response in Nellore heifers.

AB  - The aspects of the development of corrosion processes under the conditions of moisture condensation in the gas phase in the presence of carbon dioxide which lead to the formation of local damage at gas extraction sites are studied. A procedure for conducting the corrosion testing of steels under such conditions is developed and tested. The causes of local corrosion and the degree of the corrosive action of moisture condensation on steel in a carbon dioxide atmosphere are analyzed. It is found that condensation of a large amount of moisture on the surface of steel occurs in the case of a temperature differential, which leads to an increase in the rate of both general and local corrosion. The increased localization of corrosion processes under the conditions of moisture condensation in the presence of CO2 becomes the reason why the indicator of the depth of corrosion of steel is much higher than the total rate of corrosion. When evaluating the corrosive aggressiveness of the environments with the condensation of the aqueous phase, the indicators of the rate of corrosion associated with the depth of corrosion damage should be taken into account. It is determined on the basis of the test results that the degree of localization of corrosion under the conditions of moisture condensation is higher for the samples cut out from the welded seam when compared to the samples cut out from the parent pipe.

KW  - TRENDS
AB  - A high-resolution, two-dimensional numerical model is used to study the moisture redistribution following homogeneous ice nucleation induced by Kelvin waves in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). We compare results for dry/moist initial conditions and three levels of complexity for the representation of cloud processes: complete microphysics and cloud radiative effects, likewise but without radiative effects, and instantaneous removal of moisture in excess of saturation upon nucleation.
   Cloud evolution and moisture redistribution are found to be sensitive to initial conditions and cloud processes. Ice sedimentation leads to a downward flux of water, whereas the cloud radiative heating induces upward advection of the cloudy air. The latter results in an upward (downward) flux of water vapour if the cloudy air is moister (drier) than the environment, which is typically when the environment is subsaturated (supersaturated).
   Only a fraction (similar to 25% or less) of the cloud experiences nucleation. Post-nucleation processes (ice depositional growth, sedimentation, and sublimation) are important to cloud morphology, and both dehydrated and hydrated layers may be indicators of TTL cirrus occurrence. The calculation with instantaneous removal of moisture not only misses the hydration but also underestimates dehydration due to (i) nucleation before reaching the minimum saturation mixing ratio, and (ii) lack of moisture removal from sedimenting ice particles below the nucleation level.
   The sensitivity to initial conditions and cloud processes suggests that it is difficult to reach generic, quantitative estimates of cloud-induced moisture redistribution on the basis of case-by-case calculations.

AB  - Organisms exposed to suboptimal conditions face an a priori cost of combating stress in terms of metabolic resources. The energy available for maintenance, growth, and reproduction, based on the biochemical analysis of the energy budget rather than on the direct measurement of those endpoints, may therefore provide a sensitive measure of stress in an organism. The aim of this study was to validate changes in energy budget as an ecologically relevant sublethal parameter by comparing these responses with physiological, growth, and reproductive endpoints. A toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio) was conducted where fish were exposed to a control and 50, 75, and 100% effluent for 28 d under flow-through conditions. Effects of effluent exposure were measured as changes in glycogen, lipid, and protein budgets. Furthermore, the observed effects were linked to different processes like growth, condition, respiration, and reproduction within the same populations. Our results indicate that changes in lipid budgets in exposed fish were the most sensitive endpoint. Excellent relations were found between cellular energy budgets, relative condition factor, and respiration (r(2) = 0.795, p < 0.001; and r(2) = 0.735, p < 0.001, respectively), but relations were poorer for reproductive output (r(2) = 0.410, p < 0.034). As a whole, especially changes in lipid energy budgets provide a sensitive and fast indicator of altered condition in zebrafish under the given exposure regime and allow linking cellular effects to other endpoints within the same exposed populations.

AB  - The pathogen concentration in human excreta needs to be managed appropriately, but a predictive approach has yet to be implemented due to a lack of kinetics models for pathogen inactivation that are available under varied environmental conditions. Our goals were to develop inactivation kinetics models of microorganisms applicable under varied environmental conditions of excreta matrices and to identify the appropriate indicators that can be monitored during disinfection processes. We conducted a systematic review targeting previous studies that presented time-course decay of a microorganism and environmental conditions of matrices. Defined as a function of measurable factors including treatment time, pH, temperature, ammonia concentration and moisture content, the kinetic model parameters were statistically estimated using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The inactivation kinetics models were constructed for Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterococcus, Ascaris eggs, bacteriophage MS2, enterobacteria phage phiX174 and adenovirus. The inactivation rates of a microorganism were predicted using the established model. Ascaris eggs were identified as the most tolerant microorganisms, followed by bacteriophage MS2 and Enterococcus. Ammonia concentration, temperature and moisture content were the critical factors for the Ascaris inactivation. Our model predictions coincided with the current WHO guidelines. The developed inactivation kinetics models enable us to predict microbial concentration in excreta matrices under varied environmental conditions, which is essential for microbiological risk management in emerging resource recovery practices from human excreta.

AB  - Drought severely limits forage productivity of C-4 grasses across the tropics. The avoidance of water deficit by increasing the capacity for water uptake or by controlling water loss are common responses in forage C-4 grasses. Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato II are tropical C-4 grasses used for livestock production due to their reputed resistance to drought conditions. However, there is scant information on the mechanisms used by these grasses to overcome water-limited conditions. Therefore, assessments of cumulative transpired water, shoot growth, leaf rolling, leaf gas exchange, dry mass production and a number of morpho-physiological traits were recorded over a period of 21 days under well-watered or drought conditions. Drought reduced shoot dry mass of both grasses by 35 %, yet each grass exhibited contrasting strategies to cope with water shortage. Napier grass transpired most available water by the end of the drought treatment, whereas a significant amount of water was still available for Mulato II. Napier grass maintained carbon assimilation until the soil was fairly dry, whereas Mulato II restricted water loss by early stomatal closure at relatively wet soil conditions. Our results suggest that Napier grass exhibits a 'water-spending' behaviour that might be targeted to areas with intermittent drought stress, whereas Mulato II displays a 'water-saving' nature that could be directed to areas with longer dry periods.

AB  - Background Emerging evidence suggests increased risk of several physical health conditions in people with ADHD. Only a few physical conditions have been thoroughly studied in relation to ADHD, and there is little knowledge on associations in older adults in particular. We aimed to investigate the phenotypic and aetiological associations between ADHD and a wide range of physical health conditions across adulthood.
   Methods We did a register study in Sweden and identified full-sibling and maternal half-sibling pairs born between Jan 1, 1932, and Dec 31, 1995, through the Population and Multi-Generation Registers. We excluded individuals who died or emigrated before Jan 1, 2005, and included full-siblings who were not twins and did not have half-siblings. ICD diagnoses were obtained from the National Patient Register. We extracted ICD diagnoses for physical conditions, when participants were aged 18 years or older, from inpatient (recorded 1973-2013) and outpatient (recorded 2001-13) services. Diagnoses were regarded as lifetime presence or absence. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between ADHD (exposure) and 35 physical conditions (outcomes) in individuals and across sibling pairs. Quantitative genetic modelling was used to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors accounted for the associations with ADHD.
   Findings 4 789 799 individuals were identified (2 449 146 [51%] men and 2 340 653 [49%] women), who formed 4 288 451 unique sibling pairs (3 819 207 full-sibling pairs and 469 244 maternal half-sibling pairs) and 1 841 303 family clusters (siblings, parents, cousins, spouses). The mean age at end of follow-up was 47 years (range 18-81; mean birth year 1966); ethnicity data were not available. Adults with ADHD had increased risk for most physical conditions (34 [97%] of 35) compared with adults without ADHD; the strongest associations were with nervous system disorders (eg, sleep disorders, epilepsy, dementia; odds ratios [ORs] 1.50-4.62) and respiratory diseases (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ORs 2.42-3.24). Sex-stratified analyses showed similar patterns of results in men and women. Stronger cross-disorder associations were found between full-siblings than between half-siblings for nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and metabolic diseases (p<0.007). Quantitative genetic modelling showed that these associations were largely explained by shared genetic factors (60-69% of correlations), except for associations with nervous system disorders, which were mainly explained by non-shared environmental factors.
   Interpretation This mapping of aetiological sources of cross-disorder overlap can guide future research aiming to identify specific mechanisms contributing to risk of physical conditions in people with ADHD, which could ultimately inform preventive and lifestyle intervention efforts. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the presence of physical conditions in patients with ADHD. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sowing naked seeds is generally preferred in arid and semiarid regions. This research aimed to find the optimal dimensions for both pelleted and naked seeds based on seed distance in rows and field emergence irrigation setting in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivation under the environmental conditions of Central Anatolia in Turkey. For comparison, the research considered two field emergence irrigation conditions, namely, irrigated and non-irrigated, at 8 and 17 cm seed distances within rows for naked seeds of two dimensions: N3 .25-empty set4.50 and N3.00-empty set3.50 mm and for pelleted seeds of five dimensions: P3.50-empty set3.75, P3.75-empty set4.00, P4.00-empty set4.25, P4.25-empty set4.50, and P4.50-empty set4.75 mm. The results showed that the highest beet yield and refined sugar content were 66.67 and 10.31 t ha(-1), respectively, obtained in the plot that was irrigated and drilled with N3.00-empty set3.50 mm seeds at 8 cm sowing distance. The lowest values were obtained from the non-irrigated plot that was drilled with P4.50-empty set4.75 mm seeds at 17 cm sowing distance in all conditions. In field emergence irrigation conditions, planting pelleted seeds from 3.50 to 4.25 mm in dimension or 0.25-0.75 mm in thickness at row distances of 8 and 17 cm can be concluded to be the optimum application.

AB  - A contemporary road vehicle (RV) is a rather complex system, consisting of a large number of subsystems, assemblies, units, and elements (parts). While operating, an RV interacts with the environment, and its elements interact with each other. Consequently, the properties (parameters) of these elements change in the process - hardness, roughness, size, relative position, gapping, etc. A partial solution to the presented problems can be the search for a technique for assessing the RV technical condition by a generalised criterion, which is quite sensitive to changes in the technical state. One of these criteria may be fuel consumption in litres per 100 kilometres. This paper investigates the possibilities of using the fuel consumption indicator as a criterion for assessing the technical condition of the vehicle and the vehicle maintenance and repair technologies have been generalised to obtain a given technical solution. Thus, the possibility of using the fuel consumption indicator as a criterion for assessing the technical condition of the vehicles was explored using the Volkswagen Touran 1.9 TDI operating in urban conditions using a driving cycle. A clear correlation between the fuel consumption and the service lifetime of the vehicle has been established; therefore, it depends on the frequency and quality of the maintenance and repair (MR). The vehicle MR technology has been generalised to obtain a specified technical solution. The process of creating an RV MR Technology model is implemented based on an iterative approach (repetition) with the possibility to specify their features.

AB  - In this study, a set of municipal wastewater (MWW) samples from an actual residual water treatment plant was treated by ozone. The residual water was characterized in terms of organic load and biological contaminants: total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC) and helminth eggs (HE). Initial values of these parameters were 2.8 x 10(7) MPN/100 mL, 8.48 x 10(6) MPN/100 mL, and 470 L-1, respectively. The experimental setup considered the modification of pH and ozone dose as independent variables. Three different initial pH values (4.0, 7.0, and 11.0) and three different ozone concentrations (6, 15, and 30 mg/L) were used to investigate the pH ozone dose effect. The efficiency of ozone-based treatment was determined by the reduction of the microbiological indicators (TC, FC, and HE) and physicochemical parameters (COD and turbidity). The response surface method was used to determine suboptimal reaction conditions. These conditions were obtained using a two-stage procedure. The conditions under which both microbiological and organics were better removed corresponded to pH 7.8 and ozone concentration of 15.5 mg/L. A decline of biological indicators of 99% for TC, 99% for FC, and 99% for HE was obtained under the same reaction conditions. The reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity was 75% and 85% under the same operation conditions, respectively.

AB  - Background: Extreme environmental conditions will affect most people in the coming decades and influence the health and lives of billions of people. Especially at greater risk will be the elderly with diagnosed chronic heart disease, who live in urban districts.
   Aim: This study analyses the impacts of microclimatic conditions and air quality on the health of the elderly living in nursing homes.
   Methods: We analysed the impacts of temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of outdoor pollutants (particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone) on heart rate, blood pressure and symptoms.
   Results: The effects of apparent temperature on all physiological parameters and expressed symptoms (p<0.001) were found. Heat burden appeared above 25 degrees C and increases with increasing temperature. Significant effects of air pollution were also noticed at low air quality. For air quality, we found statistically significant differences only for particles and ozone (p<0.05).
   However, it has been demonstrated that integral indicators as the Humidex Index and Air Quality Stress Index have more obvious impacts on human health than single factor analysis.
   Conclusions: Extreme environmental conditions can cause adverse health effects among elderly people with cardio-vascular disease. Therefore, suitable conditions with regards to temperature, relative humidity and air quality in the nursing homes for the elderly should be established. Medical staff should monitor physiological parameters and expressed symptoms to prevent heat related illnesses.

AB  - The Piedemonte Llanero Basin is located on the eastern side of the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes. It has been the subject of numerous geological studies carried out for the oil sector, mainly. This study presents the coal-petrographical features of 15 coal seams of four geological formations from Late Cretaceous to Middle Miocene (Chipaque formation, Palmichal group, Arcillas del Limbo formation, and San Fernando formation). Analysis of 33 samples indicates enrichment in vitrinite, while liptinite and inertinite concentrations vary according to the stratigraphic position. Reflectance indicates that the coal range gradually decreases from highly volatile bituminous C (Chipaque formation) to subbituminous C (San Fernando formation). The microlithotypes with the highest concentrations are clarite and vitrinertoliptite. Maceral composition and coal facies indicate changes in the depositional conditions of the sequence. The precursor peat from Late Cretaceous to Late Paleocene accumulated under limnic conditions followed by telmatic in Late Eocene-Early Miocene. The coal facies indices show wet conditions in forest swamps with variations in the flooding surface, influxes of brackish water and good tissue preservation. The tectonic conditions along the Piedemonte Llanero basin is evident, from post-rift to foreland basin, evidenced by oxic and anoxic periods reflected in the maceral composition and its morphology. The coal environment corresponds to an estuarine system started in the Chipaque formation evolving to the lacustrine conditions in the San Fernando formation.

AB  - Management of temperate forests has the potential to increase carbon sinks and mitigate climate change. However, those opportunities may be confounded by negative climate change impacts. We therefore need a better understanding of climate change alterations to temperate forest carbon dynamics before developing mitigation strategies. The purpose of this project was to investigate the interactions of species composition, fire, management, and climate change in the Copper-Pine Creek valley, a temperate coniferous forest with a wide range of growing conditions. To do so, we used the LANDIS-II modelling framework including the new Forest Carbon Succession extension to simulate forest ecosystems under four different productivity scenarios, with and without climate change effects, until 2050. Significantly, the new extension allowed us to calculate the net sector productivity, a carbon accounting metric that integrates above-ground and belowground carbon dynamics, disturbances, and the eventual fate of forest products. The model output was validated against literature values. The results implied that the species optimum growing conditions relative to current and future conditions strongly influenced future carbon dynamics. Warmer growing conditions led to increased carbon sinks and storage in the colder and wetter ecoregions but not necessarily in the others. Climate change impacts varied among species and site conditions, and this indicates that both of these components need to be taken into account when considering climate change mitigation activities and adaptive management. The introduction of a new carbon indicator, net sector productivity, promises to be useful in assessing management effectiveness and mitigation activities.

AB  - The environmental conditions individuals experience during early development are well known to have fundamental effects on a variety of fitness-relevant traits. Although it is evident that the earliest developmental stages have large effects on fitness, other developmental stages, such as the period when secondary sexual characters develop, might also exert a profound effect on fitness components. Here we show experimentally in male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, that nutritional conditions during this later period have immediate effects on male plumage ornaments and on their attractiveness as adults. Males that had received high quality food during the second month of life, a period when secondary sexual characteristics develop, were significantly more attractive as adults in mate choice tests than siblings supplied with standard food during this period. Preferred males that had experienced better nutritional conditions had larger orange cheek patches when nutritional treatments ended than did unpreferred males. Sexual plumage ornaments of young males thus are honest indicators of nutritional conditions during this period. The mate choice tests with adult birds indicate that nutritional conditions during the period of song learning, brain and gonad development, and moult into adult plumage have persisting effects on male attractiveness. This suggests that the developmental period following nutritional dependence from the parents is just as important in affecting adult attractiveness as are much earlier developmental periods. These findings thus contribute to understanding the origin and consequences of environmentally determined fitness components.

AB  - Green infrastructure has been widely studied as a means of runoff reduction in urban areas, but the performance of such infrastructure installations is dependent on local environmental conditions. Rain gardens in particular are affected not only by precipitation but also by the native soil within which a garden is situated. In this study, we quantified the likelihood that a rain garden would overflow under different storm conditions based on installation in various native soils. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) (v. 5.1), we simulated different environmental conditions; the output overflow results were used to create linear regressions of overflow quantity as a function of soil parameters. These empirical relationships give insight into which parameters are most significant for runoff reduction under different conditions. In particular, planting media thickness and soil porosity in a rain garden were significant indicators of overflow in native soils with lower seepage rates. We used results from the regressions to create fragility curves using the Finite-Element Reliability Using Matlab (FERUM) software tool to create a visual representation of the probability of failure for a rain garden with increasing precipitation intensity when installed in different native soil types. This study helps describe the spatial variability of rain garden performance, and insights from this study can be used to inform planners of the feasibility of implementing a rain garden in terms of the local soils and typical precipitation conditions.

AB  - The condition of 25 stream sites in the Yakima River Basin, Washington, were assessed by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Multimetric condition indices were developed and used to rank sites on the basis of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. These indices showed that sites in the Cascades and Eastern Cascades ecoregions were largely unimpaired. In contrast, all but two sites in the Columbia Basin ecoregion were impaired, some severely. Agriculture (nutrients and pesticides) was the primary factor associated with impairment and all impaired sites were characterized by multiple indicators of impairment. All indices of biological condition (fish, invertebrates, and algae) declined as agricultural intensity increased. The response exhibited by invertebrates and algae suggested a threshold response with conditions declining precipitously at relatively low levels of agricultural intensity and little response at moderate to high levels of agricultural intensity. This pattern of response suggests that the success of mitigation will vary depending upon where on the response curve the mitigation is undertaken. Because the form of the community condition response is critical to effective water-quality management, the National Water-Quality Assessment Program is conducting studies to examine the response of biota to gradients of land-use intensity and the relevance of these responses to water-quality management These land-use gradient pilot studies will be conducted in several urban areas starting in 1999.

AB  - Periodic inspection of pipeline conditions is an important asset management strategy conducted by water and sewer utilities for efficient and economical operations of their assets in field. The Level 1 pipeline condition assessment involving resistivity profiling along the pipeline right-of-way is a common technique for delineating pipe sections that might be installed in highly corrosive soil environment. However, the technique can suffer from significant perturbations arising from the buried pipe itself, resulting in errors in native soil characterisation. To address this problem, a finite element model was developed to investigate the degree to which pipes of different a) diameters, b) burial depths, and c) surface conditions (bare or coated) can influence in-situ soil resistivity measurements using Wenner methods. It was found that the greatest errors can arise when conducting measurements over a bare pipe with the array aligned parallel to the pipe. Depending upon the pipe surface conditions, in-situ resistivity measurements can either be underestimated or overestimated from true soil resistivities. Following results based on simulations and decoupling equations, a guiding framework for removing pipe influences in soil resistivity measurements were developed that can be easily used to perform corrections on measurements. The equations require simple a-prior information on the pipe diameter, burial depth, surface condition, and the array length and orientation used. Findings from this study have immediate application and is envisaged to be useful for critical civil infrastructure monitoring and assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropic eutrophication is one of the most widespread problems affecting water quality worldwide. This condition is caused by excessive nutrient inputs to aquatic systems, and one of the main consequences is accelerated phytoplankton growth. Eutrophication can lead to damage to human health, the environment, society, and the economy. One of the most serious consequences of eutrophication is the proliferation of cyanobacteria that can release toxins into the water. The aim of this research was to evaluate the trophic condition of a tropical reservoir over the course of time, using a database extending over 15 years to investigate relationships with environmental conditions, considering spatial heterogeneity and seasonality, as well as inter-relations between trophic state indicators. Data for chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen were collected from 2000 to 2014, and cyanobacteria abundance was determined from 2004 to 2014. The trophic state index was also calculated. The results demonstrated the existence of two distinct compartments in the reservoir: one lotic and the other lentic. No relationship was observed between chlorophyll-a and phosphorus. The results suggested that phytoplankton growth was mainly controlled by nitrogen concentrations. These conditions favored cyanobacteria predominance, resulting in increasing abundance of these potentially toxic bacteria over time. The model obtained indicated hypereutrophic conditions, with high phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria abundance during the next years likely to affect the uses of the water of the reservoir.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is an ubiquitous environmental pollutant of increasing worldwide concern. It has become one of the most hazardous heavy metals in aquatic environments and could threaten aquatic organisms, including marine shrimp. Shrimp are sensitive to Cd and have been found to accumulate it in their bodies in proportion to environmental concentrations. The effects of Cd on the biology and gene expression of the commercially important Litopenaeus vannamei are unknown. The overall hypothesis is that Cd exerts effects on shrimp at both biological and molecular levels. These changes may provide a way to identify genes responsible for toxicity, detoxification and/or tolerance to Cd exposure both acute and chronic. To test the hypothesis, a small-scale pilot project was initiated to obtain baseline information on histological changes associated with Cd treatment and to develop the genomics tools needed to identify genes associated with Cd exposure. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) observe histopathologic changes in control- and Cd-treated postlarvae (PL) during a 48-h period, (2) measure Cd concentrations in Cd-exposed and untreated PLs, and (3) isolate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from control and Cd-treated PLs for future genomics studies. Specific pathogen-free L. vannamei PLs at stage 42 (PL42, from the Kona Line of the United Slates Marine Shrimp Farming Program) were used in a waterborne bioassay to determine histological changes in PLs exposed to a range of concentrations of CdCl2 (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 ppm) for 48 h. Results for objective (1) indicated variable response of individual shrimp to Cd exposure at different concentrations. All but 2 animals from 10-ppm group died by 24 h. Histological lesions were limited to the integument, musculature, gills, hepatopancreas, and midgut-hindgut. For objective (2), results showed that the Cd levels in control PLs at 0 h were low and remained relatively low throughout the study. There was a dose- and time-dependent relationship of waterborne Cd exposure and accumulation. Results from objective (3) suggested differential gene expression in control- and Cd-treated PLs as reflected by the number of ESTs homologous to genes with different molecular function isolated from approximately 1,100 clones each from the control and Cd-exposed (1 ppm) cDNA libraries. These ESTs contributed to the establishment of an EST database for L. vannamei (ShrimpESTBase). Homology searches of the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of ESTs isolated from the control and Cd-treated (I ppm) cDNA libraries identified a significant number of clones similar to (a) known housekeeping genes and genes involved in immune recognition, signal transduction and effector function, (b) other shrimp ESTs of unknown function, (c) ESTs from other species, (d) predicted, unknown or unnamed proteins from other species, and (e) no homology to any sequence in the GenBank database. Some ESTs (similar to 30%) from the Cd-treated library showed homology to unique sequences representing potential transposable elements. The results provide baseline information on the potential effects of Cd on shrimp health and growth and suggest a complex interaction between environmental conditions, water, feed, stress, and genetic background of PLs and should be further investigated under both laboratory and commercial conditions. Moreover, data suggest L. vannamei may be useful as bioindicators for the condition of their natural environment.

AB  - The morphological and anatomical features of the assimilation apparatus Taraxacum officinale Wigg., growing under the conditions of a rock dump of the Kedrovsky coal mine in the Kemerovo Region, were studied. It was experimentally established that the specific environmental conditions of the rock dump cause morphological and anatomical changes in the leaves of the dandelion. At the level of leaf morphology, there is a decrease in the average leaf area, thickening of leaf blades, the formation of a trend towards a decrease in the number of leaves in the outlet. At the level of the anatomical structure, there is a significant increase in the thickness of mesophyll, a tendency to a decrease in the thickness of the tissues of the upper and lower epidermis, a decrease in the number of cells of the upper and lower epidermis by 1 mm(2) and an increase in the size of stomata in the tissues of the lower and upper epidermis, a decrease in the number of stomata by 1 mm(2) and stomatal index on the upper epidermis. Under the conditions of the rock dump, an increase in the number of reliable correlations between the anatomical parameters of the leaf of Taraxacum officinale Wigg., as well as anatomical signs with indicators of atmospheric pollution, was established, to a greater extent due to the formation of positive correlations that are known to control the development of biosystems and are critical for body periods.

AB  - Dry milling performance of maize (Zea mays L.) is directly related to kernel hardness. This study assessed the contribution of maize hybrid and crop growing condition on kernel hardness and grain yield. Three hybrids that fully explore the available genetic variability for kernel hardness were planted at different environments across the Argentinean cropping area. At each environment, early and late planting dates and supplemental fertilization were evaluated. Kernel coarse-to-fine ratio was used as an indicator of kernel hardness. Coarse-to-fine ratio ranged from 2.0 to 7.0 g g(-1), grain yield ranged from 494 to 1391 g m(-2), and both were affected by hybrid and growing conditions. Hybrid ranking was stable across growing conditions; however, differences among hybrids in kernel coarse-to-fine ratio and grain yield increased when growing condition favored kernel hardness and grain yield. Growing condition explained > 60% of total variability in coarse-to-fine ratio and grain yield. Fertilization management had significant but small influence on assessed variables. In contrast, the interaction between planting date and environment was the major determinant of kernel coarse-to-fine ratio and grain yield. Delayed planting consistently reduced kernel hardness at high-latitude locations. Potential photosynthetic source during maize reproductive period explained 37% of the variation in kernel coarse-to-fine ratio. Environment and agronomic management should be considered together with the hybrid in the design of maize production strategies oriented to end-use quality.

AB  - Pasture-based dairying in New Zealand and Australia has come under increasing animal welfare scrutiny as a result of changing public expectations for farm animal management. Concurrently, efficiency-driven changes in dairy management practices and a broadening of the feedbase beyond traditionally grazed pasture have resulted in increased intensification and stocking density within the dairy industries. This intensification has included a higher proportion of grain concentrates in the diet (particularly in Australia), and the greater management of cows off pasture and even in housing (particularly in New Zealand). Research to assess the animal welfare implications of these changes and to recommend good practice management has concentrated on issues of cow environments and cow feeding, including body condition. Research has shown that cows may be managed for a few hours per day on concrete surfaces without compromising their lying behaviour and other indicators of welfare, but that longer periods off pasture require the provision of a well drained and comfortable lying surface. Other research has defined the extremes of hot and cold/wet conditions beyond which cows benefit from provision of adequate shade and shelter. Research on cow body condition has indicated that welfare responses are aligned with measures of health and productivity in supporting the need to maintain a minimum body condition before calving and during the subsequent weight loss period of early lactation. Continued research, extension and industry adoption will enable dairy producers to address community expectations as they continue to change their farming practices.

AB  - New contributions to fisheries manager have been discussed from approaches about well-being and quality of life. In Brazil, quality of life (QOL) and quality of living conditions (QLC) were evaluated in rural and aquaculture producers, with objective results that could also to contribute in small-scale fisheries assessments. This study aimed to know the distance between looks from fishermans and technicians in the municipality Itanhaem/SP in fishing activity using four dimensions: social, environmental, economics and governance from a qualiquantitative approach. The governance dimension was the most critical and unsatisfactory, resulting in lower quality of life (IQOL) and living conditions (IQLC) indicators, emphasizing the discussion of the need for further studies on the institutional processes interfere with the welfare of fishing community in the region.

AB  - Contaminant bioaccumulation dynamics was examined in young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish subpopulations (Pomatomus saltatrix) in the New York Bight ecosystem, and the results were used to assess (i) effects of habitat quality in terms of levels of PCBs and pesticides on bluefish condition and (ii) fidelity of YOY bluefish to different subestuaries that served as the nurseries subsequent to recruitment during their first summer. Total PCBs and p,p'=-DDE body burdens increased with fish length, but concentrations generally increased only poorly to moderately, which suggested steady-state contaminant uptake commensurate with aggressive feeding and dilution related to rapid growth characteristic of YOY bluefish within a subestuary. High condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels in bluefish from the Lower Hudson River, as compared with bluefish from Newark Bay with poor condition factors paired with elevated contamination levels, suggested that PCBs and pesticides alone may not determine condition in these fish. We found dissimilar patterns of prominent PCB congeners in bluefish from adjacent subestuaries (e.g., Newark Bay and Lower Hudson River) suggesting separate contaminant sources. Total PCB normalized fingerprints of PCB congeners permitted statistical discrimination among YOY bluefish specimens from various estuaries with a potential to differentiate subpopulations on scales to less than 20 km. This unexpected fidelity to nursery estuaries may have implications for the management strategies.

AB  - Environmental disturbance and condition are complex concepts to define and measure in forested landscapes. The highly fragmented Afrotemperate forests in South Africa are under increasing pressure from the agricultural matrix and resource harvesting. Rapid assessment of forest condition and disturbance would aid their conservation management. The terrestrial amphipod, Talitriator africana, dominates the decomposer guild of Afrotemperate forests and has been previously identified as a potential indicator of forest condition. Using four published studies, we further evaluate this species' suitability as an environmental indicator of forest disturbance and condition. Amphipods were consistently more abundant at highly disturbed forest edges compared to less disturbed interiors, and less abundant in deep litter compared to shallow litter. High amphipod numbers in shallow litter was correlated with low predator abundance. Shallow litter may in turn be caused by more efficient breakdown of litter by amphipods at forest edges. Numbers varied considerably between sites and years, but showed a consistent trend of high abundance with increasing forest disturbance. The latter, and the ease with which it can be surveyed and identified, make a compelling case for the use of T. africana as a single-species environmental indicator of forest disturbance. However, relatively broad tolerances and the difficulty of calibrating the abundance-disturbance relationship over a wide region limits the indicator value of this species to the local landscape, where disturbance effects vary only in their intensity (as opposed to type) across forests.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES

AB  - The Maiz Gordo Formation was deposited in a sag basin during late Paleocene to early Eocene time and formed by rocks deposited in a lacustrine basin of mixed carbonate-elastic sedimentation. Percentages of carbonate rocks decrease from the inner lake zones to the margins. Several different subenvironments were identified which were either spatially related or occurred during a time of varied climatic conditions. The paleontologic record used as an environmental indicator reveals that the climate varied from arid conditions at the base of the sequence to more humid conditions toward the top. Temperatures were moderate to warm throughout. Sag basin formation was characterized by a slowly subsiding basin with low surrounding relief, which produced a lacustrine basin characterized by ramp margins with sedimentation of low/high energy type.

AB  - This paper proposes contingency assessment method that takes into account the nature of probability distribution of power system operating conditions to get realistic severity and risk estimations of contingencies. The uncertainty in operating conditions is captured by a mutually correlated non-parametric multivariate distribution, in addition to traditional standard distributions such as multivariate normal. While capturing these important features of operating conditions, the method also addresses reducing computational requirements by using linear sensitivities and machine learning techniques. The developed contingency assessment methods are applied on SEO region (Systeme Electrique Ouest, West France) of French EHV system to estimate seventies and eventually rank the selected contingencies based on risk of voltage collapse.

AB  - Three non-food cultivars of winter wheat (Biscay, Clarus, Rapsodia) were grown at four locations in the Czech Republic with different agro-ecological conditions in the years 2005-2008 and two levels of nitrogen fertilization 90 and 120 kg N/ha were used. The influence of growing conditions (year, location, cultivation technology) on grain yield, starch content, protein, gluten, share of amylose in starch, falling number and amylographic characteristics. All qualitative indicators were significantly affected by the weather. Wheat grown in the areas 500 m a.s.l. had lower grain yield of 2.8 t/ha (8.4 t/ha), higher starch content of 2.1% (69.0%) and lower content of proteins by 1.8% (10.2%) in grain than wheat grown in the fertile conditions (below 300 m a.s.l.). The cv. Biscay had the highest starch content of 68%; the proportion of amylose in the starch was in the range 22-27%. The content of proteins was negatively correlated with starch content (r = -0.89). The level of damage of starch a-amylase was most affected by wet weather during ripening falling number was 62 s, with a very low amylographic gelatinization maximum (30-155 Brabender units) and a low gelatinization temperature at the maximum (67-74 degrees C). The respective values recorded in dry conditions were ca 300 s, AU 600 and 90 degrees C. Most damaged starch was recorded in the cv. Clarus.

AB  - We reviewed construct validity in perception-based methods assessing status and/or trend of forest condition as applied in 19 empirical studies that evaluated the conservation impact of popular participation in forest management. Perception-based methods focus on eliciting peoples' assessment of the status and/or trend in forest condition or indicators of forest condition through interviews, surveys, or participatory rural appraisal techniques. We found that individual studies generally did not attend to the issue of construct validity in relation to each particular approach to perception-based assessment of status and/or trend in forest condition. Furthermore, the studies provided very little documentation of the construct validity of the perception-based methods as applied to assessments of forest condition in the specific context of popular participation in forest management. This scarcity of evidence implies that any support for the construct validity of these methods must be found outside the literature in which it was applied. A quick review of the literature on local assessments, monitoring, and local ecological knowledge supports the construct validity of such approaches as applied in various contexts; however, we argue that this support cannot be directly transferred to the context of popular participation in forest management. Accordingly, we conclude that there is a need for research to refine and validate perception-based methods as applied in the specific context of popular participation in forest management.

AB  - 1. Environmental conditions experienced early in life may have long-lasting effects on individual performance, thereby creating 'silver-spoon effects'.
   2. We used 15 years of data from a North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben) population to investigate influences of food availability, density and spring temperature experienced early in life on reproduction and survival of female squirrels during adulthood.
   3. We found that spring temperature and food availability did not affect female survival after 1 year of age, whereas higher squirrel densities led to lower survival, thereby affecting longevity and lifetime fitness.
   4. In addition, both food availability experienced between birth and weaning, and spring temperature in the year of birth, had long-lasting positive effects on female reproductive success. These results emphasize the critical effect environmental conditions during the early life stages can have on the lifetime performance of small mammals.
   5. These long-term effects of early food and temperature were apparent only once we controlled for conditions experienced during adulthood. This suggests that silver-spoon effects can be masked when conditions experienced early in life are correlated to some environmental conditions experienced later in life.
   6. The general importance of silver-spoon effects for adult demographic performance might therefore be underestimated, and taking adult environment into account appears to be necessary when studying long-term cohort effects.

AB  - Civil infrastructure condition assessment using visual recognition methods has shown significant potential for automating various aspects of the problem, including identification and localization of critical structural components, as well as detection and quantification of structural damage. The application of those methods typically requires large amounts of training data that consists of images and corresponding ground truth annotations. However, obtaining such datasets is challenging, because the images are annotated manually in most existing approaches. With the limited availability of datasets, development of effective visual recognition systems that can extract all required information is not straightforward. This research leverages synthetic environments to develop a unified system for automated vision-based structural condition assessment that can identify and localize critical structural components, and then detect and quantify damage of those components. The synthetic environments can produce images and associated ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation of structural components and damage, as well as monocular depth estimation for structural component localization. To illustrate the approach, automated vision-based structural condition assessment of reinforced concrete railway viaducts for a Japanese high-speed railway line (the Tokaido Shinkansen) is explored. The effectiveness of the synthetic environments and the generated dataset (the Tokaido dataset) is demonstrated by training fully convolutional network-based semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation algorithms, and then testing the networks using both synthetic and real-world images. Finally, all trained algorithms are combined to realize an automated system for structural condition assessment.

In this method, the relative permittivity of the cable insulation is used as the indicator to be monitored, which is closely associated with cable tan delta. The relative permittivity is extracted from the power disturbances and their responses, which are of sufficient strength and a wide range of frequencies. This method is beneficial to the on-line monitoring for it does not need the accurate remote synchronized phase angle information. Case studies and sensitivity studies demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.

AB  - Influences of residential conditions in a megacity on the health levels of residents were investigated. Correlations between mortalities and specified residential-condition indicators in study areas randomly selected from the megacity Tokyo were examined. Indicators representing housing and city planning were significantly correlated with mortalities after adjusting for socio-economic differences between the communities. Urbanisation to a certain level seems to have been associated with good health; however, the most densely developed artificial urban environment seems to be associated with negative health outcomes. Coping skills with regard to health problems are discussed in relation to health levels. A survey elucidated that the coping attitude of the elderly is related with their educational level, family structure, frequency of receiving health information and contact with a family doctor.

AB  - In this paper we review threshold behaviour in environmental systems, which are often associated with the onset of floods, contamination and erosion events, and other degenerative processes. Key objectives of this review are to a) suggest indicators for detecting threshold behavior, b) discuss their implications for predictability, c) distinguish different forms of threshold behavior and their underlying controls, and d) hypothesise on possible reasons for why threshold behaviour might occur. Threshold behaviour involves a fast qualitative change of either a single process or the response of a system. For elementary phenomena this switch occurs when boundary conditions (e.g., energy inputs) or system states as expressed by dimensionless quantities (e.g. the Reynolds number) exceed threshold values. Mixing, water movement or depletion of thermodynamic gradients becomes much more efficient as a result. Intermittency is a very good indicator for detecting event scale threshold behavior in hydrological systems. Predictability of intermittent processes/system responses is inherently low for combinations of systems states and/or boundary conditions that push the system close to a threshold. Post hoc identification of 'cause-effect relations' to explain when the system became critical is inherently difficult because of our limited ability to perform observations under controlled identical experimental conditions. In this review, we distinguish three forms of threshold behavior. The first one is threshold behavior at the process level that is controlled by the interplay of local soil characteristics and states, vegetation and the rainfall forcing. Overland flow formation, particle detachment and preferential flow are examples of this. The second form of threshold behaviour is the response of systems of intermediate complexity - e.g., catchment runoff response and sediment yield - governed by the redistribution of water and sediments in space and time. These are controlled by the topological architecture of the catchments that interacts with system states and the boundary conditions. Crossing the response thresholds means to establish connectedness of surface or subsurface flow paths to the catchment outlet. Subsurface stormflow in humid areas, overland flow and erosion in semi-arid and arid areas are examples, and explain that crossing local process thresholds is necessary but not sufficient to trigger a system response threshold. The third form of threshold behaviour involves changes in the 'architecture' of human geo-ecosystems, which experience various disturbances. As a result substantial change in hydrological functioning of a system is induced, when the disturbances exceed the resilience of the geo-ecosystem. We present examples from savannah ecosystems, humid agricultural systems, mining activities affecting rainfall runoff in forested areas, badlands formation in Spain, and the restoration of the Upper Rhine river basin as examples of this phenomenon. This functional threshold behaviour is most difficult to predict, since it requires extrapolations far away from our usual experience and the accounting of bidirectional feedbacks. However, it does not require the development of more complicated model, but on the contrary, only models with the right level of simplification, which we illustrate with an instructive example.
   Following Prigogine, who studied structure formation in open thermodynamic systems, we hypothesise that topological structures which control response thresholds in the landscape might be seen as dissipative structures, nd the onset of threshold processes/response as a switch to more efficient ways of depleting strong gradients that develop in the case of extreme boundary conditions.

AB  - Research conducted at the Belgrade Groundwater Source in Serbia has shown that significant well screen clogging processes take place under reduced oxic and initial anoxic conditions. Criteria for the prevention, or deceleration, of clogging are becoming more relevant to well ageing, compared with classical, mechanical clogging criteria and the permissible entrance velocities derived from them. The research project was later expanded to encompass other alluvial sources, which feature distinct oxic conditions. This paper presents some of the outcomes of this project, which shed light on the correlation between certain important indicators of well screen clogging (such as the redox potential and iron concentration) and the rate of increase in local hydraulic resistance at the wells.

AB  - Structural equation modeling is an advanced multivariate statistical process with which a researcher can construct theoretical concepts, test their measurement reliability, hypothesize and test a theory about their relationships, take into account measurement errors, and consider both direct and indirect effects of variables on one another. Latent variables are theoretical concepts that unite phenomena under a single term, e.g., ecosystem health, environmental condition, and pollution (Bollen, 1989). Latent variables are not measured directly but can be expressed in terms of one or more directly measurable variables called indicators. For some researchers, defining, constructing, and examining the validity of latent variables may be the end task of itself. For others, testing hypothesized relationships of latent variables may be of interest.
   We analyzed the correlation matrix of eleven environmental variables from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Estuaries (EMAP-E) using methods of structural equation modeling. We hypothesized and tested a conceptual model to characterize the interdependencies between four latent variables-sediment contamination, natural variability, biodiversity, and growth potential. In particular, we were interested in measuring the direct, indirect, and total effects of sediment contamination and natural variability on biodiversity and growth potential. The model fit the data well and accounted for 81% of the variability in biodiversity and 69% of the variability in growth potential. It revealed a positive total effect of natural variability on growth potential that otherwise would have been judged negative had we not considered indirect effects. That is, natural variability had a negative direct effect on growth potential of magnitude -0.3251 and a positive indirect effect mediated through biodiversity of magnitude 0.4509, yielding a net positive total effect of 0.1258. Natural variability had a positive direct effect on biodiversity of magnitude 0.5347 and a negative indirect effect mediated through growth potential of magnitude -0.1105 yielding a positive total effects of magnitude 0.4242. Sediment contamination had a negative direct effect on biodiversity of magnitude -0.1956 and a negative indirect effect on growth potential via biodiversity of magnitude -0.067. Biodiversity had a positive effect on growth potential of magnitude 0.8432, and growth potential had a positive effect on biodiversity of magnitude 0.3398. The correlation between biodiversity and growth potential was estimated at 0.7658 and that between sediment contamination and natural variability at -0.3769.

AB  - The studies of litters in the forests of the Kazakh denudational upland, Southern Urals, and Central Siberia enabled us to find some common regularities of litter accumulation and decomposition that are dependent on relief conditions and the moisture regime of ecotopes. Abundant empirical data (more than 300 test plots) were used to develop graphical models showing the effect of different ecotopes on the intensity of biological processes. Forest litters are stable indicators of site conditions in forest biogeocenoses.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem functions and services has increasingly gained attention in the scientific and political community in the last decade. Lot of work has been performed to assess the actual delivery of different services for society. Still, the reference of the landscape's potential to supply these actual services has not been investigated satisfactory so far. We thus aimed at assess the potential supply of landscape services in the study area of Lake Neusiedl in Austria - a region of acknowledged diversity and environmental quality - and compared these to the actual ones. We did this by setting up a map of constructed vegetation type where physiographic site conditions were used to calculate potential land cover in the area in GIS. These constructed vegetation types were linked to landscape services within a capacity matrix giving a weight between 0 (no supply) and 5 (high supply) to which amount one type can provide each single service. The resulting map showed large differences in areal extent of the different vegetation types reflecting the different landscapes in the region such as the dominance of forest steppe in the terraced landscapes or the occurrence of halophytic vegetation only in the lake basin. The same is true for the different landscape services. Some services like 'nursery' and 'raw materials' were quite highly provided throughout the area with values between 2.12 and 4.84, whereas 'genetic resources' and 'pollination' were only little provided (all values <2). On the other hand, functions like 'nutrient regulation' or 'refugium' exhibited their large potential with values >4 in the study area. The aggregation of the services by averaging values to finally derive three main service groups gave the highest values always to habitat (values between 3.1 and 4.8), followed by regulation (2.5-4.2) and then provision (1.9-3.2). Comparing the potential with the actual service supply, nearly all landscapes in the study area resulted in higher potential than the actual service supply. We further discuss possibilities to use the potential supply as a leitbild where restoration projects might be settled in the study area even though more detailed local data will be needed to set these projects up.

AB  - Ongoing biodiversity decline threatens ecosystem stability and reflects an overarching planetary boundary being breached. It undermines enabling conditions for sustainable development and posits alarming risks to the global economy. All business entities are dependent to biological diversity and the planetary spectrum of ecosystem services either directly or indirectly and there is a strong debate on why and how the private sector can effectively contribute to ecologically sustainable societies. In this context, corporate biodiversity accounting and reporting seeks to capture information relevant to biodiversity management by employing a certain set of comprehensive, valid and credible quantitative as well as qualitative indicators. This paper seeks to contribute to this direction by providing a critical evaluation of what business entities of mega-diverse countries report on biodiversity conservation and management through widely-accepted performance metrics disclosed in their sustainability reports along with underlying determinants. The assessment relies on a composite disclosure index devised to investigate the comprehensiveness of reported performance on biodiversity management and conservation. By employing Poisson and Gaussian Bayesian regression modeling, potential associations of biodiversity indicators with national specificity, organizational size and industrial affiliation are examined. Crucially, the constructive role of biodiversity accounting and reporting in communicating performance and discharging accountability towards relevant stakeholders is investigated, under the scope of an ecologically sustainable society. Most important predictors of biodiversity indicators disclosure pertain to spatial characteristics (i.e. country effects), along with the industry affiliation of the organizations. In contrast, organizational size does not seem to have a significant effect on the disclosure of biodiversity indicators. In particular, Brazilian, Bolivian and Malaysian enterprises exhibit the highest disclosure levels in biodiversity indicators, whereas the lowest levels are observed for those from Philippines. In terms of differences according to the business sector the sample reporters pertain to, we find biodiversity indicators are mostly reported by enterprises of the materials, energy, industrials, consumer staples and utilities sectors. Comparatively lowest levels are observed for the health care and information technology sectors. Considerable variation among companies, sectors, countries as well as individual indicators is evident. The analysis derived from the study suggests that performance indicators of biological diversity, as part the firm's broader management accounting system, are still underreported and in most cases confined to generic and/or vague statements, with quantitative data and narratives on managing biodiversity being sporadic and limited.

AB  - Coastal lagoons host important values and provide irreplaceable services to society. Communication areas with the sea (gullets, 'golas' in Spanish) are dynamic environments with a key role in their overall functioning, often representing also strongholds of biodiversity, which increases their conservation value and social demand for nature-based activities. In 2013 the Regional Assembly of the Autonomous Community of Murcia adopted unanimously the creation of a pedestrian walkway to promote ecotourism, environmental education and research in the area of the 'Encanizadas del Mar Menor' (EMM, thereafter), a space between the aforementioned lagoon and the Mediterranean Sea. The agreement was conditioned upon the completion of an environmental feasibility study which was commissioned to the University of Murcia. The area affected concentrates several habitats and species of community importance listed in EU Habitat and Bird Directives, including habitat 1140 (Mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide) and many seabird and waterbirds. Traditional fishing has not only preserved its ecological uniqueness but increased cultural value. The multi-criteria evaluation developed by a multidisciplinary team has combined the basic information available with specific models of response to the presence of the infrastructure and its use by visitors, especially regarding hydrological and sediment dynamics, and biodiversity (birds and habitats). Although constrained by the complex regulatory and administrative framework, and by the quality of the environmental information available, the design and development of this study provides a model for the evaluation of projects with strong public demand in ecologically sensitive areas of Mediterranean coastal lagoons. The assessment was made on the basis of four groups of viability criteria (socioeconomic, environmental, administrative and legal, technical), weighted by expert panels to rate the alternatives previously drafted. A specific social consultation provided information on the preferences and attitudes of actual users and the regional public on the intervention and its alternatives. A combined analysis of socioeconomic (positive) and environmental (negative) impacts was used to select the alternative that concurrently maximized social preferences and environmental integration. Although the possibility of building a footbridge was rejected, the selected alternative (peripheral boat itinerary) still had good social acceptance, was consistent with ecotourism policies and matched experiences carried out elsewhere. Additional utilities of such multidisciplinary assessments are their performance as public information and participation processes, and the possibility to use them as a basis for drafting initiatives for the valorisation or restoration of other sections of lagoon complexes.

AB  - The term "bio-indicator" may denote those aquatic organisms which accumulate contaminants in their tissues to high concentration. Ideal bioindicators should meet further selection criteria. They should be sedentary, abundant at the sites of interest, easy to identify, and easy to sample. They should be strong accumulators and should not regulate the contaminants. Nowadays, the use of multiple species which represent different trophic levels or feeding guilds has been accepted as necessary for a more accurate evaluation of pollution impacts. In order to obtain a total picture of contaminant bio-availabilities in marine environments, it is necessary to use several bioindicators, including : (1) macroalgae or seagrasses, responding to dissolved sources of contaminant -(2) suspension feeders, taking particles of a peculiar size range and responding to sources in both dissolved and suspended phases -(3) detritivores, feeding on newly deposited superficial sediments. With the aim of taking part in the creation of a system for evaluating the littoral water quality, this paper shows that sponges fulfil all the conditions of good bioindicators. Sponges are one of the major phyla found in the marine hard substrate benthos. Sponges are sessile filter feeders and are able to ingest particles between 0.2 and 50 mu m as well as dissolved organic material due to a large amount of symbiotic bacteria. Several examples show all their potential by presenting their relationships with micro-organisms and different contaminants. For example, sponges are able to accumulate hydrocarbons, PCB, DDT and heavy metals. It has been demonstrated that the process was not a simple saturation kinetics. The simple organisation of sponge tissues constitutes also an advantage for researching biological answers to stresses. For example, the function of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) in sponges has been determined. As in vertebrate cells, HSP protect sponge cells against environmental stresses. It was found that sponges react to temperature stress by induction of HSP70. Moreover, reactions of sponges according to different contaminants were also tested. Prospective studies showed that cadmium, zinc and PCB's act as inductors of HSP70. The examples presented in this paper show that sponges are good candidates in marine biomonitoring even if this potential is not exploited in official biomonitoring programmes. Currently, a field application, concerning the aquatic environment contamination by heavy metals and detergents, is beginning with analysis of their accumulation in sponges and research for biological responses.

AB  - Climate warming and associated physical and biological changes will likely force widespread species redistribution, particularly in polar environments. However, tracking such distributional shifts is difficult. The dietary habits of apex predators, like polar bears (Ursus maritimus), may provide early signals of distributional change in prey populations. We used harvest-based sampling to investigate the spatial feeding patterns of polar bears across Nunavut from 2010 to 2018 (n = 1570) and identify spatiotemporal clusters of different prey based on predator diet estimates. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic identified spatial clusters of high or low dietary proportions (i.e., "hot spots" and "cold spots") reflecting seasonal and spatial availability of prey. Ringed seal (Pusa hispida) was the primary prey of bears throughout Nunavut followed by bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), although proportional consumption varied spatially. A consistent ringed seal consumption hot spot was found in Gulf of Boothia indicating the importance of year-round availability of ringed seals. Spatial clusters of bearded seal and Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) throughout Foxe Basin suggested overlapping seasonal distributions and high regional abundance. Bears had consistently high dietary levels of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) around Southampton Island and along the western coast of Hudson Bay suggesting a possible year-round concentration of this prey. Hot spots of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) consumption were evident throughout Davis Strait and a spring-summer hot spot around Jones Sound was consistent with harp seal migratory patterns. Year-round beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) hot spots were found along eastern Baffin Island and southern Viscount Melville Sound providing new knowledge of local conditions that promote polar bear predation or scavenging. Narwhal (Monodon monoceros) were less susceptible to predation with only one spatial cluster of high consumption appearing during spring-summer in Barrow Strait. Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) hot spots occurred around south-western Foxe Basin and seasonally in southern Viscount Melville Sound suggesting carcasses are locally accessible to bears and may act as a supplemental food source in particular areas and seasons. The congruence of polar bear feeding habits and known prey distribution suggests polar bears serve as ecological indicators and ongoing monitoring of their diets may reveal regional and broadscale changes in prey population distributions and Arctic ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The paper simulates ecological risk assessment for shelf ecosystems based on the ecoscreening and dynamic methods synthesis. Both approaches and environmental risk model are described, which results make it possible to estimate probability of acceptable impact on the shelf ecosystem. In contrast to existing approaches related to ranking and compiling risk matrices, the proposed method based on probabilistic ecoscreening risk assessment takes into account not only the altering conditions of external influence on the shelf ecosystem, but also the intraannual dynamics of its main components. This makes it possible to calculate the ecological risk not as a fixed value for the ecosystem under study, but as its component changing over the course of a year along with the intra-annual functioning dynamics. The latter is especially important for the coastal basins, where processes of various genesis are concentrated, high gradients of biomass values and concentrations of components containing it are presented. To simulate various scenarios of combining the effect of external stressors with the intra-annual dynamics of the ecosystem functioning, the Northern Caspian shelf basin was selected, which is subject to intense river flow and to exposure to mineral resources development technologies, including oil and gas. Ecological risk values were calculated taking into account combination of adverse natural factors and implementation of emergency and regular anthropogenic impacts at different periods of the shelf ecosystem components natural dynamics. Results made it possible to assess probabilities of the allowable exposure of shelf ecosystem, to identify areas with the 100% probability of allowable impact and especially critical areas with less than 5% of the impact probability. Calculations show not only efficiency of the proposed approach, but also open possibility of harmonizing ecological and economic requirements in the development of shelf resources. For areas with high allowable impact probability, it is possible to reduce the economic costs of ensuring ecological safety. Ecological risk areas, which are characterized by low estimate of allowable impact probability require an increase in the safety economic expenses. The proposed approach to estimating the intra-annual risk dynamics is of interdisciplinary nature and could be useful both to specialists in the ecology area, in the related fields, and to management personnel in making decisions on redistributing economic expenses and minimizing them while maintaining the priority of environmental safety.

AB  - Topography affects the resource distribution and limits physical living and production conditions in mountainous regions. Depicting the specific positive and negative terrains in karst region would support for understanding ecosystem process and land resources managing in ecologically fragile areas. However, positive and negative terrains, specific topographic types in karst region, have been difficult to extract by the automatic machine quantitative method. The novelty of this study is developing a two-level nested (TLN) model to quantify and extract positive and negative terrains features of karst through utilizing visualization indicators, openness and the sky-view factor (SVF), combing an insight of morphological analysis. The algorithms of the two visualization indicators detected the surface morphological changes in 3D sphere and realized self-adaptive of complicated topographic changes. There were three main modules included in the two-level nested model: optimum radius analysis of selected indicators, optimum threshold judgement of positive and negative terrains edges and a morphological postprocessing module. The two-level chained process designed in the second module reached the quantitative potential critical thresholds detection and optimizing expression of positive and negative terrains boundaries, which integrated analyzing the variation trend of openness difference, SVF value and SVF change. Through the TLN framework, the accuracy and stability of positive and negative terrains boundaries extraction by openness and SVF were further strengthened. The TLN model was tested in seven counties where the karst terrain morphologies were quite different. The boundaries extracted by our TLN model were compared with the visual interpretation results, and the accuracy assessment validated that the overlapping areas of test and reference results were more than 90% and the boundaries' distance deviations were less than one grid. Positive terrain was predominant in all study areas and the proportions varied from 75.33 to 85.23%. Different positive and negative terrains percentages and formations indicated different phases in landform and ecosystem evolution process. The largest proportion of cultivated land appeared in the 0-150m buffer ring where mutations were detected, which implied an increased ecological risk of karst region. Therefore, it is urgent to resolve the increasingly serious ecological and environmental issues while ensure agricultural production and economic development. The positive and negative terrains distribution patterns could provide theoretical reference for a rational land use planning in the future.

AB  - Global-scale information on natural river flows and anthropogenic river flow alterations is required to identify areas where aqueous ecosystems are expected to be strongly degraded. Such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. This study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes, in particular of flow variability, by water withdrawals and dams/reservoirs. Six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model WaterGAP. WaterGAP simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams around the year 2000, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. Compared to naturalized conditions, long-term average global discharge into oceans and internal sinks has decreased by 2.7% due to water withdrawals, and by 0.8% due to dams. Mainly due to irrigation, long-term average river discharge and statistical low flow Q(90) (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10% on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland), respectively. Q(90) has increased significantly on only 5% of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. Due to both water withdrawals and reservoirs, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. It has decreased on only 8% of the land area, in areas downstream of reservoirs where consumptive water use is low. The impact of reservoirs is likely underestimated by our study as small reservoirs are not taken into account. Areas most affected by anthropogenic river flow alterations are the Western and Central USA, Mexico, the western coast of South America, the Mediterranean rim, Southern Africa, the semi-arid and arid countries of the Near East and Western Asia, Pakistan and India, Northern China and the Australian Murray-Darling Basin, as well as some Arctic rivers. Due to a large number of uncertainties related e.g. to the estimation of water use and reservoir operation rules, the analysis is expected to provide only first estimates of river flow alterations that should be refined in the future.

AB  - We explored past critical transitions in a peatland located in N Poland using a densely dated ( x 44 C-14 dates and x26 Pb-210), high-resolution multi-proxy profile. A 6500-year record was supported by a very robust age-depth model. Changes in land use, climate and carbon sequestration in northern Poland were investigated using a range of biotic proxies. We determined critical transitions in the development of the mire which were dependent upon extrinsic drivers. The trophic status of the mire shifted several times during the last 6.5 millennia. The pattern of changes suggests that it was very sensitive to different changes in the peatland basin. We identified several factors which may have driven transitions between the bog and fen state as a response to catchment hydrology changes largely driven by human impact which overlapped with periods of climate change. We determined the vegetation threshold in relation to microcharcoal which could be related to fire intensity. Based upon microcharcoal and pollen analyses, the local plant community threshold for fire intensity was estimated to be ca 7500 microcharcoal particles/cm(2)/year. We discovered that this level was also an important tipping point for the divergence between plants positively (e.g. human indicators and Carpinus betulus) or negatively related (e.g. Quercus) related to fires. This local threshold was related to ecological changes related to the emergence and fall of subsequent human communities. The first pollen grains indicating human activities in the deposits are dated to ca. 6000 cal. BP. The strongest signal comes from the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Pre-Roman Period and the Roman Period. These past societies exploited natural resources and deforested the landscape while actively using fire. We inferred a distinct human influence since ca. 5000 cal. BP (the Neolithic) until the Early Middle Ages with strong evidence during the Bronze Age and Roman Period which demonstrates the high importance of the area until the transition from the tribe period to the Polish state. The peatland possibly recorded several climatic shifts, however the climate change signals were modified by human impacts which actively changed the environmental conditions. 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Increasing the use of forest biomass for energy production is an important mitigation strategy against climate change. Sustainable use of natural resources requires that these policies are evaluated, planned and implemented, taking into account the boundary conditions of the ecological systems affected. This paper describes the development and application of a quantitative modelling framework for evaluating integrated impacts of forest biomass removal scenarios on four key environmental sustainability/ecosystem service indicators: (i) carbon sequestration and balance, (ii) soil nutrient balances (base cations and nitrogen), (iii) nutrient leaching to surface waters (nitrogen and phosphorus), and (iv) dead wood biomass (used as proxy indicator for impacts on species diversity). The system is based on the use of spatial data sets, mass balance calculations, loading coefficients and dynamic modelling. The approach is demonstrated using data from an intensively studied region (Hameenlinna municipality) encompassing the Lammi LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) site in southern Finland. Forest biomass removal scenarios were derived from a management-oriented large-scale forestry model (MELA) based on sample plot and stand-level data from national forest inventories. These scenarios have been developed to guide future Finnish forest management with respect to bioenergy use. Using harvest residues for district heat production reduced fossil carbon emissions but also the carbon sink of forests in the case study area. Calculations of the net removal of base cations of the different scenarios ranged between -36 to -43 meq m(-2) a(-1), indicating that the supply of base cations (soil weathering + deposition) would be enough to sustain also energy-wood harvesting. Greatly increased nutrient removal values and increasing nitrogen limitation problems were however predicted. Clear-cuttings and site preparation were predicted to increase the load of total nitrogen (4.0%) and total phosphorus (4.5%) to surface waters, compared with background leaching. The amount of dead wood has been identified as a key factor for forest species diversity in Finland. A scenario maximising harvest residues used for bioenergy production, would decrease stem dead wood biomass by about 40%, compared with a business-as-usual scenario. Clear trade-off situations could be observed in the case study area between maximising the use of energy-wood and minimising impacts on species diversity, soil carbon and nutrient stores, and nutrient leaching. The developed model system allows seeking for optimised solutions with respect to different management options and sustainability considerations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enchytraeids are important organisms of the soil biocenosis. They improve the soil pore structure and the degradation of organic matter. These organisms are used in standardized testing, using survival and reproduction (6 weeks) as endpoints. The use of biomarkers, linked to ecologically relevant alterations at higher levels of biological organization, is a promising tool for Environmental Risk Assessment Here, enchytraeids were exposed for different time periods (two days and three weeks) to different soils (OECD artificial soil, different compositions in its organic matter, clay or pH value, and LUFA 2.2 natural soil) and different chemicals (Phenmedipham and copper). The main question addressed in the present study was if the effects of chemicals and different soil properties are preceded by alterations at the sub-cellular level, and if these endpoints may be used reliantly as faster screening tools for the assessment of different stress conditions in soils. The parameters measured in E. albidus whole body were: lipid peroxidation (LPO), total glutathione (TG), as well as the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). The results showed that biomarker responses in E. albidus were significantly affected by the soil type (GST CAT, GPx, GR and LPO) and the duration of exposure in OECD artificial soil (GST, GPx, GR, CAT and LPO) but not in LUFA 2.2 natural soil. For the abiotic factors studied, after 2 days, low pH decreased significantly the TG levels and the activities of CAT and GR,and low OM also significantly decreased CAT and GR activities. After 3 weeks, differences in soil properties caused a decrease in GR and GPx activities, whereas increased M activity was observed due to low organic matter and pH. Copper significantly increased the activities of CAT, GPx and GR, and decreased the activity of GST after 2 days as well as inscreasing LPO levels after 3 weeks. Phenmedipham increased LPO levels, associated with increased levels of TG as well as increased activities of CAT and GPx and decreased GST activity after 3 weeks exposure. This study shows that both abiotic and chemical stresses could be followed through biomarker analysis and that some of these determinations are potential endpoints in a quick soil contamination assessment procedure.

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of China's economic construction and urbanization, the large-scale agglomeration of industry and population has caused a series of problems, such as urban environmental pollution, ecological damage and so on. Creating a good human settlements environment is the inevitable requirement of solving ecological environmental problems and the general trend of socially sustainable development. Therefore, how to enhance the living environment in the context of rapid urbanization has become a hot topic of concern to the entire society. This paper takes the Chenggong New District of Kunming City, Yunnan Province, which has developed rapidly in recent years as an example, by combining GIS spatial analysis method, analytic hierarchy process and human settlements environment model, scientific evaluation of the suitability of human settlements in Chenggong New District by selecting natural factor indicators such as terrain fluctuation, climate suitability, hydrological conditions, land cover, and human factors indicators such as transportation, medical facilities and educational facilities. The results show that: (1) Taking into account the geographical environment, humanities and other influencing factors, the suitability of human settlements in Chenggong New District is characterized by widespread suitable areas and more suitable areas. The suitability of human settlements is generally increasing from mountain to hill to then plain. The areas where the habitat environment is apter include Longcheng Street, Dounan Street, Wujiaying Street, and Yuhua Street. Generally suitable areas mainly include Luoyang Street, Luolong Street, Wulong Street, and Qidian Street. (2) Natural factors are the most basic elements affecting the quality of human settlements, and they are also the most closely related elements of mortal habitation, production, and life. The natural factors affecting the suitability of human settlements in Chenggong New District are biological factors including topography, climate, hydrology, and land cover. Human factors such as education, transportation, and medical care have less impact on the suitability of human settlements. Under the background of rapid urbanization, the evaluation of the suitability of urban human settlements can quantitatively analyze the living environment of various areas in Chenggong New District, and provide suggestions and countermeasures for improving the living environment. At the same time, the improvement of the human settlements environment will enhance the urban living environment and the business service activity environment, improve the gathering and radiation ability of many elements such as talents, technology, and funds needed for urban development, and promote the sustainable development of the city.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of Tet(R) tetracycline-resistant bacteria as potential indicators of drug resistance, a parameter of the microbiological quality of river waters in natural reserves which are threatened by man-made pollution. The microbiological assays covered a 15-km long section of the upper reach of the Drweca River (Poland), a part of the European Ecological "Natura 2000" Network of nature protected areas. The quality of the investigated ecosystem was affected by surface runoffs from the river's agricultural catchment as well as outflows from three fish farms. The counts of Tet(R) bacteria, incubated at 14 degrees C and 28 degrees C on TSA medium with sheep blood and tetracycline, were determined in river water samples. The highest counts of both bacterial groups were determined in samples collected from sites behind fish farms. A statistical analysis of the abundance of Tet(R)14 degrees C and Tet(R)28 degrees C bacteria revealed significant differences in the size of Tet(R)28 degrees C populations at the studied sampling sites (p = 0.0011), which is why hemolytic bacteria of this group (HemTet(R)28 degrees C) were selected for further investigations. The predominant strains in the group of 86 HemTet(R)28 degrees C isolates obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were Pseudomonas fluorescens (42 isolates) and Aeromonas hydrophila (28 isolates). Analyses of the identified HemTet(R)28 degrees C strains demonstrated MIC >= 256 mu g/ml in more than 50% isolates. The MAR index of HemTet(R)28 degrees C was in the range of 0.67 at the control site to 1 at sites behind fish farms. The results suggest that tetracycline-resistant bacteria, in particular HemTet(R)28 degrees C, are a reliable indicator of antimicrobial resistance and the microbial quality of surface waters polluted due to human activity. The above can be attributed to several factors: (I) the highest percentage share of HemTet(R)28 degrees C among HPC28 degrees C was noted at sites behind fish farms, (II) tetracycline-resistant bacteria quickly respond to environmental changes, as demonstrated by the high level of resistance to tetracycline and a very high MAR index, and (III) genera/species that are easy to culture under laboratory conditions dominate in the qualitative and quantitative composition of the studied bacteria.

AB  - Root hemiparasites are a specialized group of green photosynthetic plants that obtain resources from the roots of other plants. Some root hemiparasites are considered to be important keystone species in temperate grasslands while others are listed as endangered. In this study, we used vegetation-plot data from the Czech National Phytosociological Database to construct habitat suitability models for root hemiparasites occurring in the Czech Republic. These models were based on a formalized vegetation classification, species co-occurrence patterns in vegetation units and actual presence of hemiparasitic species in the database. The resulting habitat models defined as sets of suitable plots for each species were further described by a climatic gradient, community Ellenberg indicator values and the leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme values characterizing the associated vegetation. Using the properties of each vegetation unit, descriptors of the habitat suitability models and information from experimental studies, we interpreted the habitat suitability models as axes and shapes of ecological niches of individual root-hemiparasitic species. The individual hemiparasites differed in their favoured type of vegetation but almost all types of vegetation in the Czech Republic could host some of them. Semi-natural and natural grasslands with moderate availability of mineral macronutrients and water were identified as types of vegetation with a high incidence of hemiparasites and the highest number of species of hemiparasites. High incidence but low species richness of hemiparasites was recorded in forests and scrub. In contrast, most species of root hemiparasites did not occur in extreme habitats with a high level of stress or disturbance and at nutrient-rich and moist sites dominated by fast-growing species, i.e. at sites with intense above-ground competition. This reflects the ecophysiological fundamentals of the hemiparasitic strategy, which provides efficient yet low-cost access to below-ground abiotic resources. On the one hand, this advantage diminishes at sites where primary macronutrients and soil moisture are abundant but on the other hand, exploitation of this advantage, however, requires non-extreme environmental conditions. Apart from this common pattern, individual species of hemiparasites differ in their ecological requirements, which frequently underlie their possible use as ecosystem engineers in grassland restoration or their conservation status.

AB  - Salinity is a stress factor for benthic invertebrates. Based on a 2-year study of 9 coastal lakes along the southern Baltic Sea, representing freshwater, transitional, and brackish ecosystems, we have shown that benthic fauna was structured by sea water intrusion (=fluctuation of salinity). The increase in salinity gradient resulted in a decreasing trend in the richness and abundance of benthic species, while the diversity showed a slightly positive trend, but below statistical significance (p < 0.05). The abundance of benthic organisms was the highest in brackish costal lakes, where the marine component of fauna was identified. Due to the greatest instability of environmental conditions in lakes periodically linked with the sea (transitional), we found the lowest species number, a-diversity, and abundance, regardless of the season. Salinity appears as a key factor in controlling the functioning of the ecotone (coastal lakes, lagoons) between the marine and terrestrial environments. Salinity is a prerequisite for the proper assessment of the ecological status of coastal lakes and the development of effective methods of protecting coastal lakes.
   Benthic communities were studied in nine Polish coastal lakes of the Baltic Sea; representing three levels of hydrological connection with the sea (isolated, periodically connected, and permanently connected), with resultant differences in salinity (freshwater, transitional, and brackish). The lakes classified in this way allowed us to investigate biodiversity in relation to the degree of environmental pressure. Stress intensity in coastal water bodies, resulting from contrasting marine and terrestrial influences, varied from mild to severe. Spatial variation in environmental predictors affected species richness more strongly than seasonal fluctuations. The broader the spatial salinity gradient, the smaller the species number recorded. Differences in the intensity of natural instability only slightly affected species number and a-diversity. In Baltic coastal lakes, characterized by low salinity (max. 7.5 PSU), benthic faunal communities were dominated by large populations of opportunistic species. This applied primarily to closed systems and those periodically influenced by seawater intrusion. The marine component of fauna played a more important role in increasing the diversity of benthos in permanently open water bodies (brackish). The highest density of benthic fauna was recorded in them, whereas low values were associated with the strongest instability, observed in lakes periodically linked with the sea (transitional).

AB  - The movement of nitrate through the vadose zone has major implications for environmental and human health. This issue is particularly prevalent in karst terrain where agricultural activity, thin soils and dual permeability compound the problem of high nitrate loading to the overlying ecosystem. However, a paucity of records which document vadose zone nitrate concentrations prior to the 21st century render legacy nitrate dynamics, source attribution and baseline conditions to be poorly parameterised. Speleothems growing within karst cave settings may provide an opportunity to obtain records of vadose zone nitrate contamination which extend throughout the anthropogenic era. Here, we use dual isotope analysis of delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) in a contemporary study at Cuevacubio del Llanio, N. Spain, designed to examine the transformation of nitrate between surface to cave environment, taking account of biogeochemical transformation, karst hydrology and partitioning as controls on the delivery of nitrate to the speleothem record. Concentrations of nitrate within speleothem calcite are low (measured range of 0.05 mM to 0.37 mM) due to partitioning (DNO3) across the dripwater-calcite interface. Values of delta N-15(NO3) extracted from cave waters in Cueva-cubio del Llanio (range +2.0 to +7.0 parts per thousand) are shown to be excellent indicators of nitrate source and demonstrate no fractionation during incorporation into speleothem carbonate (range of delta N-15(NO3) in speleothem carbonate +1.6 parts per thousand to +6.4 parts per thousand). Values of delta O-18(NO3) contained within cave waters (range -2.5 parts per thousand to +6.0 parts per thousand) and speleothem carbonate (range +12.3 parts per thousand to +32.3 parts per thousand) reflect a mixed signal of source, biogeochemical processing and hydrological pathway, providing critical insight into the behaviour of the karst aquifer. Contemporary systematics at Cueva-cubio del Llanio therefore confirm speleothem carbonate contains an excellent record of vadose zone nitrate. Analysis of nitrate contained within speleothem carbonate from other regions confirms the ubiquitous nature of partitioning across the water-carbonate interface and the use of speleothem nitrate isotopes for recording surface ecosystem processes and vadose zone behaviour. Application of these principles to dated speleothem records should provide critical timeseries of nitrate loading, enabling understanding and remediation against the presence of vadose zone legacy nitrate.

AB  - South Africa's small pelagics fishery is currently the largest in volume and second largest in value in the southern Benguela. It exploits short-lived, small pelagic fishes such as anchovy (for reduction into fish meal and oil) and sardine (for reduction as well as human consumption through canned products), and to a lesser extent redeye round herring and mesopelagics, largely for reduction. We explore the recent history (1940s to present) of the social-ecological system around this fishery. The natural subsystem, at the scales of the ocean environment and the ecosystem, is characterized by high interannual and documented decadal-scale variability. We characterize the human social subsystem at the scales of the fishing industry, legislation, and west coast fishing towns, and demonstrate interdependencies between the natural and social subsystems by following system-scale changes. The pelagic fishing industry has evolved to deal with variability through consolidation, diversification, and range expansion. Legislation has increasingly looked for conservation of the resource while ensuring economic viability of the industry, and hence factory-and vessel-related jobs. Fishing communities under apartheid stayed largely dependent on company-generated infrastructure, combining seasonal employment in the fishing factories with inshore fishing, targeting rock lobster and line fish. While the pelagic industry persisted and communities survived, the resource base for both offshore and inshore fisheries gradually eroded. The advent of democracy in the mid-1990s brought allocation of long-term fishing rights to individuals or companies under conditions of depleted inshore resources aggravated by a shift in the distribution of pelagic fish away from the west coast towards the Cape south coast in the second half of the 1990s. The resultant loss of employment and fishing rights in the inshore has generated community coping strategies that include poaching and challenges to the current Marine Living Resources Act, while the industry continues to expand by range and species, possibly further eroding the resource base. We argue that the situation in the pelagic social-ecological system is indicative of further loss of resilience to change. Coping with future long-term, system-scale change will necessitate careful long-term scenario planning among the various interest groups involved, joint research being one way to overcome the communications breakdown and initiate the joint planning process.

AB  - Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are declining globally due to environmental degradation and poorly planned resource use. Traditionally, local government agencies have been responsible of the management of natural reserves to preserve biodiversity. Nonetheless, much of these approaches have failed, suggesting the development of more integrative strategies. In order to discuss the importance of a holistic approach in conservation initiatives, coastal and underwater landscape value and biological/environmental indicators of coral reef degradation were assessed using the study case of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero coastal area. This area shelters representative coral reef structures of the Eastern Pacific coast and its terrestrial biodiversity and archaeology enhance the high value of its coastal area. This study explored the landscape value of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems using the geomorphosite approach in two sites on the Zihuatanejo coastal area: Caleta de Chon and Manzanillo Beach. Sedimentation rate, water transparency, chlorophyll and total suspended solids were recorded underwater in each site for environmental characterization. 50 photo-quadrants on five transects were surveyed between 3-4m depth to record coverage (%) of living corals, dead corals, algae, sand and rocks. The conservation status of coral reefs was assessed by the coral mortality index (MI). Landscape values showed that both terrestrial and marine ecosystems had important scientific and aesthetic values, being Manzanillo Beach the site with the highest potential for conservation initiatives (TtV=14.2). However, coral reefs face elevated sedimentation rates (up to 1.16kg/m(2)d) and low water transparency (less of 5m) generated by coastal land use changes that have increased soil erosion in the adjacent coastal area. High coverage of dead corals (23.6%) and algae (up to 29%) confirm the low values in conservation status of coral reefs (MI=0.5), reflecting a poorly-planned management. Current conditions are the result of "top-down" conservation strategies in Zihuatanejo, as Federal and Municipal authorities do not coordinate, disregard local community in coral reef management, and ignore the intimate relationship between the coastal and marine realms. This work confirms the importance of conservation strategies with a holistic approach, considering both terrestrial and marine ecosystems in coastal areas; and that these initiatives should include local coastal communities in management and decision-taking processes done by government authorities.

AB  - Ever increasing attention is being paid to the environmental impact of intensive agricultural practices, and in this context organic farming is gaining recognition as a relatively friendly production system. In general, the risk of harmful environmental effects is lower with organic than with conventional farming methods, though not necessarily so. This review examines organic fanning in the light of European conditions with special regard to recent research findings from Denmark. It specifies the environmental problems caused by modern farming practices and discusses appropriate indicators for assessing their impact. A driving force-state-response (DSR) framework is employed to organise and understand the processes and mechanisms that lie behind the impact of agriculture on nature and the environment. Important groups of environmental indicators are selected that characterise (a) the aquatic environment (nitrate and phosphorus leaching), (b) the soil (organic matter, biology and structure), (c) the ecosystem (arable land, semi-cultivated areas, small biotopes and landscape), and (d) resource usage and balances (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and energy use).
   The paper also reviews several empirical studies. With regard to soil biology, organic farming is usually associated with a significantly higher level of biological activity (bacteria (Monera), fungi (Mycota), springtails (Collembola), mites (Arachnida), earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris)), due to its versatile crop rotations, reduced applications of nutrients, and the ban on pesticides. In most cases there is also a lower surplus of nutrients and less leaching with organic than with conventional farming. However, poor management (e.g., the ploughing of grass and legumes (Fabates) at the wrong time of year with no subsequent crops to capture the mineralised nitrogen), low self-sufficiency in feed, and problems with certain production systems (such as those involved in organic pig farming, i.e., grazing sows, low crop yields), can lead to a high level of leaching in some organic systems. Organic farming is faced with a need to expand and develop in line with increasing demands for organic food and growing environmental concerns. This requires closer attention to the goals, values and principles on which organic practices are based, and more research into the influence of organic farming on different aspects of the environment.

AB  - Intensive urbanization leads to the use of ecologically unfavorable areas for construction. Expensive remediation may not produce the desired results. Risks of boundary ecosystems include pollution, reducing biodiversity, and human health deterioration remains. This applies to the reclaimed sewage filtration fields. The main factor of their environmental hazard before remediation is the sludge rich in organic matter whose decomposition under reducing conditions leads to methane and carbon dioxide accumulation in soils and emission to the atmosphere.
   Large areas of non-operational filtration fields were reclaimed and focused on the creation of residential areas in Moscow, outside the Garden Ring road and the Ring Highway. Conservative properties of technogenic surface-like soil formations (TSF) in parallel with their function were studied. Static soil properties were determined by the standard methods. Activity of bacterial methane formation and oxidation (biological indicators of function) were established using the kinetic methods by soil incubating in sealed vials and escaping or absorption of methane, respectively. Methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in soils and their emission to the atmosphere (gas characteristics of function) were determined by hole shooting method and closed chambers, respectively, with quantitative analysis at the gas chromatograph.
   The ground with sewage silt fragments (GS), Gleyic Technosol (GT), Urbic Technosol (Arenic, Transportic) (UT (AT)), and sandy Urbic Technosol (Humic, Transportic) (UT (HT)) are consistently formed during the reclamation of filtration fields. At the final stage in the greening of built area, Urbic Folic Technosols (UFT) are formed. In summer, CH4 generation decreases 10 times from GS and peat-compost horizons of new UFT to UT (HT), UT (AT), and UFT. Bacterial CH4 oxidation also decreases in the same row, after reducing CH4 content from 1,100-2,600 to 3-4 ppm. There is not enough oxidation intensity in GS and GT where high CH4 emission is observed; in other soils, it is absent. CO2 formation and emission, for an exception of UT (HT), decreases in the same row of soils.
   Greenhouse gases generation, sink and emission, environmental functions of young subaerial soils 0-10 years old, are estimated. Seasonal monitoring revealed the risks of atmosphere pollution by CH4 during the cold period and by CO2-all year. Formed soils don't emit CH4 in summer. Reclamation reduces atmospheric CH4 concentration from 60 to 2-4 ppm. The CO2 content is decreasing in the first years from 0.20 to 0.13-0.18 %, through 10 years-up to 0.08 %.

AB  - Trophic models of three upwelling ecosystems, the southern Benguela (South African), southern Humboldt (Chilean) and northern Humboldt (Peruvian) systems, have been fitted to catch, abundance and fishing mortality time-series. Three drivers were considered during the model fitting: internal forcing by means of the trophic flow controls between the various interacting species groups, and two kinds of external forcing, namely fishing and the environment. The southern Benguela model was fitted to time-series data from 1978 to 2003, the southern Humboldt model to data from 1970 to 2004, and the northern Humboldt to data for a shorter period, 1995-2004. Fishing has been relatively carefully managed in the southern Benguela during the period modelled and previous studies found that most of the resource variability was attributed to internal trophodynamic forcing and to environmental forcing rather than to fishing. By comparison, fishing has been shown to have played a relatively major role in driving ecosystem changes observed in the southern and northern Humboldt models. Bearing in mind the different roles played by each of the drivers in these ecosystems, flow controls between interacting species groups, which improved the fits of the models, were compared across the three ecosystems to determine to what extent the three models supported the hypothesis that upwelling ecosystems function as wasp-waist systems. Secondly, environmental forcing was examined by searching for hypothetical forcing functions, affecting different levels of the foodweb, which improved the model fits. This was an attempt to start to uncover the processes that may be involved in linking the environment to observed ecosystem dynamics and changes in these upwelling ecosystems. Model results confirmed the important ecological role played by small pelagic fish in the studied upwelling ecosystems. For example, the fit of the southern Benguela model to time-series data of catch and abundance was similarly improved when anchovy/sardine-prey and anchovy/sardine-predator interactions were externally forced, supporting the wasp-waist hypothesis. In addition, although physical drivers and conditions may differ in their nature or merely their frequency and intensity between systems, and different fishing strategies operate in each of the three ecosystems, model results suggest that these effects are transferred through the ecosystems and manifest themselves as ecosystem changes and observed resource dynamics largely via interactions with small pelagic fish.

AB  - There is currently great interest in improving the applicability of forest gap models to changing environmental conditions, in order to facilitate the assessment of possible impacts of climatic change on forest ecosystems. Moreover, for the development of mitigation strategies, it is necessary to include forest management options in the models. Both the simulation of transient effects of climatic change and of forest management regimes require a realistic representation of stand structure in gap models, since tree species respond to variations in stand density in characteristic ways, depending on their ecological strategies.
   In this study, we compared the effect of five different height growth functions that are sensitive to stand density on simulated stand structure of the FORSKA forest gap model. We used long term observation data from a beech thinning trial at Fabrikschleichach, Bavaria, to test the alternative functions. First, we compared simulation results of the original FORSKA model with measured stand development from 1870 to 1990. Whereas simulated stand level variables (e.g. biomass, mean diameter and height) showed good correspondence with observations, individual tree dimensions and simulated stand structure were quite unrealistic. After calibrating parameters of the height growth functions with data from a lightly thinned plot at Fabrikschleichach, we ran the model with data from a heavily thinned plot for validation. All five functions considerably improved the simulation of height/diameter relationships and stand structure. However, there were distinct differences between functions. The best correspondence with measurements was shown by a function which uses the relative radiation intensity in the centre of a tree crown as an indicator of the competition status of the tree. This function is rather simple and needs only two growth parameters, which can be derived for different functional types of species, according to their shade tolerance.
   With the new, flexible height growth function it should be possible to extend the applicability of gap models to more realistic simulation experiments including forest management and natural disturbances. To our knowledge, this was the first attempt to employ long term forest observation data for the calibration and validation of a forest gap model. The results suggest that such data could be very useful in model testing and improvement. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Understanding ecological benefits is one of the key questions related to the stability and sustainable development of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). However, ecological benefits assessment in the TGRA in Chongqing has not been quantified and assessed effectively. This study constructed the assessment system of ecological benefits for the follow-up development of the TGRA in Chongqing, on three aspects of society, economy and environment, based on the regional characteristics and development status of the Chongqing section of the TGRA. By using entropy technology and a grey model to revise the indicators weight value determined by traditional analytic hierarchy process, an ecological benefit assessment model is constructed based on fuzzy mathematics. Afterwards, the ecological benefits of the Chongqing section in the TGRA from 2009 to 2015 are comprehensively evaluated. The results include the following. (1) The ecological benefits of the east of the middle area of TGRA are higher than that of the upper area. The spatial distribution of the ecological benefits shows a gradual decreasing trend from northeast to southwest. (2) The ecological benefit level of the Chongqing section in the TGRA is in poor to good condition, and there are no bad or excellent assessment levels. (3) From 2009 to 2015, the number of counties with a good assessment level increased from 1 to 5, the number of counties with moderate assessment level increased from 12 to 15, while the number of counties with poor assessment level decreased from 9 to 2. (4) The ecological benefits of 16 counties show an increasing trend, while the other six counties show a decreasing trend in the Chongqing section in the TGRA from 2009 to 2015. There are 19 counties, including six counties with decreasing ecological benefits and 13 of 16 counties with increasing ecological benefits, which are not coordinated in the development of environment, social and economic benefits. These findings indicate that the ecological benefits of the Chongqing section of the TGRA are improving year by year, while unstable factors exist at the same time. To ensure the steady improvement of ecological benefits in the Chongqing section of the TGRA, the follow-up development of the reservoir area needs to further adjust the development mode of the society, economy and environment.

AB  - Rehabilitation and restoration of forest ecosystems are in growing demand to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification major environmental problems of our time. Interest in restoration of ecosystems is increasingly translated into strong political commitment to large-scale tree planting projects. Along with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks: opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species, and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material, which though it may provide forest cover in the short term, will not likely establish a self-sustaining ecosystem. The value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers. However, insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species, their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment. Also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change. Measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe, neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term. In this article, we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species, with a particular focus on genetic considerations. Our discussion is organised across three themes: (i) species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material; (ii) increasing resilience by fostering natural selection, ecological connectivity and species associations; and (iii) measuring the success of restoration activities. We present a number of practical recommendations for researchers, policymakers and restoration practitioners to increase the potential for successful interventions. We recommend the development and adoption of decision-support tools for: (i) collecting and propagating germplasm in a way that ensures a broad genetic base of restored tree populations, including planning the sourcing of propagation material of desired species well before the intended planting time; (ii) matching species and provenances to restoration sites based on current and future site conditions, predicted or known patterns of variation in adaptive traits and availability of seed sources; and (iii) landscape-level planning in restoration projects.

AB  - Urban landscapes are highly fragmented (leading to the extinction of native species) as well as transformed and disturbed (creating novel environments). Such conditions provide non-native species with opportunities to establish and spread through "urban green areas" (UGAs). UGAs can serve as stepping stones for many alien species to recruit and may become sources of propagules to launch invasions in adjoining natural ecosystems. There is great diversity in the spatial structures of UGAs worldwide; these are determined by the city's level of development, human density, urban planning policy, and history. We explore the invasion risks of, and the potential of invasive spread in, UGAs in the world's 100 most populous cities (in 40 countries). Based on maps of enhanced vegetation index at 250 m resolution over the extent of 25 by 25 km for each city centre, we simulate the invasion and spread of a reference species (a virtual ruderal invasive species) from the city centre into surrounding urban or rural areas. Doing so allowed us to provide an objective baseline for comparing urban susceptibility to such invasions across diverse cultures, histories and societies. We derive the global ranking of invasive spread potential for each city based on the rate of spread of the reference species, and the ranking of 40 countries, based on the average rate of spread in their cities. We explore correlates of spread rates after 100 time steps (years) by examining the roles of climate (mean annual temperature and rainfall), human demography (city population size and growth rate), and socio-economic indicators [human footprint, human development index and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita]. Small city population size and high GDP per capita are the only significant predictors of high potential for invasive spread. Among the G20 countries, Canada, South Korea, South Africa, France, USA and Brazil all feature in the top-10 countries, and Atlanta, Washington, D.C. and Dallas in the USA, Chittagong in Bangladesh, Toronto in Canada and Brasilia in Brazil are listed among the top 10 cities overall. Our results can serve as a global baseline assessment of invasive spread risks through UGAs, and call for improved protocols for monitoring, planning and management of UGAs.

AB  - Coastal North Carolina experienced 36 tropical cyclones (TCs), including three floods of historical significance in the past two decades (Hurricanes Floyd-1999, Matthew-2016 and Florence-2018). These events caused catastrophic flooding and major alterations of water quality, fisheries habitat and ecological conditions of the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound (APS), the second largest estuarine complex in the United States. Continuous rainfall records for coastal NC since 1898 reveal a period of unprecedented high precipitation storm events since the late-1990s. Six of seven of the "wettest" storm events in this > 120-year record occurred in the past two decades, identifying a period of elevated precipitation and flooding associated with recent TCs. We examined storm-related freshwater discharge, carbon (C) and nutrient, i.e., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings, and evaluated contributions to total annual inputs in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), a major sub-estuary of the APS. These contributions were highly significant, accounting for > 50% of annual loads depending on antecedent conditions and storm-related flooding. Depending on the magnitude of freshwater discharge, the NRE either acted as a "processor" to partially assimilate and metabolize the loads or acted as a "pipeline" to transport the loads to the APS and coastal Atlantic Ocean. Under base-flow, terrestrial sources dominate riverine carbon. During storm events these carbon sources are enhanced through the inundation and release of carbon from wetlands. These findings show that event-scale discharge plays an important and, at times, predominant role in C, N and P loadings. We appear to have entered a new climatic regime characterized by more frequent extreme precipitation events, with major ramifications for hydrology, cycling of C, N and P, water quality and habitat conditions in estuarine and coastal waters.

AB  - A benthic-pelagic mesocosm experiment was performed to study how the benthic macrofaunal community responds to a eutrophication gradient. The novel experimental setup allowed the induction of an eutrophication gradient in the water column and the detailed documentation of the response of the benthos in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Nine mesocosms were deployed in the facilities of the Hellenic Center for Marine Research in Crete in the eastern Mediterranean. The mesocosms were 4 m deep, contained 1.5 m(3) coastal water, and included 85 liters of undisturbed sediment at the bottom. No water or sediment exchange was allowed. The experimental design included a Control and two eutrophication levels (Low and High) for the 58-day duration of the experiment. Macrofaunal samples were collected at the end of the experiment from each mesocosm and compared to the ones collected at the beginning of the experiment from the sediment collection area. Results show that the High eutrophication treatment differed significantly from the Control and Low treatments in terms of macrofaunal species composition, diversity, ecological status and ecosystem processes. The increased availability of organic matter in the sediment caused differences in macrofaunal community structure by favoring deposit feeding species with high bioturbation ability, which significantly increased their abundance. The increased bioturbation potential of the new community combined with the high organic matter consumption contributed to the oxygenation of the sediment within the mesocosm, preventing the creation of hypoxic conditions in the sediment and maintaining ecosystem health despite the highly eutrophic conditions and significant changes in sediment geochemical variables. In the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean, healthy benthic ecosystems may use existing ecosystem processes to "buffer" the negative effects caused by eutrophication.

AB  - One goal of regional-scale sample surveys is to estimate the status of a resource of interest from a statistically drawn representative sample of that resource. An expression of status is the frequency distribution of indicator scores capturing variability of attributes of interest. However, extraneous variability interferes with the status description by introducing bias into the frequency distributions. To examine this issue, we used data from a regional survey of lakes in the Northeast U. S. collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). We employ a components of variance model to identify sources of extraneous variance pertinent to status descriptions of physical, chemical, and biological attributes of the population of lakes in the NE. We summarize the relative magnitude of four components of variance (lake-to-lake, year, interaction, and residual) for each indicator and illustrate how extraneous variance biases the status descriptions. We describe a procedure that removes this bias from the status descriptions to produce unbiased estimates and introduce a novel method for estimating the 'cost' of removing the bias (expressed as either increased sampling uncertainty or additional samples needed to achieve the target precision in the absence of bias). We compare the relative magnitude of the four variance components across the array of indicators, finding in general that conservative chemical indicators are least affected by extraneous variance, followed by some nonconservative indicators, with nutrient indicators most affected by extraneous variance. Intermediate were trophic condition indicators (including sediment diatoms), fish species richness and individuals indicators, and zooplankton taxa richness and individuals indicators. We found no clear patterns in the relative magnitude of variance components as a function of several methods of aggregating fish and zooplankton indicators (e.g., level of taxonomy, or species richness vs. numbers of individuals).

AB  - One of the most dramatic episodes of sustained diversification of marine ecosystems in Earth history took place during the Early to Middle Ordovician Period. Changes in climate, oceanographic conditions, and trophic structure are hypothesised to have been major drivers of these biotic events, but relatively little is known about the composition and stability of marine microbial communities controlling biogeochemical cycles at the base of the food chain. This study examines well-preserved, carbonate-rich strata spanning the Tremadocian through Upper Dapingian stages from the Oslobreen Group in Spitsbergen, Norway. Abundant bacterial lipid markers (elevated hopane/sterane ratios, average = 4.8; maximum of 13.1), detection of Chlorobi markers in organic-rich strata, and bulk nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15(total)) averaging 0 to -1 parts per thousand for the open marine facies, suggest episodes of water column redox-stratification and that primary production was likely limited by fixed nitrogen availability in the photic zone. Near absence of the C-30 sterane marine algal biomarker, 24-n-propylcholestane (24-npc), in most samples supports and extends the previously observed hiatus of 24-npc in Early Paleozoic (Late Cambrian to Early Silurian) marine environments. Very high abundances of 3 beta-methylhopanes (average = 9.9%; maximum of 16.8%), extends this biomarker characteristic to Early Ordovician strata for the first time and may reflect enhanced and sustained marine methane cycling during this interval of fluctuating climatic and low sulfate marine conditions. Olenid trilobite fossils are prominent in strata deposited during an interval of marine transgression with biomarker evidence for episodic euxinia/anoxia extending into the photic zone of the water column.

AB  - A physical, chemical and biological characterisation of river systems is needed to evaluate their ecological quality and establish restoration programs. Aquatic benthic macroinvertebrates have proven to be among the most reliable and cost-effective assessment tools for water and habitat quality in streams throughout the world. During one year of seasonal surveys, the state of the Febros River and one of its tributaries, Jaca Creek, were evaluated in terms of habitat, physical, chemical and biological water quality, using benthic macroinvertebrates as ecological indicators. These watercourses suffer pollution from agriculture, industry and urban areas. Both watercourses were moderately to severely degraded, showing spatial and temporal variability in macroinvertebrate communities and water quality. The overall poor river conditions were particularly bad in the upper part of Jaca Creek, which is affected by industry. This upriver site showed higher temperatures, conductivity and dissolved solids than all other sites studied. The best conditions were found in the Gala Biological Park area, where the habitat quality was evaluated to be high and biotic indices indicated excellent and good water quality in the spring and summer, respectively. However, even this site had biological indicator scores denoting severe degradation in autumn and winter. Macroinvertebrate diversity was low, with populations dominated by pollution-tolerant taxa like Chironomids, particularly in the summer and autumn samples. Abundances were mostly higher in the spring and lower in winter. Percentages of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera (EPT) were low (totalling 31 % on average), and Plecoptera was completely absent in the samples. The EPT percentage and the percentage of Chironomidae were related to temperature and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). In comparison to earlier studies, the Febros River improved in both habitat and biological quality. The present study should help to identify specific measures necessary to restore habitat and water quality to reference conditions.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are important environmental indicators of heavy-metal contaminants in marine environments because of their unique sensitivity to environmental change. However, this sensitivity can make parsing the effect of contaminants from other factors such as salinity and temperature difficult. To address this problem, this study individually compares the effects of heavy metals nickel and zinc on temperate rotalids and subtropical miliolids under different temperature and salinity regimes, including intermediate (22 degrees C, 32 psu), elevated temperature (30 degrees C, 32 psu), reduced temperature (18 degrees C, 32 psu), elevated salinity (22 degrees C, 40 psu), and reduced salinity (22 degrees C, 12 psu). Assemblages of foraminifera were grown experimentally from propagules (small juveniles) collected from two shallow marine sites: Sapelo Island, Georgia, and Little Duck Key, Florida. Surface sediment was collected from both locations and sieved immediately after collection. Using the propagule method, assemblages of foraminifera were grown in a controlled setting from propagules in these sediment samples. Either nickel or zinc was added to each assemblage. Experimental conditions were held constant with only metal concentration, salinity, and temperature varying.
   Exposure to elevated concentrations of nickel and zinc led to limited foraminiferal abundances compared to the controls under all temperatures and salinity conditions examined. In addition, high concentrations of nickel and especially zinc resulted in an increase of deformed tests of Sapelo Island foraminifera under intermediate (22 degrees C, 32 psu) and high salinity (22 degrees C, 40 psu) conditions. Far fewer deformities occurred in Sapelo Island assemblages in higher or lower salinities and temperatures. These results support the usefulness of foraminiferal abundance and species abundance as tools for environmental analysis. Consistent with previous work, results also identify the problems associated with using test deformities alone as a bioindicator tool.

AB  - The population dynamics of Antarctic seabirds are influenced by variations in winter sea ice extent and persistence; however, the type of relationship differs according to the region and the demographic parameter considered. We used annual presence/absence data obtained from 1,138 individually marked birds to study the influence of environmental and individual characteristics on the survival of Ad,lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica) between 1994 and 2005. About 25% of 600 birds marked as chicks were reobserved at the natal colony. The capture and survival rates of Ad,lie penguins at this colony increased with the age of individuals, and five age classes were identified for both parameters. Mean adult survival was 0.85 (SE = 0.01), and no effect of sex on survival was evident. Breeding propensity, as measured by adult capture rates, was close to one, indicating a constant breeding effort through time. Temporal variations in survival were best explained by a quadratic relationship with winter sea ice extent anomalies in the Ross Sea, suggesting that for this region optimal conditions are intermediate between too much and too little winter sea ice. This is likely the result of a balance between suitable wintering habitat and food availability. Survival rates were not correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. Low adult survival after a season characterized by severe environmental conditions at breeding but favorable conditions during winter suggested an additional mortality mediated by the reproductive effort. Ad,lie penguins are sensitive indicators of environmental changes in the Antarctic, and the results from this study provide insights into regional responses of this species to variability in winter sea ice habitat.

AB  - Urgency of the research. An important condition for the development of the region is taking into account natural resource potential and its particular usage, because it is linked to efficient economy of the region.
   Target setting. Under modern conditions of economic management and Ukraine's striving toward Europe, the significant environmental improvement as well as smart use of natural resources system integration have not been realized. All this determined the choice of the specific topic of the research paper, formed the subject, the purpose and the target of the research.
   Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. Economic aspects of the use of the natural resources potential have been researched in studies of the established national scientists, especially of V. A. Holian [1], A. S. Kycha [5], A. P. Nezhyvenko [8], Y. B. Oliinyk [10], M. A. Khvesyk [13], L. M. Cherchyk [14] and others. Such foreign scientists as D. Wardle and M. Jonsson [17], A. Zielinska [19].
   Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. There is much tension around the issue of smart use of natural resources potential of Ukraine, particularly true it is observed under current crisis conditions caused by the troubled political and subsequently economic situation in the country.
   The statement of basic materials. The article analyzes the natural-resource potential of the Rivne region. The basic allocation of natural resources has been demonstrated. The SWOT-analysis of the use of natural resources potential of Rivne region have been completed.
   Conclusions. Rivne region is rich on different mineral deposits causing some differences in the economy development. The occurrence of the unique in Ukraine amber deposit has caused many economic and political problems relating to its unlawful extraction. The losses for the economy and budget of Ukraine due to this are estimated at 20 billion US dollars yearly.

AB  - Nanomaterials have revolutionized modern science and technology due to their multiple applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, and biomedicine. Nevertheless, the use and manipulation of nanoparticles (NPs) can bring serious damages to living organisms and their ecosystems. For this reason, ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays are of special interest in order to determine the potential harmful effects of NPs. Processes based on ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity tests can significantly consume time and financial resources. In this sense, alternative approaches such as quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationships (QSAR/QSTR) modeling have provided important insights for the better understanding of the biological behavior of NPs that may be responsible for causing toxicity. Until now, QSAR/QSTR models have predicted ecotoxicity or cytotoxicity separately against only one organism (bioindicator species or cell line) and have not reported information regarding the quantitative influence of characteristics other than composition or size. In this work, we developed a unified QSTR-perturbation model to simultaneously probe ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity of NPs under different experimental conditions, including diverse measures of toxicities, multiple biological targets, compositions, sizes and conditions to measure those sizes, shapes, times during which the biological targets were exposed to NPs, and coating agents. The model was created from 36488 cases (NP-NP pairs) and exhibited accuracies higher than 98% in both training and prediction sets. The model was used to predict toxicities of several NPs that were not included in the original data set. The results of the predictions suggest that the present QSTR-perturbation model can be employed as a highly promising tool for the fast and efficient assessment of ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity of NPs.

AB  - Understanding the factors that drive the global distribution of alien species is a pivotal issue in invasion biology. Here, we used data on naturalized conifers (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) from sixty temperate and subtropical regions and five continents to test how environmental and socio-economic conditions of recipient areas as well as introduction efforts affect naturalization probabilities. We collated 18 predictor variables for each region describing environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic conditions as well as a measure of the macro-climatic match with the species' native ranges, and the extent to which alien conifers are used in commercial forestry. Naturalization probabilities across all species and regions were then related to these predictor variables by means of generalized linear mixed models.
   For both Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, naturalization probabilities were generally higher in the Southern Hemisphere, and increased with indicators of habitat diversity of the recipient region. The match in macro-climatic conditions between the native and introduced regions was a significant predictor of conifer naturalization, but socio-economic variables were less powerful predictors. Only for Cupressaceae did a socio-economic variable (human population density) affect naturalization probabilities. Key attributes facilitating naturalization were related to introduction effort. Moreover, usage in commercial forestry generally fostered naturalization, although the actual size of alien conifer plantations in a region was only correlated with the naturalization of Pinaceae.
   Our results suggest that climate matching, habitat diversity and introduction effort co-determine the probability of naturalization, which additionally, is modulated by biogeographic features of the recipient area, such as incidence of natural enemies or competitors. To date, the most widely used tools for invasive plant risk assessment only account for climate match and rarely factor in other attributes of the recipient environment. Future tools should additionally consider biotic environment and introduction effort if risk assessment is to be effective.

AB  - Marine oxygen-deficient environments with high sedimentation rates and high primary productivity can provide relevant information regarding variations of ocean-climatic conditions in the past. In the Humboldt current ecosystem, which now hosts huge populations of pelagic fishes (mainly anchovy and sardine), fish scale abundance in the sedimentary record may be useful indicators of environmental change. Here we assess such a proxy record in a 42 cm-long sedimentary core collected from 80 min Mejillones Bay (23 degrees S, northern Chile). We also analyse fish remains in surface sediment sampled along a bathymetric transect (from 10 to 110 to water depth) in the same bay. In the core-top record, the fluctuations of sardine and anchovy scale deposition rates (SDR) agreed with those of industrial catches for these two species in northern Chile, tending to validate the SDR as a proxy of local fish biomass when bottom anoxic conditions prevail. However, apparent SDR for records prior to 1820 have probably been influenced by dissolution processes linked to the oxygenation of the bottom environment of Mejillones Bay, as suggested by other proxy records. After 1820, the fluctuations in the relative abundance of sardine and anchovy scales point to alternating warm and cold conditions during about 30 years and then a progressively cooler period. Since ca. 1870, marked fluctuations of SDR of both species are observed, probably as a consequence of the onset of a different oceanographic regime characterized by intensified upwelling, stronger subsurface oxygen deficiency, higher primary productivity, and enhanced "ENSO-like" interdecadal variability. While anchovy SDR fluctuated in periods of 25-40 years, only two peak periods of sardine SDR occurred (late 19th century and late 20th century), suggesting that sardine abundance depends on other ocean-climatic factors.

AB  - In the context of global warming, extreme drought events have occurred more frequently and this is projected to continue in the future in many parts of the world. However, their ecological consequences on shallow lakes are not well studied. Here we compare the succession of diatom assemblages of two medium-sized shallow lakes in southwest China during the past similar to 70 years, comprising an extreme drought event between similar to 2009 and similar to 2013. The diatom community of Lake Chahei showed a clear response to eutrophication from similar to 1980. The pioneer species Achnanthes minutissima increased strongly with elevated sedimentary total nitrogen content and at the expense of Epithemia sorex. In contrast, the diatom community of Lake Yuxian was stable and constantly dominated by the Fragilaria construens/pinnata complex. For both lakes, the most striking change occurred with the extreme drought event when environmental conditions and diatom compositions were homogenised. With strongly shrinking lake areas, peaks in the proportion of silt were observed in the sediments, suggesting increased particle burial rates and decreased light availability. These conditions selected for motile and presumably heterotrophic species mainly of the genera Navicula and Nitzschia which exhibited abrupt increases in their relative abundances at both lakes. Meanwhile, the degree of community homogeneity (inferred by Jaccard's similarity index) of the formerly distinct diatom assemblages increased strongly between both lakes. Hence, the extreme drought event has overridden and homogenised previous abiotic conditions and led to a decrease in beta diversity between the two study sites. Navicula and Nitzschia species may be reliable (paleo) indicators for extreme drought events in comparable shallow lake systems.

AB  - Introduction The impact of work-related musculoskeletal disorders is considerable. The assessment of work tasks with physical workloads is crucial to estimate the work-related health risks of exposed employees. Three key indicator methods are available for risk assessment regarding manual lifting, holding and carrying of loads; manual pulling and pushing of loads; and manual handling operations. Three further KIMs for risk assessment regarding whole-body forces, awkward body postures and body movement have been developed de novo. In addition, the development of a newly drafted combined method for mixed exposures is planned. All methods will be validated regarding face validity, reliability, convergent validity, criterion validity and further aspects of utility under practical conditions.
   Methods and analysis As part of the joint project MEGAPHYS (multilevel risk assessment of physical workloads), a mixed-methods study is being designed for the validation of KIMs and conducted in companies of different sizes and branches in Germany. Workplaces are documented and analysed by observations, applying KIMs, interviews and assessment of environmental conditions. Furthermore, a survey among the employees at the respective workplaces takes place with standardised questionnaires, interviews and physical examinations. It is intended to include 1200 employees at 120 different workplaces. For analysis of the quality criteria, recommendations of the COSMIN checklist (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) will be taken into account.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was planned and conducted in accordance with the German Medical Professional Code and the Declaration of Helsinki as well as the German Federal Data Protection Act. The design of the study was approved by ethics committees. We intend to publish the validated KIMs in 2018. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at international meetings and disseminated to actual users for practical application.

AB  - As coral bleaching events become more frequent and intense, our ability to predict and mitigate future events depends upon our capacity to interpret patterns within previous episodes. Responses to thermal stress vary among coral species; however the diversity of coral assemblages, environmental conditions, assessment protocols, and severity criteria applied in the global effort to document bleaching patterns creates challenges for the development of a systemic metric of taxon-specific response. Here, we describe and validate a novel framework to standardize bleaching response records and estimate their measurement uncertainties. Taxon-specific bleaching and mortality records (2036) of 374 coral taxa (during 1982-2006) at 316 sites were standardized to average percent tissue area affected and a taxon-specific bleaching response index (taxon-BRI) was calculated by averaging taxon-specific response over all sites where a taxon was present. Differential bleaching among corals was widely variable (mean taxon-BRI=25.06 +/- 18.44%, +/- SE). Coral response may differ because holobionts are biologically different (intrinsic factors), they were exposed to different environmental conditions (extrinsic factors), or inconsistencies in reporting (measurement uncertainty). We found that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have comparable influence within a given site and event (60% and 40% of bleaching response variance of all records explained, respectively). However, when responses of individual taxa are averaged across sites to obtain taxon-BRI, differential response was primarily driven by intrinsic differences among taxa (65% of taxon-BRI variance explained), not conditions across sites (6% explained), nor measurement uncertainty (29% explained). Thus, taxon-BRI is a robust metric of intrinsic susceptibility of coral taxa. Taxon-BRI provides a broadly applicable framework for standardization and error estimation for disparate historical records and collection of novel data, allowing for unprecedented accuracy in parameterization of mechanistic and predictive models and conservation plans.

AB  - Since adoption of the policy of reform and opening-up in 1978, China has achieved spectacular success in economic growth, which mainly driven by abundant consumption of natural resources and resulted in serious environmental problems. Based on Emergy approach and Rescaled Range analysis, this paper aims to examine the decoupling condition in economic growth nexus environmental pressure both at specific and aggregate level and track the changing trend and the corresponding socio-economic cost in decoupling process. The results show that: the decoupling performance of waste emission (includes waste water, SO2 and solid waste) is better than energy consumption at a specific level which implies that the policies focused on end-of-pipe treatment has been succeeded in meeting the targets of emission reduction. But at aggregate level, the situation is opposite which suggest that China need more efforts in life-cycle management. The weak decoupling condition of resource use and waste water discharge may continue in the future, so as the strong decoupling condition of SO2 and solid waste, but for the aggregate environmental pressure induced by waste emission, the decoupling performance may be getting worse in the future. The investment cost of decoupling increased, whilst the job-cost of decoupling decreased. The decoupling performance can be influenced by environmental policies substantially, such as the polices of circular economy, rigorous emission reduction and waste recycling which have brought about the strong decoupling of SO2 emission and solid waste discharge from economic growth, whereas the less rigorous policies on resource exploitation and waste water discharge didn't achieve the same result. Therefore, China needs to intensify the unity among various environmental policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Worldwide, flow regimes are being modified by various anthropogenic impacts and climate change induces an additional risk. Rising temperatures, declining snow cover and changing precipitation patterns will interact differently at different locations. Consequently, in distinct climate zones, unequal consequences can be expected in matters of water stress, flood risk, water quality, and food security. In particular, river ecosystems and their vital ecosystem services will be compromised as their species richness and composition have evolved over long time under natural flow conditions. This study aims at evaluating the exclusive impacts of climate change on river flow regimes in Europe. Various flow characteristics are taken into consideration and diverse dynamics are identified for each distinct climate zone in Europe. In order to simulate present-day natural flow regimes and future flow regimes under climate change, the global hydrology model WaterGAP3 is applied. All calculations for current and future conditions (2050s) are carried out on a 5' x 5' European grid. To address uncertainty, bias-corrected climate forcing data of three different global climate models are used to drive WaterGAP3. Finally, the hydrological alterations of different flow characteristics are quantified by the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration approach. Results of our analysis indicate that on the European scale, climate change can be expected to modify flow regimes remarkably. This is especially the case in the Mediterranean (due to drier conditions with reduced precipitation across the year) and in the boreal climate zone (due to reduced snowmelt, increased precipitation, and strong temperature rises). In the temperate climate zone, impacts increase from oceanic to continental. Regarding single flow characteristics, strongest impacts on timing were found for the boreal climate zone. This applies for both high and low flows. Flow magnitudes, in turn, will be predominantly altered in the Mediterranean but also in the Northern climates. At the end of this study, typical future flow regimes under climate change are illustrated for each climate zone.

AB  - Empirical growth and yield models developed from historical data are commonly used in developing long-term strategic forest management plans. Use of these models rests on an assumption that there will be no future change in the tree growing environment. However, major impacts on forest growing conditions are expected to occur with climate change. As a result, there is a pressing need for tools capable of incorporating outcomes of climate change in their predictions of forest growth and yield. Process-based models have this capability and may, therefore, help to satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of an ecological, individual-tree-based model (JABOWA-3) in generating forest growth and yield projections for diverse forest conditions across Nova Scotia, Canada. Model prediction accuracy was analyzed statistically by comparing modelled with observed basal area and merchantable volume changes for 35 permanent sample plots (PSPs) measured over periods of at least 25 years. Generally, modelled basal area and merchantable volume agreed fairly well with observed data, yielding coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.97 and 0.94 and model efficiencies (ME) of 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. A Chi-square test was performed to assess model accuracy with respect to changes in species composition. We found that 83% of species-growth trajectories based on measured basal area were adequately modelled with JABOWA-3 (P > 0.9). Model-prediction accuracy, however, was substantially reduced for those PSPs altered by some level of disturbance. In general, JABOWA-3 is much better at providing forest yield predictions, subject to the availability of suitable climatic and soil information.

AB  - Few studies have demonstrated changes in community structure along a contaminant plume in terms of phylogenetic, functional, and geochemical changes, and such studies are essential to understand how a microbial ecosystem responds to perturbations. Clonal libraries of multiple genes (SSU rDNA, nirK, nirS, amoA, pmoA, and dsrAB) were analyzed from groundwater samples (n = 6) that varied in contaminant levels, and 107 geochemical parameters were measured. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to compare the relationships among the sites with respect to the biomarker (n = 785 for all sequences) distributions and the geochemical variables. A major portion of the geochemical variance measured among the samples could be accounted for by tetra chloroethene, Tc-99, NO3, SO4, Al, and Th. The PCA based on the distribution of unique biomarkers resulted in different groupings compared to the geochemical analysis, but when the SSU rRNA gene libraries were directly compared (Delta C-xy values) the sites were clustered in a similar fashion compared to geochemical measures. The PCA based upon functional gene distributions each predicted different relationships among the sites, and comparisons of Euclidean distances based upon diversity indices for all functional genes (n = 432) grouped the sites by extreme or intermediate contaminant levels. The data suggested that the sites with low and high perturbations were functionally more similar than sites with intermediate conditions, and perhaps captured the overall community structure better than a single phylogenetic biomarker. Moreover, even though the background site was phylogenetically and geochemically distinct from the acidic sites, the extreme conditions of the acidic samples might be more analogous to the limiting nutrient conditions of the background site. An understanding of microbial community-level responses within an ecological framework would provide better insight for restoration strategies at contaminated field sites.

AB  - The article is devoted to the "criminal anomie" conceptualization. Anomic crime is widespread in modern Russia. In Western sociology the anomical premise of crime has long been studied. The author describes a number of conditions that facilitate the growth or reduction of crimes in order to determine which social preconditions have the greatest impact on the growth of illegal behavior. To verify these conditions, he refers to the analysis of official statistics on crime, divorce, suicide, poverty, etc. for each region of the country. Descriptive statistics made it possible to show that Russia is characterized by high rates of anomie. Anomie in the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts is much higher then in the European territory of the country. Correlation analysis indicates the growth of crime in the spread of unemployment, divorce, as well as alcoholism and drug addiction of the population. Crime reduces with favorable environmental conditions. The high number of policemen does not reduce crime. Cluster analysis allowed to obtain typology of subjects of the country in terms of indicators of anomic crime. Six clusters are distinguished: the first (30 regions) is characterized by anomie growth, the second (8 regions) is characterized by the highest anomia indicators, the third (36 subjects) is relatively prosperous, the fourth (2 subjects) includes Moscow and St. Petersburg, the fifth (7 regions) embraces republics of the North Caucasus, the sixth (2 subjects) includes unfavorable the Magadan and Chukotka Regions. Cluster analysis showed that one cannot talk about common factors of crime in different regions of the country. To identify the criminogenic factors, a regression analysis was carried out, revealing a number of factors of anomic crime: an increase in the number of unemployed; urbanization; alcoholization of the population; the spread of drug addiction; degradation of the ecological situation; inflow of migrants.

AB  - We analyzed the phytoplankton present in the lower sector of the Salado River (Buenos Aires, Argentina) for 10years (1995-2005) and detected significant changes occurring in chlorophyte abundance and species richness during La Nina event (1998-1999), which period was analyzed throughout the entire basin (main stream and tributaries). We compared the physicochemical and biologic variables between two El Nino-La Nina-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) periods - El Nino (March 1997-January 1998) and La Nina (May 1998-May 1999) - to identify possible indicators of a relationship between climatic anomalies and chlorophyte performance. Chlorophyte density increased during the La Nina. Under normal or extreme hydrologic conditions, mobile (Chlamydomonas spp.) and nonmobile (Monoraphidium spp.) chlorophytes codominated. These species belonged to Reynolds's functional groups X1 and X2, those typical of nutrient-enriched environments. Comparative analyses between El Nino and La Nina periods indicated significant differences in physicochemical (K+, dissolved polyphenols, particulate reactive phosphorus, alkalinity, pH) and biologic (species diversity and richness, phytoplankton and chlorophyte total densities) variables between the two periods at all basin sites. During the La Nina condition, species richness was greater owing to interconnected shallow lakes and drainage-channel inputs, while the Shannon diversity index was lower because of the high abundance values of Monoraphidium minutum. A detailed analysis of the chlorophytes in the entire basin, indicated that changes in density and species dominance occurred on a regional scale although diverse chlorophyte assemblages were identified in the different sectors of the Salado River basin. After La Nina event, the entire basin had the potential to revert to the previous density values, showing the resilience to global environmental changes and the ability to reestablish the general conditions of stability.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges when conducting a national-scale assessment of lakes, such as the 2007 US National Lake Assessment (NLA), is finding enough reference lakes to set appropriate expectations for the assessed sites. In the NLA, a random design was used to select lakes for sampling to make unbiased estimates of regional condition. However, such an approach was unlikely to yield enough minimally impacted lakes to use as reference sites, especially in disturbed regions. We developed a 3-stage process to select candidate reference lakes to augment the NLA probability sample in the northeastern USA (Northeast). Screening included a water-chemistry database filter, landuse evaluation, and analysis of aerial photographs. In the Northeast, we assembled a database of 2109 lakes >4 ha in surface area, of which 369 passed the water-chemistry screen. Of these, 220 failed the watershed landuse screen and 60 failed the aerial photograph screen, leaving a set of 89 optimal candidate reference lakes. Twenty of these lakes were sampled as potential reference lakes in the NLA. Based on a wide variety of indicators, NLA field measurements indicated that almost all (85-100%) of the chosen candidate reference lakes had least-disturbed water chemistry, although somewhat fewer had least disturbed physical habitat (74-79%) and biology (68-78%). Nevertheless, our 3-stage screening process was an efficient method for identification of good candidates for reference-lake sampling. The reference-lake selection process used in our study can be done in the office and relatively inexpensively. As such, it is very useful for large-scale regional or national studies encompassing areas too large to census. It also has the advantage of adding a level of consistency and quantification to the reference-site selection process.

AB  - Systematic deviations in sex ratio may be adaptive in the face of the prevailing environmental or physiological cues experienced by the mother; yet some theoretical and mechanistic hypotheses remain at odds and are rarely examined noninvasively under natural conditions. Conventional interpretations of the Trivers and Willard (Trivers RL, Willard DE. 1973. Natural selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring. Science 179:90-92) hypothesis (TWH) predict that higher stress should be associated with female-biased litters; yet, several mechanistic hypotheses predict the opposite. We tested the predictions of the TWH and 2 stress-related mechanistic hypotheses in a free-living polygynandrous sciurid, Richardson's ground squirrel, Urocitellus richardsonii. We examined the relationship between litter sex ratio and indicators of maternal condition and investment. These included litter size, juvenile mass at emergence, as well as maternal age, changes in maternal body mass, and maternal fecal glucocorticoid (cortisol and corticosterone) levels during gestation, lactation, and post-weaning. Males born of small litters were significantly heavier at emergence than males from larger litters, which were female biased, whereas females showed no significant change in mass with litter size. Mothers with higher fecal cortisol levels during the gestation period (but not during lactation or post-weaning) were more likely to produce male-biased litters, whereas females producing larger litters showed significantly higher cortisol levels during lactation (but not gestation or post-weaning) than mothers producing smaller litters. Our results provide support for both the proximate glucose-mediated mechanistic model of Cameron (Cameron EZ. 2004. Facultative adjustment of mammalian sex ratios in support of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: evidence for a mechanism. Proc R Soc Ser B Biol Sci. 271:1723-1728) and the broad-sense TWH, where social and life-history characteristics play an integral role.

AB  - Combined magnetic mineral, organic and inorganic carbon content and geochemical analysis were conducted on laminated sediments from Santa Maria del Oro, a crater lake in Nayaril (western Mexico), to build up a model of the paleoenvironmental conditions for the last 2,600 years. This sequence is of particular importance as it constitutes a high resolution record of late Holocene climatic and environmental change in west-central Mexico. The analyses attained in this study allowed to recognize abrupt changes, to identify dry periods, and to compare these variations with available records in central Mexico. Laminations are caused in general by alternations of their main components: lithogenic detritus, biogenic and authigenic carbonates, and amorphous material from biological and volcanic remains. The volcaniclastic accumulations include two tephras, one of them, the Toba Jala, produced by the Cehoruco volcano. Six facies of silt, sand and peat were recognized Horizons characterized by high inorganic carbon content, authigenic siderite, and the dissolution of the finest ferrimagnetic mineralogy (magnetite) in reductive conditions, are upward followed by an increase in the concentrations of fine grained ferrimagnetic minerals. This sequence represents dissolution-precipitation cycles of magnetic minerals by anoxic/oxic variations in the water-sediment interface during warmer and dryer periods. These environmental conditions are especially present around 600 - 1140 A. D., and 1410 - 1830 A.D., which coincide with the archeological Classic period (300 - 900 A.D.) drought, the Little Ice Age (1350 - 1800 A.D.) and the droughts of the last 700 years. The effects of climatic variations such as the drought occurred in the archeological Classic period, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and the droughts over the last 700 years, have been documented in sites along central Mexico.

AB  - As the concentrated discharge outlet of an aquifer or groundwater system, a karst spring is partly independent from the aquifer, due to its formation of a pool or lake after outcropping onto the surface. Understanding how to evaluate the unique and sensitive environment of the karst spring is essential for water resource protection. Five karst springs in South China were investigated by analyzing their hydrodynamic conditions, variations in physicochemical parameters, and phytoplankton community structures. Dominated by regional or local groundwater flow, these springs had different catchment area characteristics and hydrogeological conditions. The results showed that, although they had similar water quality, their physicochemical parameters needed to be distinguished and evaluated in different ways in order to determine the cause of the observed degradation in spring water quality. Ca2+, HCO3-, and specific electrical conductivity were the major parameters reflecting the impact of regional flow from the aquifer; pH, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature indicated the local environment in and around the springs; while nitrogen and CODMn both related to the aquifer and local environment, depending on seasonal variation and human activities. The comparison of long-term nitrate data revealed that environmental pressure has increased over time. Water deterioration of Lingshui Spring was attributed to the strong interaction of surface water and groundwater. High nutrient concentrations did not correspond with the highest phytoplankton abundance or the most species. The phytoplankton community structures in the karst springs varied from place to place, depending on the hydrogeological conditions and the surrounding environment. The water environment status, as reflected by the combination of water quality indices and biological indicators, could more comprehensively represent overall water health. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are an important component of microalgae communities in aquatic ecosystems, however, their response to environmental factors in different habitats and catchment areas of small water bodies is still not well recognised. We examined ponds from two types of surroundings (field vs. forest) in order to find the best triggers for the distribution of cyanobacteria species, and analysed different habitats (open water and macrophyte-dominated zones) to find the habitat preferences of cyanobacteria species.
   Our results underline the important role of habitats in the determination of the abundance of cyanobacteria species in small water bodies. Cyanobacteria as a group preferred macrophyte-dominated sites with stable water column conditions, which to lesser extent were inhabited by representatives of other systematic groups of algae. The co-occurrence of many cyanobacteria species and zooplankton in the studied ponds may have indirectly resulted from biotic interactions in the food web. In the open water a positive relationship between zooplankton and cyanobacteria suggests stimulation of their development through the elimination of smaller edible taxa or by nutrient resupply through zooplankton excretion.
   The type of catchment area also impacted the cyanobacterial community. Field ponds with significantly higher values of pH and NO3 were characterised by a higher abundance of cyanobacteria compared with ponds within the forest catchment. A positive relationship between pH and cyanobacteria indicates that they raise pH during photosynthesis. However, some species were negatively associated with water temperature and occurred exclusively only in forest ponds.
   The study revealed that cyanobacteria in small water bodies can be a valuable indicator of important ecosystem conditions. Despite the fact that their prevalence in agricultural ponds may confirm their potential as an indicator of pollution, their high diversity associated with macrophytes contributes to an increase of overall landscape biodiversity.

AB  - This study presents the biometric relationships among various increments that is useful in both scientific and practical terms for the silvicultural of silver fir. The increments recorded in the biometric characteristics of trees are a faithful indicator of the effect of silvicultural work measures and of environmental conditions. Knowing these increments, and the relationships among them, can contribute to adaptations in silvicultural work on these stands with the purpose of reducing risks generated by environmental factors. We carried an inventory based on tree increment cores. The sample size was determined based on both radial increment and height increment variability of the trees. The sample trees were selected in proportion to their basal area on diameter categories. Current annual height increment (CAI(h)) was measured on felled trees from mean tree category. For CAI(h) we generated models based on the mean tree height. Percentages of the basal area increment and of form-height increment were used to compute the current annual volume increment percentage (PCAI(v)). For the mean tree, the CAI(h) estimated through the used models had a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.8749 and for the current annual volume increment (CAI(v)) the RMSE value was 0.1295. In even-aged stands, the mean current volume increment tree is a hypothetical tree that may have the mean basal area of all the trees and the form-height of the stand. Conclusions: The diameter, height, and volume increments of trees are influenced by structural conditions and natural factors. The structures comprising several generations of fir mixed with beech and other deciduous trees, which have been obtained by the natural regeneration of local provenances, are stable and must become management targets. Stable structures are a condition for the sustainable management of stands.

AB  - Biotic indices are tools to assess the ecological status of marine systems, and can be based on different metrics (such as ecological groups, specific diversity). The present study applies five biotic indices based on living (stained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages to assess ecological conditions in a wide area of the Mediterranean Sea in the heavily polluted Gulf of Gabes and along the western and eastern coasts of the Djerba Island, with the eastern coast considered as "pristine". The applied indices are based on epiphytic foraminifera e.g., the "long versus short life span" index (I-LS) and the modified FoRAM-Index (FI'), benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition and diversity, e.g., the Tolerant Species index (TSstd), the Foram Stress Index (FSI), the diversity Index (exp(H'(bc))) and the newly developed Foram-AZTI Marine Biotic Index (Foram-AMBI). This latter index was tested using species of benthic foraminifera presently assigned to ecological groups in the Mediterranean Sea. All indices confirm good ecological conditions eastern of Djerba. The FI' and I-LS, % TSstd, FSI, indicate a severe anthropogenic impact especially in the central part of the Gulf of Gabes, next to the phosphate industry of Skhira and along the western coast of Djerba Island and confirm direct observations and geochemical data. The indices based on epiphytic foraminifera seem to better reflect actual environmental conditions in the investigated region because of the extended Posidonia oceanica meadow in the area. The exp(H'(bc)) reflects lower degrees of pollution. The application of the Foram-AMBI index presents limitations that prevent its current use. It strongly underestimates the pollution impact along the Tunisian coast, and additional work is needed to increase the number of species attributed to ecological groups and to possibly modify the coefficients to be used in its equation.

AB  - Ecologically meaningful and scientifically defensible nutrient criteria are needed to protect the water quality of USA streams. Criteria based on our best understanding of naturally occurring nutrient concentrations would protect both water quality and aquatic biota. Previous approaches to predicting natural background nutrient concentrations have relied on some form of landscape categorization (e.g., nutrient ecoregions) to account for natural variability among water bodies. However, natural variation within these regions is so high that use of a single criterion can underprotect naturally occurring low-nutrient streams and overprotect naturally occurring high-nutrient steams. We developed Random Forest models to predict how baseflow concentrations of total P (TP) and total N (TN) vary among western USA streams in response to continuous spatial variation in nutrient sources, sinks, or other processes affecting nutrient concentrations. Both models were relatively accurate (root mean square errors <12% of the range of observations for independent validation sites) and made better predictions than previous models of natural nutrient concentrations. However, the models were not very precise (TP model: r(2) = 0.46, TN model: r(2) = 0.23). An analysis of the sources of variation showed that our models accounted for most of the spatial variation in nutrient concentrations, and much of the imprecision was caused by temporal or measurement variation. We applied 2 methods to determine upper prediction limits that incorporated model error and could be used as site-specific nutrient criteria. These site-specific candidate nutrient criteria better accounted for natural variation among sites than did criteria based on regional average conditions, would increase protection for streams with naturally low nutrient concentrations, and specified more attainable conditions for those streams with naturally higher nutrient concentrations.

AB  - Survey samplings on late summer phytoplankton communities were carried out on 48 high mountain lakes located on the Austrian and Italian slopes of the Eastern Alps. The lakes of North Tyrol ( A) and South Tyrol ( I) were sampled in 2000 as part of the EU project EMERGE (EVK1-CT- 1999- 00032). The lakes of Trentino ( I) were investigated in other research projects during 1996 and 1997 (Adamello mountain range) and 2000 ( catchment of the River Avisio), respectively. The objectives of this paper are: ( 1) to study taxonomy and biodiversity of Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cryptophyceae in high altitude lakes of the Eastern Alps; (2) to identify functional flagellate groups characterising lakes with similar habitat properties, ( 3) to identify the environmental variables driving abundance and distribution of the three selected algal groups, thus contributing to the selection of sensitive bioindicator taxa. The lakes investigated show rather wide morphological, chemical and trophic state gradients. Flagellate algae account for a median relative abundance (R.A.) of 68%. Chrysophyceae are the most important group in terms of biodiversity and R. A.. Special flagellate associations could be related to lake features, like catchment geology, mineralization level and nutrient concentrations. However, the distribution of flagellate algae did not allow a complete geographical separation of the lakes studied in the different districts. Multivariate canonical analyses indicate that the distribution of Chrysophyceae is mainly driven by NO3-N concentration and thermal conditions, while Dinophyceae are driven by a combination of alkalinity, altitude, thermal condition and, less importantly, nutrient concentration. Physical properties of the lakes, such as thermal condition and lake depth, represent the principal driving variables for Cryptophyceae. The responses to the different environmental variables suggest that the three flagellate groups analysed might be used as indicators for environmental changes in high mountain lakes of the Eastern Alps.

AB  - Fjords can transition from marine embayments to lacustrine waterbodies under glacio-isostatic change following their deglaciation. However, little is known on how a transition from fjord to lake is influenced by glacial dynamics and how it influences sedimentation in and around the basin. Here, we analyse swath bathymetry imagery and subbottom profiles pri in Lake Mekinac (southern Quebec) as well as glacial land forms from LiDAR imagery around the lake to document the evolution of a fjord basin into a lacustrine body during the transition from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. These analyses helped refine local glacial history and show that the study area was probably under the up-ice reach of the St. Lawrence Ice Stream during full glacial conditions. The mapping of moraines in and around Lake Mekinac shows that deglaciation of the study area was marked by stabilization of the ice-margin during the Mars-Batiscan Event, which is traditionally correlated to the climate deterioration at the end of the Younger Dryas. The architecture of acoustic facies in the lake indicates a transition from glacial conditions (U1 ), to proglacial-paraglacial (U2) and to postglacial conditions (U3). The bottom of Lake Mekinac also contains multiple mass movement deposits related to progradation of the Du-Milieu River delta and probably to late-Holocene earthquakes. The acoustic architecture of sediments within the lake indicates that the sedimentation regime was most dependant on the sediment input regime and that the transition from fjord to lake did not significantly influence sedimentation during deglaciation of the watershed. Further work on dating the mass movement deposits that characterise the sediment architecture should provide a better assessment of natural hazard associated with seismological events.

AB  - Whole-sediment toxicity assays contribute to elucidating the intricate association between the presence of contaminants in sediments and their toxicopathic effects in benthic fish. In the present study, Solea senegalensis juveniles were exposed under laboratory conditions to contaminated whole-sediments for 7 and 28 days. Sediments were obtained from a low to moderately polluted estuary, a highly polluted harbour and from the mixture of both field-collected sediments. Biometry data were recorded. Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment. The Integrative Biomarker Response index (IBR/n) evidenced that exposure to the three sediments caused an impact of diverse magnitude in sole health (IBR/n(Harbour) > IBR/n(Mixture) > IBR/n(Estuary)). The magnitude of biological responses essentially depended on the presence of contaminants in source sediments, which seemed to be altered by the conditions imposed by whole-sediment toxicity assays.

AB  - Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by many filamentous fungi, such as Fusarium, and are widespread in nature and can adversely affect almost all organisms. Mycotoxins can be formed in very different conditions such as when plants are growing or in crops that are stored in improper conditions. One of the methods to prevent the formation of mycotoxins in powdered feed is using varieties of appropriate quality and proper mineral fertilization, primarily nitrogen. In this study, the concentration of ergosterol and mycotoxins in the kernels of two maize cultivars from different maturity groups in Poland during the harvest of 2011 and 2012 was investigated using HPLC methods. We aimed to analyse the concentration of ergosterol as a fungal biomass indicator and mycotoxins from two maize cultivars under six different forms of nitrogen fertilizers. The "stay-green" hybrid ES Paroli was characterized by a significantly lower ergosterol and the ability to accumulate the mycotoxins, compared to the classic cultivar ES Palazzo. The varieties of maize that remain green for a longer time period, the so-called stay-green type, are characterized by a different coefficient of nitrogen remobilization compared to the classic hybrids. Their dynamics of growth and accumulation of nutrients indicates a nitrogen fertilization system, indicating that slow-release fertilizers are potentially more adapted to the cycles of maize vegetation. Hence, compared to the classic variant, the "stay-green" variety uses nitrogen more effectively from mineral fertilizers. Such hybrids are healthier and remain in good condition for a longer time; therefore, they are characterized by a lower pathogen pressure. Thus, the cultivation of such varieties can be considered as one of the elements of integrated maize production. We observed identical reactions of the studied experimental factors for both vegetation seasons, which indicates the lack of environmental impact on the functioning and interaction of experimental factors.

AB  - Alkaline wetlands and fens are groundwater dependent, terrestrial ecosystems (GWDTEs) existing throughout the temperate zone. They contain a large number of protected and endangered plant species and their ecological status is threatened by insufficient groundwater quality and quantity. However, management and conservation of fens are constrained by limited knowledge on the relations between vegetation and measurable hydrological conditions. This study investigates the relations between vegetation and water level dynamics in groundwater dependent wetlands in Denmark.
   A total of 35 wetland sites across Denmark were included in the study. The sites represent a continuum of wetlands with respect to vegetation and hydrological conditions. Water level was measured continuously using pressure transducers at each site. Metrics expressing different hydrological characteristics, such as mean water level and low and high water level periods, were calculated based on the water level time series. A complete plant species list was recorded in plots covering 78.5 m(2) at each site. Community metrics such as total number of species and the number of bryophytes were generated from the species lists and Ellenberg Indicator scores of moisture, pH and nutrients were calculated for each site.
   The water level correlates with the number of typical fen species of vascular plants, whereas bryophytes are closer connected to the stable water level conditions provided by groundwater seepage. The water level variability is proved to be a significant limiting factor for species diversity in wetlands, which should be considered along with the fertility in order to access the habitat quality. The study provides new insight in the water level preferences for GWDTEs which is highly needed in the management and assessment of anthropogenic damage to these ecosystems. (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The use of chemical information in assessment of predation risk is pervasive across animal taxa. However, by its very nature, chemical information can be temporally unreliable. Chemical cues persist for some period of time after they are released into the environment. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the rate of degradation of chemical cues under natural conditions and hence little about how they function in temporal risk assessment under natural conditions. Here, we conducted an experiment to identify a concentration of fresh alarm cues that evoke a strong antipredator response in coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus ambonensis. We then tested the rate at which these alarm cues degraded under natural conditions in ocean water, paying attention to whether the rate of degradation varied throughout the day and whether the temporal pattern correlated with physicochemical factors that could influence the rate of degradation. Fresh alarm cues released into ocean water evoke strong avoidance responses in juvenile fish, while those aged for 30min no longer evoke antipredator responses. Fish exposed to cues aged for 10 or 20min show intermediate avoidance responses. We found a marked temporal pattern of response throughout the day, with much faster degradation in early to mid-afternoon, the time of day when solar radiation, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH are nearing their peak. Ecologists have spent considerable effort elucidating the role of chemical information in mediating predator-prey interactions, yet we know almost nothing about the temporal dynamics of risk assessment using chemical information. We are in dire need of additional comparative field experiments on the rate of breakdown of chemical cues, particularly given that global change in UV radiation, temperature, and water chemistry could be altering the rates of degradation and the potential use of this information in risk assessment.

AB  - Methane-derived authigenic carbonate (MDAC) is a biogenic rocky substrate formed by microbial assemblages below the seabed. It performs important ecosystem functions, including the provision of reef-like habitats on soft sediments and the sequestration of carbon.
   The protection of MDAC is limited at the global scale; however, 27 marine protected areas (MPAs) have been designated in European waters for 'cold seep' MDAC, mainly in shallow waters (<200 m). Few studies have been conducted on these habitats from a conservation perspective.
   The effective management of MDAC structures requires an understanding of their ecology and physical characteristics in a healthy condition. This is best achieved using a multidisciplinary approach to provide evidence on predefined aspects of MDAC structures, termed feature attributes, which can be assessed to determine habitat condition over time.
   This article presents the first UK effort to develop a multidisciplinary approach to monitoring shallow MDAC feature attributes, using the Croker Carbonate Slabs Special Area of Conservation (SAC) as a case study. A range of remote and physical survey methods were used to characterize the MDAC and associated relatively unimpacted and healthy biological communities.
   The data confirm that the SAC contains the largest known area of shallow MDAC in European waters, that methane release is ongoing, and that MDAC is still likely to be forming. Specialized chemoautotrophic fauna were not recorded, possibly due to the dominance of fauna that derive carbon (ultimately) from photosynthesis. Five epifaunal taxa were found to be associated with MDAC, but not with the surrounding sediments.
   The broad multidisciplinary survey allowed a detailed characterization of shallow MDAC but was resource intensive. We recommend a low-resource monitoring strategy to deliver cost-effective and robust evidence for condition assessment and suggest further studies to contextualize future interpretations of change.

However, establishing a permanent monitoring system on a huge darn is costly. Additionally, for reasons of national security, many darns and information about them may not be able to be accessed by researchers. Accordingly, continuously monitoring the structural health of a dam by measurement may be difficult. This study presents a way to continuously monitor the health of a dam using vibration signals that are measured not on the dam but close to it. The Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam in Russia is used to demonstrate the idea. Intensive ambient vibration measurements were firstly made once to determine the natural frequencies of the dam. Then the natural frequencies of the dam under varying environmental effects are obtained from the spectra of the seismic records obtained at Cheryomushki seismic station, which is located 4.4 km northeast of the darn. To account for the effects of varying environmental conditions on the natural frequencies, an autoencoder in the form of an unsupervised learning neural network, was employed. The autoencoder was trained using the natural frequencies without using any environmental factors to learn the intrinsic behavior of the darn under varying environmental conditions. The errors between input data to the trained autoencoder and the regenerated data from the autoencoder can be used to determine whether the dam is under normal conditions. A finite element model of the dam was constructed to simulate changes of natural frequencies due to cracks in the dam structure. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can feasibly monitor the structural health of the dam.

AB  - We present the reconstruction of mire vegetation changes and fire history recorded in a continuous sediment profile that spans the last 20,000 cal yr BP from the Late Pleniglacial to Holocene in North-eastern Hungary. We also aimed to reveal past climate changes by using ecological requirements of specific aquatic plants as summer temperature indicators. Our results suggest the formation of a mesotrophic mire around 20,000 cal yr BP with brown moss, Betula sp. and Selaginella selaginoides cover beside the occurrence of Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia and T. angustifolia suggesting base-rich fen and tundra-like wet-ground habitats on the lakeshore. This community shifted to reed dominated swamp at c. 18,300 cal yr BP with inferred min. July temperatures of 12-15.7 degrees C. pinus sp., Betula nana, B. penduta/pubescens, Hippuris vulgaris and P. australis dominated until 16,600 cal yr BP pointing to shallow muddy stagnant water and colder climatic conditions than in the preceding interval. The most warmth-demanding species, T. latifolia and T. angustifolia indicated July mean temperatures >14-15.7 degrees C soon after the LGM. The formation of biogenic carbonate also started at an early stage; major accumulation occurred between 15,200 and 10,000 cal yr BP. In the Early Holocene, environmental indicator species (e.g., Phragmites australis and T. latifolia) pointed to warmer and shallower conditions, while the late Holocene was characterized by strong eutrophication and reed swamp dominance on the lakeshore. Elevated macrocharcoal concentration, wood fragments and remains of Typha species suggested frequent local fires and dry mire surface conditions during the last 1700 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, due to reduced water resources, there is a need to build reservoirs in Poland. Reservoirs perform important economic, natural and recreational functions in the environment, improve water balance and contribute to flood protection. In the construction of reservoirs, it is necessary to consider not only hydrological issues related to water quantity, but also its quality, silting, and many other factors. Therefore, the physiographic, hydrological, hydrochemical, and hydrogeological conditions of the projected reservoirs have to be taken into account to limit the potential negative effects of decisions to build them.
   In order to assess the suitability of eight projected small water retention reservoirs (to increase water resources in the Barycz River catchment in Lower Silesia and Greater Poland provinces, this article takes into account hydrological indicators (efficiency of the reservoir, operation time, dependence on the intensity of silting, and flood hazard indicator), water quality (phosphorus load and nitrogen load), hydrogeological conditions (type of geological substratum for the reservoir basin and filtration losses), and safety of the reservoir dam.
   To develop a theoretical model describing the regularities between the indicators, multivariate statistical techniques were used, including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Factor Analysis (FA). In order to assess the reservoirs, a synthetic indicator was developed to compare the reservoirs with each other in relation to the conditions. The Cluster Analysis (CA) was used for typological classification of homogeneous locations of projected small retention reservoirs.
   Own research procedure for identification of the most advantageous water reservoirs, with the use of multivariate statistical techniques, may be used as a tool supporting decision making in other facilities intended for implementation in provincial projects of small retention.

AB  - In marine environments characterised by habitat-forming plants, the relative allocation of resources into vegetative growth and flowering is an important indicator of plant condition and hence ecosystem health. In addition, the production and abundance of seeds can give clues to local resilience. Flowering density, seed bank, biomass and epiphyte levels were recorded for the temperate seagrass Zostera nigricaulis in Port Phillip Bay, south east Australia at 14 sites chosen to represent several regions with different physicochemical conditions. Strong regional differences were found within the large bay. Spathe and seed density were very low in the north of the bay (3 sites), low in the centre of the bay (2 sites) intermediate in the Outer Geelong Arm (2 sites), high in Swan Bay (2 sites) and very high in the Inner Geelong Arm (3 sites). In the south (2 sites) seed density was low and spathe density was high. These regional patterns were largely consistent for the 5 sites sampled over the three year period. Timing of flowering was consistent across sites, occurring from August until December with peak production in October, except during the third year of monitoring when overall densities were lower and peaked in November. Seagrass biomass, epiphyte load, canopy height and stem density showed few consistent spatial and temporal patterns. Variation in spathe and seed density and morphology across Port Phillip Bay reflects varying environmental conditions and suggests that northern sites may be restricted in their ability to recover from disturbance through sexual reproduction. In contrast, sites in the west and south of the bay have greater potential to recover from disturbances due to a larger seed bank and these sites could act as source populations for sites where seed production is low.

AB  - Diverse biomarkers including stable isotope, hormonal, and ecoimmunological assays are powerful tools to assess animal condition. However, an integrative approach is necessary to provide the context essential to understanding how biomarkers reveal animal health in varied ecological conditions. A barrier to such integration is a general lack of awareness of how shared extraction methods from across fields can provide material from the same animal tissues for diverse biomarker assays. In addition, the use of shared methods for extracting differing tissue fractions can also provide biomarkers for how animal health varies across time. Specifically, no study has explicitly illustrated the depth and breadth of spacial and temporal information that can be derived from coupled biomarker assessments on two easily collected tissues: blood and feathers or hair. This study used integrated measures of glucocorticoids, stable isotopes, and parasite loads in the feathers and blood of fall-migrating Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) to illustrate the wealth of knowledge about animal health and ecology across both time and space. In feathers, we assayed deuterium (D) isotope and corticosterone (CORT) profiles, while in blood we measured CORT and blood parasite levels. We found that while earlier migrating owls had elevated CORT levels relative to later migrating birds, there was also a disassociation between plasma and feather CORT, and blood parasite loads. These results demonstrate how these tissues integrate time periods from weeks to seasons and reflect energetic demands during differing life stages. Taken together, these findings illustrate the potential for integrating diverse biomarkers to assess interactions between environmental factors and animal health across varied time periods without the necessity of continually recapturing and tracking individuals. Combining biomarkers from diverse research fields into an integrated framework hold great promise for advancing our understanding of environmental effects on animal health.

AB  - How do different soil tillage systems influence soil quality over the years? Under moist cool conditions is it possible in the long term to reduce dramatically soil tillage intensity without experiencing reductions in yield or other problems? In 1987, the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Economics and Engineering in Tanikon initiated a long-term soil tillage trial to clarify these questions. The trial compared mouldboard plough, chisel, paraplow, shallow tillage and no-tillage systems on a well-drained Orthic Luvisol with 160 g kg(-1) clay, 310 g kg(-1) silt, and under a climate that has a mean annual precipitation of 1180 mm. The tillage treatment effects were evaluated by measuring several biological, chemical, and physical soil quality indicators. Reduced soil tillage increased earthworm populations, reduced Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides infection in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and increased plant colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Yields for no-tillage and other ploughless cultivation techniques were on par with those obtained by ploughing. An exception was direct-drilled maize (Zea mays), where no-tillage decreased yield by more than 10% over the course of 14 years. In the first 7 years of the trial, the level of soil organic carbon in all the tillage regimes was approximately 40% lower than natural grassland (initial situation 1987 = 75 Mg SOC ha(-1)). The no-tillage method did not differ from the others in respect of bulk density, but it showed an increased preconsolidation stress and hence better trafficability. Under Switzerland's moist cool climatic conditions, it is possible to reduce soil tillage intensity without substantial reductions in yield, and at the same time improve soil quality.

AB  - Relevance. Mires are simultaneously the indicator of the environment condition, including the river and ground waters connected to mires. It is especial in the area of accommodation of a large drinking water supply system, for example, the Tomsk system of drinking water supply from groundwaters.
   The aim of the research is to reveal the changes of the chemical composition (acid peat extracts) and mineral inclusions as indicators of mire formation conditions according to nature and anthropogenous influence in the peat deposit of the Timilyazevo mire (the western corner of Tomsk city, Western Siberia).
   Methods: methods of definition of chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils, statistical methods.
   Results and conclusions. An uneven change of ash content, Al, Ti, Cr and other elements was revealed with a maximum in the upper and lower layers of the peat deposit in proportion to mineral sources (atmospheric dust and underlying clays, respectively) for mesotrophic Timityazevo mire in the Tom river valley near the Tomsk city. An assumption is made about the presence of a general mechanism for peat formation and the transformation of mineral inclusions in mires based on the environment filtration properties taking into account the previously obtained data for the Vasyugan mire. The main features are the biochemical transformation of mineral substances coming from the atmosphere, or surface and ground flow from drylands. As a result, the substance is in a dissolved, colloidal and suspended form in the active horizon. Mineral phases are formed in the inert horizon. Trace elements co-precipitate on the surface of these particles (also particles of hydroxides) and authigenic minerals including phosphates of rare earth elements are formed. The velocity and direction of these processes depend on the geomorphological and hydrological conditions that determine the emergence and functioning of geochemical barriers.

AB  - Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.: Fr.) P. Kumm. is one of the edible mushrooms currently gaining attention as environmental restorer. The present study explores the potential of P. ostreatus (Jacq.: Fr.) P. Kumm. in degradation of textile dyes and effluents. The mushroom cultivation was carried out using paddy bed as substrate. The fully grown mushroom fruit bodies were used as a bioremediation agent against two industrially important azo dyes such as nylon blue and cotton yellow and few effluents collected from various textile industries in Karnataka, India. The ideal growth parameters such as temperature, pH, and dye concentrations for effective degradation were carried out. One of the main enzymes, laccase, responsible for biodegradation, was partially characterized. The degradation was found to be ideal at pH 3.0 and temperature at 26-28 degrees C. This study demonstrated a percentage degradation of 78.10, 90.81, 82.5, and 64.88 for dye samples such as nylon blue (50 ppm), cotton yellow (350 ppm), KSIC effluents, and Ramanagar effluents at 28 degrees C within 15th days respectively in comparison with other temperature conditions. Similarly, a percentage degradation of 35.99, 33.33, 76.13 and 25.8 for nylon blue (50 ppm), cotton yellow (350 ppm), Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation (KSIC) effluents and Ramnagar effluents were observed at pH 3.0 within 15 days, respectively (p < 0.05). Thus, the current study concluded that the utilization of P. ostreatus (Jacq.: Fr.) P. Kumm. at ideal environmental conditions is a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach for the degradation of various azo dyes and textile effluents which are harmful to the ecosystem.

AB  - The value of remotely sensed data for ecological monitoring and modeling studies that address landscape changes due to climatic change is widely recognized. However, these data can be collected at a variety of spatial resolutions which has significant implications in terms of the information that can be derived from the data. Most readily available remotely sensed data tend to have ground resolutions substantially greater than the size of individual plants so pixels may contain a mixture of vegetation types, background cover, illumination intensity and shadow. These mixtures make it difficult to evaluate fine-scale vegetation dynamics. This paper examines the potential utility of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data for assessing vegetation condition within a climatic change context. The drought in southern California that started in 1987 and the associated increase in tree mortality due to bark beetle infestations, provided the climatic change scenario for the study. A possible consequence of anthropogenically induced climatic change is the occurrence of more intense and prolonged droughts in some regions leading to greater mortality rates for susceptible vegetation species. Studies of present day patterns and processes of vegetation mortality associated with droughts may help to identify future consequences of hypothesized climatic changes. High spatial resolution (0.5 m) reflected spectral radiances were collected over the Cuyamaca State Park in southern California and related to levels of bark beetle infestations that increased during the drought years. The results from this demonstration project indicated that high spatial resolution remotely sensed data allow investigators to isolate individual plants from the scene background and are likely to provide valuable information for assessing vegetation condition. The characteristics of the reflected spectral radiances and their geostatistical properties may be potential indicators of differences in vegetation condition. These data are also likely to be valuable for determining biophysical quantities required in models of ecosystem function and for monitoring key species that may be particularly sensitive to climatic change (indicator species).

AB  - The figitid Ganaspis pelleranoi and the braconid Doryctobracon areolatus (Hym: Braconidae, Opiinae) are wide-ranging (from Florida, USA to Argentina) fruit fly parasitoids with tropical and subtropical distribution with a wet and temperate climate. In Argentina, both parasitoid species are thought to be restricted to the subtropical rainforests of the northwest and northeast, locally known as 'Yungas' and 'Paranaense' forests, respectively. However, these species recently have been recorded at the Monte and Thistle of the Prepuna eco-region, an arid region of central-western Argentina. Despite the extreme environmental conditions, anthropic artificial irrigation seems to be playing a fundamental role in fostering the presence and persistence of these species. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models were developed to assess the suitability of these areas to harbor both species. The present work is a first approach to identify suitable areas for the distribution of these two fruit fly biological control agents in the American continent; based on 19 bioclimatic variables. Furthermore, the models resulting from including the new records in the 'Monte' eco-region suggest that local populations may become adapted to particular micro-environmental conditions generated by artificial irrigation. Models revealed that these artificial oases are suitable for G. pelleranoi but seem to be unsuitable for D. areolatus. This first and new approach to the area suitability of these species invites to produce models that reflect actual distribution including more records of presence in oases with similar conditions, thus decreasing the bias of the model generated by over reliance on areas with higher humidity (forest), which correspond to the distribution known before the inclusion of the new records.

AB  - Hypoxia is of increasing concern in marine areas, calling for a better understanding of mechanisms leading to decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations ([O-2]). Much can be learned about the processes and implications of deoxygenation for marine ecosystems using proxy records from low-oxygen sites, provided proxies, such as the manganese (Mn) to calcium (Ca) ratio in benthic foraminiferal calcite, are available and well calibrated. Here we report a modern geochemical data set from three hypoxic sites within the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), USA, where we study the response of Mn/Ca-foram in the benthic foraminifer Nonionella stella to variations in sedimentary redox conditions (Mn, Fe) and bottom-water dissolved [O-2]. We combine molecular species identification by small subunit rDNA sequencing with morphological characterization and assign the SBB N. stella used here to a new phylotype (T6). Synchrotron-based scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) show low Mn incorporation (partition coefficient D-Mn < 0.05) and limited proxy sensitivity of N. stella, at least within the range of dissolved [O-2] (2.7-9.6 mu mol/l) and Mnpore-water gradients (2.12-21.59 mu mol/l). Notably, even though intra- and interspecimen Mn/Ca variability (33% and 58%, respectively) was only partially controlled by the environment, Mn/Ca-foram significantly correlated with both pore-water Mn and bottom-water [O-2]. However, the prevalent suboxic bottom-water conditions and limited dissolved [O-2] range complicate the interpretation of trace-elemental trends. Additional work involving other oxygenation proxies and samples from a wider oxygen gradient should be pursued to further develop foraminiferal Mn/Ca as an indicator for hypoxic conditions.

AB  - y The hydrogenation process in oil and fat production is accompanied by the formation of a large amount of waste, the majority of which includes spent catalysts and spent sorbents. The bioconversion of lipids through the use of immobilized enzyme preparations expands the possibilities and is one of the most powerful resource potentials of environmental biotechnology. The adsorption methods are most effective, which is due to the ease of the binding process, the low cost of the carrier and the absence of toxic substances. Immobilization of adsorption provides a large surface area, which is important for the lipolytic enzymes performing catalysis at the interface. In most cases, adsorption slightly reduces the activity of lipases and, which is extremely important, does not affect their specificity. It was shown that the use of activated carbon with a grain size of 2.0-2.8 as a carrier for immobilization of lipase, leads to maximum preservation of the initial lipolytic activity. The weight ratio of carrier/ enzyme, optimal in terms of preservation of lipolytic activity, was 1 g of biopolymer carrier per 500 mg of lipase (1: 0.5) with preservation of 36.33% of the initial activity of the native enzyme. From the obtained experimental data, it follows that the rational conditions for the immobilization of Rhizopus japonicus is GM 1.5, temperature 25 degrees C, duration of immobilization 15 minutes, the size of particles of activated carbon as a matrix is 2.0-2.8 mm. The lipolytic activity of the enzyme immobilized under these conditions is preserved by more than 30% compared with the native one, which is a high indicator of the preservation of activity.

AB  - The Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, is a vital component of saltmarsh ecosystems and an indicator species for environmental impacts, because of strong site fidelity. Also, their otoliths can provide a record of environmental conditions because they are metabolically inert, grow continuously with the fish, and incorporate trace elements from the environment. We used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to determine chemical composition differences in Gulf killifish otoliths across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Fish collections started in fall 2012 and continued through summer 2013. Concentrations of Mn, Sr, and Ba varied among sites and allowed for discrimination of fish between estuaries in Louisiana (elevated Ba concentrations) and the west side of Mobile Bay, Alabama (elevated Mn concentrations). However, elemental signatures of otoliths from Mississippi, Florida, and the east side of Alabama could not be discriminated from one another. Regional differences in otolith elemental signatures in Louisiana and west Alabama appear to provide unique chemical tags for these waters and, thus, may have utility for nursery habitat determination for species with estuarine-dependent juveniles. Otoliths of F. grandis that had been exposed to oil (either from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill or because of close proximity to an oil refinery) did not differ in elemental signature between paired oiled and non-oiled sites. Therefore, the otoliths did not contain trace metals associated with oil. Also, the relative condition of F. grandis did not differ between paired sites. The presence of F. grandis at all sites, the lack of effect of oiling on relative condition, and no signal of oil-related elements in the otoliths suggest minimal long-term impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on F. grandis.

AB  - The aim of the present contribution is to assess whether the abundance of mollusk species in the Southern Pampas (Argentina), an environmentally homogeneous region, reflect the local conditions of water bodies. In order to test this hypothesis, a comprehensive study was conducted in 30 sites regularly distributed across the region. At each site, the abundance of mollusk species was determined, and a series of physico-chemical measurements taken. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were used for the ordination of sampling sites based on the measured environmental variables. In addition, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was conducted to explore the relationships between environmental variables and mollusk abundances. Mollusk species were represented by the gastropods Biomphalaria peregrina, Chilina parchappii, Heleobia parchappii, Physa acuta, Pomacea canaliculata, Stenophysa marmorata, Uncancylus concentricus and the bivalve Musculium argentinum. Although aquatic vegetation cover, conductivity, and substrate were among the main parameters influencing mollusk distribution, their effect was insufficient to explain the spatial distribution pattern of the species in a regional scale. It is because the Southern Pampas is a very homogeneous area, and the ranges of these environmental conditions are within the range of ecological tolerance of most of the species represented. Yet, some species resulted good indicators of environmental conditions at local (microhabitat) scale, i.e., particular microhabitats that occur in different water bodies as well. In fact, even distributed in many different water bodies along the Southern Pampas C. parchappii is always linked to lotic environments, and U. concentricus is exclusively restricted to hard substrata. On the other hand, H. parchappii is the only species represented in mesohaline waters and P. acuta appeared to be a good indicator of pollution in the area.

AB  - Increasing evidence links prolonged freshwater exposure to adverse health conditions, immune deficiencies, and mortality in delphinids. Pensacola, Florida, experienced a record-breaking flood event in April 2014, after which, skin lesions evident of freshwater exposure were observed on common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Here we assess the potential consequences of the flood on bottlenose dolphin health and mortality. Data from an ongoing study were used to evaluate the relationship between skin lesions (progression, prevalence, and extent) and the flood with respect to changing environmental conditions (salinity). Annual stranding records (2012-2016) from Alabama to the eastern Florida Panhandle were used as an indicator of dolphin health to test the hypothesis that the flood event resulted in increased annual mortality rates. Although salinities remained low for several months, results suggest that there was not the widespread skin lesion outbreak anticipated. Of the 333 unique individuals detected only 20% were seen with skin lesions. There was a significant increase in the proportion of dolphins seen post-flood with lesion extent above background levels (>= 5%; p = 0.001), however, there were only 11 cases with lesion extent greater than 20%. Skin lesion prevalence increased overall following the flood (p < 0.001), but pairwise comparisons revealed a delayed response with significant increases not detected until the following fall (p = 0.01), several months after salinities returned to expected levels. Regression modeling revealed no significant effects of year, region, or year x region on mortality rates, except in Alabama, where increased mortality rates were likely due to residual impacts from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. This study takes advantage of a natural experiment, highlighting how little is understood about the conditions in which prolonged freshwater exposure leads to negative impacts on dolphin health.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the influence of light conditions, conceivably influenced by stand structure/ash dieback, on ash regeneration and the competition between ash seedlings and species growing in the understory. Materials and Methods: We selected 40 plots in a riparian forest located in Bavaria, Germany. Light-related variables (Leaf Area Index, gap fraction) were gathered with fish-eye photography, whereas other environmental factors were derived from vegetation surveys (Ellenberg indicator values). We assessed vegetation parameters such as species' richness and coverage of the herb layer to account for competition with ash seedlings. Results: Our results indicate that ash regeneration is favoured under shady conditions. The majority of other abiotic factors were not statistically associated with the analysed ash metrics. In contrast, the coverage of grass was negatively related to LAI and positively to gap fraction. Higher herb and grass coverages were linked to a suppression of ash regeneration. A higher litter coverage was associated with a higher frequency of ash seedlings. Nonparametric partial correlation analyses demonstrated the influence of light and stressed that litter coverage is of particular importance. Conclusions: We conclude that gaps, inter alia induced by ash dieback, favour grass invasion. In turn, this invasion might suppress regeneration of ash. In this regard, rapid silvicultural management such as reforestation of gaps after dieback of mature trees is recommended. The influence of litter on interspecific competition during growth should be also considered. The pace of dieback might additionally influence the timing and quantity of litter accumulation; thus, further research should also focus on these interrelations.

AB  - The different methodological tools for ecological homologation are commonly based around the controversial inference of the species fundamental niche coming from its effective niche, this being considered the medium in which the species lives, bounded by the quantification of a set of environmental variables (parameters) that define it. The methodologies and models developed in this field are generally aimed at evaluating the suitability (homologation) of a species for a given site based on its "proximity" to the observed range of variation associated with its optimal ecological response (this usually means the center of gravity, the centroid of the point cloud, etc.). In contrast, little research has been directed towards developing methodologies which fix the reference at the limit values of the recorded variation range, and which define the conditions of ecological marginality.
   At site-scale, conditions of species marginality with respect to the physical environment threaten its establishment, development and perpetuation and therefore its ecological stability. Based on the hypothesis that these conditions of marginality are focused on the edges of the parametric hypervolume that defines the fundamental niche of each species, a set of indicators has been designed to evaluate the degree of ecological marginality of a given site in terms of the specific species requirements. The application of the model to study episodes of vegetative decline in Aleppo pine stands has produced ecologically coherent results, showing a satisfactory capacity to identify the most important site aspects influencing the observed ecological behavior. It is therefore an easily implemented, transparent (white-box model) methodological tool providing a valuable means to explore the key characteristics of complex relationships between species and the physical environment in which they are found.

AB  - AimSpatial predictions of future communities under climate change can be obtained by stacking species distribution models (S-SDM), but proper evaluation of community S-SDM predictions across time with fully independent data has rarely been carried out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive abilities of S-SDMs for whole forest communities across the last 25years in a mountain region.
   LocationThe western Swiss Alps.
   MethodsWe used past vegetation surveys (2,984 plots) and environmental data from the 1990s to calibrate SDMs for 364 plant species and predict changes in forest composition under contemporary conditions. These projections were then evaluated by resurveying a random subset of 92 forest plots in summer 2014.
   ResultsSpecies distribution models showed the same accuracy in the past (calibration data) and present (evaluation data). The S-SDMs correctly predicted the general trends in species richness and shift of ecological conditions (i.e., temperature, moisture) at the regional level. However, it proved more difficult to identify precisely which forest communities or areas are most or least affected by climate change.
   Main conclusionOur results show that, across a period of a few decades, S-SDMs can usefully predict trends in macroecological properties such as richness or average ecological conditions, but fail to accurately predict changes in composition. This is likely due to the combined effects of the stochasticity of local colonization and extinction events, dispersal limitations, community assembly rules (e.g., competition), observer bias, model and location errors and interannual variation. Furthermore, these models cannot account for potential species adaptations leading to persistence in sites predicted unsuitable. This highlights the need for developing more accurate forest community predictions as support to help prioritizing conservation actions.

AB  - Supplemental feeding for ungulates is a widespread practice in many human-dominated landscapes across Europe and North America, mainly intended to seasonally support populations. Surprisingly, little consideration was given so far to the effect of supplemental feeding on ungulate spatial ecology at a large scale, in management and conservation studies. Analyses of the main ecological drivers influencing the use of supplemental feeding sites by ungulates across a gradient of abiotic and biotic factors are currently lacking. We conducted a large-scale assessment of ecological and management drivers of use of feeding station sites in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), a small cervid widely distributed across Europe that is particularly sensitive to winter severity. We tested four competing hypotheses by comparing the time spent at feeding station sites by 180 individual Global Positioning System-collared roe deer from nine populations spanning a wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradient. We found that roe deer used feeding station sites highly opportunistically in response to winter severity across its range. The harshest weather conditions at the northern range limit or the highest elevations provoked an intense use of feeding station sites, which typically peaked at the end of winter, in accordance with the adverse weather and nutritional condition hypotheses. Consistently, milder winters corresponded to a reduced and/or more homogeneous use of supplemental feeding. In general, intensively used feeding station sites heavily conditioned spatial behavior of roe deer. Importantly, biotic factors such as the presence of competitors decreased roe deer use of supplemental feeding station sites. Our results emphasize the importance of this human-induced alteration to resource distribution, especially in the context of the rapidly occurring climate change that is modifying resource availability for ungulate populations.

AB  - Methods for assessing wetland conditions must be established so wetlands can be monitored and ecological services can be protected. We evaluated biological indices compiled from macroinvertebrate and diatom metrics developed primarily for streams to assess their ability to indicate water quality in connected depression wetlands. We collected water-quality and biological samples at 24 connected depressions dominated by water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) or bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) (water depths = 0.5-1.0 m). Water quality of the least-disturbed connected depressions was characteristic of swamps in the southeastern USA, which tend to have low specific conductance, nutrient concentrations, and pH. We compared 162 macroinvertebrate metrics and 123 diatom metrics with a water-quality disturbance gradient. For most metrics, we evaluated richness, % richness, abundance, and % relative abundance values. Three of the 4 macroinvertebrate metrics that were most beneficial for identifying disturbance in connected depressions decreased along the disturbance gradient even though they normally increase relative to stream disturbance. The negative relationship to disturbance of some taxa (e.g., dipterans, mollusks, and crustaceans) that are considered tolerant in streams suggests that the tolerance scale for some macroinvertebrates can differ markedly between streams and wetlands. Three of the 4 metrics chosen for the diatom index reflected published tolerances or fit the usual perception of metric response to disturbance. Both biological indices may be useful in connected depressions elsewhere in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain Ecoregion and could have application in other wetland types. Given the paradoxical relationship of some macroinvertebrate metrics to dissolved O-2 (DO), we suggest that the diatom metrics may be easier to interpret and defend for wetlands with low DO concentrations in least-disturbed conditions.

AB  - Current concerns about climate change emphasize the need for an accurate monitoring of physiological conditions in wild populations. Therefore, the aims of this work were to a) assess the response of the octocoral Veretillum cynomorium to thermal variation in natural populations during low tide, by quantifying several biochemical indicators of thermal and oxidative stress and b) evaluate the effect of seasonality in the results and the adequacy of the use of biochemical indicators of stress in field monitoring studies in octocorals. Sampling took place during spring (April) and summer (June). Heat shock protein (Hsp70) and ubiquitin (Ub) content, enzyme activities - superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were assessed in rachis and peduncle tissues separately. The results showed significant seasonal fluctuations in the set of biomarkers tested. Differences were detected between spring and summer, with significant decreases in biomarker levels from April to June being a major observed trend. These results suggest that V. cynomorium is thermo-tolerant during summer low tide conditions. Seasonal variation seems to reflect a metabolic suppression strategy and/or may also be related to seasonal changes in food availability and reproductive status. Differences in activity between tissue types were also found significant for GST, LPO and Ub. Biomarker levels were correlated with total protein concentration, but not with wet body weight of the specimens. This study suggests that season influences the expression of biomarkers and must be taken into consideration in the preliminary stages of sampling design for climate change biomonitoring studies. In addition, the results suggest that this octocoral species is likely to survive in future challenging thermal conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Livestock production is the most Important component of northern European agriculture and contributes to and will be affected by climate change. Nevertheless, the role of farm animal genetic resources in the adaptation to new agro-ecological conditions and mitigation of animal production's effects on climate change has been inadequately discussed despite there being several important associations between animal genetic resources and climate change issues. The sustainability of animal production systems and future food security require access to a wide diversity of animal genetic resources. There are several genetic questions that should be considered in strategies promoting adaptation to climate change and mitigation of environmental effects of livestock production. For example, it may become important to choose among breeds and even among farm animal species according to their suitability to a future with altered production systems. Some animals with useful phenotypes and genotypes may be more useful than others in the changing environment. Robust animal breeds with the potential to adapt to new agro-ecological conditions and tolerate new diseases will be needed. The key issue in mitigation of harmful greenhouse gas effects induced by livestock production is the reduction of methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants. There are differences in CH4 emissions among breeds and among individual animals within breeds that suggest a potential for improvement in the trait through genetic selection. Characterization of breeds and individuals with modern genomic tools should be applied to identify breeds that have genetically adapted to marginal conditions and to get critical information for breeding and conservation programs for farm animal genetic resources. We conclude that phenotyping and genomic technologies and adoption of new breeding approaches, such as genomic selection introgression, will promote breeding for useful characters in livestock species.

AB  - Riparian ecosystem services along higher-order streams and connected tributaries may change over time as disturbances continuously increase, resulting in diverse deterioration of buffer zones. How habitat, plant cover, regeneration, erosion, and exotic parameters (riparian health conditions) change within huge dams and reservoirs worldwide is an unanswered question. We used multivariate statistical techniques to assess changes in riparian health parameters affected by disturbances identified in 304 transects within the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir, China, and associated tributaries. Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.01) revealed high diversity in habitat, plant cover, regeneration, erosion, and overall stream condition. There was also notable variance relating to exotic and pressure parameters. The critical variables of riparian health indicators and stress factors identified by principal component analysis explained 58.40% and 74.6% (in the main waterway) and 53.23% and 71.0% (in the tributaries) of the total variance. Among riparian health indicators, one habitat parameter (riparian vegetation width) in the main waterway and one regeneration parameter (tree size classes) in tributaries contributed greatly, along with other specified parameters. Furthermore, stress factors such as farming systems, land-use types, and pollutant activity variables had the highest impact on these water bodies. In comparison, counting stress factors alone showed more deterioration in the main waterway with a range of (r = & minus;0.527- 0.493), as determined using Pearson correlation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, after indexing, the parameters exhibited weaker coefficient values in tributaries, where exotic correlated negatively with other indexed values. These findings are relevant for managers of massive dam and reservoir ecosystems seeking to mitigate environmental and socioeconomic losses. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ieodo ocean research station (IORS) and the Socheongcho ocean research station (SORS) have been operated in South Korea to carry out a research across multiple disciplines. The IORS and the SORS are affected by various water masses such as Tsushima Warm Current (TWC), Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) and Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW). Therefore, the IORS and the SORS are suitable for the research on the physio-ecological response of phytoplankton to environmental changes. The particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll-a ratio (POC:Chl-a) has been widely used for an indicator of the ecological and physiological conditions of the phytoplankton. The purpose of this study is to investigate the POC:Chl-a ratio and its controlling factors at the IORS and the SORS by using satellite dataset. At the IORS, POC:Chl-a ratio ranged from 166.16 to 431.20, and the average was 322.14 +/- 46.35. On the other hand, at the SORS, POC:Chl-a ratio ranged from 131.92 to 703.98, and the average was 385.05 +/- 123.95. The POC:Chl-a ratio was higher at the SORS from autumn to winter. However, POC:Chl-a ratio in the IORS showed similar ranges in every month. The difference in POC:Chl-a ratio between the IORS and the SORS appear to be caused by differences of environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, and nutrients. However, to reveal the detailed relationship between environmental conditions and POC:Chl-a ratio, a further study on seasonal variations of the phytoplankton community structure and several environmental parameters would be warrant.

AB  - To assess radium (Ra-226) as a potential indicator of impact in well waters, we investigated its behavior under natural conditions using a case study approach. Ra-226 geochemistry was investigated in 67 private wells of southeastern New Brunswick, Canada, a region targeted for potential shale gas exploitation. Objectives were to i) establish Ra-226 baseline in groundwater; ii) characterize Ra-226 spatial distribution and temporal variability; iii) characterize Ra-226 partitioning between dissolved phase and particulate forms in well waters; and iv) understand the mechanisms controlling Ra-226 mobility under natural environmental settings. Ra-226 levels were generally low (median = 0.061 pg L-1, or 2.2 mBq L-1), stable over time, and randomly distributed. A principal component analysis revealed that concentrations of Ra-226 were controlled by key water geochemistry factors: the highest levels were observed in waters with high hardness, and/or high concentrations of individual alkaline earth elements (i.e. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), high concentrations of Mn and Fe, and low pH. As for partitioning, Ra-226 was essentially observed in the dissolved phase (106 +/- 19%) suggesting that the geochemical conditions of groundwater in the studied regions are prone to limit Ra-226 sorption, enhancing its mobility. Overall, this study provided comprehensive knowledge on Ra-226 background distribution at local and regional scales. Moreover, it provided a framework to establish Ra-226 baselines and determine which geochemical conditions to monitor in well waters in order to use this radionuclide as an indicator of environmental impact caused by anthropogenic activities (e.g. unconventional shale gas exploitation, uranium mining, or nuclear generating power plants).

AB  - Aljustrel mines were classified as having high environmental hazard due to their large tailings volume and high metal concentrations in waters and sediments. To assess acid mine drainage impacted systems whose environmental conditions change quickly, the use of biological indicators with short generation time such as diatoms is advantageous. This study combined geochemical and diatom data, whose results were highlighted in 3 groups: Group 1, with low pH (1.9-5.1) and high metal/metalloid (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn; 0.65-1032 mg/L) and SO4 (405-39124 mg/L) concentrations. An acidophilic species, Pinnularia aljustrelica, was perfectly adapted to the adverse conditions; in contrast, teratological forms of Eunotia exigua were found, showing that metal toxicity affected this species. The low availability of metals/metalloids in sediments of this group indicates that metals/metalloids of the exchangeable fractions had been solubilized, which in fact enables metal/metalloid diatom uptake and consequently the occurrence of teratologies; Group 2, with sites of near neutral pH (5.0-6.8) and intermediate metal/metalloid (0.002-6 mg/L) and SO4 (302-2179 mg/L) concentrations; this enabled the existence of typical species of uncontaminated streams (Brachysira neglectissima, Achnanthidium minutissimum); Group 3, with samples from unimpacted sites, showing low metal/metalloid (0-0.8 mg/L) and SO4 (10-315 mg/L) concentrations, high pH (7.0-8.4) and Cl contents (10-2119 mg/L) and the presence of brackish to marine species (Entomoneis paludosa). For similar conditions of acidity, differences in diversity, abundance and teratologies of diatoms can be explained by the levels of metals/metalloids.

AB  - The bryodiversity of nine Spanish Fagus sylvatica forests of four different phytosociological associations was re-studied nearly 30 years after initial sampling. Species richness and composition, Jaccard and Sorensen similarity indexes, and Ellenberg indicator values (E.i.v.) for temperature, nitrogen, light and pH were compared between the two periods of time. Changes were also studied for groups -mosses and liverworts- and habitats -epigeic, epiphytic and epilithic species. Species richness values have not significantly changed in most of the forests, but composition has done, resulting in low similarity values over time. Liverworts and epiphytes were the least sensitive groups to changes. E.i.v. changes showed general trends towards warmer and more nitrophilous, shady and acidic conditions, changes being more consistent in woods located near the limit of survival of beech. The increase in temperature revealed by the E.i.v. has been corroborated with meteorological data. Changes in light conditions under the canopy could be attributed mainly to changes in forestry management. All the forests studied showed a great turnover of species, even though they have different legal protection levels. To our knowledge, all this means that: (a) changes observed in bryodiversity are the consequence of the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors occurring at different scales, (b) the protection of areas or habitats does not prevent them from changing and (c) E.i.v. are a useful tool to detect even subtle changes in protected areas. Protection is not enough; we must have better understanding of ecosystem dynamics in order to establish appropriate conservation policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deciphering evolutionary processes occurring within long-term contaminated wild populations is essential for the ecological risk assessment of persistent chemical contaminations. Using field populations of Gammarus, a commonly-used genus in aquatic ecotoxicology, the present study sought to gain insights into the extent to which long-term exposure to metals in the field could effectively lead to shifts in toxicological sensitivities. For this, we identified a Gammarus population inhabiting a stream contaminated by cadmium (Cd). We compared the Cd-exposure and Cd-sensitivity of this population to those of five reference populations. Active biomonitoring determined in different years and seasons that significant levels of Cd were bioavailable in the contaminated site. Laboratory sensitivity tests under common garden conditions established that this long-term field exposure led to the development of a moderate Cd tolerance, which was maintained after a 3-week acclimatization in the laboratory, and transmitted to offspring produced under clean conditions. The potential physiological costs of tolerance were assessed by means of feeding rate measurements (in the laboratory and in situ). They revealed that, unlike for reference populations, the feeding activity of organisms from the tolerant population was greatly decreased when they were maintained under laboratory conditions, potentially indicating a high population vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Because dissolved Cd concentrations in water from the contaminated site were low (averaging 0.045 A mu g L-1) and below the current European environmental quality standard for Cd for inland surface waters (fixed at 0.08 A mu g L-1 in soft water environments), this case study sheds light onto the extent to which current environmental quality standards are protective against potential adverse outcomes of adaptive and micro-evolutionary processes occurring in contaminated environments.

AB  - The organic-rich Early Silurian sedithents (Longmaxi Formation) on the Yangtze platform are considered to be one of the main source rocks in South China. In order to investigate the mechanism of organic accumulation, multiple geochemical proxies, including redox parameters (S/C and trace-element ratios), productivity indices (P and Ba contents) and clastic influx indicator (Ti/Al ratios), are presented here from the Hehua section, Yichang, Hubei province. The Longmaxi sediments have high TOC contents (3.00 -10.85 %, avg. 5.63 %), low Pyrite sulfur contents (0.42-1.14 %, avg. 0.59 %), high P (0.02-0A4 %, avg. 0.12 %) and Ba contents (576.65-2542.43 ppm, avg. 1592.17 ppm). Calculated S/C, Th/U, Ni/Co, V/Cr and V/(V + Ni) ratios are 0.05-0.24 (avg. 0.12), 0.23-9.86 (avg. 2.30), 2.65-46.24 (avg. 15.46), 0.27-14.42 (avg. 3.75) and 0.36-0.96 (avg. 0.75), respectively. S/C and trace element ratios, together with pyrite morphology, suggest dysoxic/anoxic conditions prevailed during deposition of the Longmaxi intervals, which was mainly caused by a worldwide marine transgression after the melting of Gondwana glaciation. Productivity proxies indicate that the organic-rich Longmaxi sediments were deposited in moderate to high primary productivity water columns. The consistent Ti/Al ratios suggest a rather homogeneous nature for the detrital supply. Geochemical data provide a good constraint on the accumulation of organic matter and relevant oceanic environment. Anoxic conditions, together with relatively high productivity, were likely responsible for the accumulation of organic-rich sediments during the Longmaxi interval. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concentration ratios (CRwo-media) are used in most radioecological models to predict whole-body radionuclide activity concentrations in wildlife from those in environmental media. This simplistic approach amalgamates the various factors influencing transfer within a single generic value and, as a result, comparisons of model predictions with site-specific measurements can vary by orders of magnitude. To improve model predictions, the development of 'condition-specific' CRwo-media values has been proposed (e.g. for a specific habitat). However, the underlying datasets for most CRwo-media value databases, such as the wildlife transfer database (WTD) developed within the IAEA EMRAS II programme, include summarised data. This presents challenges for the calculation and subsequent statistical evaluation of condition-specific CRwo-media values. A further complication is the common use of arithmetic summary statistics to summarise data in source references, even though CRwo-media values generally tend towards a lognormal distribution and should, therefore, be summarised using geometric statistics. In this paper, we propose a statistically-defensible and robust method for reconstructing underlying datasets to calculate condition-specific CRwo-media values from summarised data and deriving geometric summary statistics. This method is applied to terrestrial datasets from the WTD. Statistically significant differences in sub-category CRwo-media values (e.g. mammals categorised by feeding strategy) were identified, which may justify the use of these CRwo-media values for specific assessment contexts. However, biases and limitations within the underlying datasets of the WTD explain some of these differences. Given the uncertainty in the summarised CRwo-media values, we suggest that the CRwo-media approach to estimating transfer is used with caution above screening-level assessments. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Freshwater diatoms are considered to be reliable indicators of the trophic status of rivers and lakes. In the past 30 years, a number of indicator indices have been developed and used for the assessment of trophic conditions all over Europe. It is however still not clear whether the ecologic signature of diatoms differs between these indicator indices. The present study assessed a large number of published European indices on the response of freshwater diatoms to trophic conditions by evaluating the consistency in the use of taxa and their trophic score from seven European indicator indices. The STAR (Standardisations of River Classifications) diatom database, a large set of samples from European running waters, was used to test the application of trophic classifications in water quality assessment. The analysis of taxa in common within the trophic indices showed that there are considerable differences between the indices, for example in the score of trophic values. There was more agreement in classification of taxa within the oligotrophic and the hypertrophic preferences than within the mesotrophic range. Based on these results, a list of diatom taxa, that are consistently used in different trophic indices, was composed. It included 159 'reliable' taxa that are not sensitive to regional setting, water type and taxonomic uncertainty. The list was further accompanied by a description of the taxa's trophic preferences. The large deviation in trophic scores for a number of diatom taxa could most probably be explained by taxonomic uncertainties. Application of these taxa for trophic assessment was questionable. The test set of the 359 STAR samples showed that differences between the trophic indices also lead to a significant variation in the water quality assessment results. Although trophic indices provide an excellent biomonitoring tool, they should be applied with caution, considering the recommendations provided in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine how levels of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) change with succession in forests with different tree species composition. More specifically we ask how ecosystem age interacts with environmental conditions to regulate ES delivery. Using the nationwide Swedish forest inventory, comprising boreal and temperate regions, we investigated how levels of six provisioning, regulating, recreational, and/or cultural forest ESs changed with forest age (10-185 years) in stands of different tree species composition. We also tested whether the number of ESs delivered (i.e. multifunctionality) changed substantially with stand age, using different threshold levels for ES delivery. Accounting for environmental conditions and stand properties, we found that levels of single ESs changed with stand age. Tree biomass production usually peaked in young to medium aged stands. In contrast, production of berries and game, and services related to biodiversity, were typically highest in old stands (120-185 years). Consistent with this strong temporal tradeoff, multifunctionality at lower threshold levels increased with stand age in most monocultures and mixtures, with the highest multifunctionality being reached somewhere between 100 and 185 years, depending on tree species composition. This was not evident for the highest threshold ES level (the top-20%), however. Moreover, multifunctionality usually decreased with warmer climatic conditions, with the exception of spruce-pine-birch mixtures. Taken together, our results show that a reduced forest age, e.g. due to forestry targeting early harvest of stands, most likely would limit the delivery of several ESs valued by society and result in less multifunctional forests. To maintain the capacity of forests to deliver high levels of multiple ESs, the role of stand age and tree species composition should be considered in decisions on how to manage future forests.

AB  - The ecosystems supporting Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchusspp.) are changing rapidly as a result of climate change and habitat alteration. Understanding how-and how consistently-salmon populations respond to changes at regional and watershed scales has major implications for fisheries management and habitat conservation. Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) populations across Alaska have declined over the past decade, resulting in fisheries closures and prolonged impacts to local communities. These declines are associated with large-scale climate drivers, but uncertainty remains about the role of local conditions (e.g., precipitation, streamflow, and stream temperature) that vary among the watersheds where salmon spawn and rear. We estimated the effects of these and other environmental indicators on the productivity of 15 Chinook salmon populations in the Cook Inlet basin, southcentral Alaska, using a hierarchical Bayesian stock-recruitment model. Salmon spawning during 2003-2007 produced 57% fewer recruits than the previous long-term average, leading to declines in adult returns beginning in 2008. These declines were explained in part by density dependence, with reduced population productivity following years of high spawning abundance. Across all populations, productivity declined with increased precipitation during the fall spawning and early incubation period and increased with above-average precipitation during juvenile rearing. Above-average stream temperatures during spawning and rearing had variable effects, with negative relationships in many warmer streams and positive relationships in some colder streams. Productivity was also associated with regional indices of streamflow and ocean conditions, with high variability among populations. The cumulative effects of adverse conditions in freshwater, including high spawning abundance, heavy fall rains, and hot, dry summers may have contributed to the recent population declines across the region. Identifying both coherent and differential responses to environmental change underscores the importance of targeted, watershed-specific monitoring and conservation efforts for maintaining resilient salmon runs in a warming world.

AB  - The Marmara region in northwestern Turkey provides a unique opportunity for studying the vegetation history in response to climate changes and anthropogenic impacts because of its location between different climate and vegetation zones and its long settlement history. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations of the largest lake in the region, Lake Iznik, already registered climate-related changes of the lake level and the lake mixing. However, a palynological investigation encompassing the Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene was still missing. Here, we present the first pollen record of the last ca. 31 ka cal BP (calibrated kilo years before 1950) inferred from Lake Iznik sediments as an independent proxy for paleoecological reconstructions. Our study reveals that the vegetation in the Iznik area changed generally between (a) steppe during glacials and stadials indicating dry and cold climatic conditions, (b) forest-steppe during interstadials indicating milder and moister climatic conditions, and (c) oak-dominated mesic forest during interglacials indicating warm and moist climatic conditions. Moreover, a pronounced succession of pioneer trees, cold temperate, warm temperate, and Mediterranean trees appeared since the Lateglacial. Rapid climate changes, which are reflected by vegetation changes, can be correlated with Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events such as DO-4, DO-3, and DO-1, the Younger Dryas, and probably also the 8.2 event. Since the mid-Holocene, the vegetation was influenced by anthropogenic activities. During early settlement phases, the distinction between climate-induced and human-induced changes of the vegetation is challenging. Still, evidence for human activities consolidates since the Early Bronze Age (ca. 4.8 ka cal BP): cultivated trees, crops, and secondary human indicator taxa appeared, and forests were cleared. Subsequent fluctuations between extensive agricultural uses and regenerations of the natural vegetation become apparent.

AB  - In the Arctic, earlier snowmelt and longer growing seasons due to warming have been hypothesized to increase vegetation productivity. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from both field and satellite measurements as an indicator of vegetation phenology and productivity, we monitored spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation growth for a coastal wet sedge tundra site near Barrow, Alaska over three growing seasons (2000-2002). Contrary to expectation, earlier snowmelt did not lead to increased productivity. Instead, productivity was associated primarily with precipitation and soil moisture, and secondarily with growing degree days, which, during this period, led to reduced growth in years with earlier snowmelt. Additional moisture effects on productivity and species distribution, operating over a longer time scale, were evident in spatial NDVI patterns associated with microtopography. Lower, wetter regions dominated by graminoids were more productive than higher, drier locations having a higher percentage of lichens and mosses, despite the earlier snowmelt at the more elevated sites. These results call into question the oft-stated hypothesis that earlier arctic growing seasons will lead to greater vegetation productivity. Rather, they agree with an emerging body of evidence from recent field studies indicating that early-season, local environmental conditions, notably moisture and temperature, are primary factors determining arctic vegetation productivity. For this coastal arctic site, early growing season conditions are strongly influenced by microtopography, hydrology, and regional sea ice dynamics, and may not be easily predicted from snowmelt date or seasonal average air temperatures alone. Our comparison of field to satellite NDVI also highlights the value of in-situ monitoring of actual vegetation responses using field optical sampling to obtain detailed information on surface conditions not possible from satellite observations alone.

AB  - Eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies is a major threat to the ecosystem services. Many studies have focused on using surface or near surface phytoplankton biomass to determine trophic status or bloom conditions. However, surface phytoplankton biomass can change quickly due to the vertical migration of phytoplankton. A more appropriate indicator is column integrated biomass which considers the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton. In this study, we estimated the spatial and temporal dynamics of column integrated biomass in a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Chaohu in China, using a biomass estimation algorithm and fourteen years of satellite data. The built algorithm was validated by in situ datasets with a significant correlation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89, mean absolute relative difference, MARD = 25.97%, the root-mean-square error, RMSE = 20.17 mg.m(-2).
   We decomposed the temporal dynamics of the satellite-based time series into inter-annual trends, seasonal and irregular behaviors of biomass in different lake sections. We compared these individual dynamics to nutrients, meteorological and climate variables, in particular with respect to ongoing effort to manage nutrients in this complex lake and catchment. Nutrient concentrations were shown to be determinant in the inter-annual trends. Irregular variation of biomass was found to be sensitive to global climate change events (ENSO) which influence regional conditions of precipitation and temperature. By taking the vertical profile of phytoplankton into consideration, the derived temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton biomass, rather than surface biomass, provided new sights into lake conditions and were seen to be a good support for lake management efforts.

AB  - High-latitude regions are experiencing rapid and extensive changes in ecosystem composition and function as the result of increases in average air temperature. Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map near-surface permafrost through decision and regression tree approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated medium-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout mainland Alaska. Our calibrated models (overall test accuracy of similar to 85%) were used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. Models indicate that near-surface permafrost underlies 38% of mainland Alaska and that near-surface permafrost will disappear on 16 to 24% of the landscape by the end of the 21st Century. Simulations suggest that near-surface permafrost degradation is more probable in central regions of Alaska than more northerly regions. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures. Additionally, warmer and drier conditions may increase fire activity and severity, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and carbon remobilization relative to climate alone. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Aims The reproductive costs for individuals with the female function have been hypothesized to be greater than for those with the male function because the allocation unit per female flower is very high due to the necessity to nurture the embryos until seed dispersal occurs, while the male reproductive allocation per flower is lower because it finishes once pollen is shed. Consequently, males may invest more resources in growth than females. This prediction was tested across a wide geographical range in a tree with a dimorphic breeding system (Fraxinus ornus) consisting of males and hermaphrodites functioning as females. The contrasting ecological conditions found across the geographical range allowed the evaluation of the hypothesis that the reproductive costs of sexual dimorphism varies with environmental stressors.
   Methods By using random-effects meta-analysis, the differences in the reproductive and vegetative investment of male and hermaphrodite trees of F. ornus were analysed in 10 populations from the northern (Slovakia), southeastern (Greece) and south-western (Spain) limits of its European distribution. The variation in gender-dimorphism with environmental stress was analysed by running a meta-regression between these effect sizes and the two environmental stress indicators: one related to temperature (the frost-free period) and another related to water availability (moisture deficit).
   Key Results Most of the effect sizes showed that males produced more flowers and grew more quickly than hermaphrodites. Gender differences in reproduction and growth were not minimized or maximized under adverse climatic conditions such as short frost-free periods or severe aridity. e
   Conclusions The lower costs of reproduction for F. ornus males allow them to grow more quickly than hermaphrodites, although such differences in sex-specific reproductive costs are not magnified under stressful conditions.

AB  - The study of intermittent rivers is a critical and timely issue due to their worldwide increase, triggered by several causes including climate change. The need to understand the response of intermittent river biota to water intermittency led us to conduct this study using benthic diatoms collected in southern Portugal. Benthic diatoms were explored in terms of assemblages, diversity indices, the Specific Pollution Sensitivity (SPI) Index, functional metrics (i.e. ecological guilds and life-forms) and conservation status. We verified that changes in water physicochemical characteristics were highly controlled by flow intermittency, which in turn is directly linked to meteorological variables (air temperature and precipitation). Changes in diatom assemblages reflect the aquatic regime of sites, changes in aquatic states through time and mesohabitats (dry biofilm, samples collected in pools or under flowing conditions). Species richness, on the other hand, did not reflect these differences, whilst Shannon diversity and Pielou's Evenness indices only reflected mesohabitat differences. The SPI distinguished sampling periods, and mesohabitats. The relative abundance of ecological guilds changed with aquatic states, with the low-profile guild dominating in eurheic and arheic conditions (except during Summer), being replaced by motile taxa in summer arheic conditions, reflecting increases in nutrient and siltation. The hypothesis that benthic diatom assemblages in dry biofilm can be used as an indicator of ecological status during the dry-phase was vali-dated, since no differences between the Ecological Quality Ratio determined in dry biofilm collected in Summer 2017 and the previous Spring 2017 in flowing water. A method is proposed for diatom sampling in thy biofilm, contributing to an integrated ecological status evaluation, which considers the dry-phase and enhances the reach of biomonitoring programs.

AB  - The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is an important ecological and commercial species along the Eastern Seaboard of North America, although its abundance in Chesapeake Bay (Maryland and Virginia) has declined precipitously since the mid-1800s. Management activities, including efforts to enhance larval settlement, to rebuild the Chesapeake Bay eastern oyster population have met with limited success. Since 1939, juvenile oyster abundance has been measured at oyster bars in the northern portion of Chesapeake Bay. Prior analyses of those data indicate that juvenile oyster abundance is influenced by environmental conditions, which are related to regional climate. We quantified a regional scale (1,000km(2)) climate signal using a synoptic climatology approach by identifying predominant weather patterns. We related these weather patterns to Susquehanna River freshwater discharge, a major influencing factor on Chesapeake Bay salinity, and the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI), an indicator of the overall wetness or dryness of a given region. We developed path analysis models that linked weather patterns to Susquehanna River discharge and thence to either the PHDI or ambient salinity and water temperature and finally to juvenile oyster abundance in one of four preidentified spatial groupings. The path models indicated that weather patterns that produce wet conditions, leading to a higher PHDI and lower salinity, resulted in reduced juvenile oyster abundance; weather patterns that produce dry conditions that decreased the PHDI and increased salinity resulted in higher juvenile oyster abundance. Our results indicate that regions of higher juvenile oyster abundance may be predicted several months in advance using the path model. These predictions can be used to increase the effectiveness of oyster restoration efforts by indicating where hard substrate added to oyster bars in the four regions is likely to result in greater than average numbers of juvenile oysters.

AB  - In this paper, temporal dynamics of eco-environmental changes in coastal areas of China during 1981-2000 are investigated based on four key surface parameters including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), thermal index, moisture index and surface broadband albedo derived from quantitative remote sensing techniques and meteorological data. Firstly, land surface temperature (LST) and land surface broadband albedo are retrieved by the split-window algorithms and high-order polynomial regression method, respectively, using NOAA/AVHRR series images. Then, moisture index and thermal index, indicators of climate and moisture conditions in the study area, are computed from meteorological data and LST using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, long-term dynamics of these eco-environmental factors and the reasons responsible for these changes are analyzed further. The results show that during the years from 1981 to 2000, the study area experienced a gradual increase in annual NDVI and climate factors and a decrease in surface annual broadband albedo, which indicates that the coastal thermal and moisture conditions and the subsistence conditions of natural vegetation have changed to a considerable extent. According to the results, a warming and wetting tendency over the last two decades is obvious in the China's coastal zone that are mainly due to land use changes as of growing urbanization, exhaust emissions from industries and transportations and, partly global climate change. Uncontrolled rapid development of the study area may be blamed for these negative changes as a major driving force. The positive feedback mechanisms between albedo, NDVI and climate factors also partly explain these changes. This study suggests that the method integrating biophysical parameters retrieved from remote sensed images and meteorologic data provides a novel and feasible way to monitor large scale eco-environmental changes.

AB  - Foraging animals interact with their food resources in complex ways, both responding to and creating variation in resource quality, quantity, distribution, and structure. The reciprocity of this interaction means that the value of food resources at any given moment is a property of both the landscape and the foraging animal. Traditional approaches to assessing landscape condition for large herbivores have relied upon coarse measurements of vegetation properties such as biomass as though they are equally applicable to all herbivores in the system; however, because different herbivore species will have differences in the way they perceive vegetation, changes to the quantity and quality of vegetation in a landscape will be interpreted differently by different herbivore species. This variation means that vegetation measurements often fail to adequately capture the true value of a resource for a foraging animal. We advocate a new approach to assessing landscape conditions for large herbivores. It invokes the use of behavioral indicators to measure the value of "foodscapes" to foraging animals. Foodscapes are inherently animal-centric, and are defined by using foraging behavior to measure the value that an animal places on the vegetation within its environment. In effect, foodscapes define what the "resource" is to the animal. We demonstrate our approach by summarizing the behavioral responses of grazing ruminants to two very relevant drivers of ecosystem change, CO2 enrichment and land-use change. We use these responses to develop a suite of behavioral indicators that are sufficient to detect critical changes in the value of the foodscape for grazing ruminants. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for using behavioral indicators to enable early detection of critical changes in forage value that would fail to be recognized by traditional approaches.

AB  - The biogeography in the Western and Central Pacific of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) is analysed with respect to their diversity, diet, size and behaviour. This analysis, based on data from 48 islands, is used to discuss some of the assumptions underlying the use of these fishes as indicators of reef ecological condition and in reef fish monitoring programmes.
   2. The diversity of butterflyfishes is highly correlated to total diversity, and the relative importance of butterflyfishes for total diversity decreases as total diversity increases.
   3. Factors found significant in explaining butterflyfish diversity were distance to the biodiversity centre, island size and connectivity, the variance explained by these factors being at least 81%. Latitude, terrestrial influence and reef development were not significant.
   4. Feeding categories of butterflyfishes are not randomly distributed over their range: coral feeders and other sessile invertebrate feeders are more diverse than expected. The relative diversity of algae-feeding species and generalist feeders decreases with butterflyfish diversity. Small and medium size fishes are less diverse than expected, large fishes are more diverse than expected.
   5. Local species composition of butterflyfish may not reflect species composition at a larger scale, in particular biological and ecological traits are not necessarily distributed similarly at different spatial scales.
   6. The geographical distribution of butterflyfishes in the Western and Central Pacific suggests that the best conditions for using these fish as indicators of reef ecological condition should be found in islands with average diversity, i.e. not too close to the biodiversity centre, nor too large. The distribution of butterflyfish suggests that their use in monitoring programmes should take into account the geographical variations of their biological and ecological traits.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate Scots pine stand degradation caused by the pollutants emitted from Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy, one of the biggest polluters of the environment in Poland for over 25 years (1966-1990). To assess the pollution stress in trees, we chose the dendrochronological analysis We outlined three directions for our research: (i) the spatio-temporal distribution of the growth response of trees to the stress associated with air pollution; (ii) the direct and indirect effects of air pollution which may have influenced the growth response of trees; and (iii) the role of local factors, both environmental and technological, in shaping the growth response of trees. Eight Scots pine stands were selected for study, seven plots located in different damage zones and a reference plot in an undamaged stand. We found that pollutant emission caused disturbances of incremental dynamics and long-term strong reduction of growth. A significant decrease in growth was observed for the majority of investigated trees (75%) from 1966 (start of factory) to the end of the 1990s. The zone of destruction extended primarily in easterly and southern directions, from the pollution source, associated with the prevailing winds of the region. At the end of the 1990s, the decreasing trend stopped and the wider tree-rings could be observed. This situation was related to a radical reduction in ammonia emissions and an improvement in environmental conditions. However, the growth of damaged trees due to the weakened health condition is lower than the growth of Scots pine on the reference plot and trees are more sensitive to stressful climatic conditions, especially to drought.

AB  - The occurrence of volunteer maize plants in subsequent crops as well as of feral maize plants in non-agricultural areas is an essential issue in risk assessments of genetically modified (GM) maize, with regard to possible contamination of natural habitats with GM material and as contribution to the total adventitious GM content of the non-GM final product. The appearance of feral maize plants has been confirmed for non-agricultural habitats in European areas with Mediterranean climate such as Spain. However, the existence of maize volunteers and feral maize outside cultivation under Central European continental climatic conditions is considered to be extremely unlikely in those winter-cold areas. Here, field observations during 5 years (2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2015) in Austria are presented that confirm the occurrence of volunteer and feral maize under Central European climatic conditions. Most of these plants produced fertile inflorescences with viable pollen and fully developed cobs. Maize kernels may reach the soil by disintegration of cobs due to disease, using crushed maize cobs for game-feeding, left overs in manure dispersed during fertilisation or from transporting and handling of crushed cobs. The evidence of volunteer and feral maize in four Federal States in Austria (Burgenland, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria) emphasises the necessity to consider these hitherto under-emphasised factors in an ecological risk assessment (ERA) of GM maize as a possible source for transgenes in non-agricultural habitats, because these plants could act as bridge for the spread of GM material into semi-natural habitats. In accordance with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which states that in principle maize has the potential to survive as a volunteer or feral plant also in regions with cold winters, the investigation of the frequency of their occurrence under Central European conditions should be part of future monitoring programmes in order to assess their potential for permitting transgene spread.

AB  - In recent years, the world has shown considerable concerns about environmental degradation accompanied by urban expansion. In terms of size, Bogura is equivalent to most of the major cities in Bangladesh, yet no thermal and ecological assessment has ever been conducted here. This study uses multitemporal Landsat satellite images between 2001 and 2020 to investigate the thermal and ecological conditions of Bogura Sadar (sub-district). Land surface temperature (LST) is obtained from Landsat images using the widely used radiative transfer equation. The thermal and ecological conditions are evaluated by computing urban heat island (UHI) and urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) from LST data. The influence of vegetation, built-area, water-body, and bare soil on LST are examined using land cover indices through pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis. According to the findings of this sub-district-scale (urban and rural areas) study, the mean LST has increased by 0.62 degrees C in the last 20 years. As per local administrative-wise findings, LST has increased in most areas, regardless of their urban or rural function. The difference between the urban area and the rest of the surroundings was significant (1.74 degrees C) in 2020. In 2001, UHI affected area was 5.65 km(2), which expanded to 8.84 km(2) in 2020. Thermal and ecological conditions are worse in urban areas than its surrounding areas. The regression models of the LST and land cover indices could explain more than half (R-2: 0.66 to 0.73) of LST variation over the years. Land cover could explain the LST in 2020 to the least extent implying that anthropogenic activities have greater influence than earlier. Land cover could explain less than half of the LST variation in the urban area.

AB  - The Government of the Republic of Korea has enforced strict regulations to improve air quality since the early 2000s. The regulations are mainly focused on reducing vehicle emissions in the Seoul metropolitan region by conforming to the European emissions standards, replacing diesel buses with compressed natural gas buses, incentives for installing diesel exhaust after-treatment systems and buying eco-friendly vehicles. There was a 20% reduction in 2010s compared to the 2000s in terms of the mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with mean aerodynamic diameters of < 10 mu m (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) during cold seasons (October through following February) although the decrease may not be entirely attributable to the regulations. The influences of other external factors such as transboundary transport of air pollutants and regional meteorological conditions cannot be neglected. This study analyzes the change in the diurnal variations & mdash;two maxima at around 11 and 22 local time (LT) and two minima at around 6 and 16 LT & mdash;of air pollutant concentrations that may be closely related to the regulatory action in reducing local vehicle emissions. A reduction of over 40% for the amplitude of two PM concentrations at 11 LT was revealed when values from the 2010s were compared to those from the 2000s. There was a similar reduction for other vehicle exhaust gases including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Additional analysis of the long-term trend in mixed layer height and surface wind speed showed that the change in environmental conditions in the diurnal time scale was either negligible or unfavorable for conditions which reduce PM concentrations. This study suggests that the mean concentration estimation may underestimate the regulatory effects, but the approach based on the diurnal variation may be a more accurate indicator.

AB  - The present study sought to investigate the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) during aerobic biostabilization (AB) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) in forced aerated piles. Understanding the factors influencing CO formation may be important not only for safety, but also for environmental and technical reasons. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the technical parameters of the piles on the concentration of CO in the process gas during AB of the OFMSW in a full-scale waste treatment system: rate of waste aeration (from 3365 to 12,744 m(3)center dot Mg-1), waste mass loads in the pile (from 391 to 702 Mg), thermal conditions, application of sidewalls as an element of pile bioreactor construction, concentration of O-2 and CO2 in the waste piles and the duration of the process from 6 to 9 weeks. The temperature and concentration of O-2, CO2, CO, CH4 were measured in each pile at weekly intervals. All six reactors provide stable thermal and aerobic conditions, but the presence of CO was observed, ranging from a few to over 2000 ppm, which demonstrated that ensuring optimum conditions for the process is not sufficient for CO to be eliminated. A moderate, non-linear rise in CO concentration was observed along with a rise in the temperature inside the reactors. Concentrations of CO were not highly correlated with those of O-2 or CO2. An increase in waste mass loads increased the CO concentration in waste piles, while application of sidewalls decreased CO concentration. Increasing aeration rate had an influence on CO production, and the highest CO concentrations were noted under air flow rate 5.3 m(3)center dot Mg-1 center dot h(-1).

AB  - Kongsfjord and Hornsund are fjords located on the west coast of the island of Spitsbergen that differ in terms of hydrographical conditions and food source availability for benthic organisms. We studied the nematode communities of these two glacial fjords with respect to their morphometric attributes (body length, width, length/width ratio) and biomass (total and individual) to evaluate whether their differences reflect differences in hydrographical and biogeochemical conditions. Sediments collected from Kongsfjord, which contained enhanced marine organic material than sediments from Hornsund, supported nematode communities exhibiting higher biomass and morphological diversity. The roles that the biochemical properties of sediments and food availability play in structuring biological communities were reflected in the wider spectrum of length/width ratio (LAW) and size spectra, with biomass dominance in the higher weight-classes observed in Kongsfjord. In this respect, the appearance of short and plump nematodes in the Kongsfjord nematode assemblage (12% of all nematodes), characterised by a L/W ratio of <12, was striking. This morphotype, which is almost absent in the Hornsund fjord (4%), is considered to be an indicator of well-oxygenated sediments with favourable food sources and may further confirm that the organic material in the Kongsfjord sediments is of higher quality. Furthermore, the homogeneity of sediment composition suggests that the morphological landscape of nematode communities are not structured by granulometry per se, as has been suggested in other studies, but rather by other environmental factors that are indirectly connected with particle size. The results of the present study provide evidence that the morphometric characteristics of nematodes are suitable for detecting differences in sediments, particularly with regard to organic matter availability.

AB  - A habitat-based aquatic macroinvertebrate study was initiated in the Lower Missouri River to evaluate relative quality and biological condition of dike pool habitats. Water-quality and sediment-quality parameters and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure were measured from depositional substrates at 18 sites. Sediment porewater was analysed for ammonia, sulphide, pH and oxidationreduction potential. Whole sediments were analysed for particle-size distribution, organic carbon and contaminants. Field water-quality parameters were measured at subsurface and at the sedimentwater interface. Pool area adjacent and downstream from each dike was estimated from aerial photography. Macroinvertebrate biotic condition scores were determined by integrating the following indicator response metrics: % of Ephemeroptera (mayflies), % of Oligochaeta worms, Shannon Diversity Index and total taxa richness. Regression models were developed for predicting macroinvertebrate scores based on individual water-quality and sediment-quality variables and a water/sediment-quality score that integrated all variables. Macroinvertebrate scores generated significant determination coefficients with dike pool area (R2?=?0.56), oxidationreduction potential (R2?=?0.81) and water/sediment-quality score (R2?=?0.71). Dissolved oxygen saturation, oxidationreduction potential and total ammonia in sediment porewater were most important in explaining variation in macroinvertebrate scores. The best two-variable regression models included dike pool size?+?the water/sediment-quality score (R2?=?0.84) and dike pool size?+?oxidationreduction potential (R2?=?0.93). Results indicate that dike pool size and chemistry of sediments and overlying water can be used to evaluate dike pool quality and identify environmental conditions necessary for optimizing diversity and productivity of important aquatic macroinvertebrates. A combination of these variables could be utilized for measuring the success of habitat enhancement activities currently being implemented in this system. Published in 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study proposes a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment. All organizations in private and public sectors produce not only desirable (good) but also undesirable (bad) outputs as a result of their economic activities. The proposed use of DEA determines the level of unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of all the organizations. A contribution of this study is that it explores how to measure not only RTS (Returns to Scale) on desirable outputs but also a new concept regarding "DTS: Damages to Scale" (corresponding to RTS for undesirable outputs). This study discusses how to measure RTS under natural disposability and DTS under managerial disposability by DEA. The measurement of RTS and DTS is formulated by incorporating "Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions (SCSCs)". As a result, this study can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections in the RTS/DTS measurement. The incorporation of SCSCs makes it possible both to restrict DEA multipliers in a specific range without any prior information and to identify all possible efficient organizations as a reference set. Using the unique capabilities of SCSCs, this study discusses the use of DEA environmental assessment by exploring how to classify the type of RTS/DTS with SCSCs. Such analytical capabilities are essential, but not previously explored in DEA environmental assessment for energy industries. As an illustrative example, this study applies the proposed approach for the performance evaluation of Japanese manufacturing industries. This study finds that these firms need to introduce technology innovation to reduce an amount of greenhouse gases and wastes. The empirical result confirms the importance of measuring RTS/DTS in DEA environmental assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For many animals and insects that are experiencing dramatic population declines, the only recourse for conservationists is captive rearing. To ensure success, reared individuals should be biologically indistinct from those in the wild. We tested if this is true with monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, which are increasingly being reared for release by citizens and commercial breeders. Since late-summer monarchs should be as migration capable as possible for surviving the arduous long-distance migration, we evaluated four migration-relevant traits across two groups of captive-reared monarchs (n = 41 and 42) and one group of wild-caught migrants (n = 41). Monarchs (descendants of wild individuals) were reared from eggs to adulthood either in a warm indoor room next to a window, or in an incubator that mimicked late-summer conditions. Using an apparatus consisting of a perch mounted to an electronic force gauge, we assessed 'grip strength' of all groups, then used image analysis to measure forewing size, pigmentation and elongation. In three of the four traits, reared monarchs underperformed compared to wild ones, even those reared under conditions that should have produced migration-ready individuals. The average strength of reared monarchs combined was 56% less than the wild group, even when accounting for size. Their orange wing colour was paler (an indicator of poor condition and flight ability) and their forewings were less elongated (elongation is associated with migration propensity) than wild monarchs. The reason(s) behind these effects is unknown but could stem from the frequent disturbance and/or handling of reared monarchs, or the fact that rearing removes the element of natural selection from all stages. Regardless, these results explain prior tagging studies that showed reared monarchs have lower migratory success compared to wild.

AB  - The present study analyzes the spatial distribution and seasonal distribution of live benthic foraminiferal communities in the estuary of Guadiana, the fourth largest river on the Iberian Peninsula, and establishes, through statistical analysis, their relationships with a series of environmental parameters. Forty-four superficial sediment samples were collected along distance-to-sea and elevation gradients in the winter and summer of 2010. Fifty-three foraminifera species were identified along the intertidal margins of the estuary. Foraminiferal distribution reflected seasonal variation of environmental factors, whose relative importance varied according to species tolerances. Elevation in relation to mean sea level appeared to be the most important parameter controlling foraminiferal distribution, probably because it combines the effects of a series of other variables (i.e. organic matter, sediment texture, pH and temperature). In the highest marsh areas, where environmental conditions approach survival thresholds, only some agglutinated species are able to survive. In the lower intertidal zone, where subaerial exposure is diminished and environmental conditions are generally less variable, more diverse faunas, mainly composed of calcareous species, prevail. During winter, when fluvial discharge peaks, agglutinated species represent more than 80% of the total individuals. In summer, when marine conditions prevail, calcareous species become more competitive, increase their densities and expand into higher marsh zones and estuarine upper reaches. In the estuary, three different foraminiferal assemblages are distinguished: i) Miliammina fusca assemblage, which dominates in unvegetated areas of the lower marsh and tidal flats of the mid-upper estuary; ii)Jadammina macrescens assemblage, which dominates in the highest marsh areas in the lower estuary; and iii) Ammonia aberdoveyensis assemblage, which dominates the areas of low marsh and tidal flats of the lower estuary.

AB  - The distribution patterns of surface sediment diatom assemblages from 49 lakes were used to explore the relationship between limnological variables and diatom assemblages as well as to assess an ecological classification system as a tool for the management and conservation of Icelandic freshwaters. Lakes were limnologically diverse ranging from deep, oligotrophic, ionically dilute lakes, to shallow lakes with a wide range of nutrient and ionic contents. Physical conditions (depth, surface area, surface water temperature) and nutrient and ion concentrations differed significantly among ecological lake categories (i.e., plateau, spring-fed, direct-runoff, valley, glacial, and coastal lakes) (ANOVA, p <0.05). Diatom assemblages were taxonomically diverse (329 taxa) with strong representation of planktonic, benthic and periphytic forms. Small benthic Fragilaria sensu lato (19 species and varieties) were the most abundant with combined abundances >20 % in all but 4 of the lakes, most likely due to the generally cold lake water conditions in this subarctic region. Variation in diatom distributions was best explained by the combination of mean depth (influencing littoral versus planktonic habitats), surface water temperature, specific conductivity, alkalinity, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and SiO2 in a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). However, these variables did not explain distribution patterns amongst small benthic Fragilaria taxa, although some weak relationships between some taxa and these variables were evident. Distinct diatom assemblages and limnological properties among ecological lake categories support the classification of Icelandic freshwaters based on major topographic, geological and hydrological characteristics. More detailed inclusion of lake depth along with lake basin form, as well as more refined categories of lake water origin and topographical positioning to better approximate regional climatic conditions, may improve the ecological classification of Icelandic freshwaters for conservation and management practices.

AB  - The Ecological Footprint (EF) is used to understand the relationship between human activities and pressure on land and its resources. The present study combined multifunctional ecological footprint with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate environmental impacts of inefficient use of resources of silage corn production in the Sarayan County, Iran. In this applied survey research, data were collected using a questionnaire accompanied by face-to-face interviews with 42 farmers (N=48). Validity of the instrument was approved by a panel of experts; while its reliability was secured via pretest-posttest method. Results showed that mean technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency were 0.86, 0.93, and 0.80; respectively. The CO2 footprints were 0.95 and 0.83 gha under current and optimum conditions; respectively, with electricity and manure comprising the highest and lowest shares. The Ecological footprint land- (gha gha(-1) farm), yield- (gha ton(-1)) and revenue-based (gha $(-1) 1,000) EFs were estimated to be 1.6, 0.84, and 1.4 under current conditions but 1.57, 0.081, and 1.33 under optimum conditions, respectively. When the resources were used efficiently, the EFCO2 and EF improved by 13.42 and 3.35% respectively, in which the highest shares in terms of quantity and percentage belonged to electricity, manure and fertilizer. Findings implied that optimum usage of electricity and fertilizer could play a significant role in mitigating environmental impacts of silage corn production in Sarayan. Local agricultural extension should focus on introduction of innovative irrigation systems to reduce water, electricity and fertilizer consumption. Meanwhile, to improve silage corn efficiency, farm size expansion is recommended based on the DEA findings.

AB  - In contrast to Europe, the USA and South Africa, Australia has no specific, overarching federal legislation to underpin a nationally-coordinated framework for monitoring, assessing and reporting estuarine condition. This has resulted in a complex mosaic of diverse approaches and governance structures, hindering the ability to-make inter-State comparisons. In this second part of a comprehensive three-part review, we present a systematic appraisal of current and impending approaches for measuring and reporting estuarine condition in each of Australia's States and Territories. A concise summary is provided in each case, supported by extensive appendices containing detailed accounts of relevant monitoring and reporting programs. We synthesise and evaluate this output at the State/Territory level, highlighting areas of improvement and major gaps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental process descriptors are necessary to evaluate the fate and transport of munitions constituents that have been introduced into the environment. An extensive database exists for freshwater environments; however, explosives fate and transport parameters such as dissolution rates, transformation rates, and adsorption of explosives have not been evaluated under both freshwater and saline conditions to determine the applicability of the freshwater data to saline environments. The objective of this study was to determine if freshwater fate and transport processes were similar to those determined under saline water conditions. We evaluated TNT, RDX, and HMX dissolution rates, transformation rates, and adsorption under freshwater and saline conditions in batch tests. Results showed a generally close agreement. Therefore, the existing freshwater database for explosives fate and transport process descriptors can be used in marine environments. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ADULT male hamsters and rats were reared for 2 months in either an isolated condition (IC) or a social condition (SC). The lengths of synaptic active zones (SAZ) of synapses in the granule cell layer of the accessory olfactory bulb were measured as an indicator of synaptic size in perforated and non-perforated synapses. In the hamster, the SAZ of both perforated and non-perforated synapses were larger in animals reared in the SC, compared to those of animals reared in the IC. In the rat, only the SAZ of non-perforated synapses was larger in the SC animals, compared with those reared in IC. These results indicate that rearing conditions affect synaptic structure, with the morphological change being more pronounced in hamsters than in rats.

AB  - The use of EO (essential oils) either alone or in mixture has become a very attractive option as a green method to remove biological infestation from outdoor stone, but it still needs research for defining the most appropriate conditions of application. The aim of this paper is to screen the effectiveness of seven plant EO (alone or in combinations) taking into account key factors for obtaining a satisfactory treatment, such as: (i) the proper concentration/application timing ratio and (ii) the best poultice to enhance the performance of EO. Several combinations of these factors were applied on a marble slab naturally colonized mainly by phototrophs. The assessment of the organisms vitality, as an indicator of the treatment efficiency, was tested by using two portable and non-invasive techniques with an immediate response: the autofluorescence of the phototrophic pigments and bioluminescence of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule. Microphotography and colour measurements were also used. The most efficient treatment was then successfully applied on a real marble statue (Archaeological Museum of Florence, Italy).

AB  - Good indoor air quality (IAQ) in buildings provides a comfortable and healthy environment for the occupants to work, learn, study, etc. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the IAQ status in the buildings. This study is aimed to establish and demonstrate the comprehensive IAQ audit approach for public buildings, based on Portugal national laws. Four public buildings in Portugal are used to demonstrate the IAQ audit application. The systematic approach involves the measurement of physical parameters (temperature, relative humidity, and concentration of the suspended particulate matter), monitoring of the concentrations of selected chemical indicators [carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ozone, and total volatile organic compounds], and the measurements of biological indicators (bacteria and fungi). In addition, air exchange rates are measured by the concentration decay method using metabolic CO2 as the tracer gas. The comprehensive audits indicated some situations of common IAQ problems in buildings, namely: (1) insufficient ventilation rate, (2) too high particle concentration; and (3) poor filtration effectiveness and hygienic conditions in most of the air handling units. Accordingly, a set of recommendations for the improvement of IAQ conditions were advised to the building owner/managers.

AB  - The validity of the haematocrit or packed cell volume as an indicator of condition in wild birds has recently been questioned. We reviewed over 300 published papers on haematocrit values for wild birds. These studies show that changes in haematocrit could be caused by a number of different natural factors that include age, sex, geographical elevation, energy expenditure, parasitism, nutrition and genetics. Haematocrit also increased with age from hatching, due to increased erythropoiesis, so that adult birds generally have greater haematocrit values than nestlings or juveniles. Haematocrit values were either independent of elevation or increased with elevation. A meta-analysis of 36 studies showed no difference in haematocrit between the sexes. Relationships between haematocrit value and both energy expenditure and parasitic infection vary between studies. In temperate climates, haematocrit tended to be higher in winter than in summer, which may be due to dehydration or increased oxygen demand caused by thermogenesis, moult or acquisition of reproductive status. Our review indicates that the use of haematocrit as a sole indicator of condition or health could lead to incorrect conclusions if natural factors that can affect haematocrit are not taken into consideration.

The changes in diatom community structure and corresponding diversity indices at both large (i.e., variation between sites) and small (i.e., variation between two microhabitats) scales were assessed through time. The results indicated clear spatial patterns at large, but not at small scale, and only limited seasonal dynamics in the diatom community. At the large scale, significant differences in diatom communities among sites were associated with both geographic position and environmental conditions (pH and conductivity). A significant effect of microhabitat type was detectable within sampling sites; the relationship between other factors and species data was not important on a small scale. The results of this study showed that both diatom diversity and community structure are good indicators of ecological heterogeneity associated with relatively high spatial and/or environmental variability. However, subtle differences in environmental conditions are hardly detectable or hidden using traditional diatom species.

AB  - Sustainable use of marine resources requires effective monitoring and management of the world's fish stocks. Acoustic and electromagnetic remote sensing techniques are being used to help manage fisheries at sustainable levels, while also guiding fishing fleets to locate fish schools more efficiently. Fish tend to aggregate in ocean areas that exhibit conditions favored by specific fish species. Some of the relevant oceanographic conditions, such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (productivity) and oceanic fronts, which strongly influence natural fluctuations of fish stocks, can be observed and measured by remote sensors on satellites, aircraft and ships. The remotely sensed data are provided in near-real time to help fishermen save fuel and ship time during their search for fish, to modelers who produce fisheries forecasts, and to scientists who help develop strategies for sustainable fisheries management. This article describes how acoustic, optical and radar sensors on ships, satellites and aircraft are used with forecast models to improve the management and harvesting of fisheries resources.

AB  - The hydrological conditions on a site constitute one of the many factors that may affect the availability of potentially toxic trace metals for uptake by plants. Bioavailability of Cd, Mn and Zn in a contaminated dredged sediment-derived soil under different hydrological regimes was determined by measuring metal uptake by the wetland plant species Salix cinerea, both in field circumstances and in a greenhouse experiment. Longer submersion periods in the field caused lower Cd concentrations in leaves and bark. The wetland hydrological regime in the greenhouse experiment resulted in normal Cd and Zn concentrations in the leaves, while the upland hydrological regime resulted in elevated Cd and Zn concentrations in the leaves. Field observations and the greenhouse experiment suggest that a hydrological regime that creates or sustains a wetland is a potential management option that reduces metal bioavailability to willows. This would constitute a safe management option of metal-polluted, willow-dominated wetlands provided that wetland conditions can be maintained throughout the full growing season.

AB  - Inclusions of mineral forming medium give important information on mineral origin. Applying methods, which are commonly used in studying natural mineral formation conditions, authors attempted to determine specific features of melt inclusions in synthetic ruby, sapphire, emerald, alexandrite and spinel. Crystals grown from melts and flux solutions were studied. The features of inclusion morphology, phase and chemical composition, and conditions of phase transformations are discussed in this paper.
   Inclusions in the synthetic crystals have a number of typomorphous features such as crystalline aggregate as vacuole filling, high temperatures of the phase transformations and specific compositions. These features are not typical of inclusions in natural minerals and permitus to distinguish between natural and synthetic gemstones. They also allow description of some characteristic conditions of gemstone synthesis method.

AB  - The results of studies on the evolution of dark chestnut steppe solonetzic soil under conditions of different uses (virgin lands - from "Askania-Nova" reservation, irrigated and non-irrigated) and climate aridization are presented. It is shown that under the influence of agricultural use, in the arable and long-term irrigated soils with fresh water, the direction of soil formation processes changes. This process affects the properties of soils and the ecosystem services that it provides. The upper part of the soil profile is transformed into a qualitatively new cultivated horizon with altered properties due to soil cultivation and irrigation water action. Irrigation with fresh water promoted the desalinization of the naturally solonetzic virgin soil. The content of Na + K from the sum of the absorbed cations is reduced, from 4.3% to 3.3% (0-25 cm) and from 3.6% to 2.4% (25-50 cm). Due to agriculture use, as well as irrigation by sprinkling, there have been changes in agrophysical indicators of virgin soil. They consist of compaction, structural state deterioration, decrease in the strength of the microstructure and the water resistance of aggregates of dark chestnut steppe soil.

AB  - The cowpea is a Fabaceae originated in Africa cultivated in the northern and northeastern of Brazil, where stands out as the main source of protein for the population. For the establishment of culture, seeds are treated to control and prevent pest attacks and diseases, can also attach nutrients to the seeds which will be available for plant development. The objective of the research was to evaluate the performance of cowpea seeds treated with chemical products and stored in controlled and uncontrolled temperature and humidity conditions. The following seeds treatments were applied: control (no treatment); micronutrient Comol 118, insecticide thiamethoxam, fipronil and pyraclostrobin+thiophanate-methyl and imidacloprid+thiodicarb were then stored in a cold environment and natural. The assessment of physiological seed quality was made initially and every 45 days through the germination and vigor. Among all products used, the imidacloprid + thiodicarb and fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate methyl provides stimulating effect on seed performance; seeds treated with thiamethoxam were less affected by storage than the untreated seeds; seeds treated with micronutrients exhibits similar behavior to untreated seeds and storage in a controlled environment better preserves the seed physiological quality.

AB  - In river and stream assessment and management, a persistent question is isolating appropriate indicators of resource condition. We employ qualitative research techniques to identify features of rivers and streams important to the general public in an urbanized arid watershed of the southwestern US, based on interview and focus group data. After detailed analysis of transcriptions, findings were member-checked with new study participants and further revised. Theme frequencies are reported to provide an indication of participants' informational priorities. Recurrent ecological themes were Water, Vegetation, and Fish and Wildlife; recurrent human themes were Garbage and Graffiti, Odor, Infrastructure, Other People, and Noise. Themes are further described along with illustrative quotes from participants. We interpret participant input into actionable metrics which could serve to track resource condition. Results are compared to previous research and current monitoring practice. The findings are particularly relevant for scientists and managers interested in the perspectives on rivers and streams held by residents of urbanized watersheds in arid landscapes.

AB  - Conditions for OM preservation depend on both the chemical nature of constituents and environmental factors. Among known preservation pathways, the selective preservation is based on refractory molecules such as algaenans, which are algal components. So far, ultralaminae have been considered as remains of microalgal cell walls on the basis of microscopic and organic geochemical similarities between fossil kerogen and recent algae. This high-resolution microscopic study focuses on organic matter (OM) from different fossil environments, i.e., from shallow to deep water. This OM is compared with recent organic analogs, i.e., microbial mats and biofilm, using transmission electron microscopy. Four possible origins of ultralaminae can be interpreted: algal and bacterial cell walls, thylakoids, and filamentous organisms. This highlights the importance of ultralaminae as a major indicator for paleoenvironmental interpretation. The multiple origin of ultralaminae implies new considerations about OM preservation and depositional conditions. In this way, the role of bacteria in OM accumulations can be reevaluated and the presence of ultralaminae such as thylakoids has a potential to become a new indicator of photosynthesis in fossil sediments.

AB  - Geographical variation in birdsong is taxonomically widespread and behaviourally salient, with females often preferring local over non-local song. However, the benefits associated with this preference remain poorly understood. One potential explanation is that song may reflect a male's place of origin and thus allow females to obtain genes well adapted to the local environment. We studied naturally occurring variation in the degree to which the elements of a male's song repertoire matched those of the local population ('syllable sharing') in migratory song sparrows (Melospiza melodia melodia). Syllable sharing was correlated with genetic similarity to the local population, suggesting that song reflects population of origin. Males sharing more syllables also had larger testosterone-dependent traits, fewer blood-borne parasites and reduced indicators of stress. Our findings are consistent with locally good genes models. Alternatively, immigrants' condition may suffer due to unfamiliarity with the breeding site or inability to match song elements during territorial interactions. Females preferring 'local-sounding' males may thus obtain genetic and/or direct benefits for their offspring.

AB  - Acacia trees are a key element in Sahelian semiarid ecosystems, being some of the few tree species surviving in such extreme environments. Understanding their growth dynamics represents a fundamental step to improve forest sustainable management. Dendroclimatology, the study of tree rings and their relationships with climate, could help in understanding how changing climatic conditions may impact these ecosystems. We studied Acacia seyal Delile trees growth in Keita Valley, in the Sahelian zone of Niger. Wood from 8 trees of known age was sampled to study the relationships between growth zones, i.e. ring patterns, and climatic conditions. We present herein, a study based on cross sections instead of cores. Wood-anatomical and dendrochronological analyses enabled us to evaluate the relationships between age and ring formation, and to confirm that one tree ring for rainy season is formed. Moreover, surprisingly for a species growing at such latitudes, acacia tree rings have a climatic signal, mainly due to the precipitation falling during the rainy season but also influenced by the average seasonal temperature.

AB  - The expression of ammonia monooxygenase encoding mRNA (amoA mRNA) in a wastewater treatment process was analyzed in an attempt to propose an effective target for the monitoring of nitrifying bacteria in engineered systems or natural environments. The quick response (1-2 h) of amoA mRNA transcription to the recovery of ammonia oxidation activity induced by the sudden exposure to ammonia was observed in a short-time batch-mode incubation whereas the amount of amoA DNA did not markedly change during the incubation under any conditions. In the continuous feeding-operation, amoA mRNA level dynamically changed in response to the change in the surrounding environmental conditions and increase in ammonia oxidation rate. Although, amoA mRNA level did not quickly respond to the decrease in ammonia oxidation activity, it decreases over long time scales. These results suggest that the profiles of amoA mRNA expression can be used as an indicator of the ammonia oxidation activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA) Project began in 1994 as a partnership between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Region III Office and the Office of Research and Development. This multiyear initiative was envisioned to: (1) improve the quality of environmental science and promote the use of sound science in environmental decision-making; (2) characterize the condition of ecological resources; and (3) report on the progress toward environmental goals through a series of State-of-the-Region reports. These reports are produced using a coordinated, integrated approach that is carried out at four levels of increasing sophistication and complexity. Results indicate that the condition of individual ecological resources can be determined with existing indicators. The results from MAIA are being communicated in a manner that is understood by environmental managers as evidenced by their use in environmental management decision-making. The application of ecological indicators needs to be coupled with an appropriate sampling design to ensure that the measurements made in the environment can be used to address the relevant questions. Multiresource indicators, those that synthesize information on individual ecological resources, are of high priority for research.

AB  - A maximum of landscape diversity is to be regarded as a helpful target as well as an analytical tool to detect actual planning deficits.  First of all, specific indicators and targets for ecosystem and landscape levels will be defined.  Ecosystem types are derived from landscape ecological site conditions, and are combined with the demands of minimal areas related to present and potential ecosystem types.
   The suitability of management practices for the site conditions, and the requirements mentioned above, will together form the basis on which a target landscape in its pattern, and the management practices suggested can be mapped.  In comparison with the present use of the landscape, measures are derived which indicate that the target of a high landscape diversity has real practical meaning:  conversion of about 15% of the arable land into forests and grasslands as one result of this study fits into the political and administrative programmes already established.  In addition, four modification categories of the actual usage are mapped and described in size and number in this case study.  The basic assumptions of this approach will be explained, to provide further working hypotheses for an interdisciplinary and integrative research into landscape ecology in rural landscapes.

AB  - The dechlorination and mineralization of pentachlorophenol (PCP) was investigated by simultaneously or sequentially combining two different anaerobic microbial populations, a PCP-dechlorinating culture capable of the reductive dechlorination of PCP to phenol and phenol-degrading Cultures able to mineralize phenol under sulfate- or iron-reducing conditions. In the simultaneously combined mixture, PCP (about 35 mu M) was mostly dechlorinated to phenol after incubation for 17 days under sulfate-reducing conditions or for 22 days under iron-reducing conditions. Thereafter, the complete removal Of Phenol Occurred within 40 (lays under both conditions. In the sequentially combined mixture, most of the phenol, the end product Of PCP dechlorination, was degraded within 12 days of inoculation with the phenol degrader, without a lag phase, under both sulfate- and iron-reducing conditions. In a radioactivity experiment, [C-14-U]-PCP was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 and (CH4)-C-14 by the combined anaerobic microbial activities. Analysis of electron donor and acceptor utilization and of the production and consumption of H-2, CO2, and CH4 suggested that, the dechlorinating and degrading microorganisms compete with other microorganisms to perform PCP dechlorination and part of the phenol degradation in complex anoxic environments in the presence of electron donors and acceptors. The presence of a small amount Of autoclaved soil slurry in the medium was possibly another advantageous factor in the successful dechlorination and mineralization of PCP by the combined mixtures. This anaerobic-anaerobic combination technology holds great promise is a cost-effective strategy for complete PCP bioremediation in situ. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009;102: 81-90.

AB  - Freezing and thawing sludge has become an economically feasible technique of sludge conditioning in regions where natural freezing is available. Even though the dramatic effects of freeze/thaw on dewatering have been studied extensively, its effects on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms have not been investigated. If freeze/thaw conditioning can be shown to reduce pathogenic microorganisms, then sludges treated in this fashion can be disposed of on land with less risk of health effects. In this paper, the effects of freezing rate, temperature and time in the frozen state on the removal of pathogens are tested. The response of seven indicators of microbial contamination; fecal coliforms, Salmonella, plaque forming units, fecal streptococci, poliovirus, helminths and protozoa to the freeze/thawing of both aerobically and anaerobically digested sludges is examined. Fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and plaque forming units are chosen as the commonly used indicators of bacteria and viruses, respectively in wastewater sludges. Pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella), virus (Poliovirus) and parasites (Ascaris suum and Cryptosporidium parvum) tested in the second phase are chosen as sample microorganisms in their respective classes. Freeze/thaw sludge conditioning is proven to be an effective means of removing most pathogenic microorganisms. Fecal streptococci are found to be the best indicator of the effectiveness of freeze/thawing on enteric bacteria. Results of this study indicate that freeze/thaw conditioning coupled with sludge digestion can significantly enhance the overall pathogenic microorganism reduction achieved in a wastewater treatment plant. Added effectiveness by freeze/thaw treatment may become critical for a plant in meeting the pathogen reduction requirements by U.S. regulations prior to any practice of land application or land disposal of sludge.

AB  - This work aims to discuss mental health from a multidimensional perspective which uses the identification of history, rhythms and particularities of the territories, conducting situational analysis of social and health needs of a population, linked to living conditions, in order to contextualize the process health-illness care. When it comes to rural areas, conditions of vulnerability related to poverty worsen. Socioeconomic indicators show that settlements in the Brazilian Northeast still presents alarming data: Considerable rates of illiteracy, food insecurity and child mortality by today's standards; difficulty in access to public services; poor work conditions and greater reliance on income transfer programs. That means that in the Brazilian countryside there are a complexity of factors and combinations of socioeconomic and environmental risks that produce distress that directly affects mental health.

AB  - Phenology is an indicator of plant response to the environment. In viticulture growth stages timing is important for site and cultivar selection, vineyard planning and cultural practices management. In the last years, autochthonous cultivars obtained an increased interest and, therefore, in this work we studied the phenological performances of Hungarian old varieties. The data recorded in 2012 were compared with the ones published 60 years ago. The examined genotypes were identified by SSR markers. Extremely high temperature and low precipitation occurred during the 2012 vintage. The uncommon weather conditions affected the length of the vegetation period less than expected. However, the time period between flowering and harvest decreased significantly. In general, minor varieties seem to be more sensitive to extreme conditions than international cultivars, according to their eno-carpological characteristics.

AB  - Research on the concentrations of the metals Cu, Cd, Fe, and Mn showed no significant relationships between metal concentrations in water and in brown algae of the Sea of Japan with background concentrations. A significant correlation between metal concentrations in the environment and in the algae was found for zinc; it was the only metal with a wide variation in concentrations exceeding background levels in the habitat of macrophytes. Correspondingly, the only significant correlation between the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of seaweeds from the Sea of Japan and the content of this element in seawater was found for zinc. It was shown for all studied metals that the highest and most variable BAF values for algae were observed within the background range of metal concentrations in the aquatic environment, which allows us to express the background range (the range caused by natural conditions) graphically. Thus, the high variability of the BAF values of aquatic organisms in the background environmental conditions necessitates very cautious interpretation of biomonitoring data.

AB  - One of the most modern possibilities to capitalise on the thermal potential of secondary energetic resources is represented by cogeneration. The paper deals with the installation of a cogeneration system at a baking plant, system which has one thermal engine in order to reduce, on one hand, the losses of thermal energy through burnt gases and on the other hand, the environmental pollution and impact. The baking plant has a continuous yearly operation and in its classical operation scenario it comprise steam and hot water generation, necessary for the technological processes specific to the bread industry. The main problem consists in checking the operation conditions capable of offering natural gas and electricity economies within profitable limits. Identifying the profitability of adopting the cogeneration solution is carried out using comparative determinations which take into consideration energetic, monetary and environmental expenses for different exploitation conditions of the baking plant. Taking into consideration the measured parameters as reference data at the moment of the research, the opportunity and the profitability of using a cogeneration based on an electricity generating driven by a heat engine was assessed.

AB  - Marine clams Ruditapes philippinarum were exposed under laboratory conditions to sediments sampled at five sites affected by wastewater effluents at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain). Contamination and early biological stress were determined. Metabolism and antioxidant system differed according to seasons. Health status diminished in summer. Metabolism of detoxification, and oxidative effect were related to concentration of metals, PAH, secondary alkane sulfonates (SAS) and antibiotics in winter. Antioxidant system and DNA damage were linked to metals and pharmaceutical products. Phase I and antioxidant system were associated to PAH and SAS in summer. Oxidative stress and effects were related to pharmaceuticals. Phase II was linked to metals and pharmaceuticals. Seasonality of sediment contamination by organic compounds and biological responses was determined. Clams were useful bioindicators, since the set of biomarkers applied was validated as potential tools for sediment quality assessment of wastewater discharges areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Genuine saving is a measure of net investment in produced, natural and human capital. It is a necessary condition for weak sustainable development that genuine saving not be persistently negative. However, according to data provided by the World Bank, resource-rich countries are systematically failing to meet this condition. Alongside the well-known resource curse on economic growth, resource abundance might have a negative effect on genuine saving. In fact, the two are closely related, as future consumption growth is limited by insufficient genuine saving now. In this paper, we apply the most convincing conclusion from the literature on economic growth - that it is institutional failure that depresses growth - to data on genuine saving. We regress gross and genuine saving on three indicators of institutional quality in interaction with an indicator of resource abundance. The indicators of institutional quality are corruption, bureaucratic quality and the rule of law. We find that reducing corruption has a positive impact on genuine saving in interaction with resource abundance. That is, the negative effect of resource abundance on genuine saving is reduced as corruption is reduced.

AB  - "Recruitment potential" in Antarctic krill in the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula varied significantly over the 7-yr time series between January 1993 and January 1999. Timing of ovarian maturation, the percent of the population reproducing, and individual reproductive output (batch volume, embryo diameter) were measured. Indices have been developed to quantify the timing and intensity of reproduction in Antarctic krill. One finding important to estimates of population fecundity for this long-lived species is that the percent of the population reproducing can vary widely, from 10 to 98%. Each season was characterized as having delayed, average or advanced ovarian development. In this study we relate these indices to direct and indirect indicators of spring or annual food availability. The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population. Intensity of reproduction was highest under "average" conditions, and oocyte development fastest with conditions of a late retreat and high spring sea ice extent.

AB  - Effects of an individual's genotype on its fitness may vary with environmental conditions or across time. Green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, were collected from a single pond for three consecutive summers (1989-1991) and identified as belonging to one of four groups: calling males, mated males, mated females, and juvenile metamorphs. We used eight polymorphic loci to examine differences among groups and across years. Heterozygosity at the isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH-2) locus was associated with enhanced overwinter survival of juveniles and male mating success; however, the relationship was not consistent across time. The association at the IDH-2 locus may be weak or the result of an interaction and, therefore, seen only under certain conditions. A shift in allelic and genotypic frequencies corresponded to changes in heterozygosity. Although the exact cause of the association is not known, this study illustrates the temporally dynamic nature of the genetics of natural populations. Multilocus heterozygosity did not appear to be a good indicator of survival or mating success in N. cinerea.

AB  - We present a statistical model designed to identify the effect of experimental perturbations on the aggregate behavior of the transcriptome expressed by the bacterium Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195. Strains of Dehalococcoides are used in sub-surface bioremediation applications because they organohalorespire tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene (common chlorinated solvents that contaminate the environment) to non-toxic ethene. However, the biochemical mechanism of this process remains incompletely described. Additionally, the response of Dehalococcoides to stress-inducing conditions that may be encountered at field-sites is not well understood. The constructed statistical model captured the aggregate behavior of gene expression phenotypes by modeling the distinct eigengenes of 100 transcript clusters, determining stable relationships among these clusters of gene transcripts with a sparse network-inference algorithm, and directly modeling the effect of changes in experimental conditions by constructing networks conditioned on the experimental state. Based on the model predictions, we discovered new response mechanisms for DMC, notably when the bacterium is exposed to solvent toxicity. The network identified a cluster containing thirteen gene transcripts directly connected to the solvent toxicity condition. Transcripts in this cluster include an iron-dependent regulator (DET0096-97) and a methylglyoxal synthase (DET0137). To validate these predictions, additional experiments were performed. Continuously fed cultures were exposed to saturating levels of tetrachloethene, thereby causing solvent toxicity, and transcripts that were predicted to be linked to solvent toxicity were monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Twelve hours after being shocked with saturating levels of tetrachloroethene, the control transcripts (encoding for a key hydrogenase and the 16S rRNA) did not significantly change. By contrast, transcripts for DET0137 and DET0097 displayed a 46.8 +/- 11.5 and 14.6 +/- 9.3 fold up-regulation, respectively, supporting the model. This is the first study to identify transcripts in Dehalococcoides that potentially respond to tetrachloroethene solvent-toxicity conditions that may be encountered near contamination source zones in sub-surface environments.

AB  - Extreme environmental conditions, such as drought, are expected to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change, leading to substantial deficiencies in crop yield and quality.Medicago sativa(alfalfa) is an important crop that is relied upon as a staple source of forage in ruminant feed. Despite its economic importance, alfalfa production is constrained by abiotic stress, including drought. In this report, we investigate the role of Squamosa Promoter Binding Protein-Like 9 (SPL9), a target of miR156, in drought tolerance. Transgenic alfalfa plants with RNAi-silencedMsSPL9(SPL9-RNAi) were compared to wild-type (WT) alfalfa for phenotypic changes and drought tolerance indicators. InSPL9-RNAi plants, both stem thickness and plant height were reduced in two- and six-month-old alfalfa, respectively; however, yield was unaffected.SPL9-RNAi plants showed less leaf senescence and had augmented relative water content under drought conditions, indicating thatSPL9-RNAi plants had greater drought tolerance potential than WT plants. Interestingly,SPL9-RNAi plants accumulated more stress-alleviating anthocyanin compared to WT under both drought and well-watered control conditions, suggesting thatMsSPL9may contribute to drought tolerance in alfalfa, at least in part, by regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. The results suggest that targetingMsSPL9is a suitable means for improving alfalfa resilience towards drought conditions.

AB  - The feasible use of electrical conductivity was evaluated in this study for optimizing polymer dosage and mixing time required in the municipal biological wastewater treatment plant sludge conditioning process. The electrical conductivity could be adopted as a key indicator because it is a low cost device with acceptable accuracy and is available in any laboratory. The cationic polymer concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 kg polymer/ton of dry sludge were applied on the 1% solids at different mixing time of 60 minutes. The centrate viscosity was used to determine the optimal dosage of polymer for the sake of comparison to the results obtained from the electrical conductivity. It was found that the electrical conductivity exhibited a similar trend to the kinematic viscosity and provided the same optimal polymer dosage of 4 kg polymer/ton of dry solids. The mixing time requirement for conditioning sludge with polymer monitored by the electrical conductivity at a 5 minute- interval was longer than 55 minutes at the mixing intensity of 120 rpm. The electrical conductivity profiles suggest that sufficient mixing time resulting in the homogenous mixture be provided, so that the optimal polymer dosage could be clearly identified.

AB  - Moss surveys have several advantages over conventional deposition monitoring based on precipitation, and allow the study of regional differences and temporal trends of airborne pollution. The purposes of this study were to: (i) describe the moss species growing in one of the largest industrial cities in Asia, (ii) document edaphic and atmospheric conditions at each site, (iii) collect materials and data for a program of regular moss monitoring, previously lacking in the Far East, (iv) uncover correlations among atmospheric and edaphic factors expected to influence moss growth. As a result, a total of fifteen moss species were recorded in twenty-five sites in Seoul, Korea, and most sites had four or five species. Each species' density was affected by soil parameters, but density of Pogonatum nessii and Taxiphyllum taxirameum was also affected by CO. In contrast, SO2 was the only environmental variable that significantly affected the composition of moss communities. On the whole, species diversity rather than abundance of specific moss species might be a good indicator of atmospheric contamination in Seoul. This investigation will help fill the gap in knowledge of the interactions between environmental pollution and moss vegetation under field conditions.

AB  - We examine the dynamic effects of credit shocks using a large dataset of U.S. economic and financial indicators in a structural factor model. An identified credit shock resulting in an unanticipated increase in credit spreads causes a large and persistent downturn in indicators of real economic activity, labor market conditions, expectations of future economic conditions, a gradual decline in aggregate price indices, and a decrease in short- and longer-term riskless interest rates. Our identification procedure allows us to perform counterfactual experiments which suggest that credit spread shocks have largely contributed to the deterioration in economic conditions during the Great Recession. Recursive estimation of the model reveals relevant instabilities since 2007 and provides further evidence that monetary policy has partly offset the effects of credit shocks on economic activity.

AB  - We present an application of Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) for the rapid characterization and identification of individual spores from several species of microfungi. The RMS-based methodology requires minimal sample preparation and small sample volumes for analyses. Hence, it is suitable for preserving sample integrity while providing micrometer-scale spatial resolution required for the characterization of individual cells. We present the acquisition of unique Raman spectral signatures from intact fungal spores dispersed on commercially available aluminum foil substrate. The RMS-based method has been used to compile a reference library of Raman spectra from several species of microfungi typically associated with damp indoor environments. The acquired reference spectral library has subsequently been used to identify individual microfungal spores through direct comparison of the spore Raman spectra with the reference spectral signatures in the library. Moreover, the distinct peak structures of Raman spectra provide detailed insight into the overall chemical composition of spores. We anticipate potential application of this methodology in the fields of public health, forensic sciences, and environmental microbiology.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive requires the assessment of the ecological status of transitional waters considering the fish component. An original methodology, based on a pressure-impact approach, was established to develop a multimetric fish-based index to characterize the ecological quality of French estuaries. An index of contamination, based on the chemical pollution affecting aquatic systems, was used as a proxy of anthropogenic pressure. The fish metric selection was based on their response to disturbances tested via statistical models (generalized linear models) taking into account sampling strategy and estuarine features. Four metrics, for which discriminating responses to level of pressure were demonstrated, were retained to constitute the estuarine multimetric fish index. This new tool appeared particularly relevant to detect the contamination effects on fish communities in estuaries. It could help managers to take decisions in order to maintain or reach the good status required by the Water Framework Directive for 2015. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cornus sp. pl., Prunus sp. pl., Viburnum sp. pl. etc.) are not suitable to assess the impact of ozone on vegetation. symptoms are not necessarily related to the ozone dose taken up by stomata, and don't are reliable indicator for biomass and productivity losses. symptoms can be considered an epiphenomenon of more complex ecosystem processes.

AB  - This paper analyses and discusses spatial and temporal patterns in the prevalence of major skin diseases (lymphocystis, epidermal hyperplasia/papilloma, ulcers), intestinal parasite Glugea sp., and liver cancer in dab (Limanda limanda) and flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Dutch section of the North Sea since the mid-1980s. We have attempted to relate disease prevalence trends in both species to chemical contaminant exposure and other relevant environmental factors including fish condition factor, population density, fishing activity, and water temperature. We observed a long-term decline in chemical-related liver cancer in the populations of both species since the early 1990s. Lymphocystis and skin ulcer (flounder only) have also displayed a significant decrease since then. We conclude that the widespread decline in the prevalence of several skin diseases and liver cancer in dab and flounder in Dutch waters in the past two decades is most likely due to the improved water quality and health conditions in this region.

KW  - FORMS
AB  - Characterization of the leaching behavior of wastes is a crucial step in the environmental assessment for reuse or disposal scenarios. The release of inorganic contaminants from waste materials is typically evaluated by tank leaching of continuously water-saturated material. However, materials, in many field or management scenarios, experience cyclic wetting and drying under varied environmental conditions (i.e. variable relative humidity, atmospheric CO2 or CO2 from biologic activities). During periods of storage in an unsaturated environment, many processes may occur that can influence the release potential and release rate of inorganic constituents. The research presented here was carried out to examine how the phenomena of carbonation during drying influence the release of inorganic contaminants from Portland cement-based materials during cyclic wetting and storage. Batch equilibrium leaching tests were used to determine constituent solubility as a function of pH. Dynamic leaching tests on monolithic material were carried out to determine the rate of constituent release as a function of leaching time and intermittent storage conditions. This paper presents the results observed for three typical waste constituents, arsenic, cadmium and lead. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of tree species, impacting ecosystem structure and function. Yet, anticipating where this will occur is often hampered by a lack of understanding of how demographic rates, most notably recruitment, vary in response to climate and competition across a species range. Using large-scale monitoring data on two dry woodland tree species (Pinus edulis and Juniperus osteosperma), we develop an approach to infer recruitment, survival, and growth of both species across their range. In doing so, we account for ecological and statistical dependencies inherent in large-scale monitoring data. We find that drying and warming conditions generally lead to declines in recruitment and survival, but the strength of responses varied between species. These climate conditions point to geographic regions of high vulnerability for particular species, such as Pinus edulis in northern Arizona, where both survival and recruitment are low. Our approach provides a path forward for leveraging emerging large-scale monitoring and remotely sensed data to anticipate the impacts of global change on species distributions.

AB  - In the present research, a methodology is developed to determine the relationship between the variables that define the use of liquefied natural gas in short sea shipping in Europe, through the use of data-mining techniques. The project takes place in the European space, which includes data from 30 countries, the 28 members of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. A Bayesian network is constructed with the 35 indicators selected, which are classified into five different categories: international trade and transport, economy and finance, population and social condition, environment and energy, and institutional and political. It is found that capacity of liquefied natural gas regasification terminals under construction and modal distribution of cargo transport by inland waters are the two root nodes of the network. In addition, the variables of transport and international trade and economy and finance become the most important in the decision to implement liquefied natural gas as marine fuel, while those of environment and energy and population and condition are the most dependent on the network.

AB  - Insects are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions and can serve as responsive indicators of changing climatic patterns and habitat conditions. However, changes in patterns of abundance over environmental gradients in forest ecosystems are poorly known. To examine landscape patterns of invertebrate assemblages, arboreal arthropods were collected during two seasons (spring and summer) by bagging branches from the lower, middle and upper canopy levels from six stands in nine second-growth (100similar to150 yr old) forests and old-growth (500 yr old) forests in Washington and Oregon. Detrended correspondence analysis and multi-response permutation procedure showed that the composition of the canopy assemblages varied significantly with latitude, precipitation and tree age. Indicator analysis was used to assess each taxon's importance in response to the environmental variables. Individual taxa showed associations with latitudinal and precipitation gradients, and between old-growth and mature Douglas-fir. These effects may be used to anticipate the impacts of climate change or land use scenarios on the spatial patterns of forest invertebrate assemblages.

AB  - 1 We propose a quantitative zonation of Switzerland based on the distribution of breeding birds. We use a combined dataset from two nationwide bird censuses 20 years apart to account for distribution changes between the censuses. This approach approximates the 'potential' distribution of species more closely than a dataset from one period only.
   2 A numerical approach with correspondence analysis and non-hierarchical clustering resulted in five avifaunal regions, consisting of two lowland regions north of the alpine arch, two alpine regions and one region of southern alpine valleys.
   3 We identified characteristic species for each region using the indicator value analysis of Dufrene & Legendre (1997) and determined environmental conditions separating the regions with discriminant analysis.
   4 Our zonation partly corresponds with previous subdivisions of Switzerland, but has the advantage of being based on a numerical approach instead of expert knowledge.
   5 We discuss avifaunal and ecological differences between the regions and relate our zonation to the classical biogeographic regions of Europe. Finally, we evaluate the importance of the zonation for bird conservation.

AB  - Green coffee (GC) is commonly stored in jute bags. Moreover, like all food, this product deteriorates over time, as shown by its quality indicators, so it is essential to preserve its original attributes during storage. The work aim was to evaluate the effect of the use of modified atmospheres packaging at two storage conditions (environmental and 18 degrees C) on physicochemical (moisture content, water activity, color and reducing sugar content), biological (viability) parameters, fungal infection, and ochratoxin A (OTA) content on GC for one-year storage. The GC used in this study is from Comalapa, Chiapas, Mexico. For one year, storage in modified atmospheres could preserve GC moisture content (11.30-8.87 %) and a(w) (0.63-0.55). The color of GC samples was maintained without significant changes for six months. Viability in GC stored for one year under all conditions was less than 25 %. Fungal infection was less than 40 % in all stored GC samples. Ochratoxin A (OTA) content in GC samples showed no significant differences during storage.

AB  - There is a knowledge gap in the ecological risk assessment of transgenic fish as to whether novel traits change their vulnerability to predation and thus their ability to establish themselves in nature. The U.S. commercialization of ornamental transgenic zebra danios Danio rerio and the approaching commercialization of other transgenic fish heighten the need for ecologically realistic models with which to address this question. Transgenic zebra danios with fluorescent body colors represent a good model system because marketed lines are likely to be released by hobby aquarists and it is relatively easy to study their interspecific interactions under nearly natural conditions. In experiments including habitat complexity, transgenic red-fluorescent-protein zebra danios were approximately twice as vulnerable as the wild type to predation by largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki, two native predators that potentially resist invasion by introduced fish. Increased predation vulnerability should decrease the risk of transgenics' becoming established if other fitness-related traits are equivalent in nature. The zebra danio model is ideal for further testing the generality of this result under more complex ecological conditions.

AB  - After a decade of transgenic crop production, the dynamics of gene introgression into wild relatives remain unclear. Taking an ecological genetics approach to investigating fitness in crop-wild hybrid zones, we uncovered both conditions and characteristics that may promote introgression. We compared diverse crop-wild hybrid genotypes relative to wild Helianthus annuus under one benign and three stressful agricultural environments. Whereas relative fitness of crop-wild hybrids averaged 0.25 under benign conditions, with herbicide application or competition it reached 0.45 and was more variable. In some instances, hybrid fitness matched wild fitness (approximate to 1). Thus, wild populations under agronomic stress may be more susceptible to introgression. Although 'domestication' traits are typically considered unlikely to persist in wild populations, we found some (e.g. rapid growth and early flowering) that may enhance hybrid fitness, especially in stressful environments. Rigorous assessment of how particular genotypes, phenotypes, and environments affect introgression will improve risk assessment for transgenic crops.

AB  - Aquatic invertebrates constitute a large proportion of biological diversity in wetlands and can be useful indicators of wetland environmental conditions; however, their assessment can be time consuming and requires special expertise. So it may be useful to screen for potential surrogates to represent overall aquatic invertebrate assemblages and make bioassessments more feasible. The composition of aquatic invertebrate communities were studied in 15 floodplain wetlands of the Wusuli River and 14 non-floodplain wetlands, all located in Northeastern China's Sanjiang Plain. Our study showed that aquatic invertebrate assemblages in non-floodplain wetlands differed from floodplain wetlands. Then the potential surrogates were identified for 11 aquatic invertebrate groups across all 29 wetlands. Gastropoda proved to be potential surrogates of overall aquatic invertebrate species density, species richness and community similarity, and could be used to classify floodplain and non-floodplain wetlands. Nine Gastropoda species were indicators for specific wetland types. Using snail assemblages as surrogates for overall aquatic invertebrate communities may make rapid assessments of wetland condition using aquatic invertebrates simple yet effective.

AB  - Altitude, temperature and precipitation are important environmental variables for the distribution of endemic plants. Taking in account their present distribution, this work studies the distribution trends of 116 endemic and subendemic species that occur on the western Iberian Peninsula and north-western Morocco, in different scenarios of future climate change. It was possible to identify five groups of taxa in the present environmental conditions, four of which for the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. This range can partially be explained by the altitudinal variability of such area. The other group distributes along the western of the Iberian Peninsula. Concerning future climate change scenarios, important changes in species distribution, and a general south-north trend were obtained. Under harsher climatic changes, only the groups that tolerate the most variable environmental conditions persist. Estimates of extinction rates of the studied taxa for the next 75 years are also presented. The present methodology allows the application of ecological indicators (environmental groups, in this case) to understand biogeographic trends.

AB  - The results of the present study represent a synoptic analysis of sediment quality in coastal waters of Lake Pontchartrain and Mississippi Sound two months after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. Posthurricane conditions were compared to prehurricane (2000-2004) conditions, for sediment quality data. There were no exceedances of effects range median (ERM) sediment quality guideline values for chemical contaminants in any of the sediment samples collected from the Lake Pontchartrain or the Mississippi Sound study areas following the hurricane. Lower threshold effects range low (ERL) values were exceeded for As, Cd, and Ni at several stations in both survey areas, similar to levels of contamination observed prior to the hurricane. The comparison of sediment quality indicators before and after the hurricane suggests considerable stability of these systems with respect to short-term ecological impacts. Although other studies have shown storm-related changes could be detected (e.g., effects on benthic communities associated with shifts in salinity), there were no indications of widespread sediment contamination.

AB  - This study examines the evolution of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, vegetation, and atmospheric conditions during an unusual flash drought-flash recovery sequence that occurred across the south-central United States during 2015. This event was characterized by a period of rapid drought intensification (flash drought) during late summer that was terminated by heavy rainfall at the end of October that eliminated the extreme drought conditions over a 2-week period (flash recovery). A detailed analysis was performed using time series of environmental variables derived from meteorological, remote sensing, and land surface modeling datasets. Though the analysis revealed a similar progression of cascading effects in each region, characteristics of the flash drought such as its onset time, rate of intensification, and vegetation impacts differed between regions due to variations in the antecedent conditions and the atmospheric anomalies during its growth. Overall, flash drought signals initially appeared in the near-surface soil moisture, followed closely by reductions in evapotranspiration. Total column soil moisture deficits took longer to develop, especially in the western part of the region where heavy rainfall during the spring and early summer led to large moisture surpluses. Large differences were noted in how land surface models in the North American Land Data Assimilation System depicted soil moisture evolution during the flash drought; however, the models were more similar in their assessment of conditions during the flash recovery period. This study illustrates the need to use multiple datasets to track the evolution and impacts of rapidly evolving flash drought and flash recovery events.

AB  - Eggs of the yellow-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) have a symbiotic relationship with green algae. It has been suggested that contaminants that are preferentially toxic to algae, such as herbicides, may impair the symbiont and, hence, indirectly affect the development of the salamander embryo. To enable testing under near-standard conditions for first-tier toxicity screening, the authors isolated the alga from field-collected eggs and identified conditions providing exponential growth rates in the apparent asexual phase of the alga. This approach provided a uniform, single-species culture, facilitating assessment of common toxicity end points and comparison of sensitivity relative to other species. Sequencing of the 18s ribosomal DNA indicated that the isolated alga is closely related to the recently described Oophila amblystomatis but is more similar to other known Chlamydomonas species, suggesting possible biogeographical variability in the genetic identity of the algal symbiont. After a tiered approach to culturing method refinement, a modified Bristol's media with 1mM NH4+ as nitrogen source was found to provide suitable conditions for toxicity testing at 18 degrees C and 200 mu molm(-2) s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on a 24-h light cycle. The validity of the approach was demonstrated with Zn2+ as a reference toxicant. Overall, the present study shows that screening for direct effects of contaminants on the algal symbiont without the presence of the host salamander is possible under certain laboratory conditions.

AB  - The study investigates two functional genes for toluene degradation across three redox conditions (nitrate and sulfate amended and methanogenic). The genes targeted include benzylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit (bssA) and a gene recently identified as being a strong indicator of anaerobic aromatic degradation, called 6-oxocylcohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydrolase (bamA). In all, sixteen different anaerobic toluene degrading microcosms were investigated using several primers sets targeting bssA and one primer set targeting bamA. One bssA primer set (7772f/8546r) was the most successful in producing a strong amplicon (eight from sixteen) with the other bssA primers sets producing strong amplicons in six or less samples. In contrast, the bamA primer set (bam-sp9 and bam-asp1) produced a strong amplicon in DNA extracted from all except one microcosm. Partial bssA and bamA sequences were obtained for a number of samples and compared to those available in GenBank. The partial bssA sequences (from nitrate amended and methanogenic microcosms) were most similar to Thauera sp. DNT-1, Thauera aromatica, Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1 and bssA clones from a study involving sulfate reducing toluene degradation. The bamA sequences obtained could be placed into five previously defined clades (bamA-clade 1, Georgfuchsia/Azoarcus, Magnetospirillum/Thauera Syntrophus and Geobacter clades), with the placement generally depending on redox conditions. Gene numbers were also correlated with toluene degradation and the final gene number for both genes differed considerably between the range of redox conditions. The work is the first in depth investigation of bamA diversity over a range of redox conditions and inoculum sources.

AB  - Exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses are reported for a novel cogeneration system including a gas turbine, a heat recovery steam generator, a supercritical carbon dioxide recompression Brayton cycle and an organic Rankine cycle. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out to clarify the effects of some decision parameters on the exergoeconomic performance of the proposed system. Also, the payback period is determined for the proposed system. The sum of capital investment cost, total exergy destruction cost and environmental impact cost is considered as an objective function which is optimized with respect to the decision parameters. The variation in overall exergoeconomic factor is determined and its implication to the system design is discussed. It is observed that under the optimized condition the average product unit cost of the system (cost of produced power and steam) is decreased by 0.56 VGJ when compared to the value obtained under a base condition.

AB  - Engineering design in mechanics is a complex activity taking into account both objective modeling processes derived from physical analysis and designers' subjective reasoning. This paper introduces arc-elastic dominance as a suitable concept for ranking design solutions according to a combination of objective and subjective models. Objective models lead to the aggregation of information derived from physics, economics or eco-environmental analysis into a performance indicator. Subjective models result in a confidence indicator for the solutions' feasibility. Arc-elastic dominant design solutions achieve an optimal compromise between gain in performance and degradation in confidence. Due to the definition of arc-elasticity, this compromise value is expressive and easy for designers to interpret despite the difference in the nature of the objective and subjective models. From the investigation of arc-elasticity mathematical properties, a filtering algorithm of Pareto-efficient solutions is proposed and illustrated through a design knowledge modeling framework. This framework notably takes into account Harrington's desirability functions and Derringer's aggregation method. It is carried out through the re-design of a geothermal air conditioning system.

AB  - Constructed treatment wetlands are efficient at retaining a range of pesticides, however the ultimate fate of many of these compound is not well understood. This study evaluated the effect of drain-fill cycling on the mineralization of chlorpyrifos, a commonly used organophosphate insecticide, in wetland sediment-water microcosms. Monitoring of the fate of C-14 ring-labeled chlorpyrifos showed that drain-fill cycling resulted in significantly lower mineralization rates relative to permanently flooded conditions. The reduction in mineralization was linked to enhanced partitioning of the pesticide to the sediment phase, which could potentially inhibit chlorpyrifos hydrolysis and mineralization. Over the nearly two-month experiment, less than 2.5% of the added compound was mineralized, While rates of mineralization in this experiment were higher than those reported for other soils and sediments, their low magnitude underscores how persistent chlorpyrifos and its metabolites are in aquatic environments, and suggests that management strategies and ecological risk assessment should focus more on ultimate mineralization rather than the simple disappearance of the parent compound.

AB  - An occupational health and industrial hygiene survey was carried out in Widia tool grinding industries in the area covered by Local Health Unit No. 60 - Vimercate (Northern Italy). The principal objectives of the study were to assess occupational cobalt exposure, identify the measures required to improve the 'risk' situations, and implement specific health protocols. The results identified a variable level of occupational hazard in the tool grinding sector. An important factor in the containment of occupational exposure was, along with correct practical procedures, the existence of adequate primary prevention measures (aspiration systems over the machines). In the plants where good industrial hygiene conditions prevailed, environmental cobalt concentrations were below the TLV, whereas the levels recorded in plants with inadequate equipment were as much as 10 times the TLV. Similarly, urinary cobalt for the workers in these same plants was as much as 13 times higher than the reference population value. However, this was recorded in plants with good industrial hygiene conditions. After technical improvements, the results of biological monitoring showed an overall reduction in exposure indicator values.

AB  - Black odorous water contains abundant organics and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which would lead to eutrophication of the water body and affect the water environment. In this study, the eutrophic water body in the campus landscape was taken as the research object, and the biological contact oxidation (BCO) method and co-cultivated indigenous microorganisms were adopted to pretreat black odorous water. Inoculating mutant strain M1 through ultraviolet-B radiation formed algae-bacteria symbiosis system in optimal effluent. The results showed that under the conditions of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 5 mg/L, light intensity of 3000 Lx and inoculum size of 125,000 cells/mL, the optimal organic migration effect was achieved by the combined process. In addition, the ability of H. pluvialis to transform from green vegetative cells to red cyst cells under stressful conditions (strong light, nitrogen starvation, etc.) made it as an indicator for monitoring the degradation status of pollutants in black odorous water.

AB  - (Post-fire recovery of the epiphytic-lichen community in Cordoba province, Argentina). Lichens are recognized bioindicators of environmental quality. Studies of lichen communities in relation to forest fires have shown the response to fire over micro-environmental variables that shape the community in the absence of this disturbance. The aim of this contribution is to recognize the effect of fire on the lichen community of Sierra Chaco in Cordoba province. Two areas were selected, one without past fire and the other with fire in 1996. Coverage and presence of lichen species on trees and shrubs were recorded in the two areas using systematic, standardized sampling. Diversity and coverage of lichens is similar between the two areas but composition varies. The lichen species in the burned area are heliophilous and adapted to stress conditions. Fire as a frequent disturbance promote, the growth of few species with high coverage that are resistant to the conditions imposed by disturbance. High intensity and high frequency fires limit development opportunities for the lichen community thus diminishing overall diversity and quality of forest systems in which they live. Key words: disturbance. fire, forest, lichen community

AB  - The effects of a natural gradient of light and competition on crown, shoot and needle morphology of naturally regenerated Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver fir (Abies alba) saplings, 0.8-0.2 m tall, were analyzed in a uneven-aged, managed stand in Comelico (eastern Italian Alps). The results indicate that: (i) both crown, shoot and needle morphology are strongly affected by light, but in the examined conditions (relative irradiance ranging from 2 to 32%) no significant effect of competition was observed, (ii) the ecological differences between Norway spruce and silver fir saplings cannot be mainly attributable to differences in crown morphological traits, and (iii) the apical dominance ratio (i. e., the length of the apical leader divided by the mean length of the lateral shoots at the last node) is a relatively good and simple indicator of the light conditions in which saplings are growing. These informations may be useful in order to promote and assure effectively natural regeneration.

AB  - An early Holocene lake sediment record from central Nova Scotia contains a minerogenic oscillation that is closely correlative with the 8.2 kyr event (ca. 8200 cal. yr BP), an event that has not been reported elsewhere in Atlantic Canada. A variety of biological and sedimentological indicators have been examined to characterise autochthonous and allochthonous changes that occurred during this time. The minerogenic upper oscillation (UO, ca. 8400 cal. yr BP) is marked by an increase in the chrysophyte:diatom ratio. Following the oscillation, the diatom community reflects a shift to more productive, less acidic conditions. The pollen record shows no major response to this short-lived event. Lithostratigraphic analyses indicates that the UO is characterised by an increase in clastic content, magnetic susceptibility and mean sediment grain size, all indicators of changing environmental conditions, most likely the result of regional cooling. The Taylor Lake record adds to a growing body of evidence for a widespread, hemispheric climate oscillation at 8.2 kyr. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The survival of Baltic salmon Salmo salar during the first year at sea (post-smolt stage) has declined since the beginning of the 1990s. In this analysis, we complement previous studies on possible causes of this decline by considering a suite of environmental parameters, potential change in predation pressure, and post-smolt growth. Marine survival estimates were found to be negatively correlated with temperature, indicating that warming conditions have not favoured survival. Survival was also found to be positively correlated with dissolved oxygen levels and regionally related to shifts in salinity. These relationships were further studied in context to the potential predation on post-smolts by one of the main piscivores in the Baltic, Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias). Concomitant with changes in environmental conditions, Baltic cod has changed its latitudinal range, moving northward in the Baltic, possibly in response to warming conditions. These changes lead us to hypothesize that predation pressure on salmon may have increased in recent years as cod has now occupied habitats used by salmon post-smolts during their southward feeding migrations. This predation may have been intensified as a result of anoxic conditions in the central basin by concentrating predation interactions in coastal waters and/or the upper water column typically occupied by salmon post-smolts. Indicators of post-smolt growth were applied to test the alternate hypothesis that mortality is growth-mediated; these indicators lacked a time series trend, which supports the contention that shifting predation pressure rather than feeding opportunities is responsible for the decline in post-smolt survival in Baltic salmon.

AB  - The carbon cycle is vital in the cycle of mass and energy fluxes of an ecosystem. In this study, three typical wetland ecosystems (city secondary wetland, artificial wetland (paddy soil), and lake-wetland) in a subtropical mon-soon climate zone were selected as research objects. We simulated the decomposition process of soil organic matter under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. CO2 and CH4 emission fluxes, as well as other indicators such as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) were measured during laboratory culture. SUVA(254) was established as an index to represent the aromatic degree of DOC. Experimental results showed that According to the wetland hydrology-type classification, the cumulative CO2 emission from seasonal waterlogged wetlands (2457-3505 ugCO(2)/g) was significantly higher than that from perennial water soil (1124-1576 ugCO(2)/g) and soil without water (1226-1414 ugCO(2)/g). The amount of CH4 emitted from paddy soils under anaerobic condition (25.1-28.1 ugCH(4)/g) was higher than that from the other two types of wetlands (0.35-2.97 ugCH(4)/g). Moreover, the oxide rate was correspondingly higher. Compared with CO2 emission, CH4 flux was minimal. Most organic matter was anaerobically oxidized under anaerobic condition. The CO2 emission rate exhibited a significant positive correlation with SOC and TN contents. The effect of the content and structure of DOC was also analyzed. CO2 emission rate was reciprocally correlated with the humification degree of DOC under aerobic conditions, but this correlation was weak under anaerobic conditions. CH4 emission rate was also proportional to the CO2 emission rate and SOC content.

AB  - Background. A decade after the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in India, a steady increase in the number of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been observed, The therapeutic options for patients with AIDS in developing countries include chemoprophylaxis and identifying and treating opportunistic infections. CD4 counts help in clinical monitoring and making decisions about initiating antiretroviral therapy or chemoprophylaxis. Flowcytometry is expensive and available only at specialized laboratories, Therefore, the possibility of using clinical indicators to predict low CD4 counts and disease progression needs to be explored.
   Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 137 HIV-infected persons investigated at an HIV reference centre in Pune, The study methods comprised pre-test counselling, informed consent, blood withdrawal and clinical evaluation. Serum samples were tested for HIV and CD4 counts were estimated on FACSort.
   Results. Study participants commonly reported with oral candidiasis, herpes tester, pulmonary tuberculosis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, rash, diarrhoea and fever. CD4 counts were significantly lower among men, symptomatic patients and those with oral candidiasis, weight loss and multiple clinical conditions. The sensitivity of most of the clinical conditions was low, the specificity was high and the positive predictive value of oral candidiasis and weight loss for low CD4 counts was > 75%.
   Conclusion. The presence of oral candidiasis and weight loss were highly predictive of low CD4 counts and these can be considered as markers of HIV disease progression. Absence of clinical conditions was found to be a good predictor of high CD4 counts. Larger systematic natural history studies may help in identifying clinical conditions that could have a prognostic significance among HIV-infected people.

AB  - Hydrological conditions are responsible for the changes in lateral connectivity between the main river channel and the floodplain lakes, a factor controlling zooplankton abundance and diversity. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of connectivity between the aquatic habitats and the river channel governs the zooplankton densities and community structure. Abundances, community composition and species diversity of zooplankton were analysed against the gradient of lakes' connectivity and the water quality parameters under a natural flood pulse in the Biebrza River (North-Eastern Poland). Our findings revealed that the water level fluctuations directly affect the availability of nutrients, aeration, what in turn controls the densities and biovolumes of zooplankton communities. Along with the increase in the lake isolation, the taxonomic diversity of zooplankton decreased, while the eudomination of taxa indicative of advanced trophy (Rotifera) was observed. Qualitative parameters, as number of species, diversity and richness, were significantly higher at mean water levels, which supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The sensitivity of the zooplankton community to variable hydrological conditions and lateral connectivity gradient demonstrates its potential as an unexploited indicator of any habitat changes in the aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The Nordasvannet fjord in western Norway is a modern semi-enclosed basin suitable for studying sedimentary cycles as they occur under anoxic bottom conditions. It is characterized by strongly anoxic conditions in the water column and bottom sediments. Diagenetic pyrite formation occurs in the sediments, and syngenetic pyrite is formed in the lower water column. Organic matter burial in the fjord exceeds that of other environments with normal marine or upwelling conditions. This is due to the better preservation of organic matter. Organic matter composition appears to have changed over time with higher fractions of terrigenous organic matter being present in the most recent sediments. This may be a result of increased input of terrigenous organic matter, possibly due to sewage supply to the fjord over the last decades. Organic C and CaCO3 contents of the sediments do not appear to reflect a productivity signal. Calcium carbonate content is influenced by chemogenic calcite formation. Biogenic opal content appears to reflect a productivity signal, but different degrees of dissolution may obscure its clear recognition. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The latest Cretaceous palynological assemblages from the southern margin of the Basque-Cantabrian Basin (northern Spain, Zumaia) are dominated by black opaque equidimensional phytoclasts, black opaque blade shaped phytoclasts and translucent gold-orange to brown phytoclasts. Deep water dinoflagellate cysts Cannosphaeridium Utinensis and Pterodinium spp. constitutes a part of the assemblages throughout the whole succession. This record and previous study suggest deposition of the Zumaia section in the marine bathyal conditions, in relative close proximity to the land. Palynofacies analyses yields increased abundance of Leiosphaeridia spp. and some changes in the palynomorph proportions just before the significant lithological change near the lower/upper Maastrichtian. This signal may either be primary and record an environmental change, or taphonomic. Nevertheless, environmental interpretation of the upper Maastrichtian palynological assemblage seems to be more consistent with the late Maastrichtian marine regression, and in consequence, a reduction of the distance from the nearby land. Such conditions may have caused transport of leiosphaerids from shallower water sites.

AB  - The development of a benthic environment after fish-farming cessation was examined. To ascertain whether recovery occurred, several abiotic (granulometry, acid-volatile sulfides, total phosphorus and redox potential) and biotic (polychaete abundance) variables were monitored using a "beyond-BACI" approach. Before the cessation of farming, the geochemical conditions and polychaete assemblages differed among the impacted and control sites. After cessation, an improvement of the geochemical conditions was achieved. A significant tendency toward a recovery of the polychaete assemblage in the impacted area was observed, but significant differences still remained compared with the control sites. The acid-volatile sulfide level was responsible for these differences. The abundance of polychaete families associated with organically enriched sediments diminished at the impacted site after cessation, whereas the abundance of some sensitive and omnivorous families increased. The "beyond-BACI" approach provided a wider framework than other approaches, enabling us to differentiate the natural variability from those changes induced by the fish farm and farming cessation.

AB  - Due to their redox reactivity, surface sorption characteristics, and ubiquity as corrosion products or as minerals in natural sediments, iron(II)-bearing minerals control to a large extent the environmental fate of actinides. Pu-L-III-edge}CANES and EXAFS spectra were used to investigate reaction products of aqueous Pu-242(III) and Pu-242(V) reacted with magnetite, mackinawite, and chukanovite under anoxic conditions. As Pu concentrations in the liquid phase were rapidly;below detection limit, oxidation state and local structure of Pu were determined for Pu associated with the solid mineral phase. Pu(V) was reduced in the presence of all three minerals. A newly identified, highly specific Pu(III)-sorption complex formed with magnetite. Solid PuO2 phases formed in the presence of mackinawite and chukanovite; in the case of chukanovite, up to one-third of plutonium was also present as Pu(III). This highlights the necessity to consider, under reducing anoxic conditions, Pu(III) species in addition to tetravalent PuO2 for environmental risk assessment. Our results also demonstrate the necessity to support thermodynamic calculations with spectroscopic data.

AB  - During latest Kimmeridgian times, the Orbagnoux area (French southern Jura) was part of a vast domain shielded behind fringing reefs.  It formed a small depression where bituminous laminites and laminated limestones were deposited.  In these sediments, organic matter is abundant (TOC values may reach 12%) and well preserved.  In this paper, we present the organic geochemistry and the palynofacies data of the Orbagnoux sediments.  During organic matter deposition, environmental conditions were oxygenated enough to allow benthic life.  The excellent preservation of organic constituents seems to be associated with the development of microbial mats at the sediment surface.  These organic mats formed a transition zone in which all available dissolved oxygen was consumed, leading to the formation of anoxic conditions within the sediments.

AB  - Conducting environmental risk assessment of engineered nanomaterials has been an extremely challenging endeavor thus far. Moreover, recent findings from the nano-risk scientific community indicate that it is unlikely that many of these challenges will be easily resolved in the near future, especially given the vast variety and complexity of nanomaterials and their applications. As an approach to help optimize environmental risk assessments of nanomaterials, we apply the Worst-Case Definition (WCD) model to identify best estimates for worst-case conditions of environmental risks of two case studies which use engineered nanoparticles, namely nZVI in soil and groundwater remediation and C-60 in an engine oil lubricant. Results generated from this analysis may ultimately help prioritize research areas for environmental risk assessments of nZVI and C-60 in these applications as well as demonstrate the use of worst-case conditions to optimize future research efforts for other nanomaterials. Through the application of the WCD model, we find that the most probable worst-case conditions for both case studies include i) active uptake mechanisms, ii) accumulation in organisms, iii) ecotoxicological response mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell membrane damage or disruption, iv) surface properties of nZVI and C-60, and v) acute exposure tolerance of organisms. Additional estimates of worst-case conditions for C-60 also include the physical location of C-60 in the environment from surface run-off, cellular exposure routes for heterotrophic organisms, and the presence of light to amplify adverse effects. Based on results of this analysis, we recommend the prioritization of research for the selected applications within the following areas: organism active uptake ability of nZVI and C-60 and ecotoxicological response end-points and response mechanisms including ROS production and cell membrane damage, full nanomaterial characterization taking into account detailed information on nanomaterial surface properties, and investigations of dose response relationships for a variety of organisms.

AB  - Aim Bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity are considered as potential natural bio-preservatives to control the growth of food spoilage bacteria. The aim of this work was to characterize a novel bacteriocin BM1029 discovered fromLactobacillus crustorumMN047 and evaluate its antibacterial mechanism. Methods and Results Bacteriocin BM1029 was purified by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. Antibacterial activity assay showed that BM1029 is antagonistic against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, it was found that BM1029 showed low haemolysis with high stability to the pretreatment with different temperatures, pH and surfactants. Moreover electron microscopy and flow cytometry suggested that BM1029 inhibit indicator strains by damaging the cell envelope integrity. Cell cycle assay suggested that BM1029 arrested cell cycle in R-phase. Conclusion The novel bacteriocin BM1029 showed high bactericidal activity againstEscherichia coliandStaphylococcus aureusthrough a cell envelope-associated mechanism. Significance and Impact of the Study Application of BM1029 inhibited the growth of indicator strains on beef meat storage at 4 degrees C suggesting that this bacteriocin is promising to be used as a novel preservative in food processing and preservation.

AB  - Whether plants can adapt to a long-term microgravity environment is crucial to their reproduction in bioregenerative life-support systems in space. This research investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on Lycopersivon esculentum Mill. (cv. Dwarf Red-bell). Several indicators, namely germination ratio, percentage of cell membrane damage, malondialdehyde content (MDA), superoxide anion (O-2(-)) content, and mininucleolus, were observed 10, 20, 30, and 40 d after planting (DAP). Simulated microgravity [random positioning machine (RPM) treatment] barely had any effect on germination ratio, but it increased MDA, an index indicating membrane lipid peroxidation. Random positioning machine-treated samples had significantly higher O-2(-) content until 16 DAP, but these differences ceased after 21 DAP. Simulated microgravity damaged cell membranes, and the damage severity was positively related to the duration of the simulated microgravity treatment. Mininucleoli were more common in RPM-treated root tips than in the 1 x g ones. In conclusion, simulated microgravity seriously disturbed tomato seedling growth by damaging cell membrane integrity, causing the accumulation of hazardous substances, and affecting the cell nucleus structure.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in physiological parameters and the Cd, Cu, Pb uptake of the lichens over time transplanted to an urban environment. Thalli of the epiphytic lichen Evernia prunastri were transplanted from an unpolluted to an urban environment (Kaunas, Lithuania). Chlorophyll a and b, malondialdehyde (MDA) and the damage to cell membranes in the lichen thalli were determined after 1 month exposure period. The concentrations of some heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu) in the biomonitors were used as an indicator of the level of air pollution in the studied area. The accumulated heavy metals in the exposed samples were assessed and the exposed-to-control ratio was calculated in each case. All the studied heavy metals accumulated in the lichens that were transplanted in the traffic sites. The concentration of chlorophyll a was higher in the samples exposed in the urban parks and residential sites. The presence of urban pollutants caused the loss of integrity of cell membranes.

AB  - The positioning methods based on received signal strength (RSS) measurements, link the RSS values to the position of the mobile station ( MS) to be located. Their accuracy depends on the suitability of the propagation models used for the actual propagation conditions. In indoor wireless networks, these propagation conditions are very difficult to predict due to the unwieldy and dynamic nature of the RSS. In this paper, we present a novel method which dynamically estimates the propagation models that best fit the propagation environments, by using only RSS measurements obtained in real time. This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration. The method proposed coupled with simulations and measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms conventional RSS-based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a calibration stage.

AB  - The value of biodiversity is usually confused with the value of biological resources, both actual and potential. A sharp distinction between biological resources and biodiversity offers a clearer insight into the value of biodiversity itself and therefore the need to preserve it. Biodiversity can be defined abstractly as the differences among biological entities. Using this definition, biodiversity can be seen more appropriately as: (a) a necessary precondition for the long term maintenance of biological resources, and therefore, (b) an essential environmental condition. Three values of biodiversity are identified and arranged in a hierarchy: (1) the self-augmenting phenomenon of biodiversity maintains (2) the conditions necessary for the adaptive evolution of species and higher taxa, which in turn is necessary for providing humans with (3) a range of biological resources in the long term. Two broad policy implications emerge: increments of biodiversity should not be traded off against biological resources as if they were the same, and the conservation of biodiversity should be a constraint on the public interest, not a goal in service of the public interest.

AB  - Plant development is orchestrated and yet flexible. This enables the formation of the correct organs within the context of previous and current environmental cues. The use of previous environmental experiences, such as the conditions when the seed formed or whether winter has passed, is critical to maximise reproductive success. Temperature is a crucial signal in achieving this, it provides current seasonal information and is an indicator of forthcoming environmental conditions, including drought or freezing. Therefore, many temperature responses facilitate environmental acclimation as well as trigger key developmental changes, such as germination, growth, and flowering. Research has identified that temperature signals are interpreted in the context of light signalling, circadian and light intensity, and developmental stage. Furthermore, a number of temperature cues are stress signals, associated with very high or low temperatures. These signals do trigger developmental responses but not as part of standard developmental growth. This article focuses on the role of ambient temperature on each of the major stages of plant development.

AB  - The effect of storage conditions (light, temperature, container types) and time on the quality of natural olive oils from different cultivars and Australian regions were studied. The oils' changing quality was monitored through several physico-chemical methods (free fatty acids, peroxide value, UV-spectrometry (K-232, K (270) and Delta K), induction time, total polyphenol content, bitterness, pyropheophytin a and 1,2-diacyl-glycerol content) and sensory analysis over 24 months. Pyropheophytins a and 1,2-diacyl-glycerols criteria showed very good performance as indicators of overall olive oil quality and freshness as well as highlighting any problems during the storage of the product. Pyropheophytin a increment averaged 7 % per year and the 1,2-diacyl-glycerols decreased at an average of 23 % per year at normal storage conditions over time.

AB  - In most cases the negative impacts of climate change to aquatic ecosystems cannot be mitigated by measures in the river basin management. Ignoring climate change by the Water Framework Directive may have strong implications for the typology and quality assessment systems used for water bodies. As a result of climate change, water bodies, especially those located near the type boundaries may change their type. Compared to typology characteristics, water quality parameters are even more labile and may be easily affected by climate change. The paper exemplifies that the anticipated deterioration of water quality within the time frame relevant for WFD implementation may be large enough to endanger the fulfillment of the set water quality objectives. The review of the river basin characterization every six years, as required by the WFD, might also include re-evaluation of reference conditions according to the changes observed at pristine reference sites. As a consequence, the restoration targets (i.e., the good ecological status) would also need to be evaluated periodically.

AB  - A quantitative and qualitative survey of the microfauna at two activated sludge plants in the Leeds area, was carried out on a weekly basis.  The frequency of occurrence and order of importance of the different species observed is described.  The specific distribution of the protozoal population was found to be dependent upon prevailing environmental factors and plant operating conditions.  As these also control the quality of the final effluent, it was possible to correlate plant performance and operating conditions with the distribution of species within the activated sludge reactor.  A method for predicting effluent quality and operating conditions from the structure of the protozoal community was derived based on multiple regression analysis.  The number of protozoa required for a successful prediction was minimized from 31 to 20 without a significant loss of accuracy using stepwise regression techniques.

AB  - Fast climate changes in the western Antarctic Peninsula are reducing krill density, which along with increased fishing activities in recent decades, may have had synergistic effects on penguin populations. We tested that assumption by crossing data on fishing activities and Southern Annular Mode (an indicator of climate change in Antarctica) with penguin population data. Increases in fishing catch during the non-breeding period were likely to result in impacts on both chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) populations. Catches and climate change together elevated the probability of negative population growth rates: very high fishing catch on years with warm winters and low sea ice (associated with negative Southern Annular Mode values) implied a decrease in population size in the following year. The current management of krill fishery in the Southern Ocean takes into account an arbitrary and fixed catch limit that does not reflect the variability of the krill population under effects of climate change, therefore affecting penguin populations when the environmental conditions were not favorable.

AB  - Scots pine blister rust and red ring rot are common on Scots pine throughout its entire range. Specialists do not explain a significant variation in the prevalence of the diseases uniquely since it depends on complex ecological and silvicultural factors. The aim of this research is to study the influence of forest growth conditions on the incidence of Scots pine blister rust and red ring rot in pine stands of the Priangarye (territory located along the lower reaches of the Angara within the Krasnoyarsk Krai). The research methods included a detailed forest pathological examination of prevailing pine forest types, specific symptom-based macroscopic diagnosis of the diseases, data analysis using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Forest growth conditions indicators included type of forest, habitat conditions, and bonitet class of forest stands. The incidence of Scots pine blister rust and red ring rot in pine forests of the Priangarye reaches the extent of moderate and severe damage, respectively. The prevalence of Scots pine blister rust is significantly higher in low-bonitet lichen pine forests; the incidence rate increases along the gradient of decreasing fertility and soil moisture level. The incidence of red ring rot is significantly higher in herb-rich pine forests, in gradations of maximum soil fertility and medium soil moisture. The revealed patterns are explained by the bioecological characteristic features of pathogens (for red ring rot-additionally by factors of structural immunity in pine trees). The results of the research should be recognized in the organization of forestry practice.

AB  - Climatic conditions of environmental zone Nemoral 2 of Europe are favorable for agricultural development. However, more frequent events of hot air-waves and prolonged droughts occurring as a consequence of climate change lead to soil moisture content reduction down to the plant wilting point. Dry soil conditions may have negative consequences for soil as a habitat. The goal of this study was to evaluate the cumulative after-effect of long-term conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) application in combination with or without crop residues on soil physicochemical properties, microbiological activity, and soil respiration (SR) under prolonged dry soil conditions. Long-term CT with residue returning created a soil environment that was more resistant to dry conditions than NT. Longterm CT with residue returning created a qualitative soil environment in which the main direct determinants for SR were fungal (F) and bacterial (B) community and carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N). Slightly weaker contributors for SR were available phosphorus (PAL), plant wilting point (PWP), plant available water (PAW), and urease activity (UR); however, they acted as indirect factors. Long-term spreading of residues on soil surface under NT determined the decrease in water capacity in mesopores and micropores. Significant reduction in field capacity and PWP was revealed, while PAW remained unchanged compared to NT with residues removed. Main direct determinants for SR were F and PAL. Slightly weaker indirect contributors for SR were B, dehydrogenase, UR, and PAW.

AB  - Many insects are tolerant of hypoxic conditions, but survival may come at a cost to long-term health. The alfalfa leaf-cutting bee, Megachile rotundata, develops in brood cells inside natural cavities, and may be exposed to hypoxic conditions for extended periods of time. Whether M. rotundata is tolerant of hypoxia, and whether exposure results in sub-lethal effects, has never been investigated. Overwintering M. roiundata prepupae were exposed to 10%, 13%, 17%, 21% and 24% O-2 for 11 months. Once adults emerged, five indicators of quality emergence weight, body size, feeding activity, flight performance, and adult longevity, were measured to determine whether adult bees that survived past exposure to hypoxia were competent pollinators. M. rotundata prepupae are tolerant of hypoxic condition and have higher survival rates in hypoxia, than in normoxia. Under hypoxia, adult emergence rates did not decrease over the 11 months of the experiment. In contrast, bees reared in normoxia had decreased emergence rates by 8 months, and were dead by 11 months. M. rotundata prepupae exposed to extended hypoxic conditions had similar emergence weight, head width, and cross-thorax distance compared to bees reared in standard 21% oxygen. Despite no significant morphological differences, hypoxia-exposed bees had lower feeding rates and shorter adult lifespans. Hypoxia may play a role in post-diapause physiology of M. rotundata, with prepupae showing better survival under hypoxic conditions. Extended exposure to hypoxia, while not fatal, causes sub-lethal effects in feeding rates and longevity in the adults, indicating that hypoxia tolerance comes at a cost. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia selliformis can be predicted with accuracy derived from knowledge of the main forcing variables. A naive Bayes classifier modeling framework, a member of the Bayesian network family, is used to identify the phytoplankton community and the physical and meteorological parameters involving K. selliformis blooms in the eutrophic Boughrara Lagoon (BL), Tunisia. The proposed model takes into account the physical environment parameters (salinity, water temperature, tide amplitude), meteorological constraints (evaporation, air temperature, insolation, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, and humidity), phytoplankton groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, Euglenophyceae), and the sampling months on K. selliformis blooms. The shift to highest salinity and atmospheric pressure, associated with reduced tide, are the most favorable conditions for K. selliformis blooms in BL. The results show that K. selliformis formed nearly monospecific blooms. A shift in species composition was pointed out between the bloom and non-bloom conditions. The Euglenophycea and some dinoflagellates like Peridinium minimum, Prorocentrum minimum, Prorocentrum micans, Prorocentrum gracile, Protoperidinium minutum, and Scrippsiella trochoidea appeared during blooms, whereas diatoms, diazotrophic cyanobacteria, and dinoflagellates (Akaskiwo sanguinea, Karlodinium veneficum, Gyrodinium spirale, Oxyrrhis marina, Polykrikos kofoidii) were observed under non-bloom conditions. This study highlighted the most favorable physical and meteorological conditions for K. selliformis bloom occurrences and also pointed out species indicators for bloom establishment and others for non-bloom conditions. Monitoring the dynamics of these species with the associated physical and meteorological variability offers valuable information to plan for the best options for prediction of potentially toxic blooms of K. selliformis and associated dystrophic consequences.

AB  - River-lake water exchange reflects hydrological connectivity and the dynamic relationship between the river and the lake. The water exchange is crucial for lake level variation, downstream river discharge and the ecosystem. To figure out the water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, a data-driven model was established based on the support vector regression and genetic algorithm technique. Nine scenarios were set with different river-lake hydrological conditions, divided into two categories: single-element change scenarios, where only the river conditions or only the lake conditions changed, and combined scenarios, where both elements changed simultaneously. The model could accurately simulate the river-lake water exchange variations. Scenario simulation results show that increasing the river flow or lowering the lake level could cause a decrease in the lake outflow. Conversely, decreasing river flow or raising the lake level could cause an increase in lake outflow. Changing lake conditions have a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than changing river conditions if the change percentages of the situation indicator values are the same. Similarly, lake level increase has a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than lake level decrease. The combined scenarios indicate the additive effect of the corresponding single-element change scenarios, with a clear linear relationship between their lake outflow changes. This study provides an efficient model for simulating complex hydrological flow relationships in river-lake systems, and supports the management of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake by providing the characteristics and causes of the river-lake water exchange.

AB  - Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) fixed in tree rings are dependent upon environmental conditions. Old northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) trees were sampled at their northwestern limit of distribution in central Canada. The objectives of the study were (i) to investigate the association between tree-ring delta C-13 values and radial growth in addition to the response of these variables to climate, (ii) to assess site differences between two sites varying in moisture regime, and (iii) to compare tree-ring delta C-13 of T. occidentalis with that of other boreal tree species growing at the northern limit of their distribution in central Canada. Over 2500 tree rings comprised of 15 T. occidentalis trees were analyzed for delta C-13. Annually resolved delta C-13 (1650-2006) and ring-width (1542-2006) chronologies were developed. During the year of ring formation, ring width was associated with spring and early-summer conditions, whereas delta C-13 was more indicative of overall summer conditions. However, compared with delta C-13 values, ring width was more often associated with climate conditions in the year prior to ring formation. Conditions conducive to moisture stress were important for both parameters. Although ring width and delta C-13 corresponded to the drought intervals of the 1790s, 1840s, 1890s, 1930s, and 1960-1970, ring width may be more responsive to prolonged drought than delta C-13. Tree-ring delta C-13 could, however, provide important information regarding physiological adaptations to drought.

AB  - To assess the state of soil and plant resources of the territory of several river catchments, the indicator of soil-productive potential (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation based on ground and remote data, FAPAR), as well as indicators of the phytomass reserve, data on phytocenosis production and land use, and leaf area index (LAI) were used. It is shown that ecosystems of river basins located in different climatic zones react ambiguously to climate change. The data obtained make it possible to forecast the dynamics of soil-productive potential in the conditions of changes in climatic characteristics, such as temperature and precipitation. It is shown that the productive potential continues to grow with time only in those areas, where the amount of biologically active temperatures is a limiting factor, i.e., in river basins within the zone of mixed forests. It is found that in river basins with limited precipitation, the temperature increase will lead to a decrease in the soil productive potential.

AB  - The forced air cooling system plays an important role in the safe operation of power converters. Condition monitoring its health status can improve the reliability of power converter and reduce the cost of unscheduled maintenance due to over-heating. This letter proposed to use the natural frequency of thermal network as an indicator to monitor the aging process of cooling system. We show that the degradation of the cooling system can be monitored by detecting the variation of thermal network natural frequency. Experimental tests on a three-phase dc/ac converter with forced air cooling system are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. This method is simple to implement and does not need to measure the power loss. Moreover, it enables the concurrent monitoring of multiple components in the cooling system.

AB  - Multicomponent surface architectures are introduced that operate with three different dynamic covalent bonds. Disulfide exchange under basic conditions accounts for the growth of stacks on solid surfaces. Hydrazone exchange under acidic conditions is used to add a second coaxial string or stack, and boronic ester exchange under neutral conditions is used to co-align a third one. The newly introduced boronic ester exchange chemistry is compatible with stack and string exchange without interference from the orthogonal hydrazone and disulfide exchange. The functional relevance of surface architectures with three different dynamic covalent bonds is exemplified with the detection of polyphenol natural products, such as epigallocatechin gallate, in competition experiments with alizarin red. These results describe synthetic strategies to create functional systems of unprecedented sophistication with regard to dynamic covalent chemistry.

AB  - Introduction: A growing belief that accounting can and should play a role in halting and reversing degradation of ecosystems is leading to conceptual and methodological developments that recognize the cost of degradation, attribute the cost to the entities responsible and assure that entities can't ignore the economic burden associated with it. Outcome: Demonstration accounts prepared around a scenario where agricultural use of land includes an obligation to maintain ecosystem condition. The accounts are compliant and coherent with both the international accounting standards for individual entities and the United Nations' System of Environmental-Economic Accounting. Discussion: Accounting for liabilities for ecosystem degradation demonstrates that, where the liability reflects the lost economic value of the ecosystem, the accounts communicate a reduction in the total net worth of the economy and a redistribution of net worth away from the party responsible for the degradation. The inclusion of both liabilities for degradation and the cost of degradation does not lead to double-counting the economic impact of degradation. Conclusion: Accounting principles and frameworks encourage greater accountability for entities responsible for ecosystem condition by providing greater visibility of the economic cost to individual entities, governments and nations.

AB  - Ptilochronology is a cost effective tool for determining the nutritional condition of birds. The technique uses the daily growth of feathers to decipher diet and habitat quality as well as contaminant load. To date, most studies using ptilochronology have focused primarily on passerines. The use of the technique in other orders, primarily waterbirds, could lead to a significant increase in their utility as bioindicators of estuarine health. I performed a survey of study skins from the Museum of Natural History in New York, NY and the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington. DC to determine whether feather growth bars are present in waterbird species. Three hundred specimens representing 52 species were examined (orders: Pelicaniformes, Suliformes, Gruiformes). Few species did not possess discernible feather growth-bars, and in one case, this may be attributed to a nocturnal foraging habit. Because the majority of species did exhibit measurable growth-bars, it seems as though ptilochronology can be applied in waterbird studies as an efficient tool for management purposes in estuarine habitats.

AB  - Whether females can obtain genetic benefits from mate choice is contentious, and the main problem faced by previous studies of natural populations is that many factors other than paternal genes contribute to offspring fitness. Here, we use comparisons between sets of naturally occurring maternal half-sibling collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, to control for this problem. We show, first, that there are paternal genetic effects on nestling fledging condition, a character related to fitness in this species. Further, the magnitude of the paternal genetic contribution to this character is related to the size of a condition-dependent male secondary sexual character. Our results demonstrate that genetic benefits from mate choice can be predicted by the size of a secondary sexual character, and therefore provide direct support for indicator models of sexual selection.

AB  - A novel disinfection device based on ionic membrane electrolysis technology was developed in this study. To test the feasibility of the newly developed system in rural and emergency water supply, biological assay for the electrolytic system was carried out. The biological efficacy results show that a high concentration of coliform bacteria can be effectively inactivated both in synthetic contaminated water and natural source water, while the chemical indicators of water quality changed only slightly after disinfection. To reduce the operating cost of the system, the electrolyte feeding method and flow rate of the electrolytic cell were optimized. Results of operating conditions show that the operation cost can be reduced by changing the electrolyte feeding method from pump-driven to gravity-driven. As the flow rate was 2.4 L.h(-1), the system has the lowest operation cost, which was 93% lower than adding commercial sodium hypochlorite solution. This paper suggests promising applications of the novel disinfection device based on ionic membrane electrolysis technology in drinking water disinfection or emergency water treatment.

AB  - The Purna alluvial basin of central India, infilled largely with areno-argillaceous sediments of Quaternary age, is also marked by occurrences of both pedogenic and non pedogenic calcretes of diverse shape and size. The previous includes nodular, laminar, hardpan and root calcretes along with rhizolith balls and rhizospheres, whereas non pedogenic type is represented by groundwater calcretes. These calcretes have been investigated for their morphological details, lithological associations in both vertical and lateral profiles of the alluvial deposit and paleoclimatic reconstructions. This study shows that the area under investigation has undergone through subtropical, arid and semiarid climatic conditions having low to medium humidity, high rainfall and evaporation that favored formation of various types of calcretes. Nodular calcretes, the most dominant morphotype, are preserved in a wide spectrum of lithology and fluvio-lacustrine environment. To some extent, their formation is controlled by parent material, irregular rainfall and mild temperature. Rapid accumulation of carbonate material, in and around the plant roots giving rise root calcretes of various shapes and size is a common phenomenon in warm and dry climatic conditions. Both hardpan and groundwater calcretes are formed due to CaCO3 precipitations in humid condition having heavy rainfall. Besides, the later also indicates arid to semiarid conditions facilitating the movement of Ca rich solution in the unconsolidated sediments through capillary action that later deposited calcium carbonate in the voids during wet and dry conditions. Well preserved rhizolith balls and rhizospheres in the palaeosols, constituting together the lower part of succession in almost entire alluvial basin, acts as potential paleoclimatic indicator.

AB  - Crop plants undergo morpho-physiological changes throughout the growth process in response to both the internal and the external environment, and that eventually determine the yield. The system-level adjustment of the morpho-physiological changes has remained largely unclear, however, especially in field conditions. Here, we reveal changes in nutrient status associated with tiller development and soil conditions based on the leaf transcriptome profile of rice (Oryza sativa) throughout the entire period of growth. We performed gene co-expression network analysis and identified three gene sets as indicators for monitoring the internal nitrogen and phosphorus status. Expression profiling reveals that the phosphorus starvation response is expressed during the tillering stage and is then switched off with the transition to nitrogen deficiency. Coincident with phosphorus status dynamics, the level of phosphate in the leaf is demonstrated to be low during the tillering stage and subsequently increases drastically. The phosphorus dynamics are genetically validated by analysing mutants with a defect in phosphorus homeostasis. Notably, we show that nitrogen limitation directly suppresses the phosphorus starvation response. Finally, the phosphorus starvation response is demonstrated to be activated in soil with a high phosphate retention capacity, without the visible pheno-types associated with phosphorus starvation. Our results reveal a growth stage- and soil condition-dependent reaction that requires phosphorus, which is expressed to promote the phosphorus uptake required for developing tillers and is directly adjusted by nitrogen status. A molecular framework for elucidating nutrient status dynamics under field conditions would provide insights into improving crop productivity.

AB  - The paleopathological record of neoplastic conditions in the past is considered scarce. The detection of tumours in ancient populations is hindered by the quality and quantity of signs visible on the skeleton, the methodological approach, the preservation of remains, and by difficulties of differential diagnosis. The aims of this paper are to report the extensive and multiple osteolytic lesions observed in an adult male and to discuss the possible etiology of these lesions. The individual, a 71-year-old male who died in 1932, is part of the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection. Records indicate that he died of a heart lesion'. The present study used macroscopic, radiological, and computerized tomography examinations to analyse the skeletal remains of the individual number 439. The type and pattern of the lesions detected, which were most prominent on the skull, were compared with both clinical and paleopathological diagnostic criteria for different nosologic groups. The differential diagnosis addresses problems expressed both in clinical and in paleopathological literature with regard to the difficulties in distinguishing metastatic tumours from multiple myeloma. The nature of the lesions represented by this individual precludes an exact diagnosis. Therefore, we employed a broader category, neoplastic condition, instead of choosing a more specific diagnosis that would likely have resulted in a misdiagnosis due to overlapping features on this individual's condition. Further investigations are necessary to establish more replicable indicators and to improve confidence in retrospective diagnosis of these types of conditions.

AB  - Concentration profiles of Mg, K, La, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, As and Mo were determined in samples from a freeze core taken at the deepest site of Baldeggersee in 1993. The special coring technique allowed an exact dating of the sediment samples and an annual resolution of the profiles. Long term changes in benthic redox conditions produce diagnostic trends in several metal profiles. Fe, As and Mn enrichments trace the onset of anoxia at the deepest site of the lake. High values of Mo concentrations and Cr/V ratios indicate periods of stable anoxic conditions in a meromictic hypolimnion. A comparison of oxygen time series with metal profiles between 1950 and 1990 indicates that Mn reacts sensitively to large seasonal variations of deep-water oxygen concentrations.

AB  - In 2014-2015, 13,477 Mongolian schoolchildren (5833 boys and 7644 girls from different regions of the country), aged 8-17, were subjected to a comprehensive biological study. The program included 501 anthropometric and anthroposcopic traits. Out of this set, bodily dimensions and functional parameters were used for the present paper. Their analysis was carried out among residents of mountain-taiga, steppe, and desert zones, which are still the main ecological niches of Mongolia. The urban sample (the best known Mongolian population, which included only subjects born and living in Ulaanbaatar) was used as a control group. The urban children and adolescents, as well as those living in the mountain-taiga zone, are characterized by maximal average values of the parameters. In the capital, these parameters are mostly affected by the living conditions, which are the best, confirming the results of previous studies. At the same time, the stressful urban factors account for higher indicators of the hemodynamic system in urban schoolchildren. The resemblance of these characteristics in steppe and desert dwellers results from relatively similar climatic conditions and physical stress patterns.

AB  - Global climate change effects will vary geographically, and effects on estuaries should be independently considered. This review of the impacts of climate change on the ecotoxicology of chemical contaminants aims to summarize responses that are specific to estuarine species. Estuarine organisms are uniquely adapted to large fluctuations in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH, and yet future changes in climate may make them more susceptible to chemical contaminants. Recent research has highlighted the interactive effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors on chemical uptake, metabolism, and organism survival. Assessments have revealed that the nature of the interaction between climate variables and chemical pollution will depend on estuarine species and life stage, duration and timing of exposure, prior stressor exposure, and contaminant class. A need for further research to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity under different abiotic conditions and to incorporate climate change factors into toxicity testing was identified. These efforts will improve environmental risk assessment of chemical contaminants and management capabilities under changing climate conditions

AB  - We studied the bark beetle guild (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in the ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona to explore if the species assemblages and relative abundance differ between managed and unmanaged stands. Four stand conditions were assessed: (1) unmanaged stands with high tree density, (2) thinned stands, (3) thinned and burned (with prescribed fire) stands and (4) stands that had been burned by stand replacing wildfires. The study was conducted in the ponderosa pine forests of the Coconino Plateau, northern Arizona. For several decades this area has been relatively free of bark beetle outbreaks despite the current overstocked condition of many stands. We found that a similar species assemblage composed of Dendroctonus frontalis, D. brevicomis, D. valens, A approximatus, D. ponderosae, and Ips pini occurred across all four stand conditions over 3 years of study. The population levels of all these species were endemic across all stand conditions. The non-aggressive D. approximatus and D. valens were indicator species for thinned and unmanaged stands, respectively, but this was not consistent among years. The ambrosia beetle Gnathotrichus sp. and the bark beetle predator Enoclerus sp. consistently indicated stands burned by wildfire. In addition to our field experiment, we analyzed the historical pattern of attacks of bark beetles in our area of study. Our findings suggest that the pattern of attack of D. brevicomis (the only Dendroctonus species for which attacks have been reported) and Ips spp. has been through scattered small infestations in groups of 1-10 trees. Whereas small infestations by Ips spp. are increasing, those for A brevicomis are decreasing. Although we agree that the high density stands in northern Arizona are in an "unhealthy" condition, our results do not show that they were supporting large bark beetle outbreaks. Our results challenge the theoretical assumptions about the relationship between stand structure, tree resistance and bark beetle performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Indicators" are a key component of resource management, but selecting them can be difficult and controversial. This study explores different methods for selecting impact indicators for management of trail conditions by comparing photo survey methods (PSM) with written survey methods (WSM). A total of 661 subjects participated in interviews conducted within Mudeung- Mountain Provincial Park in Kwang-ju, Korea. PSM explained variation in acceptability better than WSM. Six major photo components (in order of importance: area of large rocks on trail, area of wood steps, area of bare roots, area of bare soil, area of small stones, and area of stone steps) explained 84.7% of the variation in acceptability of trail management conditions. This study suggests that PSM can be a useful tool for selecting impact indicators.

T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL

CP  - International Conference on Past Global Changes
AB  - Two main types of Palaeolithic sites in southern Poland and western Ukraine: caves or rock shelters and loess sites, offer different evidence concerning former climatic variations. The most characteristic cave deposits for cold climatic conditions are angular, cryoclastic limestone rubble and loess in cave entrances. In loess profiles, arctic conditions are clearly marked by the presence of ice wedge casts and soil wedges. In cold and humid conditions, solifluction and cryoturbation features characteristic of active layers and ground ice structures developed. During periods of warm and humid climatic conditions, cave loam and chemically weathered limestone rubble originated in caves. Intensive chemical weathering formed mineral crusts on surfaces of limestone particles. The most distinct indicators of temperate climate in loess profiles are fossil soils: forest or steppe ones, depending on humidity. Remnants of animals, especially those of stenothopic taxons. provide very important evidence of environmental and climatic fluctuations. The data from both types of sites complement each other.
   Precisely documented profiles of cave and loess sites cover the time span from the decline of penultimate glaciation to the end of Vistulian time. Older cultural layers corresponding to the penultimate interglacial were found recently. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hamilton (2016) shows that an imperfect economy with extraction cost and any substitutability among inputs is sustainable along an exponentially decreasing path of extraction (EDP) under a generalized Hartwick rule with resource rent measured in SEEA-2012 (System of Environmental-Economic Accounting) units. Mathematically, the result is correct. The problem is that Hamilton offers this approach as ``the correct policy rule for sustainability'', although this saving rule may be inapplicable to real economies because the prescribed investment may exceed output. In particular, the Cobb-Douglas economy's output goes to zero along EDP even if there is no cost, no health damage from resource use, and all output is invested. The prescribed investment is feasible for the economy with the infinite resource-capital elasticity of substitution. This economy also may be sustainable, depending on initial conditions, along EDP with a reasonable constant saving rate. This result extends Hartwick (2003) disclaimer about substitutability among inputs to the generalized version of the rule. Moreover, the result shows that the assessment of sustainability and accounting prices for real economies depends, besides allocation mechanism, on specification of technology and initial conditions.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach represents an important and still evolving concept that has the potential to redefine perspectives in ecosystem management by linking different scientific areas within a common framework. Birdwatching is a recreational ecosystem service whose importance has grown in recent years, providing support for rural economies and community-based conservation. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of this ecosystem service dynamics under realistic scenarios of environmental change. We propose the birdwatching potential index, an original approach supported on non-parametric robust scale estimators to assess change in attractiveness of birdwatching hotspots. A demonstrative case study is described, integrating the index within a hybrid modelling framework and testing its performance in dissimilar dynamic scenarios. Contrasting environmental conditions resulted in divergences in the birdwatching potential index and concomitant recreational ecosystem services delivered. The framework simulations also provided information that was considered useful for guiding local conservation actions and management practices to upsurge birdwatchers' interest for a specific hotspot.

AB  - Sixty-seven shells of living land snails were selected from 3 1 different localities across Italy to investigate the relationships between their oxygen isotopic composition (delta Os-18) and the mean value of local rainfall (delta(18)Op). Despite the difficulty for some localities to correctly estimate the oxygen isotopic composition of local rainfall, a good relationship was found. This indicates that the oxygen isotopic composition of environmental water used by the snails is, in Italy, strictly related to that of the local meteoric precipitation. However, the relationship found is substantially different from that previous established for central Europe, indicating that regional climatic conditions are important in defining the final isotopic composition of land snail shells. Moreover, these equations may not hold for different climatic conditions existing during, for instance, glacial and interglacial periods. The data also show that isotopic differences among species are relatively narrow and that they may depend on ecological factors (i.e., style of life) rather than any clearly identifiable different vital offset.

AB  - Delirium is defined as an acute, fluctuating syndrome of altered attention, awareness, and cognition. It is common in older persons in the hospital and long-term care facilities and may indicate a life-threatening condition. Assessment for and prevention of delirium should occur at admission and continue throughout a hospital stay. Caregivers should be educated on preventive measures, as well as signs and symptoms of delirium and conditions that would indicate the need for immediate evaluation. Certain medications, sensory impairments, cognitive impairment, and various medical conditions are a few of the risk factors associated with delirium. Preventive interventions such as frequent reorientation, early and recurrent mobilization, pain management, adequate nutrition and hydration, reducing sensory impairments, and ensuring proper sleep patterns have all been shown to reduce the incidence of delirium, regardless of the care environment. Treatment of delirium should focus on identifying and managing the causative medical conditions, providing supportive care, preventing complications, and reinforcing preventive interventions. Pharmacologic interventions should be reserved for patients who are a threat to their own safety or the safety of others and those patients nearing death. In older persons, delirium increases the risk of functional decline, institutionalization, and death. Copyright (C) 2014 American Academy of Family Physicians

AB  - In this study we present systematic framework to analyse the impact of farm profiles as combinations of environmental conditions and management practices on common diseases in dairy cattle. The data used for this secondary data analysis includes observational data from 166 farms with a total of 5828 dairy cows. Each farm is characterised by features from five categories: husbandry, feeding, environmental conditions, housing, and milking systems. We combine dimension reduction with clustering techniques to identify groups of similar farm attributes, which we refer to as farm profiles. A statistical analysis of the farm profiles and their related disease risks is carried out to study the associations between disease risk, farm membership to a specific cluster as well as variables that characterise a given cluster by means of a multivariate regression model. The disease risks of five different farm profiles arise as the result of complex interactions between environmental conditions and farm management practices. We confirm previously documented relationships between diseases, feeding and husbandry. Furthermore, novel associations between housing and milking systems and specific disorders like lameness and ketosis have been discovered. Our approach contributes to paving a way towards a more holistic and data-driven understanding of bovine health and its risk factors.

AB  - Investigating the factors influencing the performance of social conditioning in the network environment is the core issue for improving academic performance. Through the search of existing literature, the paper analyzes the main factors that influence social conditioning learning in current research, and through the questionnaire survey and in-depth processing of the raw data, the advanced behavioral indicators related to learning are obtained and analyzed by Spearman correlation coefficient and fuzzy modeling in machine learning. The results showed that the twelve dimensions of motivation regulation, trust building, efficacy management, cognitive strategy, time management, goal setting, task strategy, peer support, team assessment, help seeking, environment construction, and team supervision were significantly related to group performance, with team supervision having a significant negative relationship with group performance. In addition, trust building, team supervision and environment construction were the main factors for online social learning, effectiveness management, task strategy, peer support and help-seeking were the secondary factors, while motivation regulation, cognitive strategies, goal setting and team assessment had little impact on the final performance. The findings have some implications for the optimization of social conditioning learning support services and the improvement of social conditioning learning performance.

AB  - To characterize the magnetic signature of sediment heavy metal contamination and identify sources of heavy metals in mangroves, 83 sediment specimens were collected from three mangroves in Fujian, China; various magnetic parameters and heavy metal concentrations were then determined. Variation in magnetic magnetization among specimens was linked to changes in pseudo-single-domain magnetite. Average values of Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn (but not Cr or Pb) were slightly lower than background levels. Geochemical evidence suggested that Co, Cr, Ni, Ti, and V were associated with lithogenic minerals in the sediment, while Cu, Pb, and Zn were associated with terrigenous minerals. A strong positive correlation was seen between magnetic concentration-dependent parameters and metal concentrations (Cu, Pb, and Zn), suggesting enrichment of metal-containing magnetic minerals with heavy metal pollution. The combined assessment of both sediment magnetic properties and heavy metal concentrations thus provides insight into the pollution status of mangrove sediments under complex conditions.

AB  - Indigenous forests across North America have been and continue to be transformed. The implications of these changes are far reaching and include the loss of habitat, biological diversity, and ecological services, as well as diminished air and water quality. The northern flying squirrel is a forest obligate that achieves its highest density in old growth, facilitates critical symbiotic relationships, and is an essential prey of disturbance-sensitive predators. Its reliance on old-forest attributes varies with community diversity, and its sensitivity to isolation renders it an ideal indicator of landscape connectivity The results of numerous studies reveal the squirrel's acute sensitivity to disturbance at multiple spatial scales, which renders it an effective sentinel of forest ecosystem processes and condition over both geological and ecological time scales. Therefore, a thorough understanding of its ecology can inform projections and the effective mitigation of continued disturbance of ecological communities of boreal and montane coniferous forests.

AB  - Uncertainty evaluation of ecological model is critical for improving prediction and identifying effective management strategies of shallow lakes. In this study, an automatic calibration approach was developed to precisely evaluate the values of uncertainties. In the approach, the inherent and environmental uncertainties are reflected from the evaluation of parameter values and the input of boundary conditions, respectively. By the approach, both the optimal values of parameters and the uncertainty levels of parameters and boundary conditions are accurately calibrated against observation data. The approach was coupled with an ecological model and applied to a case study. Modeling results showed good agreement between simulations and observation data in the total trends as well as the detailed distributions. Comparing with deterministic modeling and arbitrary stochastic modeling, the calibrated stochastic modeling supported by the approach predicted the potential risk of remediation measures in a more reasonable form. These results suggest that the proposed approach and its coupling model are useful tools for uncertainty assessment and environmental management in shallow lake systems.

   What is the central question of this study? Hypoxia reportedly does not impair thermoregulation during exercise in compensable heat stress conditions: does it have an impact on maximal heat dissipation and therefore the critical environmental limit for the physiological compensability of core temperature?
   What is the main finding and its importance? Although skin blood flow was higher in hypoxia, no differences in sweat rates or the critical environmental limit for the physiological compensability of core temperature - an indicator of maximal heat loss - were found compared to exercise in normoxia, indicating no influence of normobaric hypoxia on thermoregulatory capacity in warm conditions.
   Altered control of skin blood flow (SkBF) in hypoxia does not impair thermoregulation during exercise in compensable conditions, but its impact on maximal heat dissipation is unknown. This study therefore sought to determine whether maximum heat loss is altered by hypoxia during exercise in warm conditions. On separate days, eight males exercised for 90 min at a fixed heat production of similar to 500 W in normoxia (NORM) or normobaric hypoxia (HYP, FIO2 = 0.13) in a 34 degrees C environment. Ambient vapour pressure was maintained at 2.13 kPa for 45 min, after which it was raised 0.11 kPa every 7.5 min. The critical ambient vapour pressure at which oesophageal temperature inflected upward (P-crit) indicated that maximum heat dissipation had been reached. Neither local sweat rates on the upper arm, back and forehead (average NORM: 1.46 (0.15) vs. HYP: 1.41 (0.16) mg cm(-2) min(-1); P = 0.59) nor whole-body sweat losses (NORM: 1029 (137) g vs. HYP: 1025 (150) g; P = 0.95) were different between trials. Laser-Doppler flux values (LDF; arbitrary units), an index of SkBF, were not different between NORM and HYP on the forearm (P = 0.23) or back (P = 0.73); however, when normalized as a percentage of maximum, LDF values tended to be higher in HYP compared to NORM at the forearm (condition effect, P = 0.05) but not back (P = 0.19). Despite potentially greater SkBF in hypoxia, there was no difference in P-crit between conditions (NORM: 3.67 (0.35) kPa; HYP: 3.46 (0.39) kPa; P = 0.22). These findings suggest that hypoxia does not independently alter thermoregulatory capacity during exercise in warm conditions.

AB  - Arcellacean (thecamoebian) assemblages recovered from Lake Sentani, a large tropical lake southwest of Jayapura, Irian Jaya, Indonesia, are characterized by low diversity and low abundances. Dominated by Centropyxis aculeata and Arcella vulgaris, this fauna is similar to those indicative of stressed environments (brackish conditions, high levels of industrial contaminants) in temperate regions. However, neither condition exists in Lake Sentani. Previous work has determined that the lake is oligomictic, characterized by weak circulation with turnover occurring only every few years. Prolonged isolation of the lake bottom produces progressively reduced oxygen levels and results in reduced productivity among benthic organisms. The feeble stratification that exists here creates reduced oxygen levels at depth providing a likely explanation of the stressed arcellacean fauna. The oligomictic conditions observed here and the resultant fauna are widespread and are characteristic of a large proportion of tropical lakes around the world. As the low bottom water oxygen conditions will have a serious impact on most benthic organisms in these lakes, other limnological signals including anthropogenic contamination mill be masked. This is a disappointing result as the utility that has been developed for the group as a limnological indicator in temperate lakes does not appear to apply in a significant proportion of low latitude lakes.

AB  - Universal accessibility allows the free movement of people regardless of their condition, exercising their right to the city, this is a characteristic of sustainable cities. The objective of this research was "To diagnose the areas of opportunity in the environment in the urban district 4 from the indicators of accessibility, taking as reference the 10 most frequent types of blocks in the environment in search of greater accessibility in the environment".
   The research is non-experimental, descriptive design, with a mixed approach, through documentation and simple observation. The level of accessibility was found by evaluating the 10 most frequent types of apples, the conditions of each of the indicators were also detected. The resulting accessibility is 46,247, rejecting the hypothesis "The urban district 4 of Puerto Vallarta has an accessible environment configuration".
   Puerto Vallarta is a tourist destination and has accessibility exclusively in tourist areas, it is necessary to also intervene non-exclusive areas of tourism and improve the conditions for the inhabitants. Urban actions impact on people, especially those who need better conditions to perform in the city and not be excluded from it.

AB  - Winter is often understudied in ecosystem sciences and viewed as a burden for human systems and infrastructure. However, the importance of winter in regulating ecological processes and shaping human communities has emerged as a topic of great interest, particularly in areas that experience seasonal snow cover. Traditional seasonal definitions may not fully represent below freezing winters and snow accumulation that have historically characterized these areas. Here we: (1) propose the concept of 'frigid winter' to address longstanding problems with traditional delineations of winter; and (2) define frigid winter as a period of sustained temperatures below freezing and snow accumulation that together regulate ecological processes and their services. We explore this definition and the changes occurring within it using 100 years of meteorological data from northeastern North America. Trend analysis demonstrates that frigid winters have shortened by similar to 3 weeks over the last century, that cold, snowy conditions have become more intermittent, and that the choice of winter delineation (astronomical, meteorological, hibernal, or frigid) influences the apparent rate at which winter conditions disappear.

AB  - The increase of anthropic activities in forest ecosystems has modified their environmental conditions and therefore their species composition. Species that endure these changes inhabit disturbed sites, as is the case of Acaena elongata in the fir forest in the Magdalena river basin, south of Mexico City. With the aim to explore the relationship between the high abundance of this species with the decrease in forest cover we compared the germination between seeds: 1) scarified and non-scarified in sites with different canopy covers, 2) with different storing ages (2 and 13 months), and 3) set to germinate under different light conditions (white, red, far red) and darkness, in germination chambers. Results showed that i) scarification favored significantly germination, ii) germination was indifferent to light, and iii) a year of storing did not reduce significantly their germination. This species is successful colonizing perturbed environments since it germinates under different light environments created by different canopy covers in the forest, with discontinuous germination along time.

AB  - Despite considerable knowledge of distribution, biology and parasitic variability (PV) of Meloidogyne hapla in cropping systems, how its PV relates to soil health conditions remains unknown. This study investigated the relationship between the presence or absence of M. hapla with soil food web and the abundance of nematode community in muck (high organic matter) and mineral soils of 15 agricultural fields and adjacent natural vegetation across three vegetable production regions of Michigan, USA. Meloidogyne hapla was present in all regions and all muck soils, but only in some mineral soils. It was present in soils with degraded and disturbed soil food web conditions, but there was no pattern with nematode trophic group abundance. However, principal component analysis showed distinct relationships among M. hapla presence or absence, soils, nematode abundance parameters in agricultural and natural vegetation. The study lays down a foundation for more targeted investigations to understand any links between the PV of M. hapla and its soil environment.

AB  - Ecological monitoring is a complementary component of the overall environmental management and monitoring program of any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. The monitoring method should be developed for each project phase and allow for periodic reporting and assessment of compliance with the environmental conditions and requirements of the EIA. Also, this method should incorporate a variance request program since site-specific conditions can affect construction on a daily basis and require time-critical application of alternative construction scenarios or environmental management methods integrated with alternative mitigation measures. Finally, taking full advantage of the latest information and communication technologies can enhance the quality of, and public involvement in, the environmental management program. In this paper, a landscape-scale ecological monitoring method for major construction projects is described using, as a basis, 20 months of experience on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Crude Oil Pipeline Project, covering Turkish Sections Lot B and Lot C. This analysis presents suggestions for improving ecological monitoring for major construction activities.

AB  - A modified version of the ALien Biotic IndEX (ALEX) has been recently proposed to evaluate biological invasions in macroalgal assemblages. ALEX was applied in a Marine Protected Area where a recreational-fishing port is present testing the following hypotheses: ALEX increases with the distance from the port, it changes between the two directions off the port and it changes among three different habitats: Cystoseira beds, algal turf and dead matte of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. A total of 78 native macroalgal taxa and 4 introduced species were found, the Chlorophyta Caulerpa cylindracea and the Rhodophyta Apoglossum gregariwn, Acrothamnion preissii and Womersleyella setacea. All study sites were in high quality status highlighting that the assemblages investigated were at an early stage of NIS invasion. However, ALEX detected different values among conditions and habitats within the MPA, suggesting a local dynamics of NIS spread and different resistance to invasion of the investigated habitats.

AB  - The magnitude and extent of eutrophication was assessed at 27 segments in 23 estuaries in the Southern California Bight (SCB) between October 2008 and 2009. We applied thresholds from the existing assessment frameworks from both the European Union and the U.S. National Eutrophication Assessment to measurements of three indicators [macroalgae biomass and cover, phytoplankton biomass, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration] to categorize eutrophic condition in each estuary. Based on these frameworks, a large fraction of segments had moderate or worse eutrophic condition-78 % based on macroalgae, 39 % for phytoplankton, and 63 % for DO. Macroalgal biomass exceeding 70 g dw m(-2) and 25 % cover was found at 52 % of sites during any sampling event and in 33 % of segments for 8 weeks or longer, a duration found to negatively impact benthic infauna. Duration of hypoxic events (DO < 4 mg L-1) was typically short, with most events less than one day; although 53 % of segments had at least one event longer than 24 h. Assessment frameworks of eutrophic condition are likely to evolve over time as the body of literature on eutrophication grows, including aspects such as the applicability of indicators in specific habitat types, indicator thresholds, and how event frequency and duration are incorporated. This paper informs this debate by discussing how eutrophic conditions in SCB estuaries are categorized using different indicators and thresholds. To this end, categorization of estuarine eutrophic condition was found to be very sensitive to the type of threshold, how data are integrated to represent duration or spatial extent, and how indicators are used as multiple lines of evidence.

AB  - At the "Pasino vrelo" source, groundwater is exploited by means of wells which tap a carbonate aquifer of Badenian age. The natural quality of groundwater complies with the provisions of the Regulation on health and safety of drinking water. However, anthropogenic impacts in the form of microbiological pollution have been observed. Extensive hydrogeological investigations have been conducted in recent years in the recharge area of the groundwater source with the aim of ensuring additional quantities of drinking water and protection of the source from pollution. The analysis of hydrogeological monitoring results for groundwater levels and discharges at the groundwater source confirmed the existence of a hydraulic connection between the Quaternary alluvial and Badenian carbonate aquifers. Differences in the hydrodynamic conditions between the "Pasino vrelo" spring and "Bojanica vrelo" spring have also been observed, and are related to the influence of pumping on the groundwater discharge regime, but also to drainage conditions at the springs. Hydrochemical indicators also suggest the mixing of groundwater from both aquifers in springs and exploitation wells. Specific hydrogeological conditions at the groundwater source determined the concept of its development. Recent hydrogeological research was carried out in order to explore the possibilities of tapping deeper parts of the carbonate aquifer in order to minimise the inflow of groundwater with anthropogenic impacts from the shallow alluvial aquifer during groundwater abstraction. Preliminary results for groundwater quality in the new well justified the aforementioned investigation approach. Intensive exploitation of the well will show whether these conditions are sustainable in the long term.

AB  - Integrating multiple metrics derived from stream macroinvertebrate communities into single scores that reflect ecological condition can bridge the needs of multiple groups using biomonitoring data. Macroinvertebrate metrics from 511 Waikato, New Zealand, stream samples were standardised by their maximum observed value. Metric redundancy and optimisation processes identified three standardised metrics from an initial set of 17 that provided greatest discrimination between reference sites and those influenced by urbanisation or high levels of pastoral development: the richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera excluding Hydroptilidae (EPT*), % EPT* and the macroinvertebrate community index (MCI). The mean of these standardised metrics was used to calculate the average score per metric (ASPM). Narrative condition bands were developed based on the lower SD of individual metrics for reference samples to distinguish "very high" values, and metric quartiles between this point and a hypothetical worst-case community were used to define "high", as moderate". "low". and "very low" bands. When compared with its component metrics, the ASPM distinguished reference conditions and low-moderate levels of catchment modification and local habitat degradation more accurately than EPT* richness or MCI, and displayed lower temporal variability within reference sites than either EPT* metric. The ASPM was calculated for an independent test data Set Of urban and reference sites which, respectively, were allocated to low-very low and high-very high narrative condition bands. This analysis suggests that prudent application of the ASPM can provide a parsimonious and effective screening tool for assessing the condition of wadeable streams where More Complex methods are not practical.

AB  - A research program was initiated in 1993 to monitor water-table depth, redox potential, and soil matric potential at four sites. The selected sites were woodlands with water tables present at or near the soil surface-during late winter-and spring. Soil morphology was described and permanent monitoring instruments were installed on eight soils. Hydrosequences of three soils, which represented an Endoaquept-Fragiaqualf-Fraglossudalf and a Fraguaqualf-Fraglossudalf-Fraglossudalf sequences, were studied at two sites. An Epiaqualf and a Fragiaqualf were monitored at each of the remaining sites. Six of the eight soils experienced wetland hydrology in most years, while the other two exhibited sporadic saturation events above 25 cm. Saturated conditions occurred mainly in late winter and spring, with longest duration in the lowest landscape positions. On the wettest soils, redox levels <200 mV developed during late winter and continued into the growing season. Of the six soils meeting the hydrology criterion only three experienced both, functional hydric soil conditions (<200 mV redox potential) and exhibited definitive hydric soil indicators. However, hydric soil indicators were also present in two of the three other soils that developed only moderately reduced conditions (<350 mV). In contrasts only one of the six soils with wetland hydrology did not meet the hydrophytic vegetation criterion, while one nonhydric soil met the criterion. The presence, depth, and quality of fragipans appeared to influence the expression of hydric conditions through episaturation, endosaturation, and amphisaturation processes, creating a range of aquic and oxyaquic conditions. These findings emphasize the complexity of seasonally saturated wetland ecosystems and the difficulties in assessing and implementing wetland identification and delineation criteria.

AB  - We studied the interactions between;weather, social dominance and body condition (fat and protein reserves) In a colour-ringed population of the Great Tit in the Killarney National Park, Rep. of Ireland in two mild winters (1990 and 1992) differing markedly in rainfall. Rainfall, but not temperature, was a strong predictor of mean daily fat levels (birds were fatter on wetter days) but did not predict muscle score. The birds were also fatter in the wet winter than the dry one, and this was a greater difference than predicted by daily rainfall alone. The effects of rainfall are considered in the context of ultimate and proximate cues to fattening. In contrast, muscle scores were greater in the dry year than the wet. On average, birds known to have survived from the 1990 to the 1992 winter had higher muscle scores, irrespective of their age or sex, in 1990 than those not seen again. In the wet winter, muscle score (but not fat) was positively correlated with a measure of individual dominance; in the dry winter fat was negatively related to dominance, and no relation was found between muscle score and dominance. These results indicate that individual differences in condition reflect differences in individual status, and that experienced environmental conditions strongly influence the relationship between social status and body reserves. This is the first field study of Great Tits relating condition and dominance among individuals rather than among status classes. We suggest that, under some circumstances, muscle may be a better indicator of condition than fat.

AB  - In order to keep a high level of welfare an animal has to interact with the environment. Predictability and controllability of environmental stimuli seem to be of major importance. Loss of predictability and loss of controllability have a detrimental effect on animals. We hypothesised that both loss of predictability and loss of controllability would, among other behavioural effects of frustration, lead to an increase in the number of gakel-calls in laying hens. The gakel-call, expressed during the thwarting of behaviour, presumably is an indicator of frustration in laying hens. Predictability of reward was offered by a classical conditioning procedure, controllability of reward by operant conditioning. Assuming that controllability is predictability plus added control we also hypothesised that loss of controllability would lead to higher levels of gakel-calls than loss of predictability. Twenty hens of two commercial strains of laying hens, 10 ISA Brown Warrens and 10 ISA White Leghorns, were used. These strains of hens are known to differ in their reaction to frustration. They were subjected to frustration during a classical and an operant conditioning situation in a counterbalanced design. We found that in both conditioning situations the hens gave more gakel-calls in the frustration treatment than in the control treatment. No difference in levels of gakel-calls during frustration between classical and operant conditioning was found.
   Both loss of predictability and loss of controllability seem to impair a laying hen's welfare. The results suggest that the strains differ in behavioural strategy during frustration. When using the gakel-call as measure for welfare this difference in behavioural strategy should be taken into account.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting is a coherent framework for integrating measures of ecosystems and the flow of services they provide to the national accounting of economic activity. Here we focus on the accounting of cultural ecosystem services, particularly, nature-based recreation in open access conditions in Finland. The aim is to improve national capacity to proceed to ecosystem accounting by illustrating possibilities in existing data and knowledge and by identifying data gaps. We apply the United Nations System of Integrated Environmental Accounting - Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA EEA) framework for recreation accounting to test its applicability, and to show how existing national forest and outdoor recreation-related data sets can support accounting. Assessment of the extent of recreational resources is based on data from areas available for recreation. In the assessment of recreational use, we illustrate how nationwide survey data can provide an estimate of the number of recreational visits to nature areas and a solid base for monetary accounts. We identify gaps in the extent, supply and use data for recreational ecosystem services.

AB  - The species Desoria trispinata (MacGillivray, 1896) is globally distributed but probably not native to Europe. Reports on its occurrence have increased substantially over the last years, proving that it is extremely successful, often dominating in number not only Collembola but the entire macroscopic soil fauna under favourable conditions. Still, D. trispinata has seldom been studied, and its systematic position is poorly understood. We compiled available literature on the ecology of this species, rendering information with respect to its success. In addition, during the past years we established a controlled laboratory culture and recorded life history data. Finally, we ran a molecular genetic analysis. COI sequence divergence between specimens of D. trispinata was low among specimens from Germany, UK and Russia (up to 0.1%) clearly separating these specimens from other species of the genus Desoria. However, distance to specimens of D. trispinata from Japan was high (up to 15.3%).

AB  - A multitude of rural areas is facing increasing conflicts with regard to rural development and nature conservation because of the rapid commercialization of farming and the building and improvement of roads. In Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, South West China, this development results in strong land use changes. An analysis of these changes demands an integrated approach addressing their ecological, social, and economic dimensions. Using a combined modelling system, the NabanFrame Modeling Framework, the interdisciplinary research project LILAC was able to provide the calculation of scenarios based on the current state of land use and economic and ecological effects. The papers in the special issue combine description of the different components of the framework with some examples of scenarios calculated with the framework. Furthermore, frame conditions for better implementation of environmentally friendly land use options are explored. The role of interdisciplinary research in the development of site-adapted and integrated land use solutions is described. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of sewage effluent on the abundance, condition (length and reproduction) and mortality of hulafish Trachinops taeniatus were investigated at multiple outfall and control locations on the central coast of New South Wales, Australia. Underwater Visual surveys found consistently fewer T. taeniatus at locations where sewage was discharged compared to control locations. The condition of T. taeniatus was investigated by comparing mean length and reproductive indices of fish from two outfall and two control locations. Fish from the largest outfall location were significantly smaller in comparison with fish from control locations. Gravid female fish from outfall locations had similar gonadosomatic indices but a significantly greater number of eggs and smaller size of eggs in comparison with fish from control locations. Mortality of T. taeniatus was investigated during 2-week, in situ, caging experiments at multiple locations and times and 80% of fish survived, although mortalities of up to 73% per cage were recorded at one sewage outfall. T. taeniatus may be a suitable environmental indicator species of sewage pollution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) confers significant morbidity, but its onset can be challenging to recognize. Pain or stimulation effects of conversation may mask or attenuate common clinical manifestations of OIRD. We asked whether pupillary unrest could provide an objective signal of opioid exposure, and whether this signal would be independent from the confounding influence of extrinsic stimulation. We conducted a cross-over trial of healthy volunteers using identical remifentanil infusions separated by a washout period; in both, pupillary unrest in ambient light (PUAL) was measured at 2.5-min intervals. During one infusion, investigators continuously engaged the subject in conversation, while in the other, a quiet environment was maintained; measures of respiratory depression were compared under each condition. We tested PUAL's relationship to estimated opioid concentration under quiet conditions, measured PUAL's discrimination of lower versus higher opioid exposure using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and assessed the effect of stimulation on PUAL versus opioid using mixed effects regression. Respiratory depression occurred more frequently under quiet conditions (p < 0.0001). Under both conditions, PUAL declined significantly over the course of the remifentanil infusion and rose during recovery (p < 0.0001). PUAL showed excellent discrimination in distinguishing higher versus absent-moderate opioid exposure (AUROC = 0.957 [0.929 to 0.985]), but was unaffected by interactive versus quiet conditions (mean difference, interactive - quiet = - 0.007, 95% CI - 0.016 to 0.002). PUAL is a consistent indicator of opioid effect, and distinguishes higher opioid concentrations independently of the stimulating effects of conversational interaction. Under equivalent opioid exposure, conversational interaction delayed the onset and minimized the severity of OIRD.

AB  - The prevailing meteorological conditions that influence the advection and diffusion of the atmosphere govern the distribution of atmospheric particles from its sources. The present study explores the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric aerosols over the Indian subcontinent (5 degrees-40 degrees N, 65 degrees-100 degrees E) and its dependence on the prevailing meteorological conditions. Eleven years (2002-2012) of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with meteorological parameters extracted from reanalysis data are analysed at monthly timescales. Wind speed, wind divergence and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) are studied as parameters for advection and diffusion of atmospheric aerosols. The result shows higher aerosol loading during the monsoon season with increased spatial variability. Wind speed and divergence correlate with AOD values both over land (R = 0.75) and ocean (R = 0.82) with increased aerosol loading at higher wind speeds, which are converging in nature. Owing to the varied climatology of the Indian subcontinent, land and ocean areas were classified into subregions. Analysis was carried out over these subregions to infer the influence of meteorological conditions on aerosol loading. Results are indicative of a distinct characteristic in the prevailing meteorological conditions that influence the distribution of certain aerosol types. Further, the PBLH was analysed as an indicator of atmospheric diffusion to infer its importance in aerosol distribution. The results indicate that PBLH explains almost 30 to 90% of the total variance in AOD over the subregions which is particularly evident during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons.

AB  - A method based on color information and contour fragments was developed to identify citrus fruits in variable illumination conditions within tree canopy, in order to guide the robots for harvesting citrus fruits. The color properties of fruit targets within citrus-grove scene were analyzed, a preliminary segmentation method was put forward by fusing the chromatic aberration information and normalized RGB model. The set of contour fragments was constructed by detecting the significant edges of chromatic aberration map and the corners within these edges. The valid subset was chosen out by three indicators of every fragment: length, bending degree, and concavity or convexity. The combination analysis was done for these valid contour fragments, and the ellipse fitting was used for every subset of valid fragments to recover the occluded fruits. The partial order relationship was derived based on the distribution of the edge within the overlapped area. The results showed that occluded fruits were effectively recovered under natural outdoor light conditions using the proposed method, and the relative error was 5.27%. The partial order relation of fruit targets provide key cues for path planning of harvesting robot. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decline index (indicator of crown condition) data from 102 forest plots (approximately 10 000 trees) during 1986-2004 were compiled to derive survival models for south-central Ontario, Canada. The dominant species was sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) with approximately 75% Occurrence (n = 7640). The predictor variables for sugar maple survivorship included the decline index of 1 or 2 years prior to the beginning of the modelled period and ecological region (Algoma, Georgian Bay, Huron-Ontario, and Upper St. Lawrence). The observed crown condition of sugar maple improved significantly over the study period; in contrast, short-term mortality rate did not improve. The risk of sugar maple mortality could be predicted from decline index data for a single year indicating that the risk of tree death increases With higher decline index values (declining crown condition). Moreover, using 2 years of decline index data indicated that the risk of tree death also increased with the length of consecutive time individual trees have higher decline index values. Trees in the Algoma region, which represent the northern limit of sugar maple distribution in Ontario, were significantly more likely to die than trees in Huron-Ontario region.

AB  - This study aims to identify the role of design and operational parameters in energy costs for a wastewater treatment plant in a meat processing industry regarding water-energy nexus. In the study, the energy cost index has been calculated using a derived numerical approach. This study recommends a new comprehensive methodology for energy cost estimation for an industrial wastewater treatment plant. The model is developed based on organic load, amount of wastewater, and energy consumption required to treat wastewater. Particularly, the impact of design and operational organic load parameters on energy costs has been investigated in this study. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) have been regarded as organic load indicators. The results show that the energy cost index of operational organic load is higher than that of the design for two parameters. Energy costs of COD removal are higher than BOD removal. The costs of COD removal are 726.6 and 65,520 euro/m(3) wastewater for design and operational conditions, respectively, whereas the energy costs related to BOD removal are 90.9 and 7224 euro/m(3) wastewater for design and operational conditions, respectively. Operational COD removal leads to maximum energy costs for the plant. The lowest energy cost is related to BOD removal of design conditions. In terms of water-energy nexus, wastewater reuse could be considered to reduce energy costs. The possibility of wastewater reuse as boiler feed water has been reported as 50.38%. According to the simulated results, energy costs could be minimized at approximately 49% if wastewater reuse were applied in the plant.

AB  - Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) provide a promising alternative to conventional engine-powered vehicles, with less emission and better fuel economy. This study proposes a hierarchical control for a power-split HEV over a driving cycle, featuring pre-trip optimisation and en-route speed adaption. Constraints including vehicle powertrain boundaries, road gradients, and speed limits, are taken into consideration. In the first stage, the HEV operating conditions, including the optimal vehicle SOC, speed profiles, and total driving time, are generated for the entire trip before departure. Based on the pre-trip results, the second stage adapts the vehicle speed for a short horizon when driving, while taking the safety spacing to the preceding vehicle into consideration, which acts as an indicator of actual traffic conditions and guarantees safe driving. Both optimisations are conducted under the distance domain for realising localisation in the optimal speed profile due to frequent changes in traffic conditions. An estimation of distribution algorithm is used to run the simulation so that the feasibility, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical control can be demonstrated.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes, plant species richness may depend not only on local habitat conditions but also on landscape structure. In addition, both present and past landscape structure may be important for species richness. There are, however, only a few studies that have investigated the relative importance of all of these factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of current and past landscape structures and habitat conditions on species richness at dry grassland-like forest openings in a forested landscape and to assess their relative importance for species richness. We analyzed information on past and present landscape structures using aerial photographs from 1938, 1973, 1988, 2000 and 2007. We calculated the area of each locality and its isolation in the present and in the past and the continuity of localities in GIS. At each locality, we recorded all vascular plant species (296 species in 110 forest openings) and information on abiotic conditions of the localities. We found that the current species richness of the forest openings was significantly determined by local habitat conditions as well as by landscape structure in the present and in the past. The highest species richness was observed on larger and more heterogeneous localities with rocks and shallow soils, which were already large and well connected to other localities in 1938. The changes in the landscape structure in the past can thus have strong effects on current species richness. Future studies attempting to understand determinants of species diversity in fragmented landscapes should also include data on past landscape structure, as it may in fact be more important than the present structure.

AB  - The combination of the number of species (simple diversity), an information function (Shannon diversity) and a measure of equitability is used to characterize modern ocean environments based on planktic foraminiferal faunas. Regional environmental conditions can be recognized as deviations from the global latitudinal trend. Simple diversity (number of species) offers relatively little resolution itself, because it is sensitive to the addition of rare species. Variable conditions, such as the highly productive spring bloom and upwelling, are characterized by relatively low diversity and equitability values. Relatively high diversity and a lesser increase in equitability are found in mixing zones of adjacent water masses. In extreme conditions diversity is low, whereas equitability is intermediate to high.
   Modern patterns can be applied to fossil sections, to reconstruct regional paleoceanographic conditions. Thus relatively low Shannon diversity with low equitability in Maastrichtian heterohelicid faunas from El Kef, Tunisia, is interpreted as indicating variable conditions. An increase in simple diversity mostly traces evolution of the heterohelicids as a group, which diversified during the Maastrichtian.
   The number of species through time is a function of available niches and as such related to oceanic circulation on a global scale. Therefore, when applying modern patterns to fossil sections, a distinction has to be made between global diversity trends and regional environmental change. The correlation between Cenozoic stable isotope record and number of planktic foraminiferal species suggest indeed that simple diversity registers changes in global circulation. Maximum number of species occurred in the Maastrichtian, the Middle Eocene and the early Middle Miocene. In these three instances the maxima are found after the start of a cooling trend and are interpreted as transition periods between two modes of ocean circulation, causing the temporary coexistence of old and new species.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the integral indicator for developmental stability, the fluctuating asymmetry (FA), in the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus populations that inhabit biotopes of different types (running rivers and still, dam lakes), when exposed to different types of anthropogenic pollution (domestic sewage pollution and heavy metal pollution) in south Bulgaria. A total of 920 P. ridibundus individuals were used for FA analyses over three years (2009-2011). Fluctuating asymmetry was defined by 10 morphological traits, using the index frequency of asymmetric manifestation of an individual (FAMI). In closed water basins, regardless of the nature of toxicants, the FA values in P. ridibundus populations were statistically lower than those in river populations. The FA values were constantly the highest under conditions of sustained anthropogenic pollution, with high concentrations of toxicants in rivers with domestic sewage pollution and heavy-metal pollution. The results provide better opportunities to use FA in P. ridibundus populations for bioindication and biomonitoring, and for parallel and independent analyses of the physicochemical assessment of the environmental condition.

AB  - Cytosolic caspase-3-like proteases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, have a central role in mediating the progress of apoptosis. Here to conveniently monitor caspase-3-like activity in the multicellular environment, we have developed genetically encoded switch-on fluorescence-base indicators that are cyclized chimeras containing a caspase-3 cleavage site as a switch. When cleaved by caspase-3-like proteases, the non-fluorescent indicator rapidly becomes fluorescent, and thus detects in real-time the activation of such caspases. We generate cultured cells constitutively expressing these chimeras, and all the healthy cells are non-fluorescent. When these cells are exposed to apoptotic stimuli, dead cells show strong fluorescence depending on caspase activation. With these tools, we monitor in real-time caspase-3-like activity in each cell under various conditions, and show for the first time that the environment of cancer cells affects their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in a modified soft agar assay. These biosensors should enable better understanding of the biological relevance of caspase-3-like proteases.

AB  - Increasing soil salinity represents a major constraint for agriculture in arid and semi-arid lands, where mineral nitrogen (N) deficiency is also a frequent characteristic of soils. Biological N fixation by legumes may constitute a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilisation in salinity-affected areas, provided that adapted cultivars and inoculants are available. Here, the performance of three peanut cultivars nodulated with two different rhizobial strains that differ in their salt tolerance was evaluated under moderately saline water irrigation and compared with that of N-fertilised plants. Shoot weight was used as an indicator of yield. Under non-saline conditions, higher yields were obtained using N fertilisation rather than inoculation for all the varieties tested. However, under salt stress, the yield of inoculated plants became comparable to that of N-fertilised plants, with minor differences depending on the peanut cultivar and rhizobial strain. Our results indicate that N fixation might represent an economical, competitive and environmentally friendly choice with respect to mineral N fertilisation for peanut cultivation under moderate saline conditions.

AB  - Behavioural changes of medaka (Oryzias latipes) treated with an anticholinesterase insecticide, diazinon (0.1 mg L-1), were continuously observed for 4 days in semi-natural conditions. Although variations occurred in individual specimens, the movement tracks appeared differently with typical short-range movement with irregular turns and shaking after the treatments. Eight movement patterns frequently observed before and after the treatments were selected, and the variables characterising the movement patterns were compared quantitatively. The variables were clearly differentiated when the movement patterns were correspondingly matched before and after the treatments (e.g., vertical movements, horizontal movements, etc). Meander and stop duration were highly different among the selected movement patterns. Additionally, different degree of toxic response behaviours could also be detected by quantitative characterisation of the variables. Response behaviour was confirmed with toxicological experiments that show the decrease in the acetylcholine esterase activity in the head and body of specimens. Quantitative investigations on the variables of the movement tracks suggested the usefulness of response behaviour as a monitoring tool for environmental assessment.

AB  - This paper examines the variability in foraminiferal assemblages in surface samples from coastal settings along the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula, as well as in the Pine Island Bay area. Material comes from water depths ranging between 20 and 1257 m, latitudes between 62 degrees and 73 degrees S, and bottom water temperatures from - 1.5 to 1.2 degrees C. The microfossil analysis within this broad geographical and environmental context provides a basis for paleo-environmental studies. Environmental affinities of the assemblages were interpreted based on a wide array of ecological conditions, including CTD data, as well as on faunal indices and ecological affinities of the key taxa. Six foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by calcareous taxa. Among other factors, they correspond to variable food supply, terrigenous sedimentation, and water mass properties. Another two assemblages are dominated by arenaceous foraminifera and reflect conditions corrosive to carbonate. Our findings indicate that preserved fossil assemblages in cores from these locations may not be accurate representations of living assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of the environmental sustainability of biofuel production, distribution, and use should be selected, measured, and interpreted with respect to the context in which they are used. The context of a sustainability assessment includes the purpose, the particular biofuel production and distribution system, policy conditions, stakeholder values, location, temporal influences, spatial scale, baselines, and reference scenarios. We recommend that biofuel sustainability questions be formulated with respect to the context, that appropriate indicators of environmental sustainability be developed or selected from more generic suites, and that decision makers consider context in ascribing meaning to indicators. In addition, considerations such as technical objectives, varying values and perspectives of stakeholder groups, indicator cost, and availability and reliability of data need to be understood and considered. Sustainability indicators for biofuels are most useful if adequate historical data are available, information can be collected at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, organizations are committed to use indicator information in the decision-making process, and indicators can effectively guide behavior toward more sustainable practices.

AB  - Historians have long noted an upswell in early-modern Germany in portents, signs worked in nature that pointed to future ills, and have interpreted this increase as an indicator of rising anxiety and fears, fears that were the result, either of a new 'guilt culture', or which were conditioned by the generally dismal relationship that sixteenth- and seventeenth-century people had to their environment. This article argues for a new interpretation. It relies on recent studies in the psychology of well-being which have shown that natural disasters and a dismal environment do not condition human beings to long-term fear and anxiety. Instead, the mind's ability to adapt to such trials is evidence of an evolutionary process of 'hedonic adaptation'. The subsequent investigation draws upon the works of Martin Luther, one sixteenth-century moralist generally judged to be among the bleakest critics of the time, to show that his attitude towards the environment was complex and multifaceted, and was not characterised by an unrelieved pessimism towards nature. The conclusions thus call upon scholars of natural disaster to distinguish carefully between long-standing theological commonplaces concerning sin and its effects upon nature and the genuine reactions of human beings to historical disasters.

AB  - Hypoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) < 2 mg l(-1)) have been documented in the nearshore coastal waters of Long Bay, South Carolina, United States of America, during summer months over the past several years. Hypoxia was documented in August 2009 in the nearshore ( < 500 m offshore) for ten consecutive days and four days in September 2009 corresponding with spring tides. This study measured radon activities of shallow beachface groundwater and nearshore bottom waters to estimate mixing rates and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the nearshore waters of central Long Bay. Statistical analyses demonstrate significant correlations between high bottom water radon activities, low DO, and cooler bottom water temperatures during hypoxic conditions. Elevated radon activities during hypoxia were significantly influenced by upwelling favorable conditions which severely limited cross-shelf mixing. Model results indicate mixing of nearshore and offshore waters was limited by up to 93% (range: 43-100%) relative to non-hypoxic conditions. Data suggests previously overlooked natural phenomena including limited cross-shelf mixing and SGD can significantly influence nearshore water quality. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pontocaspian ecosystems have deteriorated due to increasing anthropogenic pressures, including shipping activities. We studied the relationships between sedimentology, environmental and shipping variables, and the dinocyst distribution and abundance across the Pontocaspian region. Cyst diversity was characterized by the presence of 36 dinocyst morphotypes. Western Black Sea assemblages were dominated by Lingulodinium machaerophorum and Round brown cysts reaching values of 60% and 31.6% respectively. Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Impagidinium caspienense and Round brown cysts dominate the Caspian Sea assemblages with relative abundances of 80, 68 and 52%, respectively. Temperature, salinity and primary productivity are the main drivers for dinocyst distribution and species assemblages. Temperature controls the distribution and relative abundance of the potentially toxic species L. machaerophorum. Dinocysts assemblages reflect enriched-nutrient conditions in the North Caspian Sea and the Western Black Sea. Distance from the harbour correlates with dinocyst assemblages in the North and Middle Caspian Sea. This is likely to be related to the high shipping activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The results of multivariate analysis applied to the associations of benthic foraminifers and ostracods from surface sediments of the north Argentine continental shelf are presented in this study. We evaluated the distribution patterns and ecological preferences of species found in modern sediments from the north Argentine continental shelf, at depths between 15 and 130 m. We identified 61 species of foraminifers corresponding to the orders Rotaliida, Miliolida, Lagenida, Buliminida, Lituolida and Trochamminida, in addition to 18 species of ostracods that belong to the suborder Podocopina. The distribution of the ostracods Bradleya kaeslery Ramos, Coimbra and Whatley was extended to higher latitudes. It was determined that water depth and temperature were the factors that most affected the distribution of both types of microorganisms. Based on these data, we established three physiographical zones, which could be linked to the different water masses. In addition, the western limit of the Malvinas current at 80 m of water depth was corroborated. Our study highlights the potential use of benthic foraminifers and ostracods individuals as bioindicators for identifying oceanographic conditions in the Argentine continental shelf.

AB  - This article explores a context for designing a new natural theology. The starting point is that traditional developments in this regard, from Augustine to Aquinas, Paley, Boyle and Barth, do not get us much further. Our thinking reflects our world - a world which has changed dramatically under modern and postmodern influences, especially those of the sciences. A new natural theology is simply an account of nature and creatureliness with due regard to scientific advances. Consequently natural theology today must start 'from below' with a new anthropology that reflects the worldview of our time. As a result the article rejects absolute transcendence, replacing it with a horizontal transcendence that accords with humans' biological makeup and with present-day scientific thinking. In the framework of horizontal transcendence the pivotal problem of the human condition is no longer death, but life. This has radical implications for theological thinking. The example used in the article is the impact this has on Paul's theological method. Examples of theology centring on the problem of life are discussed briefly with reference to Girard, Zizek and Vattimo.

AB  - In order to know the spatio-temporal distribution of a cumacean community and its role as a bioindicator of different environmental conditions, a representative seaweed (Halopteris scoparin), with which cumaceans are associated, was sampled in different stations in Algeciras Bay during one year.:Five stations were sampled seasonally, and eight environmental factors were tested (temperature, hydrodynamism, silting, dissolved organic matter, organic matter in silt, suspended solids, compactness index, and interstitial volume). The physico-chemical study showed that the bay comprised an internal and an external areas, while the spatio-temporal study revealed the presence of three cumacean species, Cumella limicola, Nannastacus unguiculatus and Scherocumella longirostris. There was a clear difference in the distribution and the abundance of these species. In fact, C. limicola was more abundant in the inner area of the bay, whereas N. unguiculatus was more abundant in the outer area. Multivariate analyses were performed to explain the structure of this community along the different stations of the bay. The segregation was significantly related to hydrodynamism and algal parameters (interstitial volume and compactness index).

AB  - Periosteal reactions, porotic hyperostosis, and cribra orbitalia have been traditionally used in bioarchaeological studies as indicators of poor "health." However, the etiology of these conditions is greatly debated, not to mention the fact that the presence of these non-specific indicators of disease may in fact represent individuals who were able to combat the insult. Bone is limited in the way it can respond; therefore, the osteoblastic and osteoclastic responses involved in these indicators can represent a range of responses to stress (nutritional or environmental), disease, trauma, or congenital conditions. The clinical literature is quite varied on the cause of these skeletal conditions.
   With a reinterpretation of these pathological conditions in mind, we evaluate data on these three osteological markers of stress in a large skeletal sample from central California (n = 3000+) spanning nearly 5000 years (3050 BC - AD 1899). While there are temporal and regional trends in these skeletal markers, they do not always correspond to known periods of stress (e.g., environmental disruptions, European contact), and do not correspond with each other in terms of prevalence. We, therefore, offer an alternative explanation of these pathological conditions in light of these findings. Patterns of periosteal reactions may be a marker of survivability as they are most commonly seen in older individuals and decrease in times of extreme stress. Patterns of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis tend to track with times of stress; however, they are predominately seen in old adults. The lack of detailed data collection further makes their interpretation difficult.

AB  - Thermal stress due to losses and environment temperature causes degradation to paper/oil insulation systems in transformers, even at operating temperature. Experience indicates that thermal ageing of oil and paper in power transformers leads to the change of some insulation characteristics. In this paper, insulating papers immersed in oil have been acceleratory aged at 140, 150, and 160 degrees C under laboratory conditions. Some of the oil properties, such as water content, breakdown voltage, acidity; together with the aged insulating paper properties such as electric strength, dielectric dissipation factor and tensile strength were measured and analyzed. Also, insulation system conditions under thermal stress have been evaluated by electrical/distinctive techniques like recovery voltage, polarization and depolarization currents. Correlations between these parameters have been investigated. Finally, paper tensile strength has been used as a criterion to estimation of insulating paper life lime.

AB  - Generalized evolutionary methods, which successively construct and solve static equilibrium problems with progressive mesh adaptation, are useful tools for defining structures that utilize their construction material to greatest effect in the finite element sense. By basing the successive element erosion upon (i) the contribution of an element to the strain energy of a structure and (ii) a certain material efficiency indicator of a structure, several weaknesses associated with previous methods have been overcome. Under static loading conditions, the strain energy contribution of an element is determined solely by the related stiffness and displacement vector. Consequently, the method is effective, and efficient when applied to problems involving such loading conditions. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through numerical applications to the problem of optimizing the topologies of two structures, a cantilever structure and a Michell structure.

AB  - Differences or similarities in the variance of fitness traits are crucial in several biological disciplines, e.g. ecological, toxicological, developmental and evolutionary studies. For example the variance of traits can be utilized as a biomarker of differences in environmental conditions. In the absence of environmental variability, the differences of the variance of a trait can be interpreted as differences of the genetic background. Several tests and transformations are utilized when testing differences between variances. There is, however, a biological tendency for the variance to scale proportionally to the square of the mean (scaling effect) which can considerably bias the results of the tests. We propose a novel method which allows for a more precise correction of the scaling effect and proper comparisons among treatment groups and between investigations. This is relevant for all data sets of distributions with different means and suggests the reanalysis of comparisons among treatment groups. This correction will provide a more reliable method when using bioindicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicted climate changes due to greenhouse gas emissions will alter site and ecological conditions, increase instability in many ecosystems and expand the value of forest carbon and wood energy. Woody plants most often are faced with drought stresses, not only because of erratic rainfall, but also the result of climatic changes. Natural variability among wood species in terms of chances in induced water stress in stem moisture content is large. Under severe water deficit, plants have to face the dilemma of dying by drying or being starved of carbon. Changes in the water content of extensible tissues of the stem are readily reversible, causing diurnal variation driven by changing water potential in the xylem. This review intends: 1. to address how stems in woody species play an important role in water storage relevant to plant hydraulics, and 2. to present methodologies to estimate water content in stems of wood species.

AB  - There is no established approach for dealing with the active acoustic detection of biological targets in highly dynamic aquatic environments where intense physical interference means that standard techniques are unsuitable. This is a particular problem in ecologically important environments with emerging industrial significance such as marine energy extraction sites. We developed an automatic processing method which allows effective target detection with high sensitivity throughout variable acoustic conditions. The method is based on scale-dependent adaptive filtering of data and morphological analysis of short-scale backscatter contributions for the exclusion of intense turbulent features and isolation of biological targets. Echosounder platform deployments around marine energy infrastructure in a tidal channel provide test data which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Target validation and assessment is carried out by the analysis of multifrequency characteristics and direct inspection. The results deliver effective, quantitative, and repeatable assessment of ecological interactions and target distributions with clear implications for environmental assessment in high energy sites and promising applications in other contexts.

AB  - In conservation biology, researchers often want to study the reasons why an endangered population is faring poorly but are unable to study it directly for logistical or political reasons. Instead they study a species that substitutes for the one of concern in the hope that it will cast light on the conservation problem. Here we outline the assumptions underlying this approach. Substitutes can be different populations or species and may be chosen because they are similar biologically to the target or representatives of a constellation of species of which the target is one. They also may be used to develop a predictive model to which the conservation target can be related. For substitutes to be appropriate, they should share the same key ecological or behavioral traits that make the target sensitive to environmental disturbance and the relationship between population vital rates and level of disturbance should match that of the target. These conditions are unlikely to pertain in most circumstances and the use of substitute species to predict endangered populations' responses to disturbance is questionable.

AB  - Since it has become appreciated that soil nematode assemblages are abundant, diverse and contribute to soil nutrient turnover, they have been increasingly used as indicators of soil condition. Use of nematodes as functional indicators relies on the allocation of nematodes to feeding groups and reproductive strategies: in both cases Groupings are uncertain. Species within feeding groups vary in their food resources and response to environmental variables, as shown by the difficulties in managing plant-pathogenic nematodes. Therefore species-levJ discrimination is necessary to permit further advances in understanding the role of nematodes in soil processes and thus in ecosystem resilience. Analysis of published nematode lists shows that among the bacterial-feeding nematodes Cephalobidae are often the most abundant group in soils; Rhabditidae may increase following a resource pulse; in stressed, natural environments Plectidae may be important. To be comparable with other biota. nematode biodiversity assessment requires species-level identification. In many jurisdictions such identification will be difficult due to inadequate systematic knowledge of the nematode fauna.

AB  - Understanding the specific response of yeast cells to environmental stress factors is the starting point for selecting the conditions of adaptive culture in order to obtain a yeast line with increased resistance to a given stress factor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the specific cellular response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Ethanol Red to stress caused by toxic by-products generated during the pretreatment of lignocellulose, such as levulinic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, ferulic acid, syringaldehyde and vanillin. The presence of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural at the highest analyzed concentration (5704.8 +/- 249.3 mg/L) under aerobic conditions induced the overproduction of ergosterol and trehalose. On the other hand, under anaerobic conditions (during the alcoholic fermentation), a decrease in the biosynthesis of these environmental stress indicators was observed. The tested yeast strain was able to completely metabolize 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, syringaldehyde and vanillin, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Yeast cells reacted to the presence of furan aldehydes by overproducing Hsp60 involved in the control of intracellular protein folding. The results may be helpful in optimizing the process parameters of second-generation ethanol production, in order to reduce the formation and toxic effects of fermentation inhibitors.

AB  - Many bird species call during migration, but call rates not necessarily reflect migration intensity. They rather seem to increase under deteriorating flight conditions. Often, nocturnal mass collisions at illuminated structures coincide with such conditions and are accompanied with high call rates of migrants. Thus, call rates could act as an indicator for situations with high collision risk for birds namely at offshore sites with hardly any alternatives for landing. In the face of increasing numbers of offshore wind farms knowledge about the environmental conditions in which maximum call rates occur, is needed for mitigation measures.
   In this first long-term study at an off shore site in the southern North Sea we investigated the effect of weather on the frequency of flight calls of three thrush-species at an illuminated platform. Flight calls were registered automatically during three autumn migration seasons. Besides generally higher call rates from 5 to 2 h before until 6 h after midnight, call rates increased with tailwinds, a change of the tailwind component during the first part of the night, off shore crosswinds and very high humidity.
   A monitoring programme is suggested that could help to reduce mass mortalities at illuminated structures.

AB  - HFC-134a is a potential alternative material for CFC-12, which depletes the ozone layer. However, problems arise when used together with conventional refrigeration oils due to the extreme polarities of HFC-134a. FAG (polyalkylene glycol) and esters are tested with HFC-134a. This investigation enhances the testing method by taking the compressor's environment into account. Miscibility and material compatibility are proved with sealed glass tests. A testing environment charged with refrigerant gas more closely simulates the conditions of a compressor. The conventional refrigeration oils (mineral oils, alkylbenzene, PAO (polyalpha olefin)) tested here are immiscible with HFC-134a. However the FAG and ester oils are miscible with HFC-134a. The friction coefficient of the PAG/HFC-134a system is similar to that of the mineral oil/CFC-12 system at operating conditions. Ester oils are preferable at the start and stop condition in the lubricity aspect. FAG shows good lubricity in conditions of extreme contact pressure. Consequently, this test provides reliable results on compressor lubricity and material compatibility of refrigeration oils with HFC-134a. It suggests a methodological way for the proper selection of refrigeration oils that may improve the durability and performance of a compressor. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Seabird parents use a conservative breeding strategy that favours long-term survival over intensive parental investment, particularly under harsh conditions. Here, we examine whether variation in several physiological indicators reflects the balance between parental investment and survival in common murres (Uria aalge) under a wide range of foraging conditions. Blood samples were taken from adults during mid-chick rearing from 2007 to 2014 and analysed for corticosterone (CORT, stress hormone), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BUTY, lipid metabolism reflecting ongoing mass loss), and haematocrit (reflecting blood oxygen capacity). These measures, plus body mass, were related to three levels of food availability (good, intermediate, and poor years) for capelin, the main forage fish for murres in this colony. Adult body mass and chick-feeding rates were higher in good years than in poor years and heavier murres were more likely to fledge a chick than lighter birds. Contrary to prediction, BUTY levels were higher in good years than in intermediate and poor years. Murres lose body mass just after their chicks hatch and these results for BUTY suggest that mass loss may be delayed in good years. CORT levels were higher in intermediate years than in good or poor years. Higher CORT levels in intermediate years may reflect the necessity of increasing foraging effort, whereas extra effort is not needed in good years and it is unlikely to increase foraging success in poor years. Haematocrit levels were higher in poor years than in good years, a difference that may reflect either their poorer condition or increased diving requirements when food is less available. Our long-term data set provided insight into how decisions about resource allocation under different foraging conditions are relating to physiological indicators, a relationship that is relevant to understanding how seabirds may respond to changes in marine ecosystems as ocean temperatures continue to rise.

KW  - INFORMATION
AB  - This paper discusses the applicability of Visibility Algorithms to detect faults in condition monitoring applications. The general purpose of Visibility Algorithms is to transform time series into graphs and study them through the characterisation of their associated network. Degradation of a component results in changes to the network. This technique has been applied using a test rig of an aircraft fuel system to show that there is a correlation between the values of key metrics of visibility graphs and the severity of four failure modes. We compare the results of using Horizontal Visibility algorithms against Natural Visibility algorithms. The results also show how the Kullback-Leibler divergence and statistical entropy can be used to produce condition indicators. Experimental results show that there is little dispersion in the values of condition indicators, leading to a low probability of false positives and false negatives.

AB  - Hydromorphic soils are found around the globe and they are well distinguished from other soil classes. The nature and severity of hydromorphism in these soils is determined by redox reactions that are highly dependant on the level and duration of soil saturation with water. Redox potentials are good indicator of redox reactions and/or hydromorphism. However, these redox reactions and hydromorphic conditions are directly affected by the presence or absence of various factors such as oxygen, organic matter and micro-organisms. In this manuscript a comprehensive review is presented about the hydromorphic soils, causes of hydromorphism, measurement of hydromorpic conditions, factors affecting the hydromorphic conditions and how the redox reactions can play an important role in pedogenesis of hydromorphic soils.

A wide range of aromatic aldehydes easily undergoes condensation with malononitrile and 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione (dimedone) under solvent-free condition to afford the desired products of good purity in excellent yields. Taking into account environmental and economical considerations, the protocol presented here has the merits of environmentally benign, simple operation, convenient workup, and good yields.

AB  - The second member of Kongdian Formation (Ek(2)) of Cangdong Sag represents an excellent hydrocarbon source rocks interval target for crude oil and shale oil production in the Bohai Bay Basin. To reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions and reveal the mechanisms of organic matter enrichment of the Ek(2) shales, a series of analyses (total organic carbon (TOC), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, major and trace element analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD)) were performed on samples collected from the borehole of Cangdong Sag. The Ek(2) consists of fine-grained rocks deposited in a lacustrine environment, and it can be further subdivided into four members (Ek(2)(4) to Ek(2)(1)). The results show that the Ek2 contains a high abundance of thermally mature Type I and II kerogen, and most of the samples show good to excellent generative potential. The mineralogical compositions, dominated by quartz, feldspar, and dolomite, with subordinated calcite, clay minerals, and analcime. Specific major and trace elements were employed to analyze the changes in paleoclimate conditions, lake water chemistry, and the detrital influx of Ek(2). The vertical changes of paleoenvironmental indicators suggest that during the sedimentary period of Ek(2), the climate changed from semi-humid to arid, with the input of terrigenous detrital gradually decreased, and the salinity of the water increased. The relationship among the primary productivity, redox conditions, detrital influx indicators and TOC content suggests that primary productivity was the most critical factor in controlling organic enrichment, and the input of terrigenous debris promotes the increase in productivity. The high primary productivity, together with anoxic bottom water conditions, resulted in the greatest enrichment of organic matter in the lower part of Ek(2) shale (Ek(2)(3)). The upper part (Ek(2)(1)) is mainly composed of moderate-TOC calcareous shale, which is deposited under arid paleoclimate, with low detrital input, moderate productivity, and favorable preservation conditions.

AB  - Knowledge about interactions between habitat quality and individual condition is vital for understanding ecological processes. We examined variation in commonly used hematological indices and body mass in incubating and chick-rearing Red-necked Grebes (Podiceps grisegena) in Poland breeding under contrasting foraging conditions in ponds used for aquaculture. Grebes used either ponds with low prey availability in the early breeding period and abundant food in the brood-rearing stage (high-quality habitat), or ponds stocked with fish attractive as prey to spring-arriving adults yet later unavailable to chicks due to size constraints (low-quality habitat acting as an ecological trap). Parental effort, measured as the proportion of time allocated to food acquisition and provisioning of chicks, was greater in the low-quality habitat, although adult grebes spent less time foraging there than in the high-quality habitat early in the season. Scaled body mass was higher in incubating grebes than in brood-rearing grebes, regardless of habitat quality. Breeding stage by habitat interactions were significant for hemoglobin, erythrocyte count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), with greater MCV and MCH values (by 20-34%, on average) during brood-rearing than during incubation in the low-quality habitat, and the opposite pattern (by 15-16%) in the high-quality habitat. These hematological responses signify changes in physiological stress associated with parental workloads. Higher MCV and MCH levels (by 22-31%) during the chick-rearing stage in the low-quality compared with the high-quality habitat indicate that parents incurred physiological costs of breeding under ecological trap conditions. No significant effects were found on leucocyte indices (total leucocyte count and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio). We consider the hemoglobin- and RBC-related parameters to be promising indicators of habitat-driven stress associated with prolonged physical exertion, especially when multiple metrics are employed.

AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of water stress caused by global warming has significantly affected gross primary productivity (GPP). However, its impact is hard to capture as the water stress of different timescales simultaneously influence GPP through the effects of time lag and legacy. As a result, synthetically considering the roles of water stress in the current year and previous years in GPP is very important for accurate modeling of GPP. In this study, we introduced the water stress indicators of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at different timescales, GPP observations from global flux network and the remote sensing-based indexes to models of convolutional neural network (CNN). We built the optimal CNN model which effectively simulated the spatial patterns of GPP and detected their trends in interannual variation. The findings were as follows: (1) The CNN model with introduction of multi-timescale SPEIs that reflect both current and previous years' water conditions improved the accuracy of modeled GPP. This result indicated that although GPP is most sensitive to current water conditions, it is also clearly affected by previous years' water conditions. (2) The optimal CNN model that considered previous years' water conditions not only aptly simulated the spatial distribution of GPP, but also showed advantages in simulating the interannual fluctuations of GPP and its response to drought. Ignoring the previous water conditions will underestimate the interannual fluctuations of GPP and the impact of drought on GPP.

AB  - Mathematical algorithms have been developed as the foundation of an environmental assessment model for mobile shelters. The assessment model can be used for sizing the heating and cooling equipment and for evaluating the transient thermal responses of shelters under specified initial heat-up and cool-down conditions. This model differs from standard HVAC load models in the form of the transient responses that can be predicted for the shelter. Currently available commercial and public-domain HVAC models predict transient-load variations and energy usage based upon a fixed inside design temperature. Computer codes such as TRNSYS can predict transient indoor conditions, but require detailed input, which is usually not available for the typical shelter The new, shelter environmental assessment model has the ability to predict inside temperature as a function of variations in environment condition, HVAC equipment performance, and inside load conditions.
   The algorithms use a multi-node lumped-capacity model for the shelter walls, the equipment and the air inside the shelter since each of these elements has an energy-storage capacity. The model includes provisions for modeling camouflage netting as a thermal radiation shield having a negligible energy-storage capacity. Therefore, radiation-shield temperatures are computed from iterative, steady-state energy balances for each time step. The unknown temperatures for the elements with heat capacity are calculated at each point in time using a "marching" solution combined with the radiation-shield temperatures. The model is designed to accommodate the energy gains from equipment and personnel, and HVA C equipment operational features, with weather data for a specific location or from standard outdoor environmental conditions.

AB  - We investigated the concentration of heavy metals in the Fe-Mn nodules in soils derived from the carbonate rocks of typical karst areas in Guangxi, Southwest China. Compared with the soil background values in Guangxi, heavy metals are substantially enriched in the following order: Cd (268.13) > Pb (39.46) > Cr (11.80) > Zn (8.43) > Ni (6.16) > Cu (3.65). CaCl2 extraction results indicate that heavy metals in the nodules are substantially stable, while the proportions of the metals released to the surrounding environment are extremely low (<= 0.003%). Moreover, pH-static leaching experiments indicate that heavy metals can hardly be dissolved into the surrounding soil environment under natural conditions (pH 6-8). However, once the soil environment is acidified, heavy metals incorporated in the nodules will gradually release into the surrounding environment, thereby causing potential ecological risks.

AB  - Understanding how physical parameters within and adjacent to Prairie Pothole Region wetlands affect the surrounding biological communities is important for sound management decisions for agricultural and rangeland settings. We evaluated the wetland, adjacent non-wetland, and landscape physical parameters role in determining low prairie (sub-irrigated) species composition. We first developed hypothetical models using the physical variables collected from 193 wetlands in relation to the existing plant communities. The models were then evaluated using structural equation modeling and a final (alternative) model was developed from these results. The models developed indicated the importance of the low prairie community in proper ecological functioning of associated wetlands. A number of physical parameters measured can be used as indicators of declining plant community condition, one example being the potential of the low prairie plant community to be invaded by exotic species such as Bromus inerrnis Leyss.

AB  - Cedrus libani of Lebanon is a valuable natural resource and the dominant species in its natural ecosystem. Intense and diverse anthropogenic pressures over historical times raised concerns about its genetic vigor and continued survival. Our investigation of the genetic diversity included samples from all remnant natural populations. Assessment of the genetic diversity using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers revealed the persistence of considerable variation distributed within populations with low population differentiation corroborated by Bayesian and analysis of molecular variance estimates (G(ST) = 0.07, Phi(ST) = 0.09). Individual assignment tests were carried out to investigate measures of gene flow. Inferences concluded that this natural heritage is not currently threatened by inbreeding or by random genetic drift. Correlation studies investigated possible effects of spatial distribution and environmental conditions on genetic structure. A climatic trend corresponding to a temperature-humidity gradient correlated significantly with the level of genetic diversity, while the edaphic variation did not.

AB  - The southern margin of the Tethys Ocean was occupied by a broad, shallow continental shelf during the Permian-Triassic boundary interval, with the area of present-day Saudi Arabia located from 10 degrees to 30 degrees south of the paleo-equator. The strata deposited in modern Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the latest Permian mass extinction (LPME) are dominated by oolitic microbialite limestone (OML), which are overlain by skeletal oolitic limestones (SOL) capped by dolostones and dolomitic limestones (DDL). This succession reflects changes in depositional setting, which can be potentially tied to redox conditions using redox sensitive trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs). Statistical analyses reveals that trace elements and REEs are associated with detrital material, and possibly with diagenetic minerals as well. Proxies such as the Y/Ho, Pr/Pr*, Sm-n/Yb-n, La-n/Sm-n and La-n/Yb-n ratios indicate that REEs do not record a seawater-like pattern, and cannot be used as redox indicator. The presence of a normal marine fauna implies oxic conditions during deposition of the DDL and SOL units. However, the OML unit, which represents the immediate aftermath of LPME, lacks both a normal marine fauna and reliable geochemical signals, making it difficult to infer redox conditions in the depositional environment. Similar to published data from sections that reflect shallow marine condition in the LPME of the Tethys Ocean, chemical index of alteration values are consistently high throughout the study succession, suggesting globally intense chemical weathering in the aftermath of the LPME. As a result, geochemical redox proxies in shallow marine carbonates of the Tethys Ocean are likely to be contaminated by detrital material that have been generated by chemical weathering, and thus, other methods are required to determine depositional redox conditions.

AB  - Practical knowledge about the performance of a ship while navigating in ice is crucial for the selection of safe and efficient route for a ship. Existing route finding tools estimate ship performance in ice adopting numerous approaches, ranging from model tests and engineering models to experts-based guidelines. Therein ship performance is usually understood as attainable ship speed or the average speed in given ice conditions; rarely the probability of besetting in ice is taken into account. Those models despite being fairly accurate in the theory share the same shortcoming in practice. The latter encompasses three main issues: (1) inaccurate information about prevailing ice conditions, (2) presence of ice conditions that goes beyond the scope of the models, and (3) the effect of operational patterns and traffic organization on the performance of an individual ship. To approach those issues, we propose a hybrid model of ship performance in ice-covered waters. The hybrid model combines two other sub-models: engineering and data-driven. The former determines ship speed and besetting probability in ridged ice field with ice concentration close to 100%. The latter sub-model provides information on ship's speed in the actual ice conditions, where the speed is affected also by operational restrictions and icebreaker assistance. It is based on an extensive dataset combining ship data from automatic identification system and ice data from ice charts and ice forecast models. The presented hybrid model is valid for a specific ship type, which is ice going bulk carrier (IA Super ice class), operating within the Northern Baltic Sea winter navigation system. The obtained results reveal that the hybrid model in principle is capable of providing reliable information about the performance of a ship in a wide range of conditions accounting for environmental variability and existing operational conditions. The model is suitable for the purpose of safe route planning in ice for a single ship or group of similar ships, accounting for the economy and safety of a voyage.

AB  - The article presents the directions and results of econometric modeling of the level of interaction of stakeholders of construction enterprises. They are defined as natural and (or) legal entities or groups of persons interacting in the construction sector on the basis of strategic contours and social directions and are defined by functional, resultant, structural, process, strategic, complex features, the interaction of which has a certain level of risk and threat. That allows to form contractual relations in capital construction, to carry out architectural control, the corresponding calculations, which is provided by the design documentation, material and labor resources. To implement econometric modeling, a mathematical model of factors is constructed that characterizes the level of stakeholder engagement. A general indicator of the financial condition of construction enterprises is proposed, and a mathematical model for its determination is constructed.
   Within the framework of econometric modeling, criteria have been proposed that confirm the adequacy of the developed mathematical models. Interpreting the results of econometric modeling, the indirect influence of the level of formation and implementation of stakeholder interaction on the financial condition of construction enterprises is determined. This indicates that other factors influence the process and determines the need to increase the efficiency of stakeholder engagement in order to strengthen the financial condition of construction enterprises.
   The result of the study is the application of methods and models of econometric modeling and construction of the model of the influence of the integrated indicator of the level of stakeholder interaction of construction enterprises on the systemic factor of their financial condition. This created a quantitative basis for the application of directions and mechanisms for improving the effectiveness of stakeholder interaction in order to strengthen the financial condition of construction enterprises.

AB  - The functioning and development of the extractive industry depends on many unusual conditions that are not found in other industries, such as the size of deposits, the level of natural and technical hazards, geographic location, or the method of mineral extraction (open pit or underground). Therefore, it is difficult to use universal development assessment methods for such specific production units. As a result, the research undertaken in this article aims to develop an indicator method for evaluating the development potential of underground hard coal mines. This method is based on a theoretical and practical analysis of the conditions of functioning of hard coal mines, expert research, and multiple case studies verifying the operation of the presented development indicator. The first part of the article is devoted to identifying and analyzing the criteria for assessing the functioning of underground hard coal mines. Next, the essence and methodology of creating and interpreting the proposed indicator was presented. The second part of the article is empirical, and contains the results of the assessment carried out using the developed indicators for five Polish hard coal mines for the years 2011-2015. The results of the research indicate that the most important factors in the development of hard coal mines relate to the geological and mining conditions, and those concerning natural hazard levels. However, during the functioning, the financial conditions and related production conditions, which ultimately determine the survival and development of underground mining plants, gain in significance.

AB  - Water is one of the most important environmental factors defining the niche of terrestrial fungi, and fungi preserved in ombrotrophic peat deposits have the potential to indicate past variations in surface wetness and vegetation composition. This study aimed to assess the potential of fungal microfossils for palaeoclimate reconstructions. The environmental preferences of fungi were evaluated by assessing the relationships among fungal types, the peat-forming vegetation, the occurrence of fire, and water table status in fossil and modem samples from two raised bogs in northern England and Denmark.
   The microfungi which showed consistent patterns among the three datasets examined in the study were generally indicators of relatively dry (hummock-like) conditions, and the abundance of most of the abundant fungal types observed reflected the prevalent vegetation type more than the direct influence of local moisture conditions. A number of fungal microfossils were identified which can be used to consistently provide a qualitative reconstruction of past conditions on the surface of the bog, and accurately indicate shifts between relatively dry and wet local conditions. Spores, in general, provided more information about local moisture conditions than vegetative mycelia. Some of the more abundant types, particularly Type 12 spores, showed a characteristic distribution with water table depth, which was consistent between the two different sites examined in the study. These fungal types can form the basis of future quantitative reconstructions of past water table and therefore climate in ombrotrophic bogs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To investigate the effects of bacterial degradation on the distribution of alkenones and related compounds, the marine haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi strain CS-57 was incubated under different conditions with bacterial consortia isolated from cyanobacterial microbial mats from the Camargue region of France. Extensive degradation occurred under aerobic and denitrifying conditions, but the effects on U-37(k') values were variable, ranging from slight to moderate (0-0.1). Under oxic conditions, C-37 alkenes, C-37 and C-38 alkenones and the C-36 methyl alkenoate were rapidly degraded. The degradation Of C-37(k') alkenones by the aerobic consortium appeared to be selective in some flasks, resulting in a moderate increase in U-37(k') values by up to 0.1 (corresponding to an inferred temperature difference of 3 degrees C). This variation in response is attributed to the numerous possibilities of initial attack on the alkenone structures in the presence of oxygen, plus the well known diversity of aerobes which may use different degradative pathways. Under denitrifying conditions, C-37(k') alkenes appeared to be degraded to a much lesser extent than the alkenones and alkenoates. Although extensive alkenone degradation occurred under these anoxic conditions, the U-37(k'), index remained practically constant. Under anoxic non-denitrifying conditions, the production of unusual isomeric alkenes and alkenones was observed. The double bond positions in these compounds were identical to those in the original compounds, so they were tentatively assigned as cis/trans or trans/cis alkene and alkenone isomers. Their formation is attributed to the involvement of extracellular bacterial cis/trans isomerases. Owing to its coelution with the C-37:3 alkenone, the presence of one or more isomeric C-37:2 alkenone(s) leads to a simultaneous overestimation of the amount Of C-37:3 alkenone and underestimation of U-37(k') the C-37:2 alkenone, and could significantly affect the measured 37 value (an underestimate of up to 20% was found for some flasks). Clearly, the environmental conditions have a major influence on alkenone degradation and in some cases could produce changes in U-37(k') values that would lead to a bias of several degrees in reconstructed palaeotemperatures.

AB  - In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used for isolating faults and degradation phenomena occurring in photovoltaic (PV) panels. In the literature, it is well known that the values of the single diode model (SDM) associated to the PV source are strictly related to degradation phenomena and their variation is an indicator of panel degradation. On the other hand, the values of parameters that allow to identify the degraded conditions are not known a priori because they can be different from panel to panel and are strongly dependent on environmental conditions, PV technology and the manufacturing process. For these reasons, to correctly detect the presence of degradation, the effect of environmental conditions and fabrication processes must be properly filtered out. The approach proposed in this paper exploits the intrinsic capability of ANN to map in its architecture two effects: (1) the non-linear relations existing among the SDM parameters and the environmental conditions, and (2) the effect of the degradation phenomena on the I-V curves and, consequently, on the SDM parameters. The ANN architecture is composed of two stages that are trained separately: one for predicting the SDM parameters under the hypothesis of healthy operation and the other one for degraded condition. The variation of each parameter, calculated as the difference of the output of the two ANN stages, will give a direct identification of the type of degradation that is occurring on the PV panel. The method was initially tested by using the experimental I-V curves provided by the NREL database, where the degradation was introduced artificially, later tested by using some degraded experimental I-V curves.

AB  - Mathematical models for characterizing hydrocarbon-water transport under flowback conditions have been intensively developed in past years. However, there have been few studies on salt transport. In this study, a mathematical model modelling the flowback behavior of salt in a multi-porous medium consisting of hydraulic fractures (HF), induced natural fractures (IF) and shale matrix (MP) under multi-phase flow conditions is proposed. The model highlights two mechanisms driving salt transport between two directly connected media: advection and diffusion. Capillary pressure and chemical osmosis, which affect multi-phase flow, are also considered. Finite difference method is applied to solve the mathematical model, and a numerical simulator has been developed by using Wolfram Mathematica. The flowback simulation of salt for a hydraulically fractured shale well in Bakken Formation, North Dakota under multi-phase flow conditions was conducted. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify how total salt recovery was affected by different reservoir parameters: the salinity in shale matrix (Cm), the salt diffusion coefficient from IF to HF (D0), the salt diffusion coefficient from MP to IF (D1), the shape factor between IF and MP (alpha 2), formation wettability and clay content (xc). Finally, the proposed model was used for fracture parameter inversion in comparison to a commercial software in terms of the procedures and indicators of history matching, and the estimated fracture parameters. The proposed model helps to understand the salt flowback behavior under multi-phase flow conditions by simulating the salt fluxes driven by advection and diffusion between the different media, and is proved to be efficiently practical by simultaneously matching flowback salinity and fluid rates for field application.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise is a ubiquitous feature of the American landscape, and is a known stressor for many bird species, leading to negative effects in behavior, physiology, reproduction, and ultimately fitness. While a number of studies have examined how anthropogenic noise affects avian fitness, there are few that simultaneously examine how anthropogenic noise impacts the relationship between parental care behavior and nestling fitness. We conducted Brownian noise playbacks for 6 h a day during the nesting cycle on Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis) nest boxes to investigate if experimentally elevated noise affected parental care behavior, nestling body conditions, and nestling stress indices. We documented nest attendance by adult females using radio frequency identification (RFID), and we assessed nestling stress by measuring baseline corticosterone levels and telomere lengths. Based on the RFID data collected during individual brood cycles, adult bluebirds exposed to noise had significantly higher feeding rates earlier in the brood cycle than adults in the control group, but reduced feeding rates later in the cycle. Nestlings exposed to noise had higher body conditions than the control nestlings at 11 days of age, but conditions equalized between treatments by day 14. We found no differences in nestling baseline corticosterone levels or nestling telomere lengths between the two treatment groups. Our results revealed that noise altered adult behavior, which corresponded with altered nestling body condition. However, the absence of indicators of longer-term effects of noise on offspring suggests adult behavior may have been a short-term response.

AB  - Concern about the reproductive toxicity of plant protection products in honey bee reproducers is increasing. Because the reproductive capacity of honey bees is not currently considered during the risk assessment procedure performed during plant protection product registration, it is important to provide methods to assess such potential impairments. To achieve this aim, we used 2 different approaches that involved semifield and laboratory conditions to study the impact of fipronil on drone fertility. For each approach, the drones were reared for 20 d, from emergence to sexual maturity, and exposed to fipronil via a contaminated sugar solution. In both groups, the effects of fipronil were determined by studying life traits and fertility indicators. The results showed that the survival and maturity rates of the drones were better under laboratory conditions than under semifield conditions. Moreover, the drones reared under laboratory conditions produced more seminal fluid. Although these differences could be explained by environmental factors that may vary under semifield conditions, it was found that regardless of the approach used, fipronil did not affect survival rates, maturity rates, or semen volumes, whereas it did affect fertility by inducing a decrease in spermatozoa quantity that was associated with an increase in spermatozoa mortality. These results confirm that fipronil affects drone fertility and support the relevance of each approach for assessing the potential reproductive toxicity of plant protection products in honey bees.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a prominent model organism in a wide range of biological studies including toxicology. However, toxicological studies are often performed at species specific optimum temperature, and knowledge on the effect of different temperature regimes on the toxicity of metal ions is rather limited. To address this knowledge gap, present study investigates the effect of various thermal scenarios (simultaneous and sequential; acute and chronic) on the toxicity of Cu and Cd in zebrafish. For this purpose we assessed mortality and whole body metal burdens as indicators of toxicity and bioavailability, respectively, and whole body electrolyte concentrations and body condition as the indicators of physiological condition. Thermal pre-incubations (for 12 or 96 h or 28 days) and subsequent metal ion exposures (for 10 days) were conducted at 17, 22, 25, 28, 32 and 34 degrees C. The metal exposures were performed at Cu concentrations of 1.2 mu M and Cd concentrations of 0.2 mu M, both singly and in binary mixtures. Irrespective of thermal treatments, Cu exposures resulted in greater mortality than Cd exposures at the given concentrations. Moreover, the Cu and Cd mixture indicated a synergistic effect. While acute pre-incubation for 12 or 96 h at elevated temperatures increased mortality in the subsequent metal exposure at the optimum temperature (28 degrees C), pre-incubation at cold temperatures in this scenario appeared to increase tolerance towards the subsequent metal exposure. Chronic thermal pre-incubation of zebrafish to a range of temperatures for 28 days moderated the effect of temperature fluctuations on subsequent metal toxicity at the optimum temperature. Chronic thermal pre-incubation at a range of temperatures followed by metal exposure at the same temperature showed that environmental temperature variations (higher or lower than optimal temperature) coupled with metal exposure, led to increased mortality, furthermore, the highest whole body metal burdens were measured in this scenario. Nevertheless, neither the whole body burden of metals, nor the metal accumulation rate, were predictors of mortality, i.e. these two values were not higher in dead fish in comparison to those that survived the exposures. Finally, we observed a significant decrease in the whole body Na+ level of dead fish in comparison to fish which survived the exposure conditions, suggesting that survival depends on maintaining Na+ homeostasis under the applied multi-stress conditions. Overall, our results show that thermal pre-history and ambient temperature play an important role in determining the tolerance of zebrafish towards metal ion stress.

AB  - The selfing rate of pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides Stapf and Hubb.) has been determined under natural conditions. This species is said to be allogamous. Nine test plants homozygous for a particular allele on the alcohol dehydrogenase: ADH A locus (A1A1) were sown 2.5 m one from each other interspersed among 300 plants homozygous for the same locus (A2A2); these nine plants served as indicators of selfing. In the 20 spikes produced by these a test plants, the selfing rates varied between 2.2% and 21.7%. Selfing rates were not significantly different within spikes of the same plant, except for one individual. There was no significant correlation between the rate of selfing and the density of the pollen shadow (estimated from the number of spikes producing pollen during the female phase of test plants) or variation in protogyny.

AB  - Using a random sample of university students to test general strain theory (GST), this study expanded on previous tests of strain theory in two ways. First, situational anger was measured, a construct that had not been used thus far in assessments of general strain. In addition, this research examined the role of social support networks as a conditioning influence on the effects of strain and anger on intentions to commit three types of criminal behavior (serious assault, shoplifting, and driving under the influence of alcohol [DUI]). The results provided mixed support for GST. While the link between anger and crime was confirmed, the nature of that relationship in some cases ran counter to the theory. Moreover, the evidence indicated that the role of social support networks was complex, and varied as a conditioning influence on intentions to engage in criminal activities.

AB  - Mapping, monitoring and managing the environmental condition of riparian zones are major focus areas for local and state governments in Australia. New remotely sensed data techniques that can provide the required mapping accuracies, complete spatial coverage and processing and mapping transferability are currently being developed for use over large spatial extents. The research objective was to develop and apply an approach for mapping riparian condition indicators using object-based image analysis of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The indicators assessed were: streambed width; riparian zone width; plant projective cover (PPC); longitudinal continuity; coverage of large trees; vegetation overhang; and stream bank stability. LiDAR data were captured on 15 July 2007 for two 5 km stretches along Mimosa Creek in Central Queensland, Australia. Field measurements of riparian vegetation structural and land form parameters were obtained between 28 May and 5 June 2007. Object-based approaches were developed for mapping each riparian condition indicator from the LiDAR data. The validation and empirical modelling results showed that the object-based approach could be used to accurately map the riparian condition indicators (R-2 = 0.99 for streambed width, R-2 = 0.82 for riparian zone width, R-2 = 0.89 for PPC, R-2 = 0.40 for bank stability). These research findings will be used in a 26,000 km mapping project assessing riparian vegetation and physical form indicators from LiDAR data in Victoria, Australia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An important issue connected with conservation chemistry is how to improve the storage and exposure conditions in order to suppress the fading and degradation of dyes and other components of paintings. Although the oxygen-free exposure cassettes are commonly known in museums, there is still lack of information in the literature about the effect of anoxic conditions on the degradation of dyes. This study is an attempt to start a database formation on the dyes degradation. Five commercial dyes (indigo, dragon's blood, curcumin, madder, carminic acid) were submitted to accelerated ageing by exposure to intensive light in the visible range in both oxygen-free (anoxia) and -rich conditions. Degradation of the samples was investigated by several analytical techniques (attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and optical microscopy). The conclusions are based on the estimators (derived from the determination of colour differences from Vis spectra and from the changes in FTIR and Raman vibrational bands intensity). According to them, only indigo, dragon's blood and curcumin show greater stability in anoxic conditions in comparison with oxygen-rich ones while madder, carminic acid undergo greater degradation.

AB  - We assessed the effect of sewage-derived materials on the structural and functional attributes of the soft-bottom macrofauna at an increasing distance from the entire diffusion area. Our results showed clear spatial changes of macrofaunal density and biomass along the distance gradient from the main outfall. High values of biodiversity, species composition, and species linked to organic enrichment near the duct suggested that moderate organic stress affected this community. The traits analysis abundance-based, compared to biomass-based one, distinguished most clearly sewage contamination conditions. Functional diversity displayed spatial patterns with higher values in the less impacted sites and was significantly related to species numbers and the biotic indices (like M-AMBI). This approach is ideal for detecting macrofaunal functional changes due to sewage contamination. Thus, we infer that traits analyses could offer great potential for environmental assessment and monitoring of coastal areas influenced by human activities.

AB  - We produced and analyzed oasis structure information, and evaluated oasis functional stability using the multiple indicators based on Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) in the arid region of China in 2015. The results showed that the oases area was 193,734 km(2), accounting for 8.17% of the arid region of China. The spatial difference in the functional stability of oases was obvious. The Beijiang zone had the highest functional stability and was relatively stable state, and the Hexi Corridor-Alashan Plateau zone had the lowest functional stability and was relatively unstable. The functional stability is dominated by production and ecological functions, which have regional differences. Increasing oasis agricultural output, strengthening highway infrastructure construction and paying attention to education will become important ways to improve oasis functional stability. Water resources determine the ecological function, thus affecting the oasis functional stability. The results provide references for the formulation of related policies according to local conditions.

AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a range of threats to natural and built environmentsu, making assessments of SLR-induced hazards essential for informed decision making(3). We develop a probabilistic model that evaluates the likelihood that an area will inundate (flood) or dynamically respond (adapt) to SLR. The broad-area applicability of the approach is demonstrated by producing 30 x 30 m resolution predictions for more than 38,000 km(2) of diverse coastal landscape in the northeastern United States. Probabilistic SLR projections, coastal elevation and vertical land movement are used to estimate likely future inundation levels. Then, conditioned on future inundation levels and the current land-cover type, we evaluate the likelihood of dynamic response versus inundation. We find that nearly 70% of this coastal landscape has some capacity to respond dynamically to SLR, and we show that inundation models over-predict land likely to submerge. This approach is well suited to guiding coastal resource management decisions that weigh future SLR impacts and uncertainty against ecological targets and economic constraints.

AB  - Benthic communities are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances which can result in changes in species assemblages. A spatio-temporal survey of environmental parameters was conducted over an 18-month period on four different fringing reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia, with unusual vs. frequent human pressures. This survey included assessment of biological, chemical, and physical parameters. First, the results showed a surprising lack of a seasonal trend, which was likely obscured by short-term variability in lagoons. More frequent sampling periods would likely improve the evaluation of a seasonal effect on biological and ecological processes. Second, the three reef habitats studied that were dominated by corals were highly stable, despite displaying antagonistic environmental conditions through eutrophication and sedimentation gradients, whereas the reef dominated by macroalgae was relatively unstable. Altogether, our data challenge the paradigm of labelling environmental parameters such as turbidity, sedimentation, and nutrient-richness as stress indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Testate amoebae are an abundant and diverse polyphyletic group of shelled protozoa living in aquatic to moist habitats ranging from estuaries to lakes, rivers, wetlands, soils, litter, and moss habitats. Owing to the preservation of shells in sediments, testate amoebae are useful proxy indicators complementary to long-established indicators such as pollen and spores or macrofossils. Their primary use to date has been for inferring past moisture conditions and climate in ombrotrophic peatlands and, to a lesser extent, to infer pH in peatlands and the trophic or nutrient status of lakes. Recent research on these organisms suggests other possible uses in paleoecology and ecology such as sea-level reconstruction in estuarine environments, as indicators of soil or air pollution, and monitoring recovery of peatland. We review the past and present use of testate amoebae, the challenges in current research, and provide some ideas on future research directions.

AB  - 1. Excessive open-cast mining of lignite in the Lower Lausitia, eastern Germany, resulted in a new dimension in the field of stream system restoration. Up to 1990, 740 km(2) of landscape had been destroyed, including topography and stream systems. Loss of streams is also reaching far beyond the actual open-pit boundaries due to the coherent groundwater depression covering 2100 km(2).
   2. Stream system restoration takes place in a man-made landscape of which the least part comprises unnatural conditions. A conceptual framework for specifying long-term restoration goals in the man-made environment is established, adapted to the complexity of comprehensive landscape restoration. This includes extensive surveys of stream structures and assessment of ecological functions in the post-mining areas.
   3. Standards to evaluate possible scenarios of development must be explicit. Adapted to the specific constraints and the potential of the post-mining landscape, undirected abiotic processes should be the primary standard in the so-called natural recovery areas of the post-mining landscape.

AB  - International trends in the development of the bioenergy sector are currently geared toward increasing the volume and quality of green energy, as well as its economic, energy and environmental profitability. For the cultivation of fast-growing energy plants, it is important to identify species and their hybrids that are able to effectively exploit the conditions that different climatic regions offer them in order to create as much biomass yield as possible. The physiological processes of plants such as energy exchange, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, and water loss by transpiration are firmly linked to the air environment. Daily air temperatures and daily precipitation values from the Physicus meteorological station were used to evaluate climatic indicators. Then the values sum of active temperatures and hydrothermal coefficients were calculated. Growth dynamics and aboveground biomass production of Miscanthus were evaluated based on the percentage increment between measurements during the main vegetation period in the years under review. Multiple regression of dependence on growth parameters from SAT and HTC confirmed that microclimates of the site may affect plantations in particular by humidity conditions during the main vegetation period. Temperature conditions during the vegetation period do not affect growth dynamics.

AB  - In the literature, analytical models have been shown to be extremely useful for estimating the decay rates of coliform as fecal indicator microorganisms, providing reliable predictions of bathing conditions in coastal and continental waters. Although a number of different formulations have been developed in the literature, each one may only be suitable for specific environments, and no comparison between these methods has ever been carried out. In the present article, a comparative analysis of bacterial decay models, calculated by eight different formulations, was performed in coastal outfall plumes, considering identical environmental conditions of solar radiation, temperature and salinity. A statistical approach was applied to identify the differences in means and in behaviors of the results obtained in the various simulations. The results indicate good agreement between bacterial decay rates calculated with at least four methods that were considered more reliable, and at least one of the models was shown to be suitable for estimating bacterial decay rates under night-time conditions, considering only the combined influences of temperature and salinity. Moreover, under daytime conditions, it provides consistent decay rates when compared with measurements taken in the field.

TI  - Integration of computer imaging and sensor data for structural health monitoring of bridges
T2  - SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
LA  - English
AB  - The condition of civil infrastructure systems (CIS) changes over their life cycle for different reasons such as damage, overloading, severe environmental inputs, and ageing due normal continued use. The structural performance often decreases as a result of the change in condition. Objective condition assessment and performance evaluation are challenging activities since they require some type of monitoring to track the response over a period of time. In this paper, integrated use of video images and sensor data in the context of structural health monitoring is demonstrated as promising technologies for the safety of civil structures in general and bridges in particular. First, the challenges and possible solutions to using video images and computer vision techniques for structural health monitoring are presented. Then, the synchronized image and sensing data are analyzed to obtain unit influence line (UIL) as an index for monitoring bridge behavior under identified loading conditions. Subsequently, the UCF 4-span bridge model is used to demonstrate the integration and implementation of imaging devices and traditional sensing technology with UIL for evaluating and tracking the bridge behavior. It is shown that video images and computer vision techniques can be used to detect, classify and track different vehicles with synchronized sensor measurements to establish an input-output relationship to determine the normalized response of the bridge.

AB  - Measures of developmental instability such as fluctuating asymmetry reflect the ability of individuals to cope with stressful conditions during ontogeny, and a very low level of asymmetry is known a priori to be the optimal solution from a functional morphological point of view. Fluctuating asymmetry represents a potentially important tool for assessment of the reaction of animals to their environment and thus for the study of animal welfare. We measured fluctuating asymmetry in three skeletal characters in chickens raised under three different light regimes: (A) a 16:8 light-dark cycle, (B) a changing light regime, and (C) permanent light. Chickens reared under permanent light developed 40% larger relative asymmetry than chickens subjected to changing light and dark conditions. Tonic immobility, a behavioural measure of fearfulness, was positively correlated with fluctuating asymmetry in chickens reared under all three light regimes. Fluctuating asymmetry was also positively related to the severity of a leg pathological condition (tibial dyschondroplasia) and positively related to a measure of impaired walking performance, These results suggest that fluctuating asymmetry may provide a reliable indicator of the reactions of domestic animals to their rearing conditions.

AB  - Daphnia pulex were reared in Chaoborus-conditioned water containing the insecticide carbaryl, and their life history parameters and morphologies were investigated. The insecticide inhibited the animals' growth and reproduction and delayed their maturation time more intensely in the Chaoborus-conditioned water than in the control Chaoborus-free water, indicating that a kairomone of Chaoborus made the Daphnia more sensitive to the insecticide. The Chaoborus-conditioned water induced neckteeth formation of D.pulex in instars 1-2 and elongated the intermoulting period of juveniles. The moulting to the spined morphs and elongation in duration of juvenile stages seemed to increase the risk of damage from the insecticide. The potential population growth rate of D.pulex in treatments was estimated as a possible fitness indicator of the animals. It was reduced synergistically by the kairomone of Chaoborus and the insecticide. Some individuals kept neckteeth until the third or fourth instar stage when they were exposed to sublethal concentrations of the insecticide in the Chaoborus-conditioned water. This was considered as a result of synergistic effects of both the kairomone and the insecticide. Insecticides may be a factor inducing further development of protuberant structures in cyclomorphic Daphnia in natural water bodies.

AB  - During the last decades many estuaries underwent ranges of environmental pressure due to increasing anthropogenic pressures and the undertaken of mitigation measures to prevent the impoverishment of these areas. The Mondego estuary (NW Atlantic coast of Portugal), a mesotidal shallow estuary, is one typical case of this. In the 1980s, the system was characterized by rich and stable animal and vegetal communities, with no eutrophication symptoms (pre-eutrophi cation period), whereas during the 1990s, massive seasonal macroalgal blooms were observed and the concomitant adverse consequences on the system's biodiversity were registered (eutrophication period). More recently (2000-2010), eutrophication symptoms have gradually decreased due to several mitigation actions, whilst recent studies indicate that the system is recovering in terms of biodiversity and structure (post-mitigation period). The population dynamics and productivity of Echinogammarus marinus (Leach) (Amphipoda, Gammaridae), a key species associated to fucoids in many Northern Atlantic estuaries, was analyzed and compared throughout these three distinct periods in the Mondego estuary, using data collected between April 2009 and March 2010 and data from the 1980s (pre-eutrophication) and 1990s (eutrophication period). The goal of this study was to test if the long-term variation of E. marinus would somehow reflect the range of environmental conditions observed in the system from the 1980s until 2010. Results showed that, in the three different periods, the species exhibited higher densities during spring, with continuous sexual activity throughout the year, multivoltine life cycle and seasonal sex-ratio fluctuations. Moreover, salinity was a major factor affecting the amphipod population in all three periods. On the other hand, differences related to the production of E. marinus were detected, being clearly higher in the 1980s (pre-eutrophic period), followed by the last decade (post-mitigation period) and, finally, the 1990s (eutrophication period), where population production and density values were the lowest of all three periods. These results suggest that E. marinus production parameters reflected the decline in environmental conditions during the 1990s, as well as the partial recovery resulting from the application of mitigation measures, exhibiting a good sensitivity to environmental pressures, namely eutrophication. Therefore, we propose that in the last years, the Mondego estuary has been under an incomplete resilience period, characterized by some environmental improvement compared to the 1990s but still distant from the 1980s condition. Overall, E. marinus production parameters seem to be good indicators of the system's environmental condition and might be useful regarding monitoring programmes in most Northern Atlantic estuaries.

AB  - Recreational sailing sector has an impact on water quality in marinas. This study proposes a standard procedure to assess the environmental risk of marinas on water quality. Risk is assessed through integrating environmental pressures, environmental conditions and societal responses (i.e. the Pressure-State-Response model). Pressures are estimated considering the main driving forces: navigation, port, dredging and external activities. State is estimated through combining the susceptibility, the ecological value and naturalness. Response is estimated through environmental management instruments and adopted measures. Managers and authorities can hierarchically classify marinas from a multi-scale spatial framework. This tool is particularly powerful for generating local, regional or national atlases to prioritize environmental planning actions. The method is applied to 320 marinas along the Spanish coast. This implementation confirms the usefulness, versatility and adaptability of this procedure as a tool for the environmental management of marinas.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA) guidance recommends that field-truthing efforts proceed when modeled hazard quotients (HQs) suggest that toxicological effects are occurring to site receptors. To date, no field methods have been proposed by the regulatory community that can lead to definitive determinations of acceptable or unacceptable risk for birds and mammals, the two terrestrial classes of receptors that are commonly assessed using the HQ method. This paper describes rodent sperm analysis (RSA) as a viable method to be applied in the field at sites with historical contamination. RSA is capable of detecting biological differences that bear on reproduction, a highly regarded toxicological endpoint of concern in USEPA Superfund-type ERAS. The results of RSA's first application at a study site are reported and discussed. The paper also provides the rationale for RSA's efficacy in the context of Superfund and other environmental cleanup programs, where limited time and money are available to determine and evaluate the field condition.

AB  - Observations of tree canopy structure are routinely used as an indicator of tree condition for the purposes of monitoring tree health, assessing habitat characteristics or evaluating the potential risk of tree failure. Trees are assigned to broad categories of structural condition using largely subjective methods based upon ground-based, visual observations by a surveyor. Such approaches can suffer from a lack of consistency between surveyors; are qualitative in nature and have low precision. In this study, a technique is developed for acquiring, processing and analysing hemispherical images of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) tree crowns. We demonstrate that by calculating the fractal dimensions of tree crown images it is possible to define a continuous measurement scale of structural condition and to be able to quantify intra-category variance of tree crown structure. This approach corresponds with traditional categorical methods; however, we recognize that further work is required to precisely define interspecies thresholds. Our study demonstrates that this approach has the potential to form the basis of a new, transferable and objective methodology that can support a wide range of uses in arboriculture, ecology and forest science.

AB  - Results of Frequency Domain Spectroscopy measurements are known to be largely influenced by environmental conditions, such as the temperature. Because field measurements, last hours after de-energizing the transformer, the ambient temperature may affect the results. Especially in cold regions of the world, extreme care are required to interpret the results when performing tests at relatively low surrounding temperatures. A better understanding and analysis of the dielectric test results are therefore only possible with a clear understanding of the physical behavior of the insulation system in response to the ambient conditions. In this contribution, the dielectric behavior of a composite oil paper insulation system has been explained from the properties of Debye basic model. A series of experiments have been performed under controlled laboratory conditions with preset moisture content inside the insulation. The equivalent circuit parameters of a laboratory made oil paper condenser bushing model were obtained using a non-linear optimization procedure. Since the dielectric parameters values are geometry dependent, poles, calculated from resistances and capacitances, were used as they are independent of the geometry. It was shown that the poles can be regarded as parameters able to be used for insulation condition assessment.

AB  - Suburban residence is considered symbolic of the American dream. Despite growth in suburban minority and immigrant populations, the question of whether access to high quality residential environments is available to all households has gone largely unexplored. This paper helps fill this gap by evaluating nativity-status and racial/ethnic differences in a range of neighborhood conditions for both suburban and central city residents. The study relies on data from the 2001 panel of the American Housing Survey and focuses on a range of neighborhood conditions, including indicators of social disorder, measures rarely examined in studies of locational attainment. Contrary to expectations based on spatial assimilation theory, we find that many foreign-born households reside in significantly better neighborhoods than their native-born counterparts. In addition, when nativity-status differences are in the favor of native-born households, suburban location does not necessarily attenuate them. With respect to the effect of race/ethnicity, we find that it is generally a more consistent predictor than nativity status of households' neighborhood conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Declining biodiversity and ecosystem functions put many of nature's contributions to people at risk. We review and synthesize the scientific literature to assess 50-y global trends across a broad range of nature's contributions. We distinguish among trends in potential and realized contributions of nature, as well as environmental conditions and the impacts of changes in nature on human quality of life. We find declining trends in the potential for nature to contribute in the majority of material, nonmaterial, and regulating contributions assessed. However, while the realized production of regulating contributions has decreased, realized production of agricultural and many material commodities has increased. Environmental declines negatively affect quality of life, but social adaptation and the availability of substitutes partially offset this decline for some of nature's contributions. Adaptation and substitutes, however, are often imperfect and come at some cost. For many of the contributions of nature, we find differing trends across different countries and regions, income classes, and ethnic and social groups, reinforcing the argument for more consistent and equitable measurement.

AB  - Society is more and more interested in developing mathematical models to assess and forecast the environmental and biological health conditions of our planet. However, most existing models cannot determine the long-range impacts of potential policies without considering the complex global factors and their cross effects in biological systems. In this paper, the Markov property and Neural Network Ensemble (NNE) are utilized to construct an estimated matrix that combines the interaction of the different local factors. With such an estimation matrix, we could obtain estimated variables that could reflect the global influence. The ensemble weights are trained by multiple population algorithms. Our prediction could fit the real trend of the two predicted measures, namely Morbidity Rate and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It could be an effective method of reflecting the relationship between input factors and predicted measures of the health of ecosystems. The method can perform a sensitivity analysis, which could help determine the critical factors that could be adjusted to move the ecosystem in a sustainable direction.

AB  - Simple Summary: Black-flanked rock-wallabies (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) can reach high numbers in fragmented populations in the West Australian wheat-belt, where they can damage crops and cause habitat degradation. As they are threatened, we wanted a non-permanent control method that did not adversely affect the body condition of treated females compared to untreated females, using body condition as an indicator of general health and fitness. We gave adult female rock-wallabies deslorelin contraceptive implants to suppress their fertility and monitored the impact for three years. Treated females did not conceive new young for over two years. We did not detect any negative effects on body condition, suggesting that deslorelin may be an effective tool for managing overabundant populations of marsupials.
   Populations of Australian marsupials can become overabundant, resulting in detrimental impacts on the environment. For example, the threatened black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) has previously been perceived as overabundant and thus ` unwanted' when they graze crops and cause habitat degradation. Hormonally-induced fertility control has been increasingly used to manage population size in other marsupials where alternative management options are not viable. We tested whether deslorelin, a superagonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), would suppress reproduction in free-living adult female rock-wallabies without adversely impacting body condition. We trapped, synchronised reproduction and allocated female rock-wallabies to a placebo implant (control, n = 22), one (n = 22) or two (n = 20) subcutaneous implants of deslorelin. Females were then recaptured over the following 36 months to monitor reproduction, including Luteinising Hormone levels, and body condition. Following treatment, diapaused blastocysts reactivated in five females and the resulting young were carried through to weaning. No wallabies treated with deslorelin, conceivede a new young for at least 27 months. We did not observe adverse effects on body condition on treated females. We conclude that deslorelin implants are effective for the medium-term suppression of reproduction in female black-flanked rock-wallabies and for managing overabundant populations of some marsupials.

AB  - This review deals with the behaviour of river buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), in confinement and in extensive conditions, also focusing on the effects of different housing and rearing conditions on their welfare. The behavioural repertoire expressed by buffaloes in extensive and intensive conditions is similar to those displayed by other domestic ruminants. However, through natural selection, buffaloes have also acquired several morphological, physiological and behavioural (La wallowing) adaptations to hot climatic conditions. Buffaloes kept in intensive conditions and having no access to pasture and water for wallowing extend their periods of idling and are less often involved in investigative activities. Confinement is also associated with a reduction of space; however, no specific studies have been carried out to determine the specific requirements of this species. Space restriction can adversely affect various aspects of buffalo welfare, such as health (increased levels of lesions and injuries), social behaviour (increased number of agonistic interactions) and heat dissipation. The buffaloes, originating from tropical areas, are well adapted to large variations in food availability and quality, and to dietetic unbalances. As to human animal relationship, it has been observed that the incidence of stepping and kicking behaviour of buffaloes in the milking parlour is positively correlated with the frequency of oxytocin injections, whereas the frequency of positive stockperson interactions with the animals such as talking quietly, petting and gentle touching are negatively correlated with the number of kicks during milking. Data from farms where both dairy cattle and buffaloes are present show that avoidance distance measured in the pen is lower in buffaloes than in cattle. This may be attributed to the fact that buffaloes are generally recognised to be curious animals. Finally, the effects of different farming practices on animal-related indicators are described. However, these measures should be integrated into a monitoring protocol, such as the Welfare Quality (R) scheme, to reliably assess buffalo welfare in the current intensive farming conditions.

AB  - Subject of the study were 682 sheep of the Karakachan breed, reared in three flocks in the region of the Middle and Western Rhodopes in 2018. The aim of the study was to create a phenotypic characteristic of the main selection traits of Karakachan sheep, under different breeding conditions in a mountainous area. The live weight and fertility traits were studied at 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 years. Body measurements of sheep were taken at 2.5 years. The indexes for stretching, chest, massiveness and compactness were calculated. It was found that the Karakachan sheep breed meets the productivity and body measurements standards defined in the breeding program. The average live weight in the studied flocks varied from 36.620 kg to 39.410 kg under different conditions and altitude. The highest live weight was reached by the animals from the Agricultural and Stockbreeding Experimental Station (ASES) Smolyan - 40.53 kg at 4.5 years of age. The biological fertility for the studied period varied from 92.2% in ASES - Smolyan up to 103% in the village of Smilyan. Body measurements and body indexes establish the indicator dynamics, within the norm, under different breeding conditions and confirm the authenticity of the breed type in the Karakachan sheep breed.

AB  - X-ray contrast media (ICM), as the most widely used intravascular pharmaceuticals, have been frequently detected in various environmental compartments. ICM have attracted increasingly scientific interest owing to their role as an iodine contributor, resulting in the high risk of forming toxic iodinated byproducts (I-BPs) during water treatment. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art findings relating to the removal efficiency as well as oxidation intermediates of ICM by conventional and advanced oxidation processes. Moreover, formation of specific small-molecular I-BPs (e.g., iodoacetic acid and iodoform) during these processes is also summarized. Conventional oxidants and disinfectants including chlorine (HOCl) and chloramine (NH2Cl) have low reactivities towards ICM with HOCl being more reactive. Iodinated/deiodinated intermediates are generated from reactions of HOCl/NH2Cl with ICM, and they can be further transformed into small-molecular I-BPs. Types of disinfectants and ICM as well as solution conditions (e.g., presence of bromide (Br-) and natural organic matters (NOM)) display significant impact on formation of I-BPs during chlor(am)ination of ICM. Uncatalyzed advanced oxidation process (AOPs) involving ozone (O 3) and ferrate (Fe(VI)) exhibit slow to mild reactivities towards ICM, usually leading to their incomplete removal under typical water treatment conditions. In contrast, UV photolysis and catalyzed AOPs including hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) and/or sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) based AOPs (e.g., UV/hydrogen peroxide, UV/persulfate, UV/peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and CuO/PMS) and reactive chlorine species (RCS) involved AOPs (e.g., UV/HOCl and UV/NH2Cl) can effectively eliminate ICM under various conditions. Components of water matrix (e.g., chloride (Cl-), Br-, bicarbonate (HCO3-), and NOM) have great impact on oxidation efficiency of ICM by catalyzed AOPs. Generally, similar intermediates are formed from ICM oxidation by UV photolysis and AOPs, mainly resulting from a series reactions of the side chain and/or C-I groups (e.g. cleavage, dealkylation, oxidation, and rearrange). Further oxidation or disinfection of these intermediates leads to formation of small-molecular I-BPs. Pre-oxidation of ICM-containing waters by AOPs tends to increase formation of I-BPs during post-disinfection process, while this trend also depends on the oxidation processes applied and solution conditions. This review summarizes the latest research findings relating to ICM transformation and (by)products formation during disinfection and AOPs in water treatment, which has great implications for the practical applications of these technologies.

AB  - Primary production hotspots in the marine environment occur where the combination of light, turbulence, temperature and nutrients makes the proliferation of phytoplankton possible. Satellite-derived surface chlorophyll-a distributions indicate that these conditions are frequently associated with sharp water mass transitions named "marine fronts". Given the link between primary production, consumers and ecosystem functions, marine fronts could play a key role in the production of ecosystem services (ES). Using the shelf break front in the Argentine Sea as a study case, we show that the high primary production found in the front is the main ecological feature that supports the production of tangible (fisheries) and intangible (recreation, regulation of atmospheric gases) marine ES and the reason why the provision of ES in the Argentine Sea concentrates there. This information provides support to satellite chlorophyll as a good indicator of multiple marine ES. We suggest that marine fronts could be considered as marine ES hot spots.

AB  - Bioavailability and ecotoxicity of metals and their relation to geochemical conditions in aquatic environments were considered. It was shown that free ions are the most penetrative species of most metals, except for organometallic complexes of some metals, for example, mercury. We analyzed models for the assessment of the hazard of metal contamination of water environments using the results of thermodynamic calculations of free ion concentrations, the ability of biological receptors to bind them, and the toxic properties of the metals. A concept was developed on the main mechanisms of metal penetration and excretion and cytotoxicity of nonessential elements. A new method was proposed for the estimation of critical levels of polymetallic contamination of water on the basis of measurements of water complexation capacity and determination of the dose-effect relations between the integrated characteristics of the polymetallic contamination and indicators of the health of the ecosystems (in situ) from the results of investigations in the northern Kola Peninsula.

AB  - This paper focuses on the quantitative analyses of Early Miocene ostracods in south and north of the Sirjan area, southwest of Kerman. Detailed studies resulted in identification of 23 species of ostracoda. The coexisting benthic foraminifera and comparing the identified microfauna assemblages with previous studies confirms the Early Miocene age for the strata. The quantitative analysis show a low diversity in the ostracoda assemblages, in compare with other areas. The ostracoda community is classified into seven morphogroups. Several communities are recorded in the ostracoda morphogroups, which reflects basic changes in the basin condition. The morphogroups analysis also reveals that the basal parts of the sections are deposited in shallow and poorly ventilated waters, while a normal condition prevailed through upward. A period of instability is predominant after the normal condition and final stages of deposition took place in the near shore environment, which reflects the end of sea life. The stratigraphical position and structural history of the basement suggest that syndepositional tectonic activities were responsible for the fluctuations in the environmental conditions. This suggestion is confirmed by comparing the studied area with adjacent areas, where similar deposits are deposited on different basements.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used for modeling and optimizing microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of total polyphenolic content (TPC) from chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa) as a function of microwave power (300, 450 and 600 W), ethanol concentration (25%, 50% and 75%) and extraction time (5, 10 and 15 min). The set of the optimal operational conditions, as well as the conditions which gave the maximum yield of TPC while minimizing extraction time, solvent and energy consumption, (economic conditions), were proposed. Statistical indicators such as the coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrated the superiority of the ANN. In order to scale-up a MAE procedure of chokeberries TPC from the laboratory to the industrial scale, the following set of conditions was proposed: an ethanol concentration of 53.6%, the microwave power of 300 W and the extraction time of 5 min corresponded to a TPC yield of 420.1 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g of fresh plant material.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important indicator of the land surface environment. The combination of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could enhance the ability of extracting information on soil moisture conditions. In this study, we employed multitemporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products of LST, NDVI, and land cover types to obtain the information about soil moisture for the greater Changbai Mountains. We selected nine time periods in 2007 for inversion of the soil moisture conditions and focused the analysis on four critical time periods. According to the spatial pattern of the LST and NDVI, we established the "wet-edge" and "dry-edge" equations and determined the relative parameters. We obtained the temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) using the wet-edge and dry-edge relationships to reveal temporal changes of the land surface soil moisture conditions of the study area. We also analyzed the relationship between different land cover types in five TVDI classes. This paper demonstrates that TVDI is an effective indicator to detect soil moisture status in the greater Changbai Mountains region.

AB  - Seasonally dichromatic male superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) solicit extra-group fertilizations through displays of their brightly colored nuptial plumage during visits to females in neighboring territories.  This ornamental plumage is lost at the end of the breeding season, and reacquired before the next breeding season after a highly variable period spent in a cryptic, female-like, ''eclipse'' plumage.  Individuals start visiting females as soon as they return to nuptial plumage, often several months before the start of breeding.  We examine variation in the timing of acquisition of nuptial plumage in relation to environmental conditions and the age, social status, and condition of males.  We show that males undergo the prenuptial molt earlier as they age and when in superior condition, and that molt is delayed in years of more adverse winter weather conditions.  We propose that the purpose of male displays may be to advertise their quality, and that females use this variation in the timing of acquisition of nuptial plumage to assess the relative quality of prospective extra-group mates.  Molting earlier is apparently costlier, so this handicap would appear to be a reliable reflection of male quality.

AB  - This review examines the usefulness of the metrics BMF (biomagnification factor) and TMF (trophic magnification factor), derived from field measurements of the levels of contaminants in naturally occurring biota, for characterizing the bioaccumulation potential ("B") of chemicals. Trophic magnification factor and BMF values greater than 1.0 are often considered to be the most conclusive indicators of B status, and the TMF criterion has been referred to as the "gold standard" for B categorization. Although not wishing to dispute the theoretical primacy of field-derived BMFs and TMFs as B metrics, we make the case that, in practice, the study-to-study (and even within-study) variability of the results is so great that they are of very restricted usefulness for assessing B status, at least in the case of the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), on which we focus here. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the results of 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting field-derived BMFs or TMFs for 14 PFASs, for which BMF values often range over several orders of magnitude from << 1.0 to >> 1.0, sometimes even in the same study. For TMFs, the range is a factor of approximately 20 for the most intensely studied PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]). We analyze the possible causes for such variability: To some extent it results from the differing ways in which the metrics are expressed, but most of the scatter is likely attributable to such factors as nonachievement of the tacitly assumed steady-state conditions, uncertainties in the feeding ecology, the impact of metabolism of precursor compounds, and so forth. As more trustworthy alternatives to field-derived BMFs and TMFs, we suggest the implementation of dietary BMF studies performed under strictly controlled conditions on aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species, as well as the consideration of measured elimination half-lives, which have been demonstrated to be directly related to BMF values.

AB  - Identification of diatom frustules, a vital step during ecological analyses, is greatly influenced by the magnification at which samples are examined. The striking differences between Light Microscopy (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reveal inconsistencies in the identification of diatoms at low magnifications. These inconsistencies hinder comparative analyses between data sets collected by several research centers and may be hiding information of potential value in the assessment of ecosystem health. Additionally, SEM research has had a marked impact on diatom taxonomy rendering traditional identification Methods insufficient for recognition of newly created taxa, Many diagnostic features of small representatives of these newly erected taxa can not be recognized even at higher LM magnifications. The consequent lack of taxonomic resolution at the LM level may be leading to overestimation of geographical distributions, ranges of tolerance to environmental parameters, and optimal conditions for growth. Qualitative aspects of the differences between LM and SEM approaches are discussed in the present paper.

TI  - Assessing environmental conditions of major river basins in Africa as surrogates for watershed health
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - There is a growing recognition of the importance of transboundary shared natural resources. However, with limited resources, international policymakers need to be able to prioritize regions before allocating resources and addressing transboundary problems. River basins are perhaps the most natural transboundary division and, as such, provide an ecological framework for environmental assessments. The health of watersheds that are divided by political boundaries are at particular risk due to differential land management practices within each watershed. In Africa, more than any other continent, over 60% of the geographical area is a transboundary water-shed. In this article, a comparative study of the five major basins in Africa-the Congo, Chad, Nile, Niger, and Zambezi-has been carried out using consistent geospatial data sets at l-km resolution. Population, land cover type, and protected areas were used to assess the current status, characteristic differences, and impending pressure on river basin resources for each watershed. In addition, a focused study within the Nile River basin is used to compare the particular differences between countries.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the influence of low level contamination by copper, lead and zinc on the functioning of estuarine sandflat ecosystems by comparing the strength and variability of relationships between benthic macrofauna and fluxes (oxygen and nutrients) at three clean and three mildly contaminated sites. Specifically, as indicators of ecosystem functioning, we examined relationships between bivalve biomass, total benthic respiration and ammonium release, and ammonium uptake and benthic primary production. Furthermore, a small amount of organic matter was added to experimental plots at all sites (35 g/0.2 m(2)) to evaluate stress-on-stress responses relative to controls. Relationships were strongest at the clean sites (steepest slopes, highest r(2) values, lowest p-values) and weakest at the mildly contaminated sites and in organically enriched plots. Our results suggest that changes in ecosystem functioning may be occurring at mild (<ERL) levels of pollution that are unlikely to cause widespread mortality of macrofauna.

AB  - Ecologists have long recognized the influence that environmental conditions have on abundance and range extent of animal species. We used the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) as a model species for studying how microclimates serve as refuge against severe weather conditions. This species serves as an indicator or umbrella species for other sensitive ground-nesting, grassland obligate species. We conducted a mensurative field experiment in the rolling plains of Texas, USA, a semi-arid ecosystem on the southwestern periphery of bobwhite range, to determine whether native bunch grasses, apparently suitable for bobwhite nesting, could reduce ambient temperature below levels harmful for eggs. During the nesting season, we compared temperature and relative humidity readings at daily heat maxima (i.e., the 3 h during each day with highest temperatures) during the nesting season over the course of two years at 63 suitable nest sites paired with 63 random locations (n = 126) using two sensors at similar to 10 and similar to 60 cm above ground level. Mean temperature at nest height was 2.3% cooler at nest sites (35.99 degrees C +/- 0.07 SE) compared to random locations (36.81 degrees C +/- 0.07 SE); at ambient height, nest sites were slightly cooler (32.78 degrees C +/- 0.06 SE) than random location (32.99 degrees C +/- 0.06 SE). Mean relative humidity at nest sites was greater at nest height (34.53% +/- 0.112 SE) and ambient height (36.22% +/- 0.10 SE) compared to random locations at nest (33.35% +/- 0.12 SE) and ambient height (35.75% +/- 0.10 SE). Based on these results, cover at sites that appear visually suitable for nesting by bobwhites and other ground nesting birds provided adequate thermal refuge in the rolling plains by maintaining cooler, moister microclimates than surrounding non-nesting locations. Post-hoc analyses of data revealed that habitat conditions surrounding suitable nest sites strongly influenced thermal suitability of the substrate. Given that eggs of bobwhites and probably other species would experience lethal temperatures without these thermal refuges in the context of proper habitat condition, nesting vegetation is a critical component of niche space for bobwhites and other ground nesting birds in semi-arid regions. Many contemporary land uses, however, degrade or destroy bunch grasses and grassland systems, and thus decrease landscape inhabitability. Conservationists working with obligate grassland species that require bunch grasses in semi-arid regions should develop land management strategies that maximize the availability of these thermal refuges across space and time.

AB  - Brazilian Amazon is facing ongoing threat due to deforestation. Eastern Amazon (EA), however, is an old colonization front, where rural landscape is dominated by secondary vegetation (capoeira) and cattle ranching. The effects of land-use land-cover (LULC) at catchment, riparian and local scales upon stream insect assemblages (SIA) were analyzed from 17 catchments. Agriculture development, daily variation in temperature, dissolved oxygen and sodium concentrations explained variations of 33.7% in taxa composition and 58.5% in functional feeding groups. Partial Least Squares Regression revealed complex effects on SIA, pointing to interactions of LULC at all scales, but stronger at the riparian. Capoeira placed varied effects upon SIA, positive and negative and weaker than agriculture or forest cover. In order to warrant optimal conditions to the stream biota, indicating a sustained flow of ecosystem services, both forest fragments and capoeira patches should be adequately managed, especially along and closer to the aquatic habitat network.

AB  - The use of energy for cooking is one of the most important sectors for the energy consumption in India. Results of a life cycle inventory are presented for the use of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas as cooking fuels, The situation in India was investigated through life cycle inventories for the following stages of the life cycle: Extraction of crude oil and natural gas, processing in refineries and fractionating plants, distribution, product transports (including energy imports) and cooking, Environmental impacts are summarized with final calculated ecological profiles for cooking with the two fuels in different cooking scenarios, These results are analysed regarding the origin of the environmental impacts in the life cycle, A direct comparison shows in the majority of the investigated indicators an ecological advantage in the use of liquefied petroleum gas over kerosene, In addition, a reflection on the economic conditions and the social consequences of both life cycles is made.

AB  - Substance abuse is a significant public health concern both domestically and worldwide. The persistent use of substances regardless of aversive consequences forces the user to give higher priority to the drug than to normal activities and obligations. The harmful and hazardous use of psychoactive substances can lead to a dependence syndrome. In this regard, the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of reward-seeking behavior need to be fully understood in order to develop effective pharmacotherapies and other methods of treatment. Animal models are often implemented in preclinical screening for testing the efficacy of novel treatments. Several paradigms exist that model various facets of addiction including sensitization, tolerance, withdrawal, drug seeking, extinction, and relapse. Self-administration and, most notably, conditioned place preference (CPP) are relatively simple tests that serve as indicators of the aforementioned aspects of addiction by means of behavioral quantification. CPP is a commonly used technique to evaluate the motivational effects of compounds and experiences that have been associated with a positive or negative reward, which capitalizes on the basic principles of Pavlovian conditioning. During training, the unconditioned stimulus is consistently paired with a neutral set of environmental stimuli, which obtain, during conditioning, secondary motivational properties that elicit approach behavior in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. For over 50 years, rodents have been the primary test subjects. However, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is gaining favor as a valuable model organism in the fields of biology, genetics, and behavioral neuroscience. This paper presents a discussion on the merits, advantages, and limitations of the zebrafish model and its utility in relation to CPP.

AB  - With the current increasing interest in aquifer denitrification, recent attention has been given to cost-effective in-situ treatments such as Enhanced In-Situ Biological Denitrification (EISBD), which intends to stimulate the indigenous bacterial activity by injecting an external organic substrate and/or nutrients to the aquifer matrix. Within this context, laboratory batch assays have been conducted to develop a strategy for in-situ denitrification of a nitrate-contaminated aquifer in Argentona, Catalonia (Spain). The assays were run under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at a temperature of 17 degrees C to better simulate the conditions of the aquifer. Acetate and glucose were added to assess their potential to promote heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria activity. Overall, the results revealed that indigenous micro-organisms had the potential of reducing nitrate under appropriate conditions. Nitrate removal was complete and faster under anaerobic conditions, though high nitrate removals were also attained under initial aerobic conditions when a readily organic compound was amended at a sufficient dosage. The results also revealed that a significant amount of the available organic carbon was consumed by processes other than denitrification, namely aerobic oxidation and other microbial oxidation processes. To sum up, the results of this study demonstrated that addition of organic compounds into the groundwater is a promising method for in-situ bioremediation of nitrate in the Argentona aquifer. This approach could potentially be applied to a number of situations in which nitrate concentration is elevated and where indigenous micro-organisms with potential to reduce nitrate are present within the aquifer material.

T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY

KW  - mudrocks
AB  - Three published rock mass classification systems (RMR, SMR, RMS) were applied to weak Waikato Coal Measure mudrocks in order to assess their value as indicators of rock mass conditions and stable slope angles. The SMR classification gives the most sensitive measure of rock mass conditions for the slopes studied, but none of the systems adequately predicts observed slope angles. Regression analysis indicates that where conditions for failure by sliding along discontinuities exist the slopes are most sensitive to the discontinuity parameters of parallelism, dip angle and spacing. Further, when the discontinuities are oriented favourably with respect to the slope, slope angles are most sensitive to intact rock strength and groundwater. This is supported by geomorphic evidence. Low angle natural slopes developed on unfavourable discontinuity sets are well predicted by published equations associated with both the RMR and RMS classification systems. Steeper slopes developed on favourable discontinuities are at a much lower angle than the equations predict and show evidence of extensive creep. Application of the present rock mass classification systems to these weak rocks is thus only appropriate when conditions exist under which the rocks fail by sliding on unfavourably oriented discontinuities. Where this does not occur, the contribution of intact strength to the rock mass strength is greatly overestimated by all of the ruck mass classification systems studied. Development of a separate rock mass classification for these conditions is not seen as appropriate. Hence, recognition of the favourability or otherwise of the discontinuity sets is crucial to dealing with these rocks. A stereonet overlay that facilitates this division is presented.

AB  - Floodplain wetlands in their optimum habitat condition act as the preventive mechanism from environmental degradation like pollution, lowering of groundwater table, flood, temperature control and others. Therefore, the protection and stability condition assessment of these wetlands are very much indispensable for the sake of the environment. In the present work, the habitat stability assessment of the wetlands of a floodplain region produced by River Ganga has been done considering the hydro-geomorphological (HGM) and surface water availability (SWA) parameters. The fuzzy classification (FC) and composite indexing (CI) method have been applied to perform the analysis. The result suggests that 16%-24% of wetland area is very highly prone to loss and 33%-36% area needs proper management whereas only 9%-11% wetlands are very highly stable. The wetlands have shown a rise in the average seasonal water level fluctuation from 2.18 m in 2014 to 3.38 m in 2018 which indicates more drying out condition during lean months. From morphogenetic perspective, nearly 43% of wetlands are riverine and in terms of HGM classification 77% of the wetlands are groundwater depressions (GWD). So, lack of water supply all throughout the year, seasonal water level fluctuation and absence of active river-wetland links are mainly responsible for the degradation of habitat stability condition of the wetlands. The results have been validated over different ground locations using kappa index and ROC curve method. It suggests that both these methods are very much accurate and between these two, FC method has given better result.

AB  - Fruit splitting or cracking is a major physiological disorder in fruit trees markedly influenced by environmental conditions, but conclusive data still are required to provide a definite explanation and preventive measures. Changes in climatic conditions critically influence fruit splitting incidence. We studied plant-soil-ambient water relations in splitting-prone citrus grown under 4 contrasting environmental conditions (climate type and soil), in Spain and Uruguay, over a six years period. Automatic trunk and fruit diameter measurements (trunk and fruit growth rate and maximum daily trunk shrinkage), which are a tree water status indicator, together with factors modifying the tree and fruit water relationship (temperature, ET, rainfall, soil texture, soil moisture, rootstock and xylem anatomy) were studied and correlated with splitting.
   A close fruit splitting and soil texture relationship was found, inversely correlated with clay and silt percentages, and positively with those for sand. Under 85%-sand soil conditions, slight changes in soil moisture due to fluctuations in temperature, ET, or rainfall changed trunk and fruit growth rate patterns during few hours and induced splitting. Splitting incidence was higher in trees with larger xylem vessels in the fruit peduncle due to rootstock ('Carrizo' and 'C-35' citrange being higher than 'FA-5', 'Cleopatra' and Poncirus trifoliata). Finally, reducing the frequency of irrigation by half increased midday canopy temperatures (similar to 5 degrees C) and splitting (+15%). We conclude that irregularities in the tree water status, due to interactions among soil moisture, rootstock and climatic conditions, leads to a number of substantial changes in fruit growth rate increasing the incidence of fruit splitting.

AB  - Pyrite framboid diameter analysis and organic geochemistry of the triangularis/crepida boundary section at Kowala (Holy Cross Mountains. Poland) imply suboxic to oxic and sporadically euxinic bottom waters during the Lower Famennian. In addition, morphological web-like structures typical for microbial mats, as well as the recognition of 2 alpha-methylhopanes and monomethyl-alkane cyanobacteria biomarkers is evidenced of microbial activity after the global Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction event. The presence of cyanobacterial mats also suggests suboxic to oxic environments and at the same time photic bottom water conditions. However, isorenieratane and its derivatives were detected in almost all samples. The presence of this well-known biomarker of green sulfur bacteria implies that euxinic conditions were present in the upper part of the water column at least intermittently or that temporal euxinia occurred in the water column. Presence of euxinic conditions is confirmed by the occurrence of small-sized pyrite framboids which were particularly dominant in the lower part of the section. The shift towards low delta C-13 values in both micritic limestones and in sedimentary organic matter seen at the beginning of the period of diminished photic zone, might reflect an influx of newly respired CO2 to surface waters, caused by enhanced respiration at depth after the F/F transition in the Checiny-Zbrza basin.

AB  - Four Trifolium repens (white clover) cultivars were evaluated under field conditions to determine the potential of these cultivars to sucessfully develop Rhizobium-associated root nodules. Nodulation of T. repens is often poor, because of suboptimal environmental conditions or absence of host-specific rhizobia. The cultivars Huia, Haifa, Ladino and Regal were selected, as these are popular cultivars available in South Africa. Thousand seed mass (TSM) of each cultivar was measured to determine viability of seed and the possible interaction between TSM and nodulation. Mean TSM values of the cultivars differed significantly, with Huia having the highest TSM followed by Haifa, Ladino and Regal. Biomass production was also measured as an indicator of nitrogen fixation efficiency. The cultivar Huia, with the highest TSM values, resulted in the highest biomass production. Nodulation indices were determined from the size, number and colour of the nodules. All plants, regardless of cultivar, formed nodules within 8 weeks. It was concluded that TSM had no effect on nodulation. Planting date with associated temperature effects and the intrinsic cultivar effect also had no influence on nodulation. It was therefore concluded that nodulation potential of the four cultivars tested was similar under environmental conditions that prevailed during the study.

AB  - In today's economy, it is necessary to explore the environmental impact of mining. Coal mining greatly affects all environmental parameters of the environment: home, production, hydrodynamics. The environmental situation in the area of the mining company can be changed if environmental contamination is monitored and environmental protection plans and measures are developed. The purpose of this work is the analysis of systems and models of these processes in the ecosystem. The main systemic hypothesis of the research is that the variety of criteria and methods of risk assessment is a necessary condition of order in the system. The main results of the work are the following: 1) a systematic analysis of the problems of environmental security, geodynamics of the mining areas, aspects of the balance of the sustainable process and the cause of the increase in danger was carried out; 2) Proposed approaches (models) for the assessment of evolutionary ecological potential and health risks, as well as adaptive situational modeling of the ecosystem. It is important to note, the study results do not suggest complex environmental monitoring studies.

AB  - The tools available for rapid and accurate evaluations of the condition of ecosystems in and environments have undergone major developments, much of this due to recent research in the southwestern U.S. Ecosystem health is now largely viewed as a function of the ability to retain soil and water resources; and indicators for monitoring have become increasingly quantitative and reflective of the ability to retain these resources. Quantitative data on rangeland health indicators have also been useful to identify state-transition thresholds which are essential for effective ecosystem management. In more recent studies, we have been investigating the potential for using quantitative bioindicators of plant function to predict the potential long-term effects of catastrophic stressors. The case-study here is of coastal mangroves (Avicennia marina) smeared with oil from a marine oil-spill. Early understanding of the potential long-term effects should allow more informed decision-making on how best to preserve or remediate affected systems. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

KW  - DEEP
AB  - Although nature often has been treated as an unproblematic reality, I argue far treating it as a contested concept, suggesting that ''nature'' is a cultural construction. Drawing on interactionist and ecological theory, I claim that the creation of social problems involving the environment is inevitably grounded in cultural choices. Through a set of ideological structures (a protectionist vision, an organic vision, and a humanistic vision), social actors develop templates for understanding the proper relationship between humans and nature. Based on an ethnography of mushroom collecting, I contend that these models lead us to experience nature through cultural eyes - wishing to be away from civilization, to be at one with nature, and to engage in the pragmatic use of nature for personal ends. Conflicting stances toward nature account for debate over the moral acceptability of the commercial collection of mushrooms and the ''problem'' of overpick. Templates of human-environmental interaction, leading to models for experiencing the wild provide the basis for understanding the conditions under which environmental change is defined as a social problem.

AB  - Applications for silver nanomaterials in consumer products are rapidly expanding, creating an urgent need for toxicological examination of the exposure potential and ecological effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The integration of genomic techniques into environmental toxicology has presented new avenues to develop exposure biomarkers and investigate the mode of toxicity of novel chemicals. In the present study we used a 15k oligonucleotide microarray for Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean and common indicator species for toxicity, to differentiate between particle specific and ionic silver toxicity and to develop exposure biomarkers for citrate-coated and PVP-coated AgNPs. Gene expression profiles revealed that AgNO3 and AgNPs have distinct expression profiles suggesting different modes of toxicity. Major biological processes disrupted by the AgNPs include protein metabolism and signal transduction. In contrast, AgNO3 caused a downregulation of developmental processes, particularly in sensory development. Metal responsive and DNA damage repair genes were induced by the PVP AgNPs, but not the other treatments. In addition, two specific biomarkers were developed for the environmental detection of PVP AgNPs; although further verification under different environmental conditions is needed.

AB  - Missing covariate values in linear regression models can be an important problem facing environmental researchers. Existing missing value treatment methods such as Multiple Imputation (MI), the EM algorithm and Data Augmentation (DA) have the assumption that both observed and unobserved data come from the same distribution, most commonly a multivariate normal or a conditionally multivariate normal family. These methods do try to incorporate the missing data mechanism and rely on the assumption of Missing At Random (MAR). We present a DA method which does not rely on the MAR assumption and can model missing data mechanisms and covariate structure. This method utilizes the Gibbs Sampler as a tool for incorporating these structures and mechanisms. We apply this method to an ecological data set that relates fish condition to environmental variables. Notice that the presented DA method detects relationships that are not detected when other missing data methods are employed.

AB  - To address the increase in the amount of Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment in Europe (WEEE), in 2003 the European Commission issued its WEEE Directive, introducing an extended producer responsibility (EPR). While there is arguably a relationship between modes of e-waste governance and the successful handling of e-waste, the empirical evidence explaining the performance of different modes of e-waste governance is limited. We address this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for analysing and evaluating e-waste governance, inspired by literature on WEEE, reverse logistics and environmental governance. This framework distinguishes between four success conditions that are seen as indicators for the performance of e-waste governance: inclusion of all stakeholders, overall strategic collaboration, an adequate rule system and knowledge sharing/performance management. In addition, the framework distinguishes between different modes of e-waste governance which are assumed to influence the extent to which the success conditions are met. We applied the framework to the case of Dutch e-waste governance to test its usefulness and derive initial lessons and good practices from it. Our findings show that the Dutch e-waste governance arrangement is performing relatively well in terms of meeting the success conditions. We identified some concrete local (pilot) approaches that added an interactive twist to the Dutch e-waste system, which appears to be conducive to the fulfilment of success conditions. These findings suggest that a combination of 'hard' public-private and 'soft' interactive modes of governance combining the strong points of formal rules and voluntary action taking is desirable.

AB  - This work has identified micromorphological properties common to colluvial deposits formed by different processes and environmental conditions, aiming at obtaining information that help the recognition of humid environment indicator micro-features. For this purpose, a stratigraphic section at Araripe sedimentary plateau was compared to the micromorphological elements of 4Cb level within HS1 section of the Palmas/Agua Doce surface, southern Brazil, generated under the shift from dry to humid paleoclimatic conditions. The applied methods comprise: i) description based on lithostratigraphical and pedostratigraphical criteria of colluvial ramp proximal facies CSM-C and section HS1 respectively; ii) sedimentological characterization; iii) - micromorphological description and analysis of materials. Level 4Cb was used as a reference due to its colluvial origin as well as for infilling a second order paleo-channel. By comparing 4Cb unit, generated in transitional environmental conditions from a drier to a wetter climate, to CSM-C section one may conclude that: I) water was present in both colluvial units, both during and after the depositional event. This demonstrates that both have important paleoenvironmental significance,especially for the south of Ceare State, which is inserted in the semi-arid context. II) the common micromorphological evidences of depletion and migration of iron oxyhydroxides point to similar colluvium forming paeloenvironmental conditions, both being generated within a transition from drier to wetter conditions. III) the accumulation of hydromorphic micro-features coupled and the migration of iron oxyhydroxides coupled with the opening of pore spaces testify to the presence of water within the system.

AB  - In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to C dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic matter (OM) in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose + arabinose)/(galactose + rhamnose + mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.

AB  - Complex and nonlinear ecological networks can exhibit a tipping point at which a transition to a global extinction state occurs. Using real-world mutualistic networks of pollinators and plants as prototypical systems and taking into account biological constraints, we develop an ecologically feasible strategy to manage/control the tipping point by maintaining the abundance of a particular pollinator species at a constant level, which essentially removes the hysteresis associated with a tipping point. If conditions are changing so as to approach a tipping point, the management strategy we describe can prevent sudden drastic changes. Additionally, if the system has already moved past a tipping point, we show that a full recovery can occur for reasonable parameter changes only if there is active management of abundance, again due essentially to removal of the hysteresis. This recovery point in the aftermath of a tipping point can be predicted by a universal, two-dimensional reduced model.

AB  - This report uses the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to assess the influence of constructing a check dam on river environment. HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS programs were used to generate hydraulic parameters such as flow discharge, water depth, velocity, water surface width and sediment discharge. Indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) and indicator of habitat alteration (IHabA) were used to evaluate the flow and habitat conditions before and after check dam construction. The range of variability approach was used to calculate the degree of hydrologic alteration for each IHA, degree of habitat alteration and overall alteration for IHabA. Variability of river habitats before and after check dam construction was contrasted. Alteration became larger the closer to the dam body. An assessment method for check dam construction is offered which does not require ecological investigation data and combines ecology concepts and hydraulics.

AB  - With the development of the Internet, the application of multimedia in College English teaching is becoming more and more demanding, especially in the area of accurate information recommendation. In order to improve the accuracy of push information in College English multimedia teaching broadcasting, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. By designing a massless particle to simulate the foraging behavior of birds, the algorithm searches for precise targets to obtain the optimal solution. Combining with Internet technology, the weight of data transmitted by multimedia broadcasting signal is calculated by setting an independent address, and then the interactive data flow between teachers and students is analyzed to optimize the design of multimedia broadcasting terminal. The results show that the indicators with higher scores are mainly distributed in the construction of network teaching platform. The three indicators with the highest scores are convenience, module integrity and management and maintenance, which are 2.825, 2.715 and 2.696, respectively. Through this study, it brings new inspiration to the intellectualization of College English teaching. Multimedia broadcasting design can solve the problem of interference in terminal broadcasting transmission by setting independent addresses.

AB  - Diplopods are components of the edaphic fauna, which makes them suitable bioindicators of soil quality. Some characteristics of the fat body of diplopods make it suitable for ecotoxicological studies. This organ, composed of diffuse tissue, fills the body cavity; it presents intense metabolic activity associated with lipid, glycogen, protein, and uric acid storage, being also responsible for storage, neutralization, and excretion of substances that are not useful to the organism. The present study aimed to investigate whether the perivisceral fat body of Rhinocricus padbergi can be used as a target organ in ecotoxicological studies and to identify possible histological and histochemical biomarkers in this organ. Upon examining the perivisceral fat body of individuals of R. padbergi exposed to different concentrations of industrial soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sigma 2,749.0 mg/kg) and metals (Sigma 40,355.8 mg/kg), we have found evidence that this organ is sensitive to environmental pollutants present in the soil. The loss of integrity of the cell boundary associated with cytoplasmatic disorganization and depletion in total proteins, neutral polysaccharides, calcium, and lipids can be considered stress biomarkers for R. padbergi.

AB  - Diversity of physical habitat and its relationship with benthic macroinvertebrates in urban reservoirs in Minas Gerais. We assessed the effects of physical habitat structure on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in 3 reservoirs: Serra Azul (SA), Vargem das Flores (VF) and Ibirite (IB). We sampled physical and chemical habitat and benthic macroinvertebrates at 30 systematic sites in each reservoir. In SA, the dominant taxa out of 12 were Melanoides tuberculatus Muller, 1774 (15.2%) and Chaoboridae (63.8%). In VF, the dominant taxa, out of 11 were M. tuberculatus (34.2%) and Oligochaeta (33.6%). In IB, M. tuberculatus (91.2%) and Chaoboridae (6.27%) dominated and we collected only 7 taxa. In SA, benthos were significantly influenced by the deciduous shrub understory and bank angle. In IB and VF, the significant physical habitat variables were: land cover, human influence, and aquatic macrophytes. We conclude that human disturbances reduced terrestrial vegetation cover and riparian and littoral physical habitat structural complexity, leading to worse water quality. Those changes, in turn, reduced the taxonomic richness of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

AB  - Habitat boundaries in general and forest edges in particular belong to the central issues in ecology. Theories about community and environmental edge-responses are diverse, but there is a lack of sufficient supporting field evidence: no consensus exists about distinctness and diversity of edges, and the existence of edge-related species. Moreover, as most studies focus on man-made edges, natural forest edges are less understood. We studied xeric forest edges in a wooded-steppe area. Twelve forest patches were selected, and plots were set up within the edges, the forest interiors and the grasslands. Species composition, species richness and Shannon diversity were compared between the three habitat types as well as between differently oriented edges. We identified diagnostic species for all habitats. Local habitat preferences of the edge-related species were compared to their regional preferences. Environmental factors of the different habitats were assessed by using ecological indicator values. Forest edges differed both from forest interiors and grasslands, forming a narrow but distinct habitat type between them. Species composition of the edges was not simply a mixture of forest and grassland species, but there were several edge-related species, most of which are regionally regarded as typical of closed steppe grasslands. Neither shady conditions of the forests, nor dry conditions of the grasslands are tolerated by these species; this is why they are confined to edges. Species richness and Shannon-diversity were higher within edges than in either of the habitat interiors. Ecological indicator values suggested that light intensity and temperature were higher in the edges than in the forests, but were lower than in the grasslands. In contrast, soil moisture was lower in the edges than in the forests but was higher than in the grasslands. There were slight differences between differently exposed edges concerning species composition, species richness and Shannon diversity. We conclude that edges should be considered an integral part of wooded-steppes. Their high diversity may have nature conservation implications. Our study emphasizes that edge species may be confined to edges only locally, but may have a broader distributional range in other areas. These species may be referred to as local edge species. Our results also point out that the very same edge can be interactive and non-interactive at the same time, depending on the characteristics considered.

T2  - SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
KW  - VENTILATION
AB  - Trains are an important means of transportation for people to travel. The train's soft sleeper compartment space is relatively small, and the density of people is relatively large. Therefore, improving the thermal comfort and air quality of the compartment is of great significance for ensuring a healthy travel environment. To analyze the appropriate mode of conditioned air supply in train soft sleeper compartments, the airflow distribution inside soft sleeper compartments is simulated numerically at four different air supply modes, namely, sidewall air supply with slot diffusers, perforated ceiling air supply, bedside task-ambient air conditioning, and displacement ventilation. The reliability of the numerical simulation models is verified with the experimental data in the literature. Comparative analysis is made in terms of the compartment temperature, velocity, predicted mean vote and predicted percentage dissatisfied (PMV-PPD), and ventilation efficiency among various modes of air supply. The four air supply schemes are evaluated comprehensively by stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA-2). As the computational results show, bedside task-ambient air conditioning is the best air supply mode in terms of comprehensive performance indicators, followed by the sidewall slot air supply. The perforated ceiling air supply ranks third, and is superior to displacement ventilation.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out to determine the causes producing the Ostertagia ostertagi hypobiosis phenomenon in cattle. In the first experiment, the effect of time on third-stage larvae in the environment was studied during a 2-year period. Three experimental paddocks contaminated with O. ostertagi eggs at different times of the year were used, and the levels of hypobiosis were recorded by using 'indicator' and 'tracer' calves. The results suggest that time as such is not a hypobiosis-inductive factor. The second experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions, where the effects of temperature and light on infective larvae were studied. Infective larvae were subjected to different conditions of temperature and light during 6 weeks, and then inoculated to parasite-naive calves, which were slaughtered after 4 weeks. Percentages of hypobiotic larvae in these calves varied from 3.5 to 94.8%, depending on the different storage conditions the larvae underwent before inoculation. Results suggest that increasing temperature and increasing time of light exposure simulating spring conditions would be the factors which act upon third-stage larvae inducing them to a later hypobiotic stage in the host.

AB  - Although extensive studies have been performed on nitrogen isotopes in lake sediments, understanding the complexity of the delta N-15 variation related to past environmental and climatic conditions still remains unclear. Supported by multi-proxy records including litho-units, organic carbon isotopes, ration of total organic carbon and total nitrogen, organic matter content, bulk dry density, the accumulation rate of organic matter, median grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and Rb/Sr and Ca/Mg ratios obtained from a sedimentary sequence in a small lake (i.e., Dahu Swamp) in the eastern Nanling Mountains in South China, we deduce that variation in the delta N-15 values results primarily from the sources of organic matter, which are significantly influenced by climatic conditions over the past similar to 16 000 years. A low (or high) lake level resulting from dry (or wet) conditions would lead to more (or fewer) vascular plant remains in the sediments and stronger (or weaker) denitrification associated with hypolimnetic anoxia, resulting in lower (or higher) delta N-15 values. In addition, dry (or wet) conditions would favor weakened (or strengthened) biogeochemical activity in the catchment, which could result in less (or more) external input of N-15-enriched OM, thus leading to decreased (or increased) delta N-15 values. Our results indicate that the lake sediment delta N-15 record in the Nanling Mountains has the potential to provide valuable insight into past East Asian monsoon climatedriven environmental changes.

AB  - Sand mining is a human activity that is increasing in inland waters and has profound effects on entire aquatic ecosystems. However, current knowledge of the effects of sand mining on freshwater lake ecosystems remains limited, especially for biotic communities. Here, we investigated the responses of macroinvertebrates indiscriminate sand mining in a large shallow lake of China. Our results indicated that sand mining significantly increased the content of suspended particulate matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a in the water column both in the sand mining area and the area adjacent to the dredging activities. While there was significantly lower total nitrogen and the total phosphorus content of the sediment were observed in the sand mining area. In terms of benthic animals, there were reductions of the macroinvertebrate density and biomass of 39.80% and 99.54%, respectively, and there was a considerable decline of the majority of macroinvertebrate taxonomic taxa as well as biological traits observed in the sand mining area due to direct dredging -induced substrate deterioration and high turbidity water. Moreover, in the area adjacent to the dredging activities, dredging-induced high turbidity water also resulted in 28% and 79 decreases in macroinvertebrate density and biomass, respectively, with a significant decrease in the densities of Bivalvia and Polychaeta but an increase in the density of Crustacea. In terms of biological traits, species (e.g., Grundidierella sp. and Sphaenum lac:Lisa-0 characterized by a small body size, short life cycle and dietary sources mainly from sediment were typically associated with the ecological condition of the indirect effects of the dredging activities. Taxa (e.g., Corbicula flurninea) with a larger body size and longer life cycle that are filter feeders should be favored by the ecological conditions of the reference sites. for biomonitoring of sand mining perturbations, a number of taxonomic and biological trait indicators were proposed in our study based on indicator value analysis, and the general applicability of trait-based indicators was highlighted. We also suggest that the biodiversity indices may be less suitable indicators of sand mining effects.

AB  - PurposeImproving the environmental performances of viticulture practices is particularly complicated during unfavorable climatic conditions because of the need for fungal and other pest pressure and the variability of phytosanitary control methods available for winegrowers. However, winegrowers wish to improve the environmental performances of their practices regardless of climatic conditions. The objective of the study was to quantify the variability in environmental impacts due to climatic variations, and changes in viticulture practices induced by climatic variability.MethodsLife cycle assessment was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of viticulture technical management routes (TMR) implemented on five plots in the Loire Valley for the Chenin Blanc grape variety. These TMRs are representative of the range of practices used in the region, including intensive conventional practices to moderate organic practices. The study covered two different years of production (2011 and 2013) under contrasting climatic conditions. The first year (2011) was hot and dry, which are favorable conditions for viticulture, while the second year (2013) was cold and humid, which are unfavorable conditions.Results and discussionDuring the unfavorable year, the number of phytosanitary treatments and soil maintenance interventions increased for most of the studied TMRs. This meant that the inter-annual variability in environmental impact was significant, depending on the type of TMR, with differences in impacts ranging from 19% to more than 40% between 2011 and 2013. Managing environmental impacts was found to be more difficult for the organic systems when climatic conditions are unfavorable (in 2013). The non-organic TMRs showed less variation in environmental impacts than the organic TMRs between the 2years studied.ConclusionsThis study shows the importance of taking into account inter-annual variability in environmental assessments of viticulture systems. Indeed, winegrowers do not respond the same way to climate variability mainly with regard to plant protection and soil maintenance. Viticulture is very sensitive to inter-annual climate variations due to the parasitic pressure variability. The different production systems do not give to winegrowers the same possibilities for adapting practices to limit their impact on the environment.

AB  - The vegetation of the high-Andean cushion-plant peatlands is mainly characterized by the cushion-forming Juncaceae of the genus Oxychloe, Distichia and Patosia, as well as Cyperaceae of the genus Zameioscirpus. This particularity of Southern Hemisphere cushion peatlands is unique and exclusive to the high-Andean regions of South America. The floristic composition and site factors of 340 peatlands were studied between 1995-2013 to investigate changes in the vegetation of the high Andean peatlands from its southernmost distribution in Argentina (39 degrees S, province of Neuquen) to the limit with Bolivia (22 degrees S, province of Jujuy). Site factors were characterized based on water samples. Data for precipitation and temperature conditions was obtained from the WorldClim 2.0 dataset. Cushion-plant species and their accompanying flora clearly reflect the changing ecological conditions along the marked climatic gradient from south to north. A group of species is limited to the southern region of the study area (provinces of Neuquen and Mendoza), and another group is limited almost exclusively to the northern region (provinces of San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Salta and Jujuy). Some Oxychloe species are distributed only in the transition zone between the winter and predominantly summer rainfall zone, however, many accompanying species show wide ecological amplitudes. The quality in the supply of minerals does not seem to play a decisive role in the differentiation of vegetation, except for the concentration of salts. Climatic conditions seem to be more relevant to the presence of the species. Our research shows that the survival of the plants is closely linked to the rainfall regime and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Similarly, the survival of plants and the potential formation of flowers and mature seeds depends on the presence of pollinators and species that disperse seeds (e.g. birds and camelids). Mobility by dispersion is also necessary for plant survival in the high Andean regions, which have experienced repeated climatic changes over the past centuries and millennia. This brought about the permanent displacement of the zoning of vegetation, and with it, the displacement of zones favorable for cushion-plant growth. The phylogenetic relationships and the spatial distribution suggest that the cushion-forming Juncaceae, depending on the evolution of climate, geomorphological processes and local site conditions, progressed step by step from the south to the north. Their current distribution is therefore largely understood as a result of short-term and long-term climatic changes.

AB  - The Middle Devonian age Marcellus Shale contains one of the largest shale gas plays in North America. Hydrocarbon production in the eastern part of the play is mostly "dry gas," consisting of essentially pure methane. Production of natural gas liquids (condensate) increases toward the west, which is the area currently, being targeted by developers. Two Marcellus Shale cores from West Virginia were analyzed to compare the isotopic and geochemical characteristics of a liquids-prone well (WV-7) in Wetzel County with a gas-prone well (WV-6) in Monongalia County. The contrasts between the cores indicate that the conditions of the Marcellus Shale deposition were different between the two sites. The dominant organic matter preserved in each core is isotopically different; delta C-13(org) values are lighter on average in WV-6 compared with WV-7. A possible explanation is that a larger fraction of terrestrial organic matter was preserved in the WV-6 core, whereas WV-7 may contain a greater percentage of marine organic matter. Clastic-influx proxies (e.g. Ti/Al, Ca/Al and Mg/Al) also suggest that the WV-6 core site received a higher siliciclastic input compared to WV-7, consistent with a more proximal location to dry land and the delivery of greater amounts of terrestrial organic matter. Depleted delta C-13(carb) values, low concentrations of redox sensitive elements (e.g. V, Cr, Ni and U), and high variability delta N-15 values in the WV-6 core all suggest the presence of higher dissolved oxygen concentration and short term shifts in an oxic/anoxic boundary near the sediment-water interface during deposition. These lines of evidence indicate that the depositional conditions were favorable for the accumulation of predominantly gas-prone Type III kerogen in the Marcellus Shale at the WV-6 site. In contrast, the Marcellus Shale at the WV-7 site was deposited in a more distal area that received a low terrestrial sediment supply, organic matter primarily derived from marine algae, and bottom water conditions that were dominantly anoxic. Such conditions were favorable for the accumulation of Type II kerogen that has a greater capacity to generate liquid hydrocarbons. Differences between the liquids-prone and gas-prone parts of the Marcellus Shale play have been largely ascribed to depth-of-burial and thermal maturation history; this study indicates that depositional environment and sedimentary facies may have played significant roles as well.

AB  - Evidence for photic zone euxinia (PZE) in ancient oceans is widespread and commonly associated with global climate change and biotic events. However, evidence of PZE in marginal settings is commonly extrapolated to infer basin-scale characteristics. To explore the relationship between euxinia in marginal settings and the wider basin in one Palaeozoic context, we have conducted a detailed spatial and temporal examination the palaeowater-column redox state from the Polish sector of the Southern Permian Basin (SPB) during deposition of the Zechstein (Lopingian) second carbonate (Main Dolomite) cycle. Sediments from toe-of-slope, slope and hypersaline lagoonal settings of the northeastern margin of the SPB contain abundant chlorobactane, isorenieratane and their likely degradation products (C-15 to C-31 2,3,6-aryl isoprenoids). These indicate that part of the photic zone was euxinic during significant intervals of the Main Dolomite deposition. Further evidence for strongly anoxic conditions includes the occurrence of C-28-bisnorhopane, high concentrations of pentakishomohopanes (i.e. high homohopane indices), and the occurrence of framboidal and native sulphur crystals in slope facies. However, a lack of these signatures in basinal settings indicates that strongly reducing conditions were restricted to the slope, and toe-of-slope locations. Even in these settings, however, highly variable homohopane indices and concentrations of isorenieratene and chlorobactene derivatives, as well as the presence of benthic fauna and bioturbation, indicate that anoxia fluctuated throughout deposition of the Main Dolomite, likely on a variety of timescales. Sterane distributions are also variable, suggesting a dynamic ecosystem, likely exhibiting a strong response to environmental forcing. Overall, it appears that high but episodic primary bioproductivity of organic matter was concentrated on the northeastern slope and restricted lagoons leading to the formation of source rocks for petroleum; however, the temporal and geographical restriction of anoxia appears to have prevented the accumulation of large or more widespread quantities of organic matter, and in fact TOC contents exhibit poor correlation with ecological and anoxia indicators. This model indicates that strong evidence for PZE in shelf and slope fades need not be associated with widespread, basin-scale anoxia, with implications for organic matter burial, carbon cycling and biotic crises.

AB  - Marine benthic communities function within the constraints of changing environmental conditions. To better understand the dynamics of this relationship, increased knowledge of physiological mechanisms that link environmental conditions to ecological responses is imperative. Here we develop a synthesis demonstrating the potential to link biochemical/physiological and population/community level responses based on the effects of increased sedimentation, hypoxia, food availability, and habitat characteristics on bivalve physiology using two soft-sediment, suspension-feeding species, Austrovenus stutchburyi and Paphies australis. Nucleic acid ratios (RNA:DNA, RNA:protein or total RNA content) have been successfully used as indirect measures of short-term growth in a range of marine organisms. Bivalve nucleic acid ratios were analysed over several temporal and spatial scales in a combination of laboratory experiments, field experiments, transplants and surveys, and only by synthesising results from several different studies were clear patterns in bivalve RNA dynamics revealed. The magnitude of response in RNA content (RNA) varied seasonally, along environmental gradients, and with bivalve species and size class. The major factor affecting RNA was enhanced food availability, which appeared to have the potential to mask any negative effects of stressors. Over the short-term (10-14 days), elevated suspended sediment concentrations or single deposition of terrigenous clay did not affect RNA, but over the longer term (months), transplantation of bivalves to turbid sites and repeated deposition of clay had a slight negative effect on RNA. In the laboratory, hypoxia did not affect the fast increase in RNA in response to added food or the slow decrease in RNA in response to starvation. In addition, a species-specific baseline RNA content was indicated, possibly representing the basal metabolism of a species. Thus, RNA was more sensitive to factors facilitating growth than to factors inhibiting growth, indicating that RNA could be a good indicator of factors related to energy acquisition, while not being as sensitive to stressors. By assessing the variability in response across time and space scales, and considering the context and time scale of both the stressor and the response, organism-level measures may be used as part of an integrated approach in impact assessment and ecological experiments.

AB  - Rapid environmental changes in the Arctic Ocean affect plankton productivity and the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that supports microbial food webs. We report concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and yields of amino acids (indicators of labile DOM) in surface waters across major Arctic margins. Concentrations of DOC and bioavailability of DOM showed large pan-Arctic variability that corresponded to varying hydrological conditions and ecosystem productivity, respectively. Widespread hot spots of labile DOM were observed over productive inflow shelves (Chukchi and Barents Seas), in contrast to oligotrophic interior margins (Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, and Beaufort Seas). Amino acid yields in outflow gateways (Canadian Archipelago and Baffin Bay) indicated the prevalence of semilabile DOM in sea ice covered regions and sporadic production of labile DOM in ice-free waters. Comparing these observations with surface circulation patterns indicated varying shelf subsidies of bioavailable DOM to Arctic deep basins.

AB  - Application of ecosystem services measurement and analysis to natural resource planning, investment, and management decisions has gained momentum over the past decade. This momentum springs from a confluence of practical conservation challenges and conceptual developments. In particular, the ecosystem services focus emphasizes an appreciation of the social and economic values of natural resources and ecological systems. Despite a growing interest in ecosystem services and their incorporation into public-sector decisions and transactions, a number of institutional challenges complicate these efforts. These challenges include dispersed agency authorities and jurisdictional fragmentation that may constrain the geographic scale of public-sector transactions or cross-jurisdictional planning and actions. Challenges also include limitations on agency capacities to adjust decisions in the face of changing resource conditions and new information. Nonetheless, many agencies have flexibility to incorporate ecosystem services assessments into their planning, use them to inform spending choices, and develop markets based on ecosystem services concepts. Challenges are, thus, more instrumental and practical rather than legal and structural. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines the links between biometeorological variables and the behavior of beach recreationists along with their rating of overall weather conditions. To identify and describe significance of on-site atmospheric conditions, two separate forms of response are examined. The first is sensory perception of the immediate atmospheric surround expressed verbally, which was the subject of earlier work. In the research reported here, on-site observations of behavior that reflect the effects of weather and climate are examined. By employing, independently, separate indicators of on-site experience, the reliability of each is examined and interpreted and apparent threshold conditions verified. The study site is King's Beach located on the coast of Queensland, Australia. On-site observations of atmospheric variables and beach user behavior are made for the daylight hours of 45 days spread over a 12-month period. The results show that behavioral data provide reliable and meaningful indications of the significance of the atmospheric environment for leisure. Atmospheric conditions within the zone of acceptability are those that the beach users can readily cope with or modify by a range of minor behavioral adjustments. Optimal weather conditions appear to be those requiring no specific behavioral adjustment. Attendance levels reflect only the outer limits of acceptability of the meteorological environment, while duration of visit enables calibration of levels of approval in so far as it reflects rating of on-site weather within a broad zone of tolerance. In a broad theoretical sense, the results add to an understanding of the relationship between weather and human behavior. This information is potentially useful in effective tourism management and planning.

AB  - Inefficient delivery and inadequate coverage of water supply and sanitation services are major concerns for public health in the urban regions of developing countries. The contamination of the treated water within distribution system leads to frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases. This demands a proactive approach that is based on risk assessment and a management methodology to ensure water safety. In this context, the paper presents a model study undertaken for the water supply network of a pilot area in Hyderabad city, India. The risk assessment methodology uses geospatial databases of the water supply network, sewer network, open drains, groundwater table, pressure in pipes, and soil data with a number of system-specific attributes. Fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approach with qualitative and quantitative domain knowledge is employed in pipe condition assessment model. The physical parameters viz, pipe age, material, diameter; operational parameters viz. intermittency, number of breaks and bursts, and leakage in the system; and environmental parameters viz, workmanship, bedding condition, and traffic determine the vulnerability of pipes to contaminant intrusion. The zones of contamination formed in the soil near open drains and sewer crossings (i.e., hazards) are delineated using a contaminant ingress model. The risk of contaminant intrusion is assessed as a function of vulnerability and hazard. The results indicate that roughly 3% of pipes in the network are in Bad condition and require rehabilitation on a priority basis; about 46% of pipes are in Medium condition. The study describes a techno-economically feasible approach to assist water managers and policy makers in delivering safe drinking water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to evaluate the impact of water deficit in field conditions, researchers or breeders must set up large experiment networks in very restrictive field environments. Experience shows that half of the field trials are not relevant because of climatic conditions that do not allow the stress scenario to be tested. The PhenoFieldR (R) platform is the first field based infrastructure in the European Union to ensure protection against rainfall for a large number of plots, coupled with the non-invasive acquisition of crops' phenotype. In this paper, we will highlight the PhenoFieldR (R) production capability using data from 2017-wheat trial. The innovative approach of the PhenoFieldR (R) platform consists in the use of automatic irrigating rainout shelters coupled with high throughput field phenotyping to complete conventional phenotyping and micrometeorological densified measurements. Firstly, to test various abiotic stresses, automatic mobile rainout shelters allow fine management of fertilization or irrigation by driving daily the intensity and period of the application of the desired limiting factor on the evaluated crop. This management is based on micro-meteorological measurements coupled with a simulation of a carbon, water and nitrogen crop budget. Furthermore, as high-throughput plant-phenotyping under controlled conditions is well advanced, comparable evaluation in field conditions is enabled through phenotyping gantries equipped with various optical sensors. This approach, giving access to either similar or innovative variables compared manual measurements, is moreover distinguished by its capacity for dynamic analysis. Thus, the interactions between genotypes and the environment can be deciphered and better detailed since this gives access not only to the environmental data but also to plant responses to limiting hydric and nitrogen conditions. Further data analyses provide access to the curve parameters of various indicator kinetics, all the more integrative and relevant of plant behavior under stressful conditions. All these specificities of the PhenoFieldR (R) platform open the way to the improvement of various categories of crop models, the fine characterization of variety behavior throughout the growth cycle and the evaluation of particular sensors better suited to a specific research question.

AB  - This article outlines a systematic and ecological approach to the analysis of ecological niches of pathogenic plant micromycetes taking into account the achievements of general and evolutionary ecology and epiphytothiology. The regularities of the expansion of phytopathogen niches in different ecological environments are traced. The evolutionarily formed primary narrow ecological niches of soil micromycetes expand as they move to the "soil-air" boundary and air environment with the damage of plant organs. The evolutionarily formed wide ecological niches of ground-air (or leaf-stem) micromycetes expand due to the air-drop transmission mechanism under favorable hydrothermal conditions. In Western Siberia, the formation of ecological niches of pathogenic micromycetes of annual and perennial plants is at different stages of completion. The suggested evolutionary ecological classification of ecological niches of phytogathogens allows one to move from the abstract concept of ecological niche hypervolume to their specific monitoring taking into account the nature of the action of factors: evolutionary ecological (tactics R, S, T), natural, and anthropogenic in agroecosystems and natural landscapes.

AB  - The dynamic equilibrium of the aquatic ecosystems is accomplished because of the connections between the species and the environmental conditions and also because of the mutual connections between the existing populations. From this point of view, the study of biotic - phytoplankton, zooplankton and/or benthonic components - from the position of the systemic method and conception, in order to characterise the dynamics and role within the integrated aquatic ecosystems represents a proprietary problem of the research in ecology. The paper presents the research results regarding the biological analyses of the aquatic ecosystems of the Danube delta in two sampling sites: Uzlina and Murighiol for the samplings period April 2003 - August 2006. Investigations of the biological properties of water and sediment samples from Uzlina and Murighiol control sections have been accomplished from the viewpoint of phytoplanktonic, zooplanktonic and benthonic macro invertebrates components and the analysis of the biotic communities in the sampling site was focused on the quantitative (numerical density, biomass, abundance after numerical density and biomass) and qualitative components (dominant species, indicator species).

AB  - Ukraine is a large agricultural country with grain production of more than 60 million tons. At that, the percentage of tilled agricultural land reaches 80%, and in some regions even exceeds 90%. The environmental imbalance of agricultural production is becoming more evidentwith the increasing destructive tendencies in the land use. The problem of soil fertility loss is of particular relevance under present conditions. On the one hand, this problem is caused by the high percentage of tilled agricultural land in the territory of Ukraine and the intensive use of the eroded lands, but, on the other hand, by insufficientlyhigh farming culture andrapid growth of deficiency in organic substance and basic soil nutrients (Kolisnyk, 2019; Tsyhanskyi et al., 2019).
   According to the statistical bulletin of Ukraine, the areas where corn was grown in Ukraine in 2015-2017 reached 4.3-4.7 min ha, and Ukraine occupied the leading positionin the world in 2016 in grain production, producing 28.07 min t, with an average yield in the country of 66.0 t/ha (Kolisnyk, 2019; Kolisnyk, 2016).
   Therefore, modern agrotechnologies in agriculture are the important factors in improving crop productivity and preserving soil fertility. Modern technologies being used in the competitive agricultural crop production are the means of functioning of sustainable systems in agriculture. It is possible to improve the efficiency and stability of agriculture only due to the introduction of intensive crop growing technologies. The latest technologies contribute to a more efficient use of the potential of modern varieties and hybrids, and increase yields and their quality by influencing the productive process of plant development. These technologies favour the optimization of production costs with regard to the ecological safety of the environment and maintain the relative agroecosystem balance (Palamarchuk et al., 2010; Kolisnyk, 2007; Butenko et al., 2019).
   Long-termexperiments indicate that the potential of the new corn hybrids hasn't beenused quite enough (Kolisnyk, 2016; Khodanitska, 2020). The realization of its genetic potential will significantly increase the seed production and stimulate the development of the processing industry. Taking into account the biological characteristics of new corn hybrids and the development of new technologies for their growing, there arises the need to optimize the interaction of the hybrid with the available hydrothermal environmental resources and the arranged factors, which will ensure a more complete realization of their potential in the specific region.

AB  - Walking with different types of cueing/stimulus (i.e. auditory, visual) has been shown to alter gait variability, thus emerging as an innovative therapeutical tool to restore abnormal gait variability in clinical populations. However, the majority of the research in this area has focused on auditory stimuli while visual stimuli are an understudied alternative that needs more attention, particularly due to the natural dependence on vision during walking. Furthermore, the time differences between the occurrences of the walking steps and the sensory cues, also known as asynchronies, have also received minimal attention, even though the ability to synchronize with different stimuli is of great importance. This study investigated how synchronizing to visual stimuli with different temporal structures could affect gait variability and the respective asynchronies. Participants performed four 15-min walking trials around an indoor track while wearing insole footswitches for the following conditions: a) self-paced walking, and b) walking with glasses that instructed the subjects to step in sync with a virtual moving bar. The stepping occurences of the moving bar were presented in three different ways b1) non-variable, b2) variable and b3) random. Stride times and asynchronies were determined, and the mean values along with the fractal scaling (an indicator of the complexity) in their time series, were calculated. The fractal scaling of the stride times was unaltered when participants walked with the variable stimulus as compared to the self-paced walking condition; while fractal scaling was significantly decreased during the non-variable and random conditions, indicating a loss of complexity for these two conditions. No differences were observed in the means or the fractal scaling of the asynchronies. The correlation analysis between stride times and asynchronies revealed a strong relationship for the non-variable condition but a weak relationship for both variable and random conditions. Taken together, the present study results supports the idea of an existing internal timekeeper that exhibits complexity. We have shown that this complex pattern is similar regardless of the stimulus condition, suggesting that the system's complexity is likely to be expressed at the task performance level asyncrhonies when walking to a stimulus. Thus, future research in sensoriomotor gait synchronization should focus and further explore the role of the asynchronies, as it may be of clinical significance.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a geoecological assessment of the human-induced impact on the geosystem components of the Osetr river basin in the Moscow region. To assess the surface water quality of this river basin, hydrochemical surveys were conducted which included the determination of parameters such as the pH index, water temperature, the amount of dissolved oxygen (O-2), electrical conductivity, salt content, COD (chemical oxygen demand), BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand for 5 days), etc. Within the framework of ecological monitoring, a reconnaissance survey of the dam in Zaraysk was conducted, during which the basic ecological indicators were determined. The assessment was performed to assess the radiation, chemical, sanitary, epidemiological, and physical-ecological risk factors. The work resulted in geoecological zoning of the middle part of the Osetr river basin based on water pollution levels (WPI-water pollution index, SCWPI-specific combinatorial water pollution index), the amount of human-induced impact, and the human-induced load (point-rating method), using definitions of five categories of river channel sections with human-induced load and ecosystem conditions.

AB  - The macrofauna settling on experimental substrates was studied at two sites of the Lesina Lagoon to test its possible role in monitoring ecological variations in a brackish-water ecosystem. The community settlement was seasonally investigated on 3-month-old wooden poles; the development was monitored from 2001 to 2005. Comparisons with benthic assemblages settled on 10-yr-old poles were also performed. The main hydrological parameters were periodically measured during the study. A total of 38 species were collected. The assemblage reached the highest development in the central lagoon, showing relevant carbonate structures which supported a rich vagile fauna. Close to the sea-water inlet species richness and abundance values were lower, with the disappearance of some brackish-water species. A remarkable salinity drop during 2004 produced some faunistic changes in the assemblages, which however maintained different structures between the study sites, thus confirming macrozoobenthos as an efficient bioindicator of different environmental conditions for transition biotopes and a useful investigation tool in monitoring programmes.

AB  - Various methods have been developed to monitor environmental quality, including biomonitoring using lichen. In this paper, a total of 143 previous studies from the last decade were analyzed to gain insight into current practices, progress, and challenges. Content analysis was employed to systematically characterize and classify the existing biomonitoring using lichen studies into several groups based on research area and scope. Various aspects of current biomonitoring applications using lichen were analyzed and it was found that the number of related studies increased significantly in recent years. Two main techniques for biomonitoring using lichen were identified, with varying research scope and types of parameters that were measured in the studies. Finally, the current practices, progress, and challenges of biomonitoring using lichen as the biological indicator were discussed, and future recommendations were provided.

AB  - In the backdrop of climate change and overexploitation of resources, ecologically sensitive regions like Sundarban deserve special attention. This study investigates the current situation of Sundarban, both in terms of physical and sociocultural aspects. The study traverses through the harsh conditions of the region and the societal preparedness to face them. In order to save Sundarban, there is a need to change the ongoing model of development and conservation in the area. Environment Induced Resettlement and Profit-Sharing Model (ERPSM) proposes a sustainable approach to give nature the required space to recover from the ongoing degradation. A consortium of government, cooperative and corporate can bring necessary change through a participatory approach. It may be proposed, that successful implementation of ERPSM can significantly improve indicators of several Sustainable Development Goals. The suggested model will generate economic incentive for the government and the affected population to encourage measures to save the islands which are rapidly getting eroded and also draw public and private investment in the process.

AB  - The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is prolific and their reefs are dominant features along the estuaries and coastal areas in the Gulf of Mexico including those along the Southwest Florida coast. This paper examines the ecological and indirect economic value of oysters and the ecosystem services they provide. Drivers of change in reefs as well as various factors (pressures) that affect oyster reefs are examined. Using the monitoring data from on-going studies, this study examined various metrics of oyster health, reproduction and survival to develop an index to create an overall state of oyster reefs in the Southwest Florida estuaries. Based on existing data, oyster reefs in Southwest Florida estuaries are at "caution", but stable. Restoration of a more natural freshwater inflow, minimizing nutrient and contaminant input as well as decreased sedimentation will enable oyster reefs to expand and thrive. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using taxa as indicators of environmental impacts is widespread. Indicators are chosen because they are considered to be easy to measure, sensitive to stresses and respond to stresses in predictable ways. Here, we review these criteria by addressing the nature of the relationships between some characteristic of taxa and the environmental variables they are supposed to indicate. It is crucial that variables measured as indicators be strongly and consistently correlated (through space and time) with levels of the environmental variables. Appropriate experiments must be done to establish that an observed correlation is causal, or the correlation cannot be considered sufficient to identify a useful indicator. Finally, it is necessary to establish that the taxa directly respond to changes in the environmental variables they are supposed to indicate. Appropriate methodologies to establish these criteria are considered and we evaluate studies in which these criteria have or have not been met. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water resource management consists of planning and implementing measures to ensure sufficient and quality supply to activities requiring water usage, including the supply of plumbing systems in buildings. Major problems arise from mismanagement of water usage, such as the lack of proper upkeep practices and maintenance of plumbing fixtures in public buildings. The aim of this study is to analyze the existence of possible statistical correlations between water consumption data and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures in public administrative buildings. Ten public buildings were visited in Brazil while performing this research, in order to determine the per capita water consumption, flow rates, and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures. Flow rate data were obtained through field measurements by the gravimetric method and compared with the values set by Brazilian standards and environmental certifications. Consumption indicators were calculated, which showed variation from 16.6 to 69.3 L/user/day. The performed statistical analysis pointed out that there was significant correlation with variables related to construction and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures, such as the number of installed devices, number of leaks and defects found, in addition to devices with flow rate noncompliant to limits established by current legislation.

AB  - We compared condition of endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) between an urban population in Bakersfield, California (BAK), and a nearby exurban population at the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California (NPRC). Our objective was to determine whether differences between urban and exurban environments, particularly food availability and disease vectors, were reflected in kit fox condition. Body mass, blood chemistry, and prevalence of viral antibodies were assessed at both sites in 1988 and 1989. Body mass was higher for BAK kit foxes, particularly juveniles, and varied between years for NPRC kit foxes. Higher red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Het), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) among NPRC kit foxes were indicative of hemoconcentration, probably resulting from dehydration associated with low food or water intake. Kit forts from NPRC: exhibited higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lower cholesterol (CHOL) levels compared to BAK kit foxes. These results may have reflected dietary differences, but they possibly indicated tissue catabolism by NPRC kit foxes due to nutritional deprivation. Other serological data also suggested nutritional stress among NPRC kit foxes. Prevalence of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper (CD), and infectious canine hepatitus (ICH) was similar between populations. Food availability for kit foxes at NPRC was relatively low during 1988-89 due to drought conditions, but food probably was not a limiting factor at BAK due to abundant water and the presence of anthropogenic foods. Urban environments may provide certain advantages for San Joaquin kit foxes and could contribute to conservation and recovery efforts.

AB  - In order to analyze the spatial distribution patterns, pollution sources and ecological risks of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn), 30 sediment samples were taken from in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE). The results indicated that the contamination ranking of heavy metals was As > Cr > Cd > Ni > Mn > Pb > Zn > Cu. In the various areas, the pollution magnitude decreased as follows: adjacent sea > river mouth > inner-region. Compared to data published for other regions, the YRE data indicated that the sediment was not severely contaminated by heavy metals. In the YRE, natural and anthropogenic inputs dominated the distribution patterns of the heavy metals. Beyond that, the hydrodynamic conditions, such as the Taiwan warm current, coastal current and Yangtze diluted water, also caused distribution variations in the study areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the principal metabolites in cattle excreta following the administration of Synovex((R)) ONE, which contains estradiol benzoate and trenbolone acetate, is 17 alpha-estradiol. As part of the environmental assessment of the use of Synovex ONE, data were generated to characterize the fate of 17 alpha-estradiol in the environment. Studies were conducted to determine the degradation and transformation of 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol in 2 representative water-sediment systems each under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The same transformation products-estriol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone-were formed, principally in the sediment phase, under both conditions in both systems. From the production of these transformation products, the 50% disappearance time (DT50) values of estrone and 17 beta-estradiol were determined, along with the DT50 values of 17 alpha-estradiol and the total drug (17 alpha-estradiol+17 beta-estradiol+estrone). The results indicate that 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol was more persistent under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions and that 17 alpha-[C-14]-estradiol was less persistent than its transformation products. The DT50 values for the total system (aqueous and sediment phases) and for the total residues (17 alpha- estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, and estrone) were selected for use in modeling the environmental fate of estradiol benzoate. For aerobic degradation in the water-sediment system, the DT50 was 31.1 d, and it was 107.8 d for the anaerobic system. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB  - Background Many factors interfering with a listener attempting to grasp speech in noisy environments. The spatial hearing by which speech and noise can be spatially separated may play a crucial role in speech recognition in the presence of competing noise. This study aimed to assess whether, and to what degree, spatial hearing benefit speech recognition in young normal-hearing participants in both quiet and noisy environments.
   Methods Twenty-eight young participants were tested by Mandarin Hearing In Noise Test (MHINT) in quiet and noisy environments. The assessment method used was characterized by modifications of speech and noise configurations, as well as by changes of speech presentation mode. The benefit of spatial hearing was measured by speech recognition threshold (SAT) variation between speech condition 1 (SC1) and speech condition 2 (SC2).
   Results There was no significant difference found in the SRT between SC1 and SC2 in quiet. SRT in SC1 was about 4.2 dB lower than that in SC2, both in speech-shaped and four-babble noise conditions. SRTs measured in both SC1 and SC2 were lower in the speech-shaped noise condition than in the four-babble noise condition.
   Conclusion Spatial hearing in young normal-hearing participants contribute to speech recognition in noisy environments, but provide no benefit to speech recognition in quiet environments, which may be due to the offset of auditory extrinsic redundancy against the lack of spatial hearing.

AB  - Temporary rivers are characterized by shifting habitats between flowing, isolated pools, and dry phases. Despite the fact that temporary rivers are currently receiving increasing attention by researchers and managers, the isolated pools phase has been largely disregarded. However, isolated pools in temporary rivers are transitional habitats of major ecological relevance as they support aquatic ecosystems during no-flow periods, and can act as refugees for maintaining local and regional freshwater biodiversity. Pool characteristics such as surface water permanence and size, presence of predators, local physicochemical conditions, time since disconnection from the river flow, or distance to other freshwater habitats challenge a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of these habitats, and challenge ecological quality assessments and conservation practices in temporary rivers. In this paper, we aim at providing a characterization of isolated pools from a hydrological, geomorphological, physicochemical, biogeochemical, and biological point of view as a framework to better conceptualize, conserve, and manage these habitats.

AB  - Military training commonly results in land degradation, but protocols for assessing and predicting long-term environmental impact are lacking. An ability to assess the impact of repeated disturbance and subsequent recovery is needed to balance training requirements against environmental quality. To develop methodology for assessing soil quality, a study evaluating disturbance resulting from tank maneuvers was initiated on Fort Riley Military Installation, Kansas. The objectives were to identify and quantify soil-quality indicators on two soil types exposed to controlled tank traffic. We examined physical, chemical, and biotic indicators after treatments were applied during wet and dry soil conditions. A randomized complete-block design, with three blocks per soil type and three treatments per block, was used. Treatments consisted of disturbance created by a 63-ton M1A1 tank making five passes in a figure-8 pattern during either dry or wet soil conditions. The M1A1 was operated at a speed of approximately 8 km/h. Control plots received no tank traffic. Soil-quality indicators evaluated were soil compaction, soil penetration resistance, rut depth, soil bulk density, soil texture, soil chemical composition, plant biomass, soil microbial diversity, and nematode and earthworm taxa. Soil-quality indicators were sampled within one week after tank disturbance. Preliminary data indicate soil-texture-dependent treatment effects (p <= 0.05) for bulk density and porosity. Bulk density increased and porosity decreased on trafficked areas, in the silt loam soil, but showed no change in the silty clay loam soil. Disturbance during wet soil conditions raised penetrometer resistance and gravimetric water content more than disturbance during dry soil conditions (p <= 0.05). A significant difference in disturbance was measured between the outside and inside portion of the same track (p <= 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). The outside track caused the greatest amount of disturbance, as measured by the height of the disturbed soil ridge above the track bed. Tank disturbance significantly reduced total vegetative biomass (p <= 0.05) compared with that of un-trafficked areas. Disturbance under wet soil conditions significantly reduced grass biomass (p = 0.040), whereas disturbance under dry soil conditions significantly reduced forb biomass (P = 0.0247) compared to un-trafficked areas. Total earthworm abundance (p = 0.011) was reduced by 82% when disturbance occurred during wet soil conditions regardless of soil type. (c) 2005 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocean and atmosphere reanalysis fields are used to study environmental conditions and their relation to commercial fish catch in the central Benguela upwelling zone, using both targeted and objective techniques. Composite maps and sections indicate a 10%-20% weakening of southeasterly winds, a 0.5 degrees C warming of sea temperatures over the shelf, and changes in currents and subsurface upwelling associated with higher fish catch. During periods of high fish catch, recirculating gyres form that may aid the retention of eggs and larvae. Offshore winds contribute to poleward Ekman transport in a 50-m-deep layer within 100 km of the coast.
   In addition to composite analysis, the natural variability is studied by principal component analysis of wind stress, sea level, temperature, salinity, currents, and vertical motion in the period 1970-2007. Comparison of interannual time scores and fisheries data indicate that anomalous poleward winds and warmer temperatures in the Luderitz plume, driven by an atmospheric trough in the South Atlantic, are associated with higher catch rates.

AB  - Live (rose Bengal-stained) benthic foraminifera were studied from one of the largest coral reef aquaria in the world (Burgers' Ocean, Arnhem, the Netherlands). Benthic foraminifera were unintentionally transported to the aquarium with live rock (i.e., natural reef substratum) from Java and Bali (Indonesia) during initial setup in 2000. After eight years and stabilization of the water chemistry, the foraminifera were found to have successfully colonized this artificial environment. Fifty benthic foraminiferal taxa (>125 mu m) were identified in samples from the various subenvironments within the aquarium. The ecological conditions in the aquarium appeared to be optimal for both symbiont-bearing foraminifera and hermatypic corals. Among the four symbiontic foraminiferal species identified, Heterostegina depressa was the most abundant and it was dominant in all samples. Overall, foraminiferal densities in the aquarium were relatively high compared to those in the natural environment emulated. Although foraminifera are not generally recognized as inhabitants of saltwater aquaria, they can play an important ecological role in this type of closed environment.

AB  - The use of ethanol in gasoline has become a worldwide tendency as an alternative to reduce net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, increasing gasoline octane rating and reducing dependence on petroleum products. However, recently environmental authorities in large urban centers have expressed their concerns on the true effect of using ethanol blends of up to 20% v/v in in-use vehicles without any modification in the setup of the engine control unit (ECU), and on the variations of these effects along the years of operation of these vehicles. Their main concern is the potential increase in the emissions of volatile organic compounds with high ozone formation potential. To address these concerns, we developed analytical and experimental work testing engines under steady-conditions. We also tested carbureted and fuel-injected vehicles every 10,000 km during their first 100,000 km of operation. We measured the effect of using ethanol-gasoline blends on the power and torque generated, the fuel consumption and CO2, CO, NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emissions, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene and 1,3-butadiene which are considered important ozone precursors. The obtained results showed statistically no significant differences in these variables when vehicles operate with a blend of 20% v/v ethanol and 80% v/v gasoline (E20) instead of gasoline. Those results remained unchanged during the first 100,000 km of operation of the vehicles. We also observed that when the vehicles operated with E20 at high engine loads, they showed a tendency to operate with greater values of (ratio of the actual air-fuel ratio to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) when compared to their operation with gasoline. According to the Eco-Indicator-99, these results represent a minor reduction (<1.3%) on the impact to human health, and on the deterioration of the ecosystem. However, it implies a 12.9% deterioration of the natural resources. Thermal equilibrium analysis, at the tailpipe conditions (similar to 100 degrees C), showed that ethane, formaldehyde, ethylene and ethanol are the most relevant VOCs in terms of the amount of mass emitted. The use of ethanol in the gasoline reduced 20-40% of those emissions. These reductions implied an average reduction of 17% in the ozone formation potential.

AB  - Integration of molecular methods, ecological modeling, and statistical hypothesis testing are increasing our understanding of differentiation within species and phylogenetic relationships among species by revealing environmental connections to evolutionary processes. Within mammals, novel diversity is being discovered and characterized as more complete geographic sampling is coupled with newer multi-disciplinary approaches. North American red squirrels exemplify a forest obligate genus whose species are monitored as indicators of forest ecosystem condition, yet phylogenetic relationships reflecting evolutionary history within this genus remain tentative. Through testing of competing systematic and niche-based divergence hypotheses, we recognize three species, Tamiasciurus douglasii, T. hudsonicus, and T. fremonti. Our data provide evidence of regional differences in evolutionary dynamics and continental gradients of complexity that are important both for future management and for investigating multiple pathways that can lead to the formation of new species.

AB  - Taking a novel hybrid-power gas engine heat pump as an example, fuel-consumed rate, fuel-consumed flow, fuel conversion efficiency and life cycle assessment were used to analyze energy-saving effect and natural gas environmental benefits on human health, ecosystem quality and resource consumption through contrast with electric power consumption model. The test results show that the fuel conversion efficiency under different operating conditions of HPGHP is higher than conventional GHP under the same load. Besides, from the total indicator, scores on resource consumption is the highest. Gaseous product is mainly CO2 and other carbon or sulfur oxide gases are discharged in form of negative or water body, which means the use of natural gas effectively control the pollution gas emissions. At last, concept of environmental benefit time was established; the result shows that HPGHP can embody better environmental benefits than gas heat pump when running more than 1778 h.

AB  - Background and Aims In and environments many plant species are found associated with the canopies of woody perennials. Favourable conditions for establishment under canopies are likely to be associated with shade, but under canopies shade is distributed patchily and differs in quality. Diurnal temperature fluctuations and maximum temperatures could be reliable indicators of safe sites. Here, an examination is made as to whether canopy-associated species use temperature cues to germinate in shade patches, rather than matrix areas between trees.
   Methods The study was carried out in and southern Kalahari savannah (Republic of South Africa). Perennial and annual species associated with Acacia erioloba trees and matrix species were germinated at temperature regimes resembling shaded and unshaded conditions. Soil temperature was measured in the field.
   Key Results Germination of all fleshy-fruited perennial acacia-associated species and two annual acacia-associated species was inhibited by the temperature regime resembling unshaded conditions compared with at least one of the regimes resembling shaded conditions. Inhibition in perennials decreased with seed mass, probably reflecting that smaller seedlings are more vulnerable to drought. Germination of matrix species was not inhibited by the unshaded temperature regime and in several cases it increased germination compared with shaded temperature regimes or constant temperature. Using phylogenctically independent contrasts a significant positive relationship was found between canopy association and the germination at shade temperatures relative to unshaded temperatures.
   Conclusions The data support the hypothesis that canopy species have developed mechanisms to prevent germination in open sun conditions. The results and data from the literature show that inhibition of germination at temperature regimes characteristic of open sun conditions can be found in fleshy-fruited species of widely divergent taxonomic groups. It is predicted that germination mechanisms to detect canopy shade based on temperature cues are widespread in species depending on nurse plants, especially bird-dispersed species.

AB  - Habitat and hydrology indices were developed to assess the conditions in reaches of the impounded Mississippi river, the Fort Peck and Garrison reaches of the upper Missouri river, the Missouri National Recreational river (MNRR), the channelized lower Missouri river, and the Ohio river. Data were obtained from field sampling, air photo interpretation, and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic records. Habitat and hydrology attributes were incorporated into four habitat indices (channel complexity, substrate quality, littoral cover, and riparian condition) and one hydrology index. Construction of habitat indices for these very large rivers was complicated by a lack of previous research demonstrating methods for choosing and weighting the metrics used to compose these indices. Many habitat metrics used to assess habitat quality in small rivers proved irrelevant or impractical for assessing habitat quality in the upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers. In addition, these very large rivers, unlike smaller streams, were subject to physical and hydrological alterations due to channelization, revetment, levees, and dams. Because of the lack of proven indicators of habitat condition in very large rivers, we began with a large number of measures of natural and anthropogenic stress, eliminating only those metrics that failed tests of range, redundancy, and correlation with longitudinal position along the river. The lock and low-head dam sequences on the impounded Mississippi and Ohio influenced both hydrological patterns and the resident fish community, with conditions recovering with increased distance below dams, until hydrology was once again altered by impoundment from a downriver dam. Channel complexity and hydrology indices displayed the highest correlations with a multimetric fish index, possibly because these indices integrated habitat condition over a larger scale than the transect- and site-scaled littoral cover and riparian indices. Data limitations prevented the calculation of a littoral cover and a channel complexity index for the upper Missouri and Ohio rivers, respectively. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of environmental enrichment on the welfare of stabled horses was estimated on the basis of positive and negative behavioural indicators. Six stabled horses were exposed for seven days to each of two conditions in early spring. i) a window at the back of the loose box was opened, but no horses were within the view of the subject horses (OW) and ii) the window in the loose box was opened and two horses that had been in the some stable as the subject horses were turned out to the paddock next to the stable and were within view of the subject horses (OWH). The window in the loose box had been closed prior to the start of the study for protection against the cold during winter months (CW condition) but horses could see outside the loose box through the grille door. The behaviour of the subject horses was recorded by video camera from 1300 to 1530h, firstly, in the CW condition for the three days prior to treatment as the control condition, and then for the lost three days of each week in the OW and OWH conditions. The behaviour was focal- and instantaneous-sampled at 30-s intervals. Significant differences between the effects of the loose box conditions on the mean percentage of time spent in standing behaviour, looking behaviour, and bedding investigation behaviour (which may be an indicator of frustration) were observed but no significant difference in the mean percentage of time spent in standing-sleep behaviour (which may be an indicator of behavioural satisfaction) was observed. When the window was opened, bedding investigation and standing behaviour decreased and, when the conspecifics were within view, bedding investigation behaviour decreased and looking behaviour increased. The results suggested that the OW and OWH treatments suppressed the frustration of stabled horses which did not perform any abnormal behaviour, but may not increase the behavioural satisfaction of stabled horses.

AB  - We present a methodological approach for the characterization of spatial variations of environmental and transport conditions based on geochemical data. We analyzed the geochemical characteristics of terrestrial sediments on an alluvial fan and adjacent areas in the eastern part of the Donggi Cona catchment. The geochemical characteristics of the sediment samples were measured using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. A factor model based on nine elements (Sr, Rb, Zn, Fe, Mn, V. Ti, Ca and K) gave the best results using factor analysis. Our results show that factor analysis of geochemical data can explain spatial variations in the catchment, even within a relatively small area with more or less constant climatological conditions.
   The four most important factors of our model explain 68.4% of the total variance within the dataset. The four factors represent a carbonate, weathering and two redox condition signals, respectively. The spatial distribution of factor loadings points to regions with specific environmental conditions. These regions show a certain carbonate input or production (factor 1), specific weathering rates (factor 2) or specific redox conditions (factors 3 and 4). The factor loadings of the first and second factor are used to reclassify the data into four groups, being dune, loess, lake and fluvial gravel sediments. This reclassification confirms or improves the prior field classification in 70% of all cases. For 23% of the samples, the model gave a different interpretation. The factor loadings in these cases represent the origin of the material rather than its present sediment type, thereby giving valuable information about sediment provenance. Since the third and fourth factor seem more dependent on location, they do not differentiate between different sediment types.
   Multivariate statistics of the geochemistry of terrestrial sediments (i) allows the subdivision of samples into different sediment types, (ii) indicates dominant regions for weathering, carbonate production and manganese washout and (iii) gives suggestions about the provenance of the sediments. This is the first detailed study of geochemical parameters on the Tibetan Plateau not focusing on lake cores, resulting in a spatial characterization of the local geochemistry. This gives insight in the sediment transport connections between the catchment and the lake, illustrating the value of terrestrial sediments as additional indicator of environmental variations.

AB  - Low-head dams are ubiquitous in eastern North America, and small dam removal projects seek to improve habitat conditions for resident and migratory fishes. Effects of small dams of varying status on local fish communities are poorly documented, and recent work suggests benefits of maintaining fragmentation. We sampled fish at 25 dams (9 breached, 7 relict, 9 intact) in three river basins in North Carolina, USA. Fishes were sampled at three reaches/dam from 2010 to 2011. Study reaches were located upstream (free-flowing reaches), downstream (tailrace) and >500 m downstream of dams (n = 75 reaches). Analyses revealed significantly elevated fish CPUE, taxa richness and percentage intolerant taxa in intact dam tailraces suggesting small dams may improve conditions for resident taxa. Breached dam tailrace reaches exhibited lower fish CPUE, taxa richness and percentage intolerant taxa relative to upstream reference reaches. Relict dams exhibited no between-reach differences in fish community metrics. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed drainage-specific stream fish responses across study drainages. Tar and Roanoke drainage streams with intact and relict dams supported fish assemblages indicative of natural communities, whereas Neuse Drainage streams with intact and breached dams contained disturbed habitats and communities. These data demonstrate fish community responses to dam condition are drainage specific but communities in streams with intact and relict dams are largely similar. Additionally, breached dams may warrant higher removal priorities than intact dams because they negatively influence fish communities. The variability in response to some dams indicates managers, regardless of region or country, should consider holistic approaches to dam removals on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - This study is the first attempt which provides information regarding the biomarker characteristics and geochemical elements of the Jurassic Amran sediments from Samae area in the Taiz Governorate, Southern Yemen. The geochemical results helped us to investigate the origin and type of organic matter and its relation to environment conditions during deposition of the sediments. The Amran sediments have the highest concentration of terrestrial detritus elements (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) with relatively high carbonate element (CaO), indicating that these sediments are limestones with argillaceous and clastic contents that are deposited in a shallow marine environment. This is supported by low total sulfur (TS) contents and Sr/Ba ratios and biomarker environment indicators. Their biomarkers provide also evidence for a mixed organic matter by aquatic and terrigenous organic matter contributions. This is confirmed by bimodal distribution of normal alkanes, relation of acyclic isoprenoids to normal alkanes, relatively high tricyclic terpanes compared to tetracyclic terpanes, and high proportion of C-27 (36.1-44.4 %) and C-29 (33.4-41.1 %) compared to C-28 (21.9-23.8 %) regular steranes. Moreover, the suboxic bottom water conditions are evidenced in the Jurassic Amran argillaceous limestone sediments, as identified from V/Ni, and pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios in the range of 1.53-2.54 and 1.09-1.38, respectively. Therefore, suboxic conditions contribute to organic matter (OM) preservation during deposition of the Amran sediments.

AB  - Honesty of sexual advertisement is thought to be the result of signalling costs. Because production costs of depigmented plumage patches are probably very low, their role as honest signals of individual quality has been questioned. Costs of bearing these traits, however, should also be taken into account. Studies on proximate determination and possible information content of white badges are very rare. We investigated repeatability, sensu lato heritability, and condition- and age-dependence of white wing patch size, a male display trait in a population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), based on 4 years of data. By comparing relationships between age and wing patch size (1) within individuals among years versus (2) among individuals within years, we could address the viability indicator value of the trait. Wing patch size approximately doubled at the transition from subadult to adult plumage, and its change was significantly related to body condition the previous season. Repeatability and heritability values suggest that the trait is informative already in subadult plumage, and that genetic and early environmental effects are important in its determination, the latter only during the first year of life. Thus, wing patch size can act as a condition-dependent signal of genetic quality. Indeed, discrepancy between results from the horizontal and vertical age-dependence approaches shows that the trait was positively related to expected lifespan. After examining several alternative explanations, we conclude that wing patch size indicates genetically based viability. This is the first study to demonstrate a good genes viability benefit conferred by a depigmented plumage patch.

AB  - To assess the relationship of radiolarian production, species distribution in water and surface sediment to water-mass characteristics, biological productivity and export regimes in the Sea of Okhotsk (SOk) we accomplished a quantitative analysis of radiolarian assemblages obtained from 35 surface-sediment samples and 115 plankton samples recording the radiolarian depth distribution in the upper 1000 m of the water column at 23 locations. This study augments the knowledge on the autecological demands of radiolarians dwelling in a specific hydrographic and biological environment, and extracts new information on the significance of radiolarians for the assessment of past oceanographic and climatic development in high latitudes. Highest radiolarian accumulation rates and seasonal radiolarian standing stocks are encountered in the western part of the SOk close to Sakhalin, marking the environmental conditions in this area as most favorable for radiolarian production. Maximum standing stocks occur during summer, indicating that the radiolarian signal preserved in the sediment record is mainly produced during this season when the mesopelagic biomass is at highest activity. We identified seven radiolarian species and groups related to specific water-mass characteristics, depth habitats, and productivity regimes. Of those, Dietyophimus hirundo and Cycladophora davisiana are most prominent in the Sea of Okhotsk Intermediate Water (200-1000m), the latter representing an indicator of the occurrence of cold and well ventilated intermediate/deep water and enhanced export of organic matter from a highly productive ocean surface. While Antarctissa (?) sp. I is typically related to the cold-water Sea of Okhotsk Dicothermal Layer (SODL), ranging between 50 and 150m water depth, the surface waters above the SODL affected by strong seasonal variability are inhabited predominantly by taxa belonging to the Spongodiscidae, having a broad environmental tolerance. Taxa only found in the sediment record show that the plankton study did not cover all assemblages occurring in the modern SOk. This accounts for an assemblage restricted to the western Kurile Basin and apparently related to environmental conditions influenced by North Pacific and Japan Sea waters. Other important taxa include species of the Plagomidae group, representing the most prominent contributors to the SOk plankton and surface sediments. These radiolarians show a more opportunistic occurrence and are indicative of high nutrient supply in a hydrographic environment characterized by pronounced stratification enhancing heterotrophic activity and phytodetritus export.

AB  - Rapidly expanding conversion of tropical forests to oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia leads to soil acidification following intensive nitrogen fertilization. Changes in soil pH are predicted to have an impact on archaeal ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and complete (comammox) ammonia oxidizers and, consequently, on nitrification. It is therefore critical to determine whether the predicted effects of pH on ammonia oxidizers and nitrification activity apply in tropical soils subjected to various degrees of anthropogenic activity. This was investigated by experimental manipulation of pH in soil microcosms from a land-use gradient (forest, riparian, and oil palm soils). The nitrification rate was greater in forest soils with native neutral pH than in converted acidic oil palm soils. Ammonia oxidizer activity decreased following acidification of the forest soils but increased after liming of the oil palm soils, leading to a trend of a reversed net nitrification rate after pH modification. AOA and AOB nitrification activity was dependent on pH, but AOB were more sensitive to pH modification than AOA, which demonstrates a greater stability of AOA than AOB under conditions of short-term perturbation. In addition, these results predict AOB to be a good bioindicator of nitrification response following pH perturbation during land-use conversion. AOB and/or comammox species were active in all soils along the land-use gradient, even, unexpectedly, under acidic conditions, suggesting their adaptation to native acidic or acidified soils. The present study therefore provided evidence for limited stability of soil ammonia oxidizer activity following intensive anthropogenic activities, which likely aggravates the vulnerability of nitrogen cycle processes to environmental disturbance.
   IMPORTANCE Physiological and ecological studies have provided evidence for pH-driven niche specialization of ammonia oxidizers in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the functional stability of ammonia oxidizers following pH change has not been investigated, despite its importance in understanding the maintenance of ecosystem processes following environmental perturbation. This is particularly true after anthropogenic perturbation, such as the conversion of tropical forest to oil palm plantations. This study demonstrated a great impact of land-use conversion on nitrification, which is linked to changes in soil pH due to common agricultural practices (intensive fertilization). In addition, the different communities of ammonia oxidizers were differently affected by short-term pH perturbations, with implications for future land-use conversions but also for increased knowledge of associated global nitrous oxide emissions and current climate change concerns.

AB  - Securing desirable forest regeneration outcomes is an essential component of sustainable forest management. When natural reproduction is preferred over planting, achieving desirable outcomes may be the principal challenge for forest managers, as reports of struggles and even failures are common across many regions and forest ecosystems. Informing managers and policymakers of the prospects of regeneration success before practices and policies are implemented promotes long-term sustainability because rehabilitating undesirable regeneration outcomes is often lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. In 2012, the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Forest Inventory and Analysis program implemented Regeneration Indicator (RI) protocols that added detailed seedling measurements and browse impact assessments to a subsample of inventory plots across 24 states in the northern United States. The goal of this expanded sampling effort is to improve the ability to monitor broad scale regeneration trends and better inform forest management planning and policy. Modeling probable regeneration outcomes is difficult and the rarity of vetted models that can fully utilize RI inventory data highlights an immediate need for flexible methods to evaluate regeneration of different taxa at large scales. This manuscript is premised on estimation of a tree seedling mortality budget for inventoried reproduction. The method offers a transparent structure for leveraging existing literature and expert knowledge to gain provisional insight into plausible regeneration outcomes. The resulting tool provides flexibility for users to examine regeneration for multiple species, site conditions, and user-defined quantitative regeneration objectives. The approach is demonstrated by applying a suite of multispecies regeneration objectives to RI data for two case studies with different forest composition and geographic scales, the Ozark Highland Ecological Section (OHES) and the Monongahela National Forest (MNF). Within the Quercus/Carya dominated OHES, analyses indicate that desirable regeneration outcomes are more likely than not based on current plot conditions. Regeneration events were projected to produce new fully stocked forests on 76% of OHES plots, produce a sizable component of characteristic overstory species on 57%, and produce a sizable component of commercially important species on 59%. Within the Acer/Fagus/Betula and Quercus/Caiya forests of the MNF, analyses indicated that difficulties in achieving desirable regeneration outcomes were likely. Only 36% of MNF plots were projected to produce new fully stocked forests following a regeneration event and only 29% were projected to regenerate a sizable component of either characteristic overstory species or commercially important species.

AB  - Eutrophication is known to affect the community structure of macroalgae by e.g. decreasing the depth penetration of species and by shifting dominance from perennial to annual species. However, there is substantial lack of knowledge in the Baltic Sea regarding the distribution of many of the macroalgal species, how natural environmental factors affect their occurrence and how they respond to eutrophication. As macroalgae are used as indicators of the quality of the sea areas in the EU legislation (Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive), this kind of knowledge is essential. The aim of this study was to determine which variables were related to variation in species occurrence and their lower limit of occurrence in the Finnish marine area. The study was carried out on data from five study areas along the Finnish coastline and included about 30 taxa. Our results showed that both the macroalgal communities and the occurrence (presence/absence) of most of the species differed between the study areas and that the differences were mainly related to salinity and exposure, although also eutrophication related factors played a role. Of the perennial species, eutrophied conditions seemed to favour only the occurrence of Sphacelaria arctica and Polysiphonia fucoides. Secchi depth was important in determining the lower limit of occurrence of brown and red algal species. However, Secchi depth was rarely the only factor causing variation in the lower limit of occurrence as also exposure, salinity and slope of the shore affected it. We conclude that in the northern Baltic Sea, the taxonomic composition of the macroalgal communities is not a very useful indicator of eutrophication as perennial species seem to tolerate rather eutrophied conditions, when suitable substrate is available. The lower limit of occurrence of many of the brown and red algal species is a good indicator of eutrophication but due to lack of suitable substrate in more eutrophied areas, especially in the depths where light becomes limiting, it is only applicable in the middle and outer archipelago areas. Furthermore, when planning monitoring programmes or setting thresholds for evaluating the ecological status of the sea, the natural variation in the lower limit of occurrence of macroalgae across sea areas is problematic and should carefully be taken into account.

AB  - How the geochemical characteristics of organic matter shale for the carbonate platform fades remain uncertain, which restricts an integrated reconstruction of the model of organic matter accumulation and preservation. Here, we present new results from element geochemical fingerprinting and integrated analyses of paleoclimate, paleoproductivity, paleoredox environment, and terrigenous input of the targeted Middle Devonian Tanshanping and Dacaozi Formations in the Ninglang-Yanyuan Basin, Southwest China. It is worth noting that although the carbonate platform connects with the open sea partially, the redox environment will not be completely controlled by relative sea level variations. Specially, the paleoclimate, paleoproductivity, and paleoredox conditions are the main controlling factors of the accumulation and preservation of organic matter. In view of the paleoclimate indexes, we suggest that both a relatively warm-humid climate characterized by intensified chemical weathering conditions and a higher terrigenous input are identified as two major drivers forcing the reductive environment in the sedimentary waterbody. Finally, a comprehensive model is established for providing new insights into the mechanism of organic matter accumulation and preservation for the carbonate platform fades. The paleoredox environment, paleoproductivity, paleoclimate, and terrigenous input are believed to have exerted a very considerable force on reconstructing the model of organic matter accumulation and preservation for the carbonate platform facies. Specially, the coupling interactions between the paleoproductivity and redox condition are thus also stressed. We found that the preservation condition is much more important than the paleoproductivity, resulting in the degree of organic matter enrichment. Even if the paleoproductivity of a sedimentary waterbody of a depositional period of the Dacaozi Formation was higher, the TOC concentrations were relatively low due to the poor preservation condition by fall of the sea level and increase of the terrigenous input. In another aspect, the better preservation condition of the Tanshanping Formation makes the TOC concentrations higher in the case of lower paleoproductivity in the sedimentary waterbody.

AB  - Deposition of the Miocene Monterey Formation into numerous basins provides an ideal opportunity to study how preservation of geochemical signatures varies within and among basins as a function of local and global climatic and oceanic conditions. This study presents commonly employed redox indicators, including iron (Fe) speciation and redox-sensitive trace metal concentrations (Mo, U, V), to constrain paleoredox conditions from three Monterey locations: the Santa Barbara Basin, the Santa Maria Basin, and the San Joaquin Basin. The Fe speciation geochemistry of the Santa Barbara and Santa Maria Basin sediments are consistent with a wide range of redox conditions from suboxic to euxinic. These results, in combination with associated phosphorites and trace metal enrichment patterns, indicate oscillatory redox conditions, perhaps with a chemocline that fluctuated above the sediment-water interface on seasonal or multi-year timescales. Overall, these sections were deposited in environments similar to modern phosphorite-forming and upwelling-dominated oxygen minimum zone settings like the Peru Margin. Geochemical evidence indicates that the San Joaquin Basin was generally more restricted and more stably anoxic compared to the other two basins, perhaps more analogous to the modern Cariaco Basin, at least for the studied interval. Iron speciation in the San Joaquin Basin reveals anoxia and euxinia over the entirety of the studied interval, although trace metal concentrations are generally at the low end of those typical of anoxic/euxinic conditions-consistent with a restricted connection with the open ocean. The one exception is an interval c. similar to 11.6 million years ago (Ma) with elevated concentrations of redox-sensitive elements that may represent a decrease in basin restriction or an increase in water column sulfide concentrations. The present-day California Margin does not achieve euxinic conditions in similar basinal settings comparable with these Monterey sections, suggesting fundamental differences for the Miocene California margin that may carry implications for global-scale oxygen deficiency in Miocene oxygen minimum zones.

AB  - An important aspect of sustainable forest management is to assess the impact of forest operations on ecosystem services. This work analyzed the long-term effect of two standard thinning regimes on carbon stocks both in tree biomass and soil compartments as well as its effect on soil condition. The target population was a 90-year-old Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) stand in southwestern Europe. Soil condition was measured as dry mass of the forest floor and concentration of carbon, nutrients in the forest floor as well as exchangeable cations, effective cation exchange capacity, pH and bulk density in the mineral soil. Repeated thinnings from below in a southern European population of Scots pine led to a reduction in current on-site carbon stock in tree biomass of 28% in moderately thinned stands (D grade: average residual basal area of 65-79% relative to the control plots) which was consistent with an observed loss of volume production. However, the inclusion of the amount of carbon exported off-site with harvested biomass reduced the decrease in stock to 4.8%. Nutrient concentrations in the forest floor increased in moderate thinned stands (P, K, Mg and Mn) or were unchanged (C, N and Fe). The selected thinning regime did not alter mineral soil condition. A decreasing pattern of Ca and Mn stocks with depth was consistent with a high reduction of nutrient concentration of elements and higher bulk density with depth. However K, Mg and Na showed stable stocks across depths because of a much smaller reduction of nutrient concentrations in deeper layers relative to the surface layer. We hypothesized that this stable pattern with soil depth was due to leaching. The sustainability of forest thinning is a trade-off between loss of standing biomass and increasing stand stability as long as other indicators, like soil condition, do not significantly change.

AB  - Rice nurseling seedlings were raised under temperature-controlled condition (32 degrees C) in darkness or with illumination of 500 lux (Exp.1) and 170 lux (Exp.2) by fluorescent lamp for 1, 2 and 4 days before the end of experiment to clarify the effects of light conditions during the nursery period (4 days) on the seedling characters, taking root and early growth after transplanting. Exp.2 included an additional plot in which the seedlings were raised under 32 degrees C with natural indoor light (Maximum:70 similar to 80 lux during daytime) through plastic panel of the incubator. 1) Rice nurseling seedlings with 2.1 similar to 2.3 plant age in leaf number, 7 similar to 8 cm in plant length and remained ca. 40% endosperm could be raised under 32 degrees C, irrespective of light conditions tested in this study. Plant age in leaf number of the seedlings was a little promoted by illumination during raising period. 2) Although the chlorophyll content of the seedlings increased with increasing light intensity, the effect of the illumination period (1 similar to 4 days) on that was scarcely detected. 3) The day of first tiller apperance, as an indicator of taking root, was faster in the seedlings raised under illumination, irrespective of the illumination intensity or period, than those under dark condition, and this result led to better early growth in those seedlings, especially in the case of removal of endosperm. 4) The results mentioned above showed that weak illumination, ranging from 100 to 500 lux, during the nursery period hardly inhibited elongation growth of the seedlings, and the suitable rice nurseling seedlings with a length of 7 similar to 8 cm for trasnsplanter and ca. 40% of the endosperm remaining could be raised under 32 degrees C with weak illumination for 4 days. Moreover, weak illumination promoted taking root and early growth of the seedlings due to the production of chlorophyll.

AB  - The increase of coverage of forest /vegetation is imperative to improve the environment in dry-land areas of China, especially for protecting soil against serious erosion and sandstorms. However, inherent severe water shortages, drought stresses, and increasing water use competition greatly restrict the reforestation. Notably, the water-yield reduction after afforestation generates intense debate about the correct approach to afforestation and forest management in dry-land areas. However, most studies on water-yield reduction of forests have been at catchment scales, and there are few studies of the response of total evapotranspiration (ET) and its partitioning to vegetation structure change. This motivates us to learn the linkage between hydrological processes and vegetation structure in slope ecosystems. Therefore, an ecohydrological study was carried out by measuring the individual items of water balance on sloping plots covered by different vegetation types in the semiarid Liupan Mountains of northwest China. The ratio of precipitation consumed as ET was about 60% for grassland, 93% for shrubs, and > 95% for forestland. Thus, the water yield was very low, site-specific, and sensitive to vegetation change. Conversion of grassland to forest decreased the annual water yield from slope by 50-100 mm. In certain periods, the plantations at lower slopes even consumed the runon from upper slopes. Reducing the density of forests and shrubs by thinning was not an efficient approach to minimize water use. Leaf area index was a better indicator than plant density to relate ET to vegetation structure and to evaluate the soil water carrying capacity for vegetation (i.e., the maximum amount of vegetation that can be supported by the available soil water for an extended time). Selecting proper vegetation types and plant species, based on site soil water condition, may be more effective than the forest density regulation to minimize water-yield reduction by vegetation coverage increase and notably by reforestation. Finally, the focuses in future research to improve the forest-water relations in dry-land areas are recommended as follows: vegetation growth dynamics driven by environment especially water conditions, coupling of ecological and hydrological processes, further development of distributed ecohydrological models, quantitative relation of ecowater quota of ecosystems with vegetation structures, multi-scaled evaluation of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation, and the development of widely applicable decision support tools.

AB  - For millennia, land use in the Mediterranean region has led to situations in which soil has been severely degraded showing high risks of erosion and impoverishment. Thus, the establishment of soil quality indices is considered to be of crucial importance in determining the state of degradation and recovery of soils. Soils from stable forest ecosystems have specific physical, chemical and biological properties due to the conditions in which they developed. Hence, modelling the balance established among different key soil properties from stable forest ecosystems could be used as a soil quality index, because disturbance practices lead to changes in that natural balance. Here we report the establishment of two soil quality indices under Mediterranean semiarid conditions for forest soils in SE Spain, based on the use of multiple linear regressions integrating different physical, chemical and biochemical properties. As we observed the strong influence that climatic factors have on the values of the different soil properties and their relationships, mean annual precipitation was also incorporated in the regression models as a categorical explanatory variable. Model 1, that explains 92% of the variance in soil organic carbon (SOC), showed that SOC can be calculated by a linear combination of 6 physical, chemical and biochemical properties (acid phosphatase, water holding capacity (WHC), electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorus (P), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and aggregate stability (AS)). Model 2 explains 89% of the variance in SOC, which can be calculated by means of 7 chemical and biochemical properties (urease, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities, pH, EC, P and CEC). Our results confirm that a balance exists between the soil organic carbon of high quality soils and some other properties widely recognised in soil quality assessments, due to their sensitivity and the information they provide about the functionality of soils. As disturbance practices should be accompanied by the loss of this balance, SOC calculated by the models (SOCc) is no longer an accurate estimation of the actual SOC determined in laboratory (SOCa). Thus, it is possible to obtain a soil quality index by the calculation of the model residuals: Soil Quality Index=model residual=SOCc-SOCa. For a non-disturbed soil, the soil quality index should be 0 (SOCc=SOCa). In contrast, for disturbed soils, SOCc should be lower or higher than the actual SOC, with values in the soil quality index < 0 or > 0. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The Western Cape Province of South Africa is characterized by Fynbos vegetation. This unique endemic vegetation type belongs to the Cape Floral Kingdom, the smallest of the six floral kingdoms in the world, and only a few provincial, national and private game reserves in this area currently support populations of African elephants (Loxodonta africana). As a result, not much is known about the ability of elephants to thrive in such a unique environment. External factors such as a nutritionally poor diet can be perceived as a stressor by mammals, and establishing links between these two factors was the focus of this study. The results of monitoring individual stress-related hormone levels and body conditions suggest that elephants can obtain adequate nutrition from Fynbos vegetation.
   Abstract Fynbos is a unique endemic vegetation type belonging to the Cape Floral Kingdom in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, representing the smallest of the six floral kingdoms in the world. Nowadays, only a few game reserves in this region support populations of African elephants (Loxodonta africana), and thus, little information exists regarding the suitability of the nutritionally poor Fynbos vegetation for these megaherbivores. Using already established non-invasive methods, the monitoring of individual body conditions and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations, as a measure of physiological stress, was performed to examine a herd of 13 elephants in a Western Cape Province Private Game Reserve, during two monitoring periods (April and June 2018), following a severe drought. The results indicate that overall median body condition scores (April and June: 3.0, range 2.0-3.0) and fGCM concentrations (April: 0.46 mu g/g dry weight (DW), range 0.35-0.66 mu g/g DW; June: 0.61 mu g/g DW, range 0.22-1.06 mu g/g DW) were comparable to those of other elephant populations previously studied utilizing the same techniques. These findings indicate that the individuals obtain sufficient nutrients from the surrounding Fynbos vegetation during the months monitored. However, a frequent assessment of body conditions and stress-associated fGCM concentrations in these animals would assist conservation management authorities and animal welfare practitioners in determining ways to manage this species in environments with comparably poorer nutritional vegetation.

AB  - Live imaging allows observations of cell structures and processes in real time, to monitor dynamic changes within living organisms compared to fixed organisms. Fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the dynamic infection process of the nematode parasitic bacteriumPasteuriasp. and the sugarcane root-lesion nematode,Pratylenchus zeae. Under fluorescence microscopy, green-autofluorescent globules were observed in live control andPasteuriasp.-infected nematodes. Only nematodes killed byPasteuriasp. or heat treated displayed a diffuse pattern of autofluorescence. Propidium iodide (PI), used as a cell membrane integrity indicator, confirmed that the nematode's cuticle acts as an impermeable barrier. PI stained cells/DNA of heat-treated control andPasteuriasp.-infectedP. zeae. PI as a counterstain facilitated the location ofPasteuriaendospores on the cuticle surface ofP. zeae. No PI staining was observed in sporangia and in endospores within the nematode body. However, PI specifically stained endospores on the cuticle surface and within the cuticle carcass showing, in mature propagules, a ring-like pattern. Live imaging, combined with fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent dyes such as PI, appears useful in live studies on plant nematode interactions with nematophagous bacteria.

AB  - Edible plants generally green leafy vegetables contain bioactive Phenolics and antioxidant principles which are important in maintaining the oxidative balance of the human body and are used widely as dietary supplements. Optimal extraction of such principles is the need of the hour for the nutraceutical industries. The work presents three innovative sample pretreatment such as providing additional heat to the thimble, use of microwave pretreated sample and pretreatment with acoustic waves. These modifications are intended to improve the working efficiency and output of traditional Soxhlet extraction and make it at par with modern extraction techniques. Extraction of plant phenolics/flavonoids from edible leaves of Amaranthus viridis Linn (Amaranthaceae) and their subsequent HPTLC mapping was used as the performance indicator. Check of nutraceutical and biological integrity upon application of such pretreatment methods was performed. SEM analysis was carried out to get a true inside of the exctraction events occurring internally. Such findings can be helpful for small scale industries who cannot afford costlier modern extraction methods. Four assumptions have been proposed which can be a critical in impriving any extraction method.

AB  - Andrew Ter Ern Loke has proffered a creative, novel, and bold model of the Incarnation as a contribution to analytic theological discussions of Christology. Recent work in this field has offered a distinction between abstract-nature and concrete-nature conceptions of natures. The former holds that entities have properties which entail their membership in a particular kind, the latter holds that being a member of a certain kind entails the having of certain properties. Loke's model, what he calls the Divine Preconscious Model, holds that at the Incarnation the divine attributes of the Word were submerged into the Word's preconscious, while the conscious of the Word took on certain human properties. This model, Loke holds, entails Christ's full divinity and full humanity without falling into Apollinarianism or Nestorianism. However, I argue that because Loke avers that his model runs on a concrete-nature account of natures, he is not able to maintain the full humanity of Christ. I suggest two ways Loke might be able to maintain the integrity of his model, either by embracing a form of neo-Apollinarianism or by adopting the abstract-nature perspective of natures.

AB  - The marginal marine environments of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) serve as an ideal natural laboratory to study how oceanographic and climatic variability influence coral-reef ecosystems. Reefs along the Pacific coast of Panama span a natural gradient of nutrients, pH, and temperature as a result of stronger seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Panama relative to the Gulf of Chiriqui. The ecosystems are not only influenced by spatial and seasonal variations in oceanography but are affected by the climatic variability of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Foraminifera can be robust indicators of ecosystem condition because the composition of their assemblages and the geochemistry of their tests can change rapidly in response to environmental variability. We studied benthic foraminifera in sediment samples collected from 3 m below mean sea level in the Gulf of Panama and the Gulf of Chiriqui. Temperature loggers deployed from 2016 to 2019 showed that average temperatures were lower and more variable in the Gulf of Panama due to seasonal upwelling. All sites in both gulfs were dominated by heterotrophic foraminifera, which was likely the result of nutrient enrichment due to upwelling, combined with ENSO effects. However, the Gulf of Chiriqui was characterized by higher abundances of symbiont-bearing foraminifera than the Gulf of Panama. The orders Miliolida and Rotaliida dominated the foraminiferal assemblages in both gulfs, with Quinqueloculina and Rosalina being the most abundant genera in the two orders, respectively. Miliolids were less abundant in the Gulf of Panama than in the Gulf of Chiriqui, whereas rotaliid densities were not significantly different between the two gulfs. Lower pH in the Gulf of Panama as a result of upwelling may have contributed to the lower abundance of miliolids, which secrete tests of high-magnesium calcite. Geochemical analysis of tests of the symbiont-bearing miliolid Sorites marginalis revealed that foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios were lower in the Gulf of Panama than in the Gulf of Chiriqui. The offset in foraminiferal Mg/Ca is consistent with the lower mean annual temperature observed in the Gulf of Panama due to stronger seasonal upwelling. Because the geochemistry and assemblages of foraminifera reflect differences in environmental conditions, they could potentially be used in tandem with coral proxies to reconstruct past environmental change and project the future of coral-reef systems within the ETP.

AB  - Background: Regulated cell death plays an essential role in various biological processes, leading to the development of a number of methods to detect and quantitatively measure cells exhibiting decreased viability due to either apoptosis or necrosis.
   Methods and results: When cytotoxicity is induced by anti-cancer chemicals, human cell lines exhibit specific features, including dampened cell proliferation and lost plasma membrane asymmetry, presenting distinct sensitivity. In this study, we report a set of novel digital PCR (dPCR) assays to quantitatively measure the degree of cell death. These dPCR assays are designed to quantify targets of increasing sizes within the RNase P (RP) gene locus. The ratio between short and long target copy numbers implies the degree of DNA fragmentation, which we name the RP fragmentation index.
   Conclusions: Compared to other conventional quantitative methods, the RP fragmentation index using cellular DNA represents a valid indicator in the measurement of the degree of cell death.
   General significance: The demonstrated dPCR assays can precisely assess DNA fragmentation that quantitatively reflects the degree of cytotoxicity.

AB  - Despite the large number of ponds scattered across the landscape, there is still insufficient recognition of their functioning. This would require the development of methods for assessing this type of aquatic ecosystem, based on their environmental specificity. Even though conditions are potentially homogenic in small and shallow water bodies, macrophytes divide the area into diverse microhabitats. Therefore, we hypothesized that the type of habitat (the open water vs. various macrophytes) may have a considerable structuring effect on functional groups, such as life-forms (pelagic and littoral) or trophic-associated rotifers, confirming their great suitability for environmental studies. Sixty three ponds, with 136 sites located within the open water, helophytes and elodeids, were analysed. Eutrophic rotifers showed a similar response to environmental factors and were linked to a certain type of habitat as was the whole pelagic community, while mesotrophic rotifers, which ecologically also belong to the pelagic community, responded in the same way as the littoral community and species diversity. The first group of rotifer indices, pelagic rotifers and their eutrophic fraction prevailed in the open water of fishstock large-surfaced ponds. However, the second group consisting of littoral rotifers along with overall species diversity and mesotrophic fraction, increased concurrently with the presence of crustaceans in small-surfaced ponds overshaded by nymphaeids and pleustophytes. The presence of elodeids in ponds, particularly Ceratophyllum and Chara, with the highest complexity (plant biomass), apart from increasing the diversity and share of littoral rotifers, reduced the occurrence of eutrophic rotifers and increased that of mesotrophic ones. This confirms the viability of using certain trophic indicators for water quality prediction in ponds. While elodeids were of the greatest importance, helophytes did not impact rotifer distribution, having no indicative value for quality state assessment in ponds. We demonstrate that a functional approach, taking into account rotifer life forms (pelagic vs. littoral community), may serve as a valuable tool for environmental analyses in case of small water bodies. Rotifer indices revealed not only a prevalence towards a particular type of habitat but they also selectively chose certain species of macrophyte beds, which suggests that for conservation purposes a highly complex cover of elodeids should be maintained to improve the ecological value of ponds.

AB  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the Southern High Plains (SHP) is known to play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health by reducing soil erosion. However, the restoration of soil biological health (biological community and its function) over time under CRP have not been clearly elucidated. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in the soil microbial community composition using a CRP chronosequence. Soil samples (0-10 cm and 10-30 cm) were collected in 2012 and 2014 from 26 fields across seven counties within the SHP and included seven croplands (representing 0 y in CRP), 16 CRP fields of varying ages (8-28 y as of 2014), plus three rangelands (representing no disturbance for > 30 y). Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the impacts of CRP restoration on soil microbial biomass. Shifts in soil microbial community composition, according to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles, with increasing CRP restoration years were explored using multivariate ordination. Total microbial biomass (using total FAME content as a proxy) increased with CRP years at 10-30 cm in 2012 and both depths in 2014. Although different environmental conditions were present during the two sampling years (2012 followed a record extreme drought in 2011 with conditions improving in 2014), the physiological stress of microbial community indicated by ratios of saturated to monounsaturated FAME biomarkers consistently decreased with CRP restoration years in both sampling years and both depths. A shift in microbial community composition was measured during CRP restoration at 0-10 cm in both sampling years (and at 10-30 cm in 2012) with an increase in relative fungal abundance through the initial 15 y of CRP and then a decline after 15 y. The overall increase in soil microbial biomass and decrease in microbial physiological stress indicators with increasing years under CRP illustrates how this is a valuable restoration program for building soil health in fragile, sandy SHP soils. The mechanisms underlying the decline in fungal abundance in years 15-28 are unclear and the associated reduction in the fungal to bacterial ratio does not necessarily reflect reduced soil health. Overall, the CRP program is an effective restoration practice in the SHP that can restore overall soil biological attributes including microbial biomass, re-establish the soil microbial community with decreased microbial physiological stress, and improve soil microbial functions related to C sequestration.

AB  - Aim Because intertidal organisms often live close to their physiological tolerance limits, they are potentially sensitive indicators of climate-driven changes in the environment. The goals of this study were to assess the effect of climatic and non-climatic factors on the geographical distribution of intertidal macroalgae, and to predict future distributions under different climate-warming scenarios. Location North-western Iberian Peninsula, southern Europe. Methods We developed distribution models for six ecologically important intertidal seaweed species. Occurrence and microhabitat data were sampled at 1-km2 resolution and analysed with climate variables measured at larger spatial scales. We used generalized linear models and applied the deviance and Bayesian information criterion to model the relationship between environmental variables and the distribution of each target species. We also used hierarchical partitioning (HP) to identify predictor variables with higher independent explanatory power. Results The distributions of Himanthalia elongata and Bifurcaria bifurcata were correlated with measures of terrestrial and marine climate, although in opposite directions. Model projections under two warming scenarios indicated the extinction of the former at a faster rate in the Cantabrian Sea (northern Spain) than in the Atlantic (west). In contrast, these models predicted an increase in the occurrence of B. bifurcata in both areas. The occurrences of Ascophyllum nodosum and Pelvetia canaliculata, species showing rather static historical distributions, were related to specific non-climatic environmental conditions and locations, such as the location of sheltered sites. At the southernmost distributional limit, these habitats may present favourable microclimatic conditions or provide refuges from competitors or natural enemies. Model performances for Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus were similar and poor, but several climatic variables influenced the occurrence of the latter in the HP analyses. Main conclusions The correlation between species distributions and climate was evident for two species, whereas the distributions of the others were associated with non-climatic predictors. We hypothesize that the distribution of F. serratus responds to diverse combinations of factors in different sections of the north-west Iberian Peninsula. Our study shows how the response of species distributions to climatic and non-climatic variables may be complex and vary geographically. Our analyses also highlight the difficulty of making predictions based solely on variation in climatic factors measured at coarse spatial scales.

AB  - Changes in benthic macrofaunal communities are indicative of environmental stressors, including eutrophication and hypoxia. However, some species are sensitive not only to hypoxia but also to various environmental contaminants. We tested which of the environmental predictors (sediment organic carbon, sediment concentrations of metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], bottom water oxygen, salinity, temperature, and surface chlorophyll-a concentration) that best explained the following response variables: (1) macrofauna community composition, (2) abundance of a benthic sentinel species, the amphipod Monoporeia affinis; and (3) the Benthic Quality Index (BQI). All data originated from 29 reference monitoring stations in the Baltic Sea and the statistical tests included both uni- and multivariate analyses. The community composition and BQI were best explained by the same combination of salinity, depth, temperature and PAH concentrations. The abundance of M. affinis, which is sensitive to hypoxia and chemical exposure, was best explained by PAHs as a single predictor. Our findings suggest that benthic communities in the Baltic Sea are influenced by anthropogenic contaminants, which should be taken into account when benthos is used for eutrophication status assessment.

AB  - The effects of solid organic wastes from a marine fish farm on sediments were tested using benthic community as ecological indicators and biomarkers in native clam (Scrobicularia plana) as biochemical indicators. The benthic fauna and clam samples were collected in the intertidal sediment in October 2010 from five sites of the Rio San Pedro (RSP) creek, following a gradient of contamination from the aquaculture effluent to the control site. Numbers of species, abundance, richness and Shannon diversity were the biodiversity indicators measured in benthic fauna. Morphological and reproduction status of clams were assessed using the condition factor and gonado-somatic index, respectively. Phase I and Phase II detoxification enzymatic activities (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST)), antioxidant enzymatic activities (glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR)) and oxidative stress parameters (Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) and DNA strand breaks) were measured in clams' digestive gland tissues. In parallel, temperature and salinity in the adjacent water, redox potential, pH and organic matter in sediment, and dissolved oxygen in the interstitial water were measured. The results suggested that RSP showed a spatial gradient characterised by hypoxia/anoxia, reduced potential, acidic conditions and high organic enrichment in sediments at the most contaminated sites. Significant (p<0.05) decrease of biodiversity indicators were observed in the areas impacted by the aquaculture discharges. Biomarkers did not show a clear pattern and of all biochemical responses tested, GPX, DNA damage and LPO were the most sensitive ones and showed significant (p<0.05) increase in the polluted sites. Benthic biodiversity indicators were significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with pH, redox potential and dissolved oxygen and negatively correlated with organic matter. On the contrary, antioxidant enzymatic responses (GPX) and oxidative stress parameters were significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with those physico-chemical parameters. It has been demonstrated that effluents from fish aquaculture activities in Rio San Pedro creek may produce an alteration of physicochemical characteristics of seabed and induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in soft-sediment species which may lead to changes of the benthic population structure and health status of the exposed organisms.

AB  - Submarine ocean outfalls are commonly used for the disposal of partially treated effluents in coastal cities. Typically, the greatest environmental risk caused by toxic substances occurs in the near field of the outfall discharge. The ecological impact of the effluent varies greatly under different discharge and environmental conditions that are characterized by both regular and stochastic variations. For a comprehensive environmental risk assessment of a coastal discharge, it is necessary to determine both the likelihood and severity of the adverse effects on the biological community. We present the first integrated stochastic (Monte Carlo) environmental risk assessment of a major coastal sewage outfall discharge the Stonecutters Island outfall of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) in Hong Kong. Unionized ammonia (NH3) is used as the target pollutant. To accurately envisage the ambient concentrations of NH3, a Lagrangian jet model (JETLAG/VISJET) is used to analyze pollutant concentrations in the near field of the outfall. The environmental conditions are simulated from 3D hydrodynamic model simulations over a 4 month period for typical wet and dry seasons. Statistical characteristics of the effluent discharge and receiving water temperature are derived from field data. The probability distribution of predicted exposure concentrations (EC) is generated from this integrated simulation. A species sensitivity distribution, which represents a statistical distribution of threshold sublethal effects levels or benchmark concentrations (BC) for various marine organisms is constructed using available chronic toxicity data. The environmental risk of NH3 on the marine community is characterized by computing statistical distributions of Hazard Quotient (HQ = ECIBC) using Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that the probability of HQ > 1 for HATS Stage 1 (1.6 million m(3)/day sewage treated with chemically enhanced primary treatment) is around 0.11 for wet season but just about 0.06 for the dry season. The risk increases by about 10% to 0.08-0.13 with additional sewage loads of 0.8 million m(3)/day at the same level of treatment (HATS Stage 2A). With an upgrade to secondary treatment (HATS Stage 2B), the probability will be reduced to 0.03-0.05. Compared to the use of "worst case" scenarios or point pollution threshold estimates, the present method offers a more holistic ecological assessment, and is much less sensitive to arbitrary choice of model parameters. The present risk assessment approach can be readily extended to the accurate determination of mixing zones based on statistical evaluation of ecological risks.

AB  - Black spruce (Picea mariana) peatlands play important ecologic and economic roles in the temperate-boreal region of North America, providing a valuable timber resource while also performing important ecosystem functions. Climate models project decreases in the amount of snowfall received throughout the temperate-boreal region by 2100, as average wintertime temperatures increase. We used a paired-plot experimental design to assess the effect of snow removal on soil temperature and frost development at six forested peatland sites in northern Minnesota, USA, during the three winters from 2017 to 2020. Treatments consisted of 1) removal of snow throughout the winter, or 2) ambient snow cover conditions. During the three years of the study, there was a significant effect of snow removal by mid-winter that continued into late winter and spring, where removal of snow increased soil frost depth compared to plots with ambient snow cover treatment. Soil temperatures in the removal plots were highly responsive to air temperature fluctuations to depths of 20 cm or more, whereas the ambient snow cover soils exhibited little fluctuation and degrees maintained temperatures near or above 0 C for much of the winter season. We found that each cumulative freezing degree day resulted in an average of 0.36 cm of soil frost development in snow removal plots, as compared to 0.07 cm depth in the ambient treatment plots. Soils were significantly colder through much of the summer growing season in the removal treatment compared to the ambient treatment, with detectable soil frost in the soil profile as late as mid- to late-June. These results indicate that predicted changes in wintertime precipitation may result in increased development of soil frost in forested peatland systems, although some of this effect may be offset by predicted concurrent increases in air temperature. We did not measure indicators of biological activity, but the large and prolonged reduction in soil temperature with snow removal is likely to depress biological activity throughout the growing season and the many ecosystem functions it influences. Because of the role that soil temperature and frost play on the hydrologic and ecological processes of peatlands, as well as the crucial role of soil frost in peatland forest management, findings of this study provide important insight into the potential effects of altered winter conditions on these expansive and ecologically important ecosystems.

AB  - In the present review, we compiled and evaluated the available information supporting the assessment of population and community recovery after pesticide application. This information is crucial for the environmental risk assessment of pesticides. We reviewed more than 3900 manuscripts on those organism groups relevant or likely to become relevant for the risk assessment procedures in Europe, that is, aquatic invertebrates, algae, aquatic plants, fish, aquatic microbes, amphibians, as well as birds and mammals, non-target terrestrial arthropods including honeybees, non-arthropod invertebrates, terrestrial microbes, non-target terrestrial plants, nematodes, and reptiles. Finally, 106 aquatic and 76 terrestrial studies met our selection criteria and were evaluated in detail. We extracted the following general conclusions. (i) Internal recovery depends strongly on reproduction capacity. For aquatic invertebrates, recovery was generally observed within a maximum of five generation times. (ii) In cases where recovery occurred within one generation, migration from uncontaminated areas was identified as the main pathway for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, in particular, for insect species with the ability for aerial recolonization. (iii) Community composition in general did not recover within the study duration in the majority of cases. (iv) The ecological context, including factors such as food resources, habitat quality, and recolonization potential, is a crucial factor for recovery from pesticide effects. (v) Indirect effects acting through food chain processes, including predation and competition, are highly relevant for increasing the magnitude of effect and for prolonging recovery time. Based on our findings, we recommend defining realistic scenarios for risk assessment regarding exposure, taxa considered, environmental conditions, and ecological context. In addition to experimental studies, field monitoring was shown to yield valuable information to identify relevant taxa, long-term effects, and the conditions for recovery, and should therefore be considered to validate approaches of risk assessment. Likewise, ecological modelling was found to be a valuable tool for assessing recovery. Finally, both study design and interpretation of results still often suffer from missing ecological information or from neglect of the available knowledge. Hence, a more rigorous utilization of existing knowledge (e.g., from general disturbance ecology) and the generation of systematic ecological knowledge on the various factors influencing recovery are needed.

AB  - Partially protected areas are now the dominant global form of spatial management aimed at preserving ecosystem integrity and managing human use. However, most evaluations of their efficacy use only a narrow set of conservation indicators that reflect a fraction of ways in which protection can succeed or fail. In this paper, we examine three case studies of partially protected coral reef fishery systems to evaluate benefits and risks of their use as a management tool. We use data from community-based management arrangements in three Pacific Island countries to demonstrate three vignettes of how partial protection can boost fisheries production, enhance the ease with which fishers catch their prey, and alter the composition of fisheries yields. These changes in fisheries productivity, catchability, and vulnerability under partial protection carry substantial benefits for fishers. However, they also carry significant risks for ecosystems and fisheries livelihoods unless adaptively managed so as to confer the short to medium term benefits in resource performance without risking longer term sustainability.

AB  - Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) have numerous advantages as indicators of environmental quality. A quality assessment index for bryophyte species assemblages (BQAI) was developed for the State of Ohio, USA. Reliable identification of bryophytes to species often requires considerable training, practice, and time. In contrast, reliable identification to genera for most bryophytes in Ohio requires much less training. We identified 110 bryophyte species (14 liverworts and 96 mosses) belonging to 69 genera (13 liverwort and 56 moss) in 45 wetlands (27 emergent, 13 forested, and 5 shrub) in Ohio. As expected, there were more genera and higher BQAI scores in forested than in emergent wetlands. Number of genera was highly correlated (r a parts per thousand yen 0.9) with BQAI in emergent and forested wetlands and for the combined set of wetlands. Number of genera and BQAI responded almost identically to an index of wetland disturbance. The results suggest that number of genera has potential as a screening tool for assessing bryophyte community quality in wetlands in some regions.

AB  - The concept of species sensitivity differences is important in ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment, but testing usually focuses on lethality of toxicants. The effects on the suborganismal level are mostly ignored; therefore, the present study assessed a biomarker of venotoxicity (the alkaline comet assay) to compare species sensitivities. Five earthworm species (Amynthas diffringens, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Dendrodrilus rubidus, Eisenia fetida and Microchaetus benhami) were exposed for 48 It to sublethal concentrations of cadmium sulphate in reconstituted soil water and DNA integrity was evaluated with the parameter Tail DNA %. Significant amounts of DNA damage were detected in three (A. caliginosa, D. rubidus and E fetida) species. E fetida exhibited the highest level of DNA damage, although D. rubidus showed the highest increase (3-fold) in DNA damage from the control. All exposed earthworms accumulated Cd. although body loads did not correspond with DNA damage levels; most of the Cd was probably sequestrated and rendered harmless. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) pollution is a pervasive water quality issue in the USA for small streams and rivers. The effect of nutrients on the biotic condition of streams is often evaluated with biological indicators such as macroinvertebrate assemblages or periphyton assemblages, particularly diatoms. Molecular approaches facilitate the use of periphyton assemblages as bioindicators because periphyton is diverse and its composition as a whole, rather than just diatoms, soft-bodied algae, or any single group, may convey additional information about responses to nutrients. To further develop the concept that a taxonomically-broad evaluation of periphyton assemblages could be useful for developing stream bioindicators, we examined microbial assemblage composition with both 16S and 18S rRNA genes, enabling us to evaluate composition in 3 domains. We measured otherwise unknown nutrient responses of different periphyton groups in situ with experiments that used glass fiber filters to allow diffusion of amended nutrients into a stream. We deployed these experimental setups in 2 streams that differ in the extent of agricultural land-use in their catchments in the southeastern USA. Experiments consisted of controls, N amendments, P amendments, and both N and P amendments. Periphyton assemblages that grew on the filters differed significantly by stream, date or season, and nutrient treatment. Assemblage differences across treatments were more consistent among Bacteria and Archaea than among eukaryotes. Effects of nutrient amendments were more pronounced in the stream with less agricultural land use and, therefore, lower nutrient loading than in the stream with more agricultural land use and higher nutrient loading. Combined N and P amendments decreased species richness and evenness for Bacteria and Archaea by similar to 36 and similar to 9%, respectively, compared with controls. Indicator species analysis revealed that specific clades varied in their response to treatments. Indicators based on the responses of these indicator clades were related to nutrient treatments across sites and seasons. Analyses that included all the taxa in a domain did not resolve differences in responses to N vs P. Instead, better resolution was achieved with an analysis focused on diatoms, which responded more strongly to P than N. Overall, our results showed that in situ nutrient-diffusing substrate experiments are a useful approach for describing assemblage responses to nutrients in streams. This type of molecular approach may be useful to environmental agencies and stakeholders responsible for assessing and managing stream water quality and biotic condition.

AB  - Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) are a widely used metric in plant ecology comprising a semi-quantitative description of species' ecological requirements. Typically, point estimates of mean EIV scores are compared over space or time to infer differences in the environmental conditions structuring plant communitiesparticularly in resurvey studies where no historical environmental data are available. However, the use of point estimates as a basis for inference does not take into account variance among species EIVs within sampled plots and gives equal weighting to means calculated from plots with differing numbers of species. Traditional methods are also vulnerable to inaccurate estimates where only incomplete species lists are available.We present a set of multilevel (hierarchical) modelsfitted with and without group-level predictors (e.g., habitat type)to improve precision and accuracy of plot mean EIV scores and to provide more reliable inference on changing environmental conditions over spatial and temporal gradients in resurvey studies. We compare multilevel model performance to GLMMs fitted to point estimates of mean EIVs. We also test the reliability of this method to improve inferences with incomplete species lists in some or all sample plots. Hierarchical modeling led to more accurate and precise estimates of plot-level differences in mean EIV scores between time-periods, particularly for datasets with incomplete records of species occurrence. Furthermore, hierarchical models revealed directional environmental change within ecological habitat types, which less precise estimates from GLMMs of raw mean EIVs were inadequate to detect. The ability to compute separate residual variance and adjusted R-2 parameters for plot mean EIVs and temporal differences in plot mean EIVs in multilevel models also allowed us to uncover a prominent role of hydrological differences as a driver of community compositional change in our case study, which traditional use of EIVs would fail to reveal. Assessing environmental change underlying ecological communities is a vital issue in the face of accelerating anthropogenic change. We have demonstrated that multilevel modeling of EIVs allows for a nuanced estimation of such from plant assemblage data changes at local scales and beyond, leading to a better understanding of temporal dynamics of ecosystems. Further, the ability of these methods to perform well with missing data should increase the total set of historical data which can be used to this end.

AB  - The present paper aims to predict distortions and residual stresses in thick plate weld joints of austenitic stainless steel material prepared by automatic hot wire gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process and narrow gap technique using finite element analysis (FEA). The prediction has been validated by carrying out experiments. The variables considered in welding of plate joints are narrow groove configuration, high deposition rate leading to lower heat input (hot wire GTAW), and stress relieving treatment. A suitable stress-relieving treatment has been proposed for relaxing residual stresses and preventing sensitization of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the ASS weld joint. Predicted and experimental results of temperature distribution, distortions, and residual stresses were found to be in good agreement. The applicability of prediction of residual stresses for higher weld thicknesses has also been verified. The nature of residual stresses across thickness has also been compared with that given in Structural Integrity Assessment Procedures for European Industry (SINTAP) and BS 7910 standards. Details of the above finding are discussed in this paper.

AB  - In this study, the physiological response of a sensitive lichen species (Evernia prunastri) exposed for three months in a complex urban area (Milan, Italy) was evaluated in order to verify if the air pollution abatement measures adopted over the years resulted in a suitable air quality for the survival of this sensitive species. Parameters investigated rely on the photosynthetic activity of the photobiont (Fv/Fm, PIabs, and OJIP curves), damage to mycobiont (membrane damage and antiradical activity), and the production of secondary metabolites involved in the protective functions of the organisms. Results showed that although air quality in Milan still suffers from heavy pollution from PM and NOx, the overall situation is not as severe as to induce the death of this sensitive biomonitor, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, the vital status of the samples exposed in the study area showed a significant impairment compared to that of samples exposed in a control area, indicating that the current air quality in Milan still prevents the optimal survival of E. prunastri.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems offer many valuable services to human societies. Easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive and efficient assessment and monitoring methods that investigate ecosystem integrity need to be developed for their conservation and protection. Such tools are the bio-indicators, with many recommending the Odonata (dragonflies) as a very appropriate indicator. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the potential of utilizing diversity indices on Odonata species for riverine habitats in Greece. The studied areas were along Sperchios River, Thermopyles spring and Kakavorema stream, located in Sperchios River Basin (Central Greece). The analysis based on the number of different species and three diversity indices, found differences among the three habitats. Sperchios River had the highest biodiversity and Thermopyles spring the lowest. This was also indicated by the water quality parameters and riparian area widths measured. Overall the differences found in these three habitats indicate the potential usefulness of Odonata for evaluating riverine habitats in Greece and the Balkans.

AB  - Halite deposits from the hyperarid zone of the Atacama Desert reveal the presence of endolithic microbial colonization dominated by cyanobacteria associated with heterotrophic bacteria and archaea. Using the lambda-scan confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) option, this study examines the autofluorescence emission spectra produced by single cyanobacterial cells found inside halite rocks and by their photosynthetic pigments. Photosynthetic pigments could be identified according to the shapes of the emission spectra and wavelengths of fluorescence peaks. According to their fluorescence fingerprints, three groups of cyanobacterial cells were identified within this natural extreme microhabitat: (i) cells producing a single fluorescence peak corresponding to the emission range of phycobiliproteins and chlorophyll a, (ii) cells producing two fluorescence peaks within the red and green signal ranges, and (iii) cells emitting only low-intensity fluorescence within the nonspecific green fluorescence signal range. Photosynthetic pigment fingerprints emerged as indicators of the preservation state or viability of the cells. These observations were supported by a cell plasma membrane integrity test based on Sytox Green DNA staining and by transmission electron microscopy ultrastructural observations of cyanobacterial cells.

AB  - Marsh birds (rallids, bitterns, and grebes) depend on emergent wetlands, and habitat loss and degradation are the primary suspected causes for population declines among many marsh bird species. We evaluated the effect of natural wetland characteristics, wetland management practices, and surrounding landscape characteristics on marsh bird occupancy in Illinois during late spring and early summer 2015-2017. We conducted call-back surveys following the North American Standardized Marsh Bird Survey Protocol three times annually at all sites (2015 n = 49, 2016 n = 57, 2017 n = 55). Across all species and groups, detection probability declined 7.1% +/- 2.1 each week during the marsh bird survey period. Wetlands managed for waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) had greater occupancy than reference wetlands. Marsh bird occupancy increased with greater wetland complexity, intermediate levels of waterfowl management intensity, greater proportions of surface water inundation, and greater proportions of persistent emergent vegetation cover. Wetland management practices that retain surface water during the growing season, encourage perennial emergent plants (e.g., Typha sp.), and increase wetland complexity could be used to provide habitat suitable for waterfowl and marsh birds.

AB  - The organism physiological systems forming a hierarchic network with mutual dependence and subordination can be considered as systems with non-linear dynamics including positive and negative feedbacks. In the course of evolution there occurred selection of robust, flexible, modular systems capable for adaptive self-organization by non-linear interaction of components, which leads to formation of the ordered in space and time robust and plastic organization of the whole. Cells of multicellular organisms are capable for coordinated "social" behavior with formation of ordered cell assemblies, which provides a possibility of morphological and functional variability correlating with manifestations of the large spectrum of adaptive reactions. The multicellular organism is the multilevel system with hierarchy of numerous subsystems capable for adaptive self-organization; disturbance of their homeostasis can lead to pathological changes. The healthy organism regulates homeostasis, self-renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells serving its parts and construction blocks by preserving its integrity and controlling behavior of cells. The systemic approach taking into account biological regularities of the appearance and development of functions in evolution of multicellular organisms opens new possibilities for diagnostics and treatment of many diseases.

AB  - Based on the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, a macroinvertebrate-based assessment system to evaluate the ecological quality of streams has been developed by AQEM project consortium. In the Czech Republic the impact of organic pollution was principal pressure studied, but some morphological degradation of some sampling sites could not be avoided. A multimetric assessment system for three stream types was developed. Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used for the detection of the response of macroinvertebrate communities to the gradient of organic degradation. Significant relationships between abiotic (BOD, TOC, nutrients) and biotic (saprobic index, ASPT) indicators of organic enrichment/eutrophication were identified. Separate storage of the riffle and pool components of each multi-habitat sample allowed differences between these habitats to be compared in context of the metrics applied in the assessment system. Lotic and lentic habitats differed in taxonomic composition, ecological traits and biotic indices. The separate assessment of the riffle and pool parts of samples provides additional useful information when combined effects of organic pollution and morphological degradation are to be considered.

AB  - As a major tributary of the Nyl River, and ultimately for the Nylsvley wetland, the Olifantspruit, Limpopo province, South Africa, was investigated during the summer (high flow) and winter (low flow) of 2007 at three sites. This preliminary study used physical and biological indicators to determine the quality of the water that ultimately flows into Nylsvley. Significant seasonal differences were found. The observed differences relate to habitat structural differences and human activities in the catchment. Key findings included higher water temperatures during the high-flow period than during the low-flow period. The higher temperatures were accompanied by lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen at all sites. In total, 13 fish species were recorded, with most being found in the pool biotopes. The Nantes site, located nearest to the Nylsvley wetland, had the highest number of fish species, possibly indicating a linkage between these two systems. The most common macroinvertebrate families were the Baetidae, Aeshnidae and Coenagrionidae. It can be assumed that this river acts as an important refuge area for fish and macroinvertebrates from the Nyl River, and therefore it is important to conserve the Olifantspruit.

AB  - We used a geographic information system (GIS) and logistic regression to investigate relationships between geomorphology and Castor canadensis (North American beaver) impoundment of lower-order, blackwater streams of a Southeastern landscape. Using GIS, we divided streams into 632 500-m reaches and measured a set of geomorphic variables for each reach. Beavers were most likely to impound stream reaches crossed by roads with a gradient of approximate to 0.6 to 1.2% and watershed sizes of approximate to 2500 ha; reaches with watershed sizes < approximate to 500 ha or > 5000 ha were almost completely avoided. Gradient and road crossings contributed little to discrimination among impounded and unimpounded reaches, suggesting these variables had relatively small influences on beaver impoundment when compared to stream size. Our results indicate that GIS and geomorphic variables can be used to model the impoundment of streams over larger areas (e.g., the proportion of third-order watersheds impounded), but are less accurate at predicting the impoundment of individual reaches. However, the temporal dynamics of impoundment creation and abandonment will need to be incorporated into region-specific models before they can be used in ecosystem integrity assessment.

AB  - A site specific evaluation of geological barriers is required for landfills and waste repositories. The waste-repository-rock system has to be taken into consideration for this. Since the geotechnical barrier in conjunction with geological barriers contributes considerably to long-term isolation of the harmful substances from the biosphere, it is absolutely necessary to use engineering geology and hydrogeological methods far a quantitative assessment of the barrier effect of the host rock and the geological environment. For a waste disposal mine, the load-bearing capacity of the rock, the protective properties of the surrounding rock formations and the geological stability of the area are important factors in a safety analysis, of which the geotechnical stability analysis is an important part. Such an analysis comprises an engineering geological study of the site, laboratory and in situ experiments and model calculations, long-term monitoring, and special geological and geochemical investigations. Existing geomechanical modelling techniques provide a useful tool to perform barrier integrity calculations and to design an underground disposal mine. As an example, the barrier performance of the rock salt of the Gorleben salt dome is demonstrated using various safety indicators.

AB  - Wetland hydro-ecology is a key research field for ecologists, hydrologists and wetland investigators to quantify the relationship between wetland ecological patterns and hydrological mechanisms. Existence and functioning of wetlands is crucial for adjacent terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Hydro-ecological research promotes both protection and restoration of healthy natural wetlands by further understanding the biophysical characteristics of wetland habitats. This study establishes a wetland hydro-ecological model with the methodological support from geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). It conceptualises a cause-effect chain interface from the real wetland ecosystem. GIS and computer modelling methods are used to generate the hydrological indicators based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). By interpreting multi-temporal RS images, we produce wetland classification information and various landscape indices. Both hydrological and landscape indicators are used to integrate the hydro-ecological analysis with some multidisciplinary analysis methods.
   For the application of the wetland hydro-ecological model, we present a case study in an inland floodplain wetland within the scale of a catchment. The study site is the Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR), a Ramsar-designated site on the Sanjiang Plain in Northeast China. The multi-temporal Landsat TM 7 images and a DEM of the study area at finer scale are used to generate the various indicators of the wetland biophysical habitats. Field monitoring data of hydrology and ecology are used to calibrate the generated digital information. Our hydro-ecological analysis presents two significant results by coupling the wetland landscape ecology into hydrological units: (1) the constitutions of the wetland communities (an ensemble of plants that are specially equipped to live in soggy conditions) in the riverine or non-riverine biophysical habitats are clearly different in HNNR. The patch area and numbers of wetland communities increased from the forestry communities, the bush communities, the meadow communities through to the marshes in a good moisture gradient within the riverine zone, while the predominant patch area and number replaced by the transitional meadow communities beyond the riverine zone; (2) the flood water plays a key role on controlling the distribution of the wetland communities in HNNR. The predominant distribution of typical marsh communities in the yearly saturated zone exchanged into the larger distribution of the wet meadow in the seasonal saturated zone, and then finally replaced by the predominant distribution of the wet meadow in the yearly unsaturated zone. Furthermore, a cluster analysis for quantitative spatial characteristics of wetland distribution shows the numerical difference between marshes and non-marshes biophysical habitats in the core HNNR.

AB  - There is inadequate morphological nomenclature and definition of organ pathology when using wild fish in biomonitoring of environmental pollution. The aim of this investigation was to provide a guide that assesses histology of Shorthorn (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and Fourhorn (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) sculpins obtained from a study using these two fish species as bioindicator organisms to evaluate environmental impact attributed to a dumpsite located in East Greenland. Specific histopathological lesions were quantified on the basis of Bernet etal. and all lesions were photomicrographed, evaluated, and placed into specific categories of five reaction patterns. These were circulatory disturbances, regressive changes, progressive alterations, inflammation, and tumors based on anatomical location, type, and severity. This method is postulated to enable an objective assessment of the histological integrity of fish gills and liver; thus, making it possible to compare sculpin pathology and reaction patterns at different locations. Data suggest that this updated histological guide might be used for identification and quantification of histological lesions when applying sculpins in biomonitoring programs in Greenland and other Arctic regions.

AB  - In the last few years, awareness in developed countries has increased regarding the importance of urban watercourses as essential natural resources for human well being. Macroinvertebrates have been used as bioindicators to complement physico-chemical evaluation of water quality after environmental perturbations. The city of Manaus is closely associated with the Amazonian rain forest and with its dense hydrographic network. Any perturbation, such as deforestation and/or water pollution in the city's streams, therefore causes changes in the local ecosystem as the population increases. In this study, 65 streams were sampled in October and November 2003. Samples were taken from stream-bed sediment in the center of the channel and litter/sediment at the edge of the stream. Deforestation, total Nitrogen (TN), total Phosphorus (TP), depth, width, electrical conductivity, temperature and dissolved Oxygen (DO) were measured. A total of 115,549 specimens were collected, distributed among 152 taxa. Oligochaeta, Chironomus, Psychodidae and Ceratopogonidae were the taxa with the greatest frequencies of occurrence and the highest total abundances. Higher deforestation, TN and TP were correlated with lower DO and greater electrical conductivity, pH and water temperature. Deforestation, TN and TP were not associated with water velocity and stream width. Depth was the only variable correlated (negatively) with deforestation and not correlated with TN and TP. Greater deforestation, TN and TP were correlated with lower richness of taxa; but these variables did not affect abundance. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordenated the streams into two groups; the majority of the streams were in the group with high levels of deforestation and with high values of TP, TN, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature, where the macroinvertebrates were reduced to a few taxa. The other group was composed of streams that were well oxygenated and deep, where richness of taxa was higher. These results indicate changes in community composition in response to changes in environmental conditions. The highest taxa correlation was with streams that were well oxygenated and had the greatest depth and water velocity. Species Indicator Analysis identified 29 taxa as indicators of nonimpacted streams, 16 as indicators of deforested streams and three as indicators of streams impacted by deforestation and domestic sewage. Of the total sampled streams, 80% were impacted by deforestation and water pollution and had fauna tolerant of these perturbations. Water pollution, represented by TN and TP, affected the macroinvertebrate fauna in a way similar to deforestation, i.e., causing reduction in taxa richness, simplifying the insect community composition without changing abundance. Use of the taxa suggested in this study as environmental indicators could improve the evaluation of water quality in the streams in Central Amazonia.

AB  - Here, we introduce a concept that addresses the complex interrelations between land use and biodiversity by applying an organismic and comparative approach towards grassland ecosystems in southern Africa and temperate Europe. While the natural savannas of southern Africa evolved millions of years ago, cultural grasslands in Europe emerged as a result of intensifying agriculture only a few hundred years ago. A unique feature of recent African ecosystems is the high original megafaunal species diversity (taxa existing prior to Pleistocene extinctions). European ecosystems have been shaped by humans and the original megafaunal species diversity is clearly reduced.
   Similar to the situation in southern Africa today, large herbivores also created a cyclic habitat mosaic in Europe during the last interglacial. The depleted herbivore community in Europe during the early Holocene was no longer able to maintain this cyclic succession. This resulted in a more uniform and dense vegetation type - a process that can be currently witnessed in Africa in bush encroachment. The comparative approach considers further strong natural and cultural linkages between Europe and Africa, such as biogeographical relations between continents, faunistic similarities during the late Pleistocene, the Afro-Palearctic bird migration system or the domestication history of European and African cattle.
   Our approach is based on the assumption that comparative investigations of response patterns under different ecological conditions lead to a better understanding of the common interrelations between land use and biodiversity. It deals with the central question, whether ecosystems respond in a similar way to disturbances. Biodiversity response patterns in relatively undisturbed savanna ecosystems might be a valuable reference for Europe, e.g. in terms of increasing aridity in Europe in the future. The comparative approach requires a careful selection of primary taxa. Special focus is on the use of terrestrial small mammals as ecological indicators.
   The approach further focuses on human-wildlife interactions. The emergence of top predators in Europe reveals the value of the experience from Africa, where pastoralists manage to coexist with large predators since millennia. The investigation of African grasslands enables a critical reflection and a thorough understanding of processes, which have occurred a long time ago in Europe. Our approach leads to a revaluation of the significance of Africa in terms of a conservative, relict case scenario that can provide essential insights into the original situation of ecosystems, especially in view of "rewilding'' approaches in Europe. Thereby, the approach leads to a careful consideration of the term "wilderness''. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - N-stable isotope analysis of macroalgae has become a popular method for the monitoring of nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Basing on changes in their delta N-15, macroalgae have been successfully used as biological traps to intercept nitrogen inputs. As different nitrogen sources differ in their isotopic signature, this technique provides useful information on the origin of pollutants and their extension in the water body. However, isotopic fractionation potentially resulting from microbial nitrogen processing, and indirect isotopic variations due to effects of physicochemical conditions on algal nutrient uptake and metabolism, may affect anthropogenic N isotopic values during transportation and assimilation. This in turn can affect the observed isotopic signature in the algal tissue, inducing isotopic variations not related to the origin of assimilated nitrogen, representing a "background noise" in isotope-based water pollution studies.
   In this study, we focused on three neighbouring coastal lakes (Caprolace, Fogliano and Sabaudia lakes) located south of Rome (Italy). Lakes were characterized by differences in terms of anthropogenic pressure (i.e. urbanization, cultivated crops, livestock grazing) and potential "background noise" levels (i.e. nutrient concentration, pH, microbial concentration). Our aim was to assess nitrogen isotopic variations in fragments of Ulva lactuca specimens after 48 h of submersion to identify and locate the origins of nitrogen pollutants affecting each lake. delta N-15 were obtained for replicated specimens of U. lactuca spatially distributed to cover the entire surface of each lake, previously collected from a benchmark, unpolluted site. In order to reduce the environmental background noise on isotopic observations, a Bayesian hierarchical model relating isotopic variation to environmental covariates and random spatial effects was used to describe and understand the distribution of isotopic signals in each lake.
   Our procedure (i) allowed to remove background noise and confounding effects from the observed isotopic signals; (ii) allowed to detect "hidden" pollution sources that would not be detected when not accounting for the confounding effect of environmental background noise; (iii) produced maps of the three lakes providing a clear representation of the isotopic signal variation even where background noise was high. Maps were useful to locate nitrogen pollution sources, identify the origin of the dissolved nitrogen and quantify the extent of pollutants, showing localized organic pollution impacting Sabaudia and Fogliano, but not Caprolace. This method provided a clear characterization of both intra- and inter-lake anthropogenic pressure gradients, representing a powerful approach to the ecological indication and nitrogen pollution management in complex systems, as transitional waterbodies are.

AB  - Resource managers in South Florida are aware that coastal and marine ecosystems provide food, recreation, and a quality of life that are highly-valued by humans. Estimates of economic values in Florida, such as willingness-to-pay for a day of coral reef snorkeling or the change in this value from a change in coral cover, are not updated in a timely manner or are not available at all. Usually these studies are "baseline studies" that provide a snapshot of economic values under existing economic and environmental conditions. Therefore, to be useful to ecosystems management, human dimension (HD) economic indicators that are relatively easy to measure each year must be identified. In addition, they must be combined with a conceptual model that links these indicators to the ecosystem services; their relevant economic values; the HD non-economic metrics of well-being; and the quality and/or quantity of the environmental and ecologic attributes associated with the ecosystem service. Carefully selected HD economic indicators together with ecological, environmental, and non-economic human dimensions indicators can provide a rich source of information for managing the long term conservation and use of coastal and marine ecosystems.
   In this paper, we specify criteria for selecting HD economic indicators that measure the change in demand for ecosystem services resulting from changes in the quality or quantity of the environmental attributes that comprise the service. We assessed a suite of candidate metrics and arrived at a final set of HD economic indicators for further evaluation. These HD economic indicators are the percentage change from year to year in: (1) coastal park visitation; (2) number of registered recreational boats; (3) pounds of commercial seafood landed; (4) number of live marine organisms landed; and (5) dollar value of insured flood damage claims paid.
   We illustrated the use of these HD economic indicators with an empirical example for the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas where the indicators are measured over a one year period. The changes were then scored and the scores were assigned a stop light rating of: green for good (or increasing), yellow for fair (or stable), and red for poor (or decreasing). Our empirical illustration of HD economic indicators offers a first step in developing metrics to rate the status of Florida's coastal and marine ecosystem services. The next steps are to propose a full suite of candidate HD economic indicators and metrics; final selection of HD economic indicators and their integration into the conceptual model; annual calculation of these indicators and their evaluation; and environmental/ecosystem assessment.

AB  - Climate change will have major impacts in the Great Lakes region of North America. Particularly vulnerable are shallow freshwater estuaries, such as Lake Michigan's Green Bay, located in the north-eastern part of the State of Wisconsin. Green Bay and the Lower Fox River, its major tributary, were considered to be severely polluted as early as 1925. As a result of large expenditures of money and a major research effort that has been conducted over the past 40 years or more, some progress has been made toward the restoration of ecosystem integrity. However, work remains, and within this context, potential climate change impacts pose additional challenges. We discuss in this paper a methodology that can be used to assess climate change impacts on ecosystems, and describe an application to the Green Bay ecosystem. The methodology employs numerical methods to evaluate the inputs from scientific, policy, and management experts who are knowledgeable about the ecosystem under study. The Green Bay ecosystem application reveals that runoff from agriculture and urban sources, already a major ecosystem stressor, will be exacerbated in the future as a result of climate change impacts.

AB  - The recent increase in frequency and severity of flooding in the UK has led to a shift in the perception of risk associated with flood hazards. This has extended to the conservation community, and the risks posed to historic structures that suffer from flooding are particularly concerning for those charged with preserving and maintaining such buildings. In order to fully appraise the risks in a manner appropriate to the complex issue of preservation, a new methodology is presented here that studies the nature of the vulnerability of such structures, and places it in the context of risk assessment, accounting for the vulnerable object and the subsequent exposure of that object to flood hazards. The testing of the methodology is carried out using three urban case studies and the results of the survey analysis provide guidance on the development of fragility curves for historic structures exposed to flooding. This occurs through appraisal of vulnerability indicators related to building form, structural and fabric integrity, and preservation of architectural and archaeological values. Key findings of the work include determining the applicability of these indicators to fragility analysis, and the determination of the relative vulnerability of the three case study sites.

AB  - Progress towards sustainability requires positive steps to meet all of the interdependent core requirements for sustainability - including biophysical system integrity and basic human well-being. Where these essentials are involved trade-offs should be avoided, unless all other options are worse. In environmental assessments, it is useful to identify major trade-offs and minimize them through selection of less bad alternatives or addition of mitigations or offsets. However, the more promising approach starts earlier and encourages planning that avoids invidious trade-offs, including through re-consideration of the initial purposes and alternatives.
   This paper considers two historical cases of assessments that avoided significant trade-offs through processes that gave mandatory attention to purposes and alternatives, covered the full suite of sustainability considerations, empowered citizen participants and facilitated the bumping of cases up to a more strategic level where broader alternatives offered better tradeoff avoidance. These long-advocated assessment design elements are still rarely applied as a full package in existing environmental assessment law and practice. Commitment to trade-off avoidance adds to the reasons for their general adoption.

AB  - Background. Mining, agriculture and cattle production are activities that threaten the quality and quantity of water resources in the Colombian Andes. However, many drainage basins in this region have not been subjected to simultaneous evaluation of the impact these activities have on the density, diversity and composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates (AMI). The first two of these ecological variables are expected to decrease drastically from zones with no apparent impact towards areas with anthropogenic activity, which areas with mining will present the most impoverished AMI community.
   Methods. We evaluated the density, diversity and composition dissimilarity of AMI in streams impacted by gold mining, agriculture and cattle production. Two reference streams were also studied. Six benthic samplings were conducted bimonthly (Feb 2014-Feb 2015) using a Surber net. Water samples were taken in order to make environmental evaluation among the aforementioned streams, including hydrological, physicochemical and bacteriological parameters (HPCB). Diversity was evaluated as the effective number of RTUs-recognizable taxonomic units-by comparing the richness, typical diversity, and effective number of the most abundant RTUs. Compositional dissimilarity was examined with nMDS and CCA analysis.
   Results. A total of 7,483 organisms were collected: 14 orders, 42 families and 71 RTUs. Our prediction regarding the density and diversity of AMI (Reference > Cattle production > Agriculture > Mining) was partially fulfilled, since the agriculture-dominated stream presented a more impoverished AMI community than that of the gold mining stream. However, these streams presented lower diversity than the cattle production and reference streams, and the AMI density only differed significantly between one reference stream and the agriculture stream. The AMI composition in the agriculture-dominated stream clearly differed from that of the other streams.
   Discussion. The observation of a more impoverished AMI community in agricultural production areas compared to those with mining or cattle production may reflect the importance of the remaining riparian vegetation, which was scarce at the stream with agricultural activity. Moreover, the low diversity, and mainly the reduced AMI richness, in the agriculture stream coincided with the absence of insect genera are intolerant to deterioration of the biological and physicochemical conditions of the water (e.g. Anacroneuria).
   Conclusions. The results suggest that the local impact of agricultural activities may be of equal or greater magnitude than that of mining in terms of AMI density, diversity and composition, in the Colombian Andean riverscape. Future studies should systematically evaluate, throughout the annual cycle, the relative effects of the productive land use, the remaining native vegetation cover and the consequent changes in the HPCB parameters of the water on AMI communities in Colombian Andean basins.

AB  - P> A survey of c. 350 remote high altitude and high latitude lakes from 11 different mountain regions was undertaken to explore species distribution across Europe at a scale not previously attempted.
   Lakes were sampled for planktonic crustaceans, rotifers, littoral invertebrates and sub-fossil chironomids, diatoms and cladocerans. Each lake was characterised in terms of water chemistry, morphology, catchment attributes and geographical location.
   Separate twinspan analyses were undertaken on diatom, chironomid, planktonic crustacean, littoral invertebrate and cladoceran (chydorids only) data to classify sites according to taxonomic composition. For most datasets there was a spatial component to the classification with distinct geographical groups emerging - Norway and Scotland, Finland and Central/Eastern Europe.
   Constrained ordination methods were employed to examine how species responded to a range of environmental factors, which were aggregated into a series of component groups - proximal environment (the chemical, trophic and physical attributes of the lake), catchment characteristics and geographical location. Several key environmental gradients were identified, which explained significant levels of the variance across several of the biological groups including dissolved organic carbon (chironomids, planktonic crustaceans), temperature (chironomids and littoral invertebrates), chloride/sea-salt (littoral invertebrates, diatoms and rotifers), lake morphology (all groups), calcium/pH (diatoms), nitrate (chydorids, littoral invertebrates, rotifers and planktonic crustaceans) and fish (littoral invertebrates). In some cases these statistical relationships are likely to represent direct ecological constraints and, in others, it is probable that the environmental variable is acting as a surrogate for some other attribute or process.
   Variance partitioning was undertaken to quantify how much of the variation in each biological group could be uniquely attributed to variables representing the proximal environment, catchment characteristics and geographical location. For most groups the location of the lake tends to explain the greatest variation in species composition across the Lake Districts. The proximal environment was also important but, with the exception of diatoms, secondary to location. Therefore, a strong geographical signal emerged from the analyses. Three distinct limno-regions were identified; Nordic (Scotland and Norway), Sub-Arctic (Northern Finland) and Alpine (Pyrenees, the Alps and Eastern Europe ranges).
   Our results have implications for the development of regionalisation schemes based on biological responses to environmental gradients; (i) lake 'types' based on environmental factors cannot be extrapolated throughout Europe, even within the relatively narrow gradients found in remote mountain lakes, (ii) biotic response to large-scale variations in environmental conditions, such as those that could be expected with climate change, is likely to vary according to regions because of the biogeographical differences among them.

AB  - A methodology based on emergy analysis for the calculation of the biophysical value of the stocked biomass (natural capital) was applied to the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of Portofino (PF) and Cinque Terre (CT). The resources exploited, on a yearly base, to maintain the natural capital itself alive (environmental flows) were accounted too. Emergy analysis is an accounting method useful to identify and convert in a single unit of measure all resources feeding a system. This allows the implementation of a system overall assessment and then the conversion of the obtained value in money terms. The studied MPAs are located in the northwestern part of Italy, are both tourism oriented and subdivided in zones with different protection degree. The habitats occupying both the MPAs bottoms have been identified together with the biomass stored on their surface, identifying units named FBHA (fishes and benthos habitat assemblage). The calculation of biomass stocked in the benthic organisms and in the fishes associated to each FBHA represents the basis for the assessment of MPA natural capital value and of environmental flows. From these values, the trophic network of each habitat was modeled allowing calculating the inputs to emergy analysis.
   The value of PF natural capital, expressed as resources employed through space and time to store the existing biomass, is equal to over 10 million Euros while the CT natural capital amounts to over 30 million.
   The high value habitats, where biomass is concentrated and stored, represent hot spots that are restricted in a limited surface and that can be maintained only if the resources they need are provided by adjacent lower value habitats. Through the applied methodology, a balance is performed to understand if an MPA is self-sufficient or dependent on external areas. Therefore, if an MPA is correctly planned, as CT is, the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the deficit FBHAs and even to export resources to other systems. In this case, the MPA lies in a surplus condition. On the contrary, the MPA is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then potentially posed at risk.
   If information about natural capital, flows and balance is synthesized in a Geographical Information System, it represents an effective tool to MPAs managers to measure the efficacy of protection established. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recovery of three tropical forest covers from mid-elevation sites in Costa Rica: oligochaetes, litter and soil analysis. In Costa Rica, the region of Rio Macho is a highly fragmented landscape with imminent risk of landslides. This area, which provides important environmental services, has been partially recovered to its original forest through intentional reforestation with exotic species or natural regeneration after abandonment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioindicator potential of oligochaete presence as well as some litter and soil characteristics. The ecosystem recovery of the two common restoration modes was measured within three different forest covers. For this, some substrate characteristics were analyzed and compared in a 50 years old secondary forest, a 13 years tacotal, and a 35 years cypress (Cupressus lusitanica) plantation. The three sites studied differed in density, biomass and average mass of oligochaetes, and in some litter (depth, nitrogen, phosphorus and C/N ratio of litter), and soil variables (soil water content (CA), pH, phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, and magnesium). The forest registered the lowest density of earthworms and soil pH, and the highest soil CA and phosphorus. CA was inversely related to the oligochaete density across sites. Besides, there were positive correlations between C/N and C/P ratios from the litter and soil pH, and inverse correlations of litter depth, litter N and P concentrations with soil P. Discriminant Analysis (AD) performed with all soil and litter variables, produced a sharp classification of the three forest cover types. AD suggests that site differences were mostly determined by soil CA and litter nitrogen concentration. Considering all the evaluated parameters, our results suggest in the first place, that oligochaetes are sensitive to changes in some soil and litter characteristics. Secondly, aside from the striking oligochaete differences between the old secondary forest and the other two sites, some soil and litter traits resulted good indicators of the present recovery of the three forest covers. In addition, comparing soil nutrients content (organic carbon, nitrogen, calcium, potassium and sulfur) among the three sites, our findings indicate that the cypress plantation had reached soil nutrient conditions similar to the old secondary forest, presumably by the accumulation of nutrients, as a result of low nutrient recirculation. In conclusion, ecosystem level studies throughout simple evaluation criteria (soils, oligochaetes and ground litter) can be used as rapid indicators of the state of some of the many and complex forest ecosystem compartments.

AB  - A problem of providing the resource-ecological safety, increase of efficiency of the naturally-economic potential use of territory is one of priority for every region of Ukraine. At the same time, formation of an efficient market economy in the regions requires solution of the problems between the goals of the social and economic system development and negative effects of its impact on the environment with considering the influence of destabilizing factors. In this aspect, forming new comprehensive approaches to ensuring resource and environmental safety in the region and creating strategies for improving primary and secondary resources management based on economic models and mechanisms are becoming a priority in regional development.
   Therefore in the article there are worked out and scientifically justified the methodological principles of estimation of resource-ecological safety in the region. They consist in the calculation of three-component index that takes into account ecological safety of regional economy, level of ecological risk on the basis of a priori choice of model of relations "man-environment", and level of resources proceeding in the region. These approaches are based on developing an innovative methodology for regional social and economic system development, that ensures prevention of ecosystems and human health deterioration while improving social and economic conditions of a given system through a mechanism of more efficient use of natural and economic potential of the area.
   The methodological basis of the study were the results of basic and applied research in the field of physical economy, ecological economics, of the concept of sustainable development. Methodological-theoretical basis of organizing resource-ecological safety of the region is based on integration of ecologic, economic, technological and social imperatives. Economic-mathematic model of resource-ecological safety management and approaches of optimal management strategies determination and their implementation mechanisms are proposed. The results of research allowed to form conceptual principles of providing the resource-ecological safety in the regions of Ukraine, oriented to the increase of efficiency of territory naturally-economic potential use on the basis of solid wastes capitalization and minimization of their negative influence. The methodical base of risks diagnostics of regional resource-ecological safety management system and evaluation of its efficiency are worked out. Practical importance of work consists in optimization of strategy of providing the resource-ecological safety in a region, realization of that will allow: to improve competitiveness of region; to get an additional profit from secondary resources; to save primary resources and improve their quality; to turn contaminated lands in economic turnover of region; to decrease a risk to the health of population from negative influence of wastes; to ensure the preservation and resumption of the natural environment of the region.

AB  - Monitoring at large geographic scales requires a framework for understanding relationships between components and processes of an ecosystem and the human activities that affect them. We created a conceptual model that is centered on ecosystem processes, considers humans as part of ecosystems, and serves as a framework for selecting attributes for monitoring ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada. The model has three levels: 1) an ecosystem model that identifies five spheres (Atmosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Lithosphere, Sociocultural), 2) sphere: models that identify key ecosystem processes (e.g., photosynthesis), and 3) key process models that identify the "essential elements" that are required for the process to operate (e.g., solar radiation), the human activities ("affectors") that have negative and positive effects on the elements (e.g., air pollution), and the "consequences" of affectors acting on essential elements (e.g., change in primary productivity). We discuss use of the model to select attributes that best reflect the operation and integrity of the ecosystem processes. Model details can be viewed on the web at http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/sncf/spam_report/index.htm (Appendix section).

AB  - The article considers the species composition of the Dothideomycetes and its structural characteristics in conditions of anthropogenically transformed ecosystems of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The materials of the work were the original mycological collection carried out as part of the mycological survey of this territory during 2008-2016, as well as the materials of the herbarium of the Institute of Botany named after M. Kholodny of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Herbarium collection and identification of the samples were performed in accordance with the generally accepted methods of cameral processing of xylotrophic, herbotrophic and coprothrophic micromycetes. To establish the taxonomic affiliation of species, the method of light microscopy was applied. As a result of our research, the species diversity of ascolocular fungi (Dothideomycetes) has been established in the anthropogenically transformed ecosystems of the steppe zone of Ukraine, which includes 156 species from 43 genera 19 families 5 orders and groups of taxa of Incertae sedis of the subclasses Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae. The characteristic features of the taxonomic structure of the investigated mycobiota are the predominance of representatives of the order of Pleosporales, the families Cucurbitariaceae and Mycosphaerellaceae, the genera Cucurbitaria and Mycosphaerella. In the ecological structure of mycobiota in anthropogenically transformed ecosystems saprotrophic and xylotrophic species dominated. The ascolocular fungi species are form consortium connections with 178 species of vascular plants from 112 genera of 51 families, with the largest number of micromycetes (65 species) noted on plants of the Rosaceae. An analysis of the abundance of species in anthropogenically transformed ecosystems of the investigated area showed that 47% of the species are randomly distributed. Widespread species are Dothidea sorbi (Wahlenb.) Sacc., Cucurbitaria caraganae P. Karst., C. amorphae (Wallr.) Fuckel, Botryosphaeria dothidea (Moug.) Ces. & De Not., Otthia spiraeae (Fuckel) Fuckel. In the anthropogenically transformed ecosystems of the steppe zone of Ukraine, in comparison with natural ecosystems, the proportion of species from the genera Cucurbitaria and Mycosphaerella increases quantitatively, and the proportion of Leptosphaeria and Pleospora species decreases. An increase in the proportion of hemibiotrophic species in the ecological structure can be considered a characteristic feature of anthropogenic influence on mycobiota. Comparative analysis of quantitative and qualitative indicators of the mycobiota structure combined with spatial and temporal changes of these indicators can serve as an instrument for indicating its anthropogenic transformation. It would be promising to conduct further research on changes in the species structure of micromycetes exposed to various types of anthropogenic impact in terrestrial ecosystems of the steppe zone of Ukraine.

AB  - Climate change effects on Himalayas are expectedly more pronounced than any other mountainous ecoregion of the world with expected threat of meltdown by the year 2100 if effective checks are not imposed. The impacts of this climate warming in the geologically fragile Himalayas has started to show its effects on shifting precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, glaciers meltdown, species richness patterns and overall unpredictable microclimatic conditions. For measuring such impacts of current climate warming in Himalayan ecosystems, need of ecological substitutes has been stressed on by different United Nation conventions. Lichens in contrast to vascular flora have long been proved to act as cost effective global indicators for measuring ecosystems responses to environmental climate. The variations in microclimatic attributes and their effects on photosynthetic efficiency and distribution were studied in geologically fragile ecosystem of Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Garhwal Himalayas. Total 217 species of lichens comprising 80 genera and 35 families were found along different elevations. Among the different habitat groups, corticolous lichens showed their dominance (123 species) followed by saxicolous (65 species) and terricolous (29 species) lichens. Corticolous forms were dominated by crustose while saxicolous and terricolous were mostly fruticose growth forms. Mostly large number of species showed a narrow distribution with maximum species richness observed in mid elevation zones (1950-2200m) followed by a gradual decline towards higher elevations. Phaeophyscia hispidula, Parmotrema reticulatum and Flavoparmelia caperata showed wider ecological amplitude. Out of these species, P. hispidula and F. caperata were further subjected to chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with a pulse amplified modulated fluorometer to access photosynthetic quenching efficiencies. Maximum electron transport rates (ETR; 96 +/- 5.76mole(-) m(-2)s(-1)) were observed in Phaeophyscia hispidula (1550m) while F. caperata showed nearly 21% lower ETR. Photochemical quenching (qP; 0.5 +/- 0.01) was maximum at 1550m elevation in F. caperata while P. hispidula showed maximum qP values at 2200m elevation, showing it's higher tolerances towards extreme light stresses. F. caperata showed higher (0.102 +/- 0.003) non photochemical quenching (NPQ) in comparison to P. hispidula (0.062 +/- 0.001) at extreme elevations of 3508m. P. hispidula overall showed more toxitolerant nature towards abiotic stresses as compared to F. caperata. Higher photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 1600-2350 mu molm(-2)s(-1)), thallus hydration levels and extreme variations in air temperature (5.75-31.65 degrees C), ambient humidity along elevations were imperative in controlling species richness, distribution and photosynthetic quenching of lichen flora in the region.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration by vegetation restoration is the theme of much current research. Since 1999, the program of "Grain for Green"has been implemented in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China. Its scope represents the largest vegetation restoration activity in China. However, it is still unclear for the SOC sequestration effects of vegetation cover change or natural succession promoted by the revegetation efforts at different scales under the semi-arid conditions. In this study, the changes in SOC stocks due to the vegetation restoration in the middle of Loess Plateau were estimated at patch, hill slope transect and small watershed scale from 1998 to 2006. Soil samples were taken from field for the determination of cesium-137 (Cs-137) and SOC contents. Vegetation cover change from 1998 to 2006 at the small watershed scale was assessed using Geographic Information System. The results showed that cropland transforming to grassland or shrubland significantly increased SOC at patch scale. Immature woodland, however, has no significant effect. When vegetation cover has no transformation for mature woodland (25 years old), SOC has no significant increase implying that SOC has come to a stable level. At hill slope scale, three typical vegetation cover patterns showed different SOC sequestration effects of 8.6%, 24.6%, and 21.4% from 1998 to 2006, and these SOC increases mainly resulted from revegetation. At the small watershed scale, SOC stocks increased by 19% in the surface soil layer at 0-20 cm soil depth from 1998 to 2006, which was equivalent to an average SOC sequestration rate of 19.92 t Cy-1 km(-2). Meanwhile. SOC contents showed a significant positive correlation (P<0.001) with the Cs-137 inventory at every soil depth interval. This implied significant negative impacts of soil erosion on SOC sequestration. The results have demonstrated general positive effects of vegetation restoration on SOC sequestration at multiple scales. However, soil erosion under rugged topography modified the spatial distribution of the SOC sequestration effects. Therefore, vegetation restoration was proved to be a significant carbon sink, whereas, erosion could be a carbon source in high erosion sensitive regions. This research can contribute to the performance assessment of ecological rehabilitation projects such as "Grain to Green" and the scientific understanding of the impacts of vegetation restoration and soil erosion on soil carbon dynamics in semi-arid environments.

AB  - Extended calving interval (CInt) for high-yielding dairy cows beyond the traditional 12 mo has been suggested as a profitable, environmentally and welfare-friendly production strategy. However, concerns exist on whether extending cow CInt, and consequently prolonging lactation length, impairs milk quality. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of milk produced during the extended lactation period to mid lactation. In particular, milk indicators related to udder integrity and cheesemaking properties when cows were fed low-or high-energy diets in early lactation mobilization period. Forty-seven healthy Danish Holstein cows (15 primi- and 32 multiparous) were fed 2 distinct weight-adjusted diets in early lactation: either a high-density diet for approximately 42 d in milk (DIM) followed by a low-density diet (n = 22), or a low-density diet throughout the whole experiment (n = 25). Milk quality was explored at 3 lactation periods: 140 to 175 DIM (P1), 280 to 315 DIM (P2), and 385 to 420 DIM (P3). Lactation period was found to be the main factor affecting milk yield, quality, and cheesemaking properties. Primiparous cows kept the same daily milk yield throughout the studied periods, whereas multiparous cows produced, on average, 10.2 kg/d less in P3 compared with P1. Fat, protein, and casein concentrations increased, respectively, by 18, 16, and 16%, from P1 to P3. Cheesemaking properties, such as curd-firming rate, gel strength, and wet and dry curd yield, got an improvement from P1 to P3 and were strongly correlated with milk concentrations of protein and casein. The udder integrity indicators, somatic cells count, level of free amino terminals as an index of proteolysis, and milk pH, remained unchanged throughout the studied lactation periods. Feeding cows either high-or low-density diets during the early lactation mobilization period did not exert any relevant carryover effect on milk composition, and thus had no effect on cheesemaking properties in extended lactation. Further, sensory quality of mid-and extended-lactation milk was assessed by a trained sensory panel. The sensory quality of milk from P3 reflected sensory descriptors related to the increased levels of fat and protein over lactation, but, importantly, milk produced in P3 did not present sensory demerits when compared with milk produced in P1. In conclusion, high-yielding Holstein cows undergoing an 18-mo CInt produced high-quality milk from mid to extended lactation.

AB  - Forest-steppe landscapes of Siberia are characterized by a high diversity of flora and plant communities. The zonal vegetation of piedmont forest-steppe to the east of the Ob River is represented by meadow steppes, xeric meadows and small-leaved forests. Various ecological-coenotic groups of species form these communities and indicate different ecological conditions as well as an anthropogenic impact. Correctly identified ecological-coenotic groups can be used in vegetation classification, assessment of ecological characteristics of habitats, and communities genesis. The aims of our study were: (1) a formalized analysis of geobotanical releves of steppe and meadow vegetation and the identification of ecological-coenotic groups of species for piedmont forest-steppe landscapes to the east of the Ob River; (2) characterization of plant communities with high syntaxonomical rank using distinguished ecological-coenotic groups.
   Our research was carried out in Novosibirsk region to the east of the Ob River between its valley and the Salair Ridge (53 degrees 30'N - 55 degrees N, 81 degrees 30'E - 84 degrees E) (See Fig. 1). 505 releves were selected for further analysis, 352 were sampled by the authors of the paper, and 153 were taken from literature [Makunina and Mal'tseva 2008; Dymina 1989 ; Makunina et al. 2010]. Each releve was assigned to the high rank syntaxa (class, order, alliance). Using IBIS 7.2, a table was prepared, which was processed in JUICE 7.0 using Modified TWINSPAN Classification. For all types of communities, lists of indicator species with occurrence and importance values were compiled. To distinguish differential species, the formal criteria were used [Dengler et al., 2005; Michl et al., 2010]. To assess the environmental characteristics of habitats, indicator values for species on ecological gradients (pasture digression, soil richness-salinity and moisture, tolerability for hemeroby) were used.
   Four types of plant communities were identified using cluster analysis (See Fig. 2). A synoptic table was built taking into account the constancy and importance value of species (See Table). On the basis of formal analysis of the releves, 8 ecologicalcoenotic groups were identified, including 93 species in total (27% of the total flora of the steppe and meadow vegetation of the studied region). All of them have an indicator or differential significance. To determine the leading environmental factors in the differentiation of vegetation, indicator values of plants and DCA-ordination were used. For each releve its position on four gradients was calculated: soil moisture, tolerability for hemeroby, soil richness-salinity and pasture digression. An analysis of Pearson's correlation between the position of the releves on ecological gradients and on the first three axes of DCA-ordination showed that the first two factors play a leading role in the differentiation of vegetation. On the gradient of soil moisture, all releves were divided into steppes, steppe meadows and forest meadows. The second factor is responsible for the difference between communities of pastures and fallows on one side and natural or slightly transformed steppes and meadows on the other. Four generalized types of plant communities were identified using cluster analysis. The first cluster represents steppe vegetation. Members of 1, 5 and 6 ecological-coenotic groups take part in the steppe coenoflora (See Table). This coenoflora includes 11 species with a high importance value, among which are the common steppe dominants Stipa capillata and Artemisia glauca. Another four plants are dominants and co-dominants . Medicago falcata, Stipa pennata, Poa angustifolia, Fragaria viridis. The analyzed communities occupy the driest position on the moisture gradient: 52-53 gradations on average (See Fig. 3). The second cluster represents xeric meadows and meadow steppes that dominate in foreststeppe landscapes. These are rich multi-dominant communities that are characterized by a large group of plants with a high importance value. The basis coenoses are formed by common mesoxeric meadow-steppe and meadow plants: Fragaria viridis, Calamagrostis epigeios, Poa angustifolia, Filipendula vulgaris, Dactylis glomerata, Peucedanum morisonii, Phlomoides tuberosa, Brachypodium pinnatum, Medicago falcata, Iris ruthenica, Seseli libanotis, Stipa pennata, Vicia amoena, Centaurea scabiosa and Artemisia latifolia. Representatives of 2, 5-8 ecological-coenotic groups actively participate in the formation of coenoflora (See Table). Steppe meadows and meadow steppes are the most heterogeneous type of communities. On the moisture gradient they are located between steppes and forest meadows (average moisture gradations are 57-58). The third community type combines transformed variants of meadow vegetation: pastures and fallows. Phytocoenoses are characterized by multidominance and an approximately equal ratio of rhizome grasses (Dactylis glomerata, Poa angustifolia, Festuca pratensis, Phleum pratense, Elytrigia repens, Bromopsis inermis) and perennial herbs (Fragaria viridis, Filipendula vulgaris, Medicago falcata, Amoria repens, Trifolium pratense, Taraxacum officinale). 3, 6, and 8 ecologicalcoenotic groups actively participate in the species composition of transformed meadows (See Table). This type of communities is well separated on the gradient of tolerability for hemeroby, while according to moistening conditions it corresponds to xeric meadows (See Fig. 3).
   The fourth type represents forest meadows.
   Coenoses are multi-dominant with many abundant and constant species. Among them prevail perennial herbs: Filipendula ulmaria, Aegopodium podagraria, Heracleum dissectum, Pteridium aquilinum, Cirsium setosum, Urtica dioica, Rubus saxatilis, Anthriscus sylvestris, Crepis sibirica and Bupleurum longifolium. Usually, rhizome grasses are the main codominants: Bromopsis inermis, Brachypodium pinnatum, Calamagrostis epigeios and Poa angustifolia. Species from 4, 7, and 8 ecological-coenotic groups form this type of communities (See Table). On the moisture gradient, forest meadows occupy wet parts: 62 gradations on average.
   The described types of communities can be used both in the dominant classification and in syntaxonomy. The indicator and differential species allow to detail the phytocoenotic diversity of vegetation, its spatial patterns and dynamics.

AB  - Data on Maghrebian mayfly communities are scarce and fragmentary, but evidence of alterations of the North African riverine landscape depleting the freshwater biota is rapidly mounting. In contrast to the overexploited lowlands, the highlands of north-eastern Algeria are hotspots of freshwater biodiversity and the last refugia to micro-endemics, North African endemics, and Eurosiberian relicts. The mayflies of relict mountain streams of north-eastern Algeria were investigated and 20 species or taxa in five families were recorded. Two species of the genus Habrophlebia and one species of Centroptilum are new to science, whereas two Rhithrogena species are new to Algeria, including the Numidian endemic Rhithrogena sartorii. Co-inertia analysis suggested a highly significant co-structure between mayfly assemblages and habitats defined by altitude, flow velocity, bed width, water depth, and water conductivity. In addition, a Poisson generalized linear model indicated a strong positive relationship between species richness and water depth and a weaker negative one with bed width (stream size). The results are congruent with the hypothesis that habitat provides the templet that drives mayfly communities, and they support the use of mayflies as bioindicators in the implementation of monitoring schemes to assess the ecological integrity of Maghrebian freshwater biodiversity hotspots. The upstream part of the Kebir-East river basin is subjected to forest fires, pollution, and flow alteration, whereas the downstream part, which includes the vast Mekhada marsh, is increasingly fragmented and invaded by alien fish species. Conservation efforts focusing on the management of Oued Kebir-East, a transboundary Maghrebian river, and the restoration of the Mekhada marsh, a Ramsar site, need to be launched during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).

AB  - Pollution is a key threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health within protected areas. Using a non-invasive, multi-matrix approach, sediment, vegetation and faecal material from lion (Panthera leo) and giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) were collected and assessed for the simultaneous quantification of 20 trace elements using an optimised method for Inductively Coupled Plasma--Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Method Linearity was confirmed over an analytical range of 0.1-50 mg/kg for aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe); 0.4-400 pg/kg for vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd); 0.5-5 pg/kg for mercury (Hg); and 1-1 000 pg/kg for elements arsenic (As), boron (B), barium (Ba), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), tin (Sn), strontium (Sr) and zinc (Zn). Coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was above 0.99 for all elements. Accuracy (% recovery) and precision (% RSD) of replicate measurements for certified reference material controls fell within 20% of expected value at lower concentrations and 15% at higher concentrations for all elements except Al. Results for instrument and method limit of detections (LOD), method limit of quantification (LOQ) and expanded uncertainty were satisfactory. Preliminary data indicate As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn were present in all matrices evaluated. This raises concerns regarding the combined action of multiple elements at concentrations that can adversely affect ecosystem and wildlife integrity.
   Sample quantity is reduced due to the power and sensitivity of ICP-MS.
   The optimised method is capable of detecting differences in trace element concentrations over large orders of magnitude in animal faeces containing different amounts of organic content.
   The method can be applied to the quantification of essential and potentially toxic elements in faeces across a wide range of terrestrial species. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are used to produce predictions of potential Leguminosae diversity in West Central Africa. Those predictions are evaluated subsequently using expert opinion. The established methodology of combining all SDMs is refined to assess species diversity within five defined vegetation types. Potential species diversity is thus predicted for each vegetation type respectively. The primary aim of the new methodology is to define, in more detail, areas of species richness for conservation planning.
   Methodology: Using Maxent, SDMs based on a suite of 14 environmental predictors were generated for 185 West Central African Leguminosae species, each categorised according to one of five vegetation types: Afromontane, coastal, non-flooded forest, open formations, or riverine forest. The relative contribution of each environmental variable was compared between different vegetation types using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis Paired Comparison contrast. Legume species diversity patterns were explored initially using the typical method of stacking all SDMs. Subsequently, five different ensemble models were generated by partitioning SDMs according to vegetation category. Ecological modelers worked with legume specialists to improve data integrity and integrate expert opinion in the interpretation of individual species models and potential species richness predictions for different vegetation types.
   Results/Conclusions: Of the 14 environmental predictors used, five showed no difference in their relative contribution to the different vegetation models. Of the nine discriminating variables, the majority were related to temperature variation. The set of variables that played a major role in the Afromontane species diversity model differed significantly from the sets of variables of greatest relative important in other vegetation categories. The traditional approach of stacking all SDMs indicated overall centers of diversity in the region but the maps indicating potential species richness by vegetation type offered more detailed information on which conservation efforts can be focused.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the influence of lead, copper, manganese and cadmium on DNA integrity in plant cells. Plants, as biological indicators, can measure the potential effects of pollutants when they are used to measure effects of heavy metals. The genotoxicity of heavy metals in kidney-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seedlings was subjected to RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis. An RAPD 'fingerprinting' technique was used to detect DNA damage in the kidney-bean seedlings treated with two selected heavy metals at concentrations of 150 and 350 mg.l(-1). Polymorphisms became evident as the presence and/or absence of DNA fragments in treated samples compared with the untreated one. At 350 mg.l(-1), a high number of both missing bands and new amplified fragment were observed. Results suggested that a qualitative measure reflecting changes in RAPD profiles were significantly affected at higher concentrations (350 mg.l(-1)) of the tested heavy metals. A total of 467 RAPD fragments in RAPD profiles were detected by using six random primers (decamers) and 224 of these fragments showed polymorphism. There was a distinct distance between the band patterns of treated plants and the control samples when the cluster method was applied. In addition, the result derived from numerical analysis revealed a considerable distance between the band pattern of the plant samples treated with 350 mg.l(-1) heavy metals and the control sample. Finally, a comparison between untreated and treated genomes shows that RAPD analysis can be used to evaluate how the environmental pollutants modify the structure of DNA in living organisms.

AB  - Man-made freshwater habitats have been widely used to successfully modify the environment for human benefit, including purposes of irrigation, flood control or electricity generation. Over the past decade, our knowledge about the mayfly fauna and its ecology in South-East Europe has been growing, yet the data related to lentic assemblages remain very scarce. In this study, littoral mayfly assemblages were investigated at artificial and heavily modified lentic habitats in the Dinaric Western Balkan (n=21) and Pannonian Lowland (n=15) ecoregions. Mayfly nymphs were sampled during the summer months of 2016 or 2017. At each sampling site, ten samples were collected using a benthos hand net. A total of 21 mayfly species were recorded, though species richness per site was rather low (i.e., between zero and seven species). Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus, 1761) was the most frequent species recorded, while Caenis horaria Linnaeus, 1758 was the most abundant. This study showed that the Croatian mayfly fauna is still growing, with the first record of Siphlonurus aestivalis Eaton, 1903 for the country. The assemblage structure was mainly dominated by lower reaches and lentic (potamal and littoral) elements and detritivores (gatherers/collectors and active filter feeders). Orthophosphates and chemical oxygen demand had the highest influence on mayfly assemblages, reflecting a higher level of pollution at sites in the Pannonian Lowland ecoregion, and consequently markedly lower mayfly abundances. As mayflies are widely used as bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems, detailed information about their assemblages in heavily modified and artificial habitats could contribute to future conservation activities of freshwater habitats and their communities. Additionally, these results could be applied in creating a monitoring system for artificial lakes according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - 1. Sampling and processing of benthic macroinvertebrate samples is time consuming and expensive. Although a number of cost-cutting options exist, a frequently asked question is how representative a subset of data is of the whole community, in particular in areas where habitat diversity is high (like Dutch surface water habitats).
   2. Weighted averaging was used to reassign 650 samples to a typology of 40 community types, testing the representativeness of different subsets of data: (i) four different types of data (presence/absence, raw, (2)log- and ln-transformed abundance), (ii) three subsets of 'indicator' taxa (taxa with indicator weights 4-12, 7-12, and 10-12) and (iii) single taxonomic groups (n = 14) by determining the classification error.
   3. (2)log- and ln-transformed abundances resulted in the lowest classification error, whilst the use of qualitative data resulted in a reduction of 10% of the samples assigned to their original community type compared to the use of ln-transformed abundance data.
   4. Samples from community types with a high number of unique indicator taxa had the lowest classification error, and classification error increased as similarity among community types increased. Using a subset of indicator taxa resulted in a maximum increase of the classification error of 15% when only taxa with an indicator weight 10-12 were included (error = 49.1%).
   5. Use of single taxonomic groups resulted in high classification error, the lowest classification error was found using Trichoptera (68%), and was related to the frequency of the taxonomic group among samples and the indicator weights of the taxa.
   6. Our findings that the use of qualitative data, subsets of indicator taxa or single taxonomic groups resulted in high classification error implies low taxonomic redundancy, and supports the use of all taxa in characterising a macroinvertebrate community, in particular in areas where habitat diversity is high.

AB  - To characterize seafloor substrate type, seabed mapping and particularly multibeam echosounding are increasingly used. Yet, the utilisation of repetitive MBES-borne backscatter surveys to monitor the environmental status of the seafloor remains limited. Often methodological frameworks are missing, and should comprise of a suite of change detection procedures, similarly to those developed in the terrestrial sciences. In this study, pre-, ensemble and post-classification approaches were tested on an eight km(2) study site within a Habitat Directive Area in the Belgian part of the North Sea. In this area, gravel beds with epifaunal assemblages were observed. Flourishing of the fauna is constrained by overtopping with sand or increased turbidity levels, which could result from anthropogenic activities. Monitoring of the gravel to sand ratio was hence put forward as an indicator of good environmental status. Seven acoustic surveys were undertaken from 2004 to 2015. The methods allowed quantifying temporal trends and patterns of change of the main substrate classes identified in the study area; namely fine to medium homogenous sand, medium sand with bioclastic detritus and medium to coarse sand with gravel. Results indicated that by considering the entire study area and the entire time series, the gravel to sand ratio fluctuated, but was overall stable. Nonetheless, when only the biodiversity hotspots were considered, net losses and a gradual trend, indicative of potential smothering, was captured by ensemble and post-classification approaches respectively. Additionally, a two-dimensional morphological analysis, based on the bathymetric data, suggested a loss of profile complexity from 2004 to 2015. Causal relationships with natural and anthropogenic stressors are yet to be established. The methodologies presented and discussed are repeatable and can be applied to broad-scale geographical extents given that broad-scale time series datasets become available.

AB  - Bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into deeper habitats and higher latitudes, but our understanding of their effects in these areas is limited. The ecological importance of habitat-forming megabenthos and their vulnerability to trawling is acknowledged, but studies on effects are few. Our objective was to investigate chronic effects of otter trawl fishery on substratum and megabenthos on the shelf (50-400 m) and slope (400-2000 m) in the southern Barents Sea. The study area represents a wide range in the history of fishing intensity (FI). Physical impact of trawling, density of trawl marks (TMs), was quantified on 250 video transects from shelf and slope, and megabenthos (. 2 cm) composition was studied on 149 video transects from the shelf. The number of satellite-recorded vessels within grid cells 5 x 5 km was used as a proxy for FI in the TM analysis and for the megabenthos records within a 2-km radius around the transects. The effects of using different search area sizes were tested. Patterns in the density of TMs and megabenthos composition were compared with FI using linear regression and correspondence analysis. Occurrence of TMs was not directly related to FI but to bottom type, whereas megabenthos density and diversity showed a negative relation. For 79 of the 97 most common taxa, density was negatively correlated with FI. The sponges Craniella zetlandica and Phakellia/Axinella were particularly vulnerable, but also Flabellum macandrewi (Scleractinia), Ditrupa arietina (Polychaeta), Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatulacea), and Spatangus purpureus (Echinoidea) were negatively correlated with FI, whereas asteroids, lamp shells, and small sponges showed a positive trend. Our results are an important step towards the understanding of chronic effects of bottom trawling and are discussed in relation to the descriptors "Biological diversity" and "Seafloor integrity" in the EU Marine strategic framework directive.

AB  - The ecological assessment of a C12-15 AE-3S linear alkylethoxysulfate (AES) anionic surfactant to invertebrates, fish, periphyton, and an aquatic macrophyte was conducted in a 30-d outdoor stream mesocosm study with five replicated concentrations and controls. Alkylethoxysulfate structural integrity and exposure concentrations were maintained during the 30-d treatment period, with average measured concentrations of 0.7, 1.27, 2.2, 4.3 1, and 10.18 mg/L. No effects were observed on the aquatic macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum at the highest concentration tested. A sevenfold increase in periphyton biomass at 10.18 mg/L was observed relative to controls primarily because of increases in density of the filamentous alga Mougeotia sp. Densities of the invertebrates Annelida (Stylaria), Amphipoda, Copepoda, Trichoptera (Hydropsychidae), Cladocera, and Diptera (Chironomidae) significantly decreased in streams treated with AES at 10.18 mg/L. Densities of drifting invertebrates were not observed to be affected at any concentration tested. Reproduction of Pimephales promelas significantly decreased at 1.27 mg/L and growth of juvenile Lepomis macrochirus was significantly affected at 4.31 mg/L. Multivariate cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed distinct structural effects on the invertebrate communities in the streams treated with AES at 10.18 mg/L compared to the control and streams treated at < 10.18 mg/L through the 30-d treatment. Convergence of the communities treated at 10.18 mg/L toward control communities in the ordination suggests recovery in these communities after termination of surfactant treatment. The results from this study support an ecosystem value of >2.0 mg/L, and indicate that the conservative Dutch risk assessment for AESs has at least a fivefold margin of safety.

AB  - Introduction: Semiaquatic hemipterans are insects that may be among the best indicators of the quality of the aquatic environment, specifically in terms of the content of substances that break surface tension. However, no studies are evaluating how these insects are affected by changes in the surface tension of the water.
   Objective: To determine the effect of soapy water on the locomotion ability of three species of neotropical semiaquatic hemipterans.
   Methods: From August to November 2020, we conducted ex situ experiments, with nine groups of ten individuals of the family Veliidae (N = 90) and Gerridae (N = 90), where each group individually, was subjected to the entry of soapy water for three minutes. For this, we designed an aquarium consisting of three plastic boxes at different heights, connected to each other, so that a current flow was generated. We used powdered laundry soap, liquid hand soap, and bar soap for dishes. For each type of soap we prepared a low (9 ppm), medium (50 ppm) and high (200 ppm) concentration. By means of recordings, we recorded the time the hemipterans spent in the water, as well as their ability to get out of the water, and whether or not they sank.
   Results: We found that, regardless of the type of soap, the time spent by hemipterans in contaminated water decreases drastically as the concentration increases, but the impact varies by species, with Rhagovelia solida (family Veliidae) being less affected by pollution compared to Platygerris caeruleus and Potamobates unidentatus (family Gerridae).
   Conclusions: The use of these taxa as indicators of the degree of contamination of rivers by detergents and soaps can be very useful, especially if we take into account the differences in sensitivity according to the family or gender of the group.

AB  - With the wide application of chiral ionic liquids (CILs) as green solvents, their threats to the aquatic environment cannot be ignored. Thus, risk assessment and the prospective design of inherently safe CILs have become more urgent. However, whether enantioselectivity is a feature of the aquatic toxicity of CILs is poorly understood. Herein, we describe the first investigation into the ecotoxicities of CILs toward green algae Scenedesmus obliquus and Euglena gracilis. A series of methylimidazolium lactic ionic liquids, which cation parts with different alkyl chains and anion part is enantiomers of lactate, are used as representative CILs. The results of S. obliquus showed that the EC50 value of L-(+)-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium lactate (L-(+)-EMIM L) was more than 5000 mu M, while the EC50 value of D-(-)-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium lactate (D-(-)-EMIM L) was 2255.21 mu M. Such a distinct difference indicates the enantioselective toxicity of CILs to algae. This enantioselectivity initially persisted with increasing carbon chain length, but no longer exhibited when with greater carbon chain lengths, due to changes in the toxicity weightings of the cation parts. Further research showed that the enantioselective effects of CILs resulted from the differences in the production of reactive oxygen species, the damage to cell membrane integrity and cell wall after exposure to CILs. Results from this study showed that monitoring for the racemate CILs will give an inadequate or misleading environmental risk assessment. Thus, we should improve our ability to predict their effects in natural environments. In the meantime, non-selective use of CILs will do harm to aquatic organisms. Therefore, to minimize their potential for environmental impact, the enantioselective toxicities of CILs with short alkyl chains should be taken into consideration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect, consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes, then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods. In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river. These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river restoration and management efforts.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate community structure of the Achiras stream (Cordoba, Argentina): analysis prior to a dam construction. Regulation of rivers and streams modifies parameters that directly influence on the biota. In Achiras-del Gato endorheic basin has completed the construction of a midsize dam that will alter the limnological characteristics of the system and the structure of benthic communities. This study provides the first taxonomic records of macrobenthos of this lotic system and analyzes the spatial and temporal variations of the community structure in the foothills stretches of Achiras stream. Zoobenthos samples were collected and abiotic variables were recorded in runs and riffles, during a year, in two sites located upstream and downstream of the dam area, prior to the dam was built. For each site, habitat and season we determined the abundance, frequency, taxonomic richness, Shannon and evenness, and the data were analyzed using one-way and three-way ANOVA. Attributes of the reference communities were complemented by the determination of ecological indicators and detectors, and exclusive taxa. In the first site 73 taxa were recorded, Simulium was the most abundant and Leptohyphes eximius Eaton, 1882, was the most frequent. In the second site we found 75 taxa, Caenis was the most abundant and Cricotopus sp. 3, was the most frequent. In this study composition and distribution of the biota and indicators taxa are discussed. We determined that the community attributes were affected by the hydrological periods in wich the samples were taken. Achiras stream has a phreatic-pluvial hydrological regime with low flows in winter and high flows in summer. Therefore, we expect changes in native biota and in system integrity in response to hydraulic variability reduction when Achiras dam start functioning and alters the natural flow.

AB  - Large-scale surveys, such as national forest inventories and vegetation monitoring programs, usually have complex sampling designs that include geographical stratification and units organized in clusters. When models are developed using data from such programs, a key question is whether or not to utilize design information when analyzing the relationship between a response variable and a set of covariates. Standard statistical regression methods often fail to account for complex sampling designs, which may lead to severely biased estimators of model coefficients. Furthermore, ignoring that data are spatially correlated within clusters may underestimate the standard errors of regression coefficient estimates, with a risk for drawing wrong conclusions. We first review general approaches that account for complex sampling designs, e.g. methods using probability weighting, and stress the need to explore the effects of the sampling design when applying logistic regression models. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the performance of the standard logistic regression model with two approaches to model correlated binary responses, i.e. cluster-specific and population-averaged logistic regression models. As an example, we analyze the occurrence of epiphytic hair lichens in the genus Bryoria; an indicator of forest ecosystem integrity. Based on data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) for the period 1993-2014 we generated a data set on hair lichen occurrence on > 100,000 Picea abies trees distributed throughout Sweden. The NFI data included ten covariates representing forest structure and climate variables potentially affecting lichen occurrence. Our analyses show the importance of taking complex sampling designs and correlated binary responses into account in logistic regression modeling to avoid the risk of obtaining notably biased parameter estimators and standard errors, and erroneous interpretations about factors affecting e.g. hair lichen occurrence. We recommend comparisons of unweighted and weighted logistic regression analyses as an essential step in development of models based on data from large-scale surveys.

AB  - Regulating ecosystem services (ES) fundamentally underpin biosphere integrity, human safety, and the provision of most other ES. However, the pathways by which regulating ES generate benefits for people are complex and vary spatially and temporally. Emerging ES decision-making frameworks underemphasize regulating services because they focus on ES that have more obvious links to human wellbeing (e.g., in close proximity to beneficiaries with very short time lags). Lack of attention towards regulating ES can lead to unintended management trade-offs that create risk for human wellbeing and can cause immediate and delayed impacts on cultural and provisioning ES. Therefore, a remaining challenge for ES frameworks is to address the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks whereby ecosystems contribute to human wellbeing over time, including through regulating services. We address this challenge by (i) reviewing the complexities associated with regulating ES components-capacity, ecological pressures, and demand, (ii) exploring the spatial and temporal variability that influence regulating ES components, including the flow of service benefits, and (iii) illustrating the inter-dependency of regulating ES components through examples of ES that are linked hydrologically. We conclude that ES capacity, pressure, demand and the flow of benefits are distinct, but intricately linked components that influence how regulating ES provide benefits and improve human wellbeing. We pose that ES assessment frameworks could be improved by including indicators of regulating ES that differentiate between the capacity to provide a regulating ES, the demand for the same, and the actual service that is conveyed, the latter of which is influenced by underlying capacity and ecological pressure. These indicators should also be spatially and temporally explicit to fully incorporate the dynamic influence of temporal variability, spatial scale, and landscape configuration on regulating ES and the benefits they yield.

AB  - In this paper, we model the excitation energy transfer (EET) of photosystem I (PSI) of the common pea plant Pisum sativum as a complex interacting network. The magnitude of the link energy transfer between nodes/chromophores is computed by Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) using the pairwise physical distances between chromophores from the PDB 5L8R (Protein Data Bank). We measure the global PSI network EET efficiency adopting well-known network theory indicators: the network efficiency (Eff) and the largest connected component (LCC). We also account the number of connected nodes/chromophores to P700 (CN), a new ad hoc measure we introduce here to indicate how many nodes in the network can actually transfer energy to the P700 reaction centre. We find that when progressively removing the weak links of lower EET, the Eff decreases, while the EET paths integrity (LCC and CN) is still preserved. This finding would show that the PSI is a resilient system owning a large window of functioning feasibility and it is completely impaired only when removing most of the network links. From the study of different types of chromophore, we propose different primary functions within the PSI system: chlorophyll a (CLA) molecules are the central nodes in the EET process, while other chromophore types have different primary functions. Furthermore, we perform nodes removal simulations to understand how the nodes/chromophores malfunctioning may affect PSI functioning. We discover that the removal of the CLA triggers the fastest decrease in the Eff, confirming that CAL is the main contributors to the high EET efficiency. Our outcomes open new perspectives of research, such comparing the PSI energy transfer efficiency of different natural and agricultural plant species and investigating the light-harvesting mechanisms of artificial photosynthesis both in plant agriculture and in the field of solar energy applications.

AB  - A growing number of studies indicate high conservation potential of freshwater habitats occurring in post-mining areas. The overall diversity of these habitats depends on many factors, however, even a high diversity may diminish significantly over time. Therefore, it is difficult to identify and understand the importance of key habitat properties for diversity. Here I present analysis of three studies comparing the diversity of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). Each study was performed in different coal mining basins within the Czech Republic (a total of 94 sites). In this analysis, I used generalized linear mixed models and several multivariate methods to analyze the effects of a number of environmental characteristics such as depth, bottom substrate or bank slope, reflecting not only the current quality but also the succession and formation of individual pools. The occurrence of overall 14 nationally red listed species indicates the high conservation value of these habitats, while the 40 species found indicate that these areas contribute significantly to regional diversity. Species richness of individual pools was associated with habitat type (spoil heap vs. mine subsidence) and with several habitat variables, in particular the character of vegetation around aquatic habitats. In conclusion, the results indicate that diversity and species composition are significantly influenced by factors reflecting the formation and subsequent succession of pools. Effective conservation management should concentrate primarily on modifying pools' initial properties such as bottom substrate. Subsequent management should then sustain landscape dynamics, which means in particular to sustain minor disturbances that subsequently affect vegetation succession and prevent excessive overgrowing of expansive vegetation, as doing so is promoting the habitat heterogeneity which is essential to high biodiversity in these areas.

AB  - 1. Although diatoms have been used for many decades for river monitoring around the world, studies showing evidence that diatoms integrate temporal variability in water chemistry are scarce.
   2. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of the Eastern Canadian Diatom Index (IDEC: Indice Diatomees de l'Est du Canada) with respect to temporal water chemistry variability using three different spatio-temporal data sets.
   3. Along a large phosphorus gradient, the IDEC was highly correlated with averaged water chemistry data. Along within-stream phosphorus gradients, the IDEC integrated phosphorus over various periods of time, depending on the trophic status of the site studied (Boyer, Nicolet or Ste. Anne river) and variability in nutrient concentration.
   4. In the Ste. Anne River, where nutrient concentrations were low and generally stable, an input of phosphorus induced a rapid change in diatom community structure and IDEC value within the following week. In the mesotrophic Nicolet River, the observed integration period was approximately 2 weeks. Diatom communities in the eutrophic Boyer River appeared to be adapted to frequent and significant fluctuations in nutrient concentrations. In this system, the IDEC therefore showed a slower response to short term fluctuations and integrated nutrient concentrations over a period of 5 weeks.
   5. Our results suggest that the integration period varies as a function of trophic status and nutrient concentration variability in the streams. Oligotrophic streams are more sensitive to nutrient variations and their diatom communities are directly altered by nutrient increase, while diatom communities of eutrophic rivers are less sensitive to nutrient fluctuations and major variations take a longer time to be integrated into index values.
   6. The longer integration period in the eutrophic environment may be attributed to the complexity of the diatom community. The results from this study showed that the diversity and evenness of the communities increased with trophic status.

AB  - Extreme hydrological events, such as water scarcity and flooding, can modify the effect of other stressors present in aquatic environment, which could result in the significant changes in the ecosystem functioning. Presence and interaction of various stressors (genotoxic pollutants) in the environment can influence the integrity of DNA molecules in aquatic organisms which can be negatively reflected on the individual, population and community levels. Therefore, in this study we have investigated the impact of flooding, in terms of genotoxicity, on organisms belonging to different trophic levels. The study was carried out on the site situated in the lower stretch of the Sava River which faced devastating effects of severe flooding in May 2014. The flooding occurred during our field experiment and this event provided a unique opportunity to assess its influence to the environment. The in situ effects of this specific situation were monitored by measuring physical, chemical and microbiological parameters of water, and by comparing the level of DNA damage in coelomocytes and haemocytes of freshwater worms Branchiura sowerbyi, haemocytes of freshwater mussels Unto tumidus and blood cells of freshwater fish Abramis bjoerkna/Abramis sapa, by means of the comet assay. Our study indicated that the flooding had a significant impact on water quality by decreasing the amount and discharge rate of urban wastewaters but simultaneously introducing contaminants from the nearby fly ash disposal field into river by runoff, which had diverse effects on the level of DNA damage in the studied organisms. This indicates that the assessment of genotoxic pollution in situ is strongly affected by the choice of the bioindicator organism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mining and associated infrastructure developments can present themselves as economic opportunities that are difficult to forego for developing and industrialised countries alike. Almost inevitably, however, they lead to biodiversity loss. This trade-off can be greatest in economically poor but highly biodiverse regions. Biodiversity offsets have, therefore, increasingly been promoted as a mechanism to help achieve both the aims of development and biodiversity conservation. Accordingly, this mechanism is emerging as a key tool for multinational mining companies to demonstrate good environmental stewardship. Relying on offsets to achieve "no-net-loss" of biodiversity, however, requires certainty in their ecological integrity where they are used to sanction habitat destruction.
   Here, we discuss real-world practices in biodiversity offsetting by assessing how well some leading initiatives internationally integrate critical aspects of biodiversity attributes, net loss accounting and project management. With the aim of improving, rather than merely critiquing the approach, we analyse different aspects of biodiversity offsetting. Further, we analyse the potential pitfalls of developing counterfactual scenarios of biodiversity loss or gains in a project's absence. In this, we draw on insights from experience with carbon offsetting. This informs our discussion of realistic projections of project effectiveness and permanence of benefits to ensure no net losses, and the risk of displacing, rather than avoiding biodiversity losses ("leakage"). We show that the most prominent existing biodiversity offset initiatives employ broad and somewhat arbitrary parameters to measure habitat value and do not sufficiently consider real-world challenges in compensating losses in an effective and lasting manner. We propose a more transparent and science-based approach, supported with a new formula, to help design biodiversity offsets to realise their potential in enabling more responsible mining that better balances economic development opportunities for mining and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Flow regimes have become a fundamental part of ecological informatics to reveal the complex interactional mechanism lying between flow regimes and ecological system. In this study, the changes of flow regimes were investigated to obtain the suitable flow regimes for maintaining the ecological integrity in the Lower Yellow River, China. The temporal abrupt for annual streamflow was explored with Mann-Kendall method (M-K method), and alterations of flow regimes at daily scale were described in accordance with Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Histogram Matching Approach (HMA). Results showed that: (i) the annual flow presented a downward abrupt in 1984, and after that year, the flow magnitude was smaller in general, and the frequency of low flow was much higher during all the twelve months: (ii) during the post-impact period, both of the maximum and minimum flow magnitudes for 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, 30-day and 90-day declined, and frequency distribution distances were larger than 70% except for 1-, 3-, 7- and 30-day minimum flows; (iii) the number and duration of low pulse extended for the post-impact period, whereas the number and duration of high pulse decreased: and (iv) suitable ranges of monthly magnitude as well as number and duration days for high/low pulses were obtained (e.g., 743 to 3979 m(3)/s for monthly flow magnitude in July, August, September, October and November with similar target ranges, from 94 to 1075 m(3)/s for the rest seven months). The results indicate that the flow magnitude of the Yellow River has a decreasing trend, and some critical hydrologic characteristics should be taken into account due to their importance for ecosystems health in the downstream Yellow River Basin.

AB  - The diversity and distribution of freshwater insects in South America is poorly known. Riffle beetles (Elmidae) are aquatic Coleoptera that are considered important indicators of environmental integrity. In Brazil, the country with the largest area and highest richness of Elmidae in the Neotropics, the diversity of the family remains incipient. The southern region of Brazil (state of Rio Grande do Sul) reportedly has a higher richness of stream insects than other regions. In this study, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the potential distribution of riffle beetle taxa in southern Brazil to identify areas with elevated diversity and suggest priority areas for further investigation towards conservation of Elmidae. As most records of Elmidae were represented by larvae, we predicted the potential distribution firstly of genera and secondly of species within the genus Macrelmis because they were available as adults and allowed identification to species level. These were modelled in relation to environmental factors such as climate, topography, hydrography and land cover. Our results suggested that montane regions and basins located within well-preserved forested regions indicated the highest potential richness of Elmidae. In addition, the areas with higher predicted suitability for the occurrence of genera overlapped with the suitable areas for species of Macrelmis. This result suggests the existence of an elevated ecological similarity among most of the modelled taxa, and that projections for certain Elmidae genera can be useful proxies for estimations of the potential distribution of species in the region. The most important environmental factors related to the predicted distribution of Elmidae taxa were associated with climate (precipitation), landscape (forest cover) and topography. Unsurprisingly, freshwater ecoregions were also suggested as important drivers of Elmidae distribution. Our results indicate that conservation efforts for aquatic insects such as riffle beetles in Brazil should focus on watersheds located in montane and forested regions.

AB  - The concept of sustainability should be significantly integrated into practice as well as into contemporary urbanism principles as innovative technological approaches for designing the future cities of 21st century. A green certification can be accepted as an essential tool to provide the location-specific, measurable, monitorable, updatable components and parameters of sustainability. The aim of the study is to discuss the preparation of analysis and synthesis of green building and settlement certification that is carried out with the Ministry of Environment and Urbanism and to share the results of the significant experience which is dealing with global objectives at the national and local scale. This first experience will be evaluated under the indicators of land use, ecology and disaster management topics related to their contribution in sustainable urban development with a notion of providing social and economic sustainability of urban livelihoods. Alongside the evaluation this paper will provide a comparison of this national intervention with other widely used and world-known international green certifications. Having elaborated international green certificates to build the infrastructure for a national certificate on urban scale, the major land use decisions for the sustainable settlements prove to provide integrity between the green scales building and settlement. Thus, the researchers decided to emphasize the major subjects of ecological assets and land evaluation, sustainable site selection and energy efficient planning, sustainable urban development and land use, environmental management and infrastructure planning, disaster mitigation in conjunction with socio-cultural quality and socio-economic welfare to insure sustainability measures in Turkish settlements. The decisions on the parameters also help other components of sustainability to relate among whole dynamics of the city. Therefore, the suggestions for a national green certificate in this study are expected to contribute to the adoption of realistic and practical steps necessary to achieve sustainability goals.

AB  - Heroin abuse and natural aging exert common influences on immunological cell functioning. This observation led to a recent and untested idea that aging may be accelerated in abusers of heroin. We examined this claim by testing whether heroin use is associated with premature aging at both cellular and brain system levels. A group of abstinent heroin users (n=33) and matched healthy controls (n=30) were recruited and measured on various biological indicators of aging. These measures included peripheral blood telomerase activity, which reflects cellular aging, and both structural and functional measures of brain magnetic resonance imaging. We found that heroin users were characterized by significantly low telomerase activity (0.21 vs 1.78; 88% reduction; t(61)=6.96, P<0.001; 95% confidence interval=1.12-2.02), which interacted with heroin use to affect the structural integrity of gray and white matter of the prefrontal cortex (PFC; AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), a key brain region implicated in aging. Using the PFC location identified from the structural analyses as a 'seed' region, it was further revealed that telomerase activity interacted with heroin use to impact age-sensitive brain functional networks (AlphaSim corrected P<0.05), which correlated with behavioral performance on executive functioning, memory and attentional control (Pearson correlation, all P<0.05). To our knowledge, this study is the first to attempt a direct integration of peripheral molecular, brain system and behavioral measures in the context of substance abuse. The present finding that heroin abuse is associated with accelerated aging at both cellular and brain system levels is novel and forms a unique contribution to our knowledge in how the biological processes of drug abusers may be disrupted.

AB  - The environmental legislation of many countries increasingly requires the continuous monitoring of fish assemblages to evaluate the success of river and stream restorations. Predicting species-environment relationships on the basis of monitoring data is central in the evaluation of ecological integrity and planning of rehabilitation strategies. Monitoring data are, however, often plagued by a substantial proportion of zeros (no catch at single sampling points) which are caused by relevant ecological processes, but complicate the use of commonly used statistical methods. This study compares mere count regression models, mixture and hurdle models based on Poisson and negative binomial distribution and logistic regressions with respect to their ability to cope with large zero-inflated data sets obtained by point abundance sampling of young-of-the-year fish from three large German rivers. Only mixture and hurdle models based on negative binomial distribution could satisfactorily be fitted to the zero-inflated and overdispersed count data. The logistic regression models applied to transliterated catch data simplified the computational procedure and yielded qualitative similar results to the count regression models indicating that the use of more complex count data did not generally provide better predictions. Therefore, presence/absence sampling may be a suitable and less costly alternative to abundance surveys for identifying environmental factors which affect the spatial distribution of fish populations at least if information on subtly abundance fluctuations is not needed. Mixture or hurdle models are particularly worth the additional effort if it is reasonable to distinguish between those environmental factors influencing the occurrence probability and others affecting the abundance. All models showed low sensitivity to rare guilds pointing to the need for a further development of statistical models for rare species whose management is a matter of growing environmental concern.

AB  - The Mayflower orchid, Laelia speciosa, is an endangered orchid endemic to oak forests of central Mexico. Because of extractive pressure on remaining natural populations, in vitro propagation has been proposed as an alternative for the massive propagation of this plant for conservation and commercial purposes. However, it is unknown whether this orchid will be able to tolerate the increased air temperature that is projected to occur during the present century, especially for in vitro propagated individuals at early developmental stages. A laboratory assay that measured electrolyte leakage, a common indicator of cell membrane integrity, was utilized to determine the high-temperature tolerance for 8-year-old individuals rescued from a wild population and for 2-year-old micropropagated individuals of the Mayflower orchid. The plants were incubated under day/night air temperatures of 25/15, 30/20, or 35/25 degrees C. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of the quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) averaged 0.74 +/- 0.01, except for the micropropagated individuals incubated under 35/25 degrees C, whose quantum yield of 0.64 +/- 0.02 was indicative of stress. Electrolyte leakage also responded to incubation temperature. An observed increase of temperature tolerance of 0.6-1.0 degrees C per increased degree of incubation temperature indicates an ability to acclimate to rising air temperatures. However, the LT50 (the temperature that causes half of the maximum electrolyte leakage to occur) dramatically decreased (by 6.7-10.9 degrees C) for plants kept under 35/25 degrees C. In this case, the in vitro propagated individuals were less able to resist high air temperatures. It appears that the Mayflower will be able to survive climate change, provided that in vitro propagated individuals are sufficiently hardened.

AB  - Understanding soil processes is fundamental to the success of forest restoration programs. We compared different types of soils in Mediterranean mountain forests with respect to their edaphic environments and influence of vegetation cover and lithology. We then used this information to determine the suitability of current forest restoration programs in these ecosystems.
   Twenty-four surface horizons in forest soils in two zones of contrasting lithology (calcareous and metamorphic) and different types of vegetation cover or management (shrubland, autochthomous forest and reforested forest) were sampled. A set of their essential soil properties were analysed and a series of parameters considered as indicators of surface soil processes was selected: aggregate size, structural stability, water repellency, mineralisation rate and fungal activity.
   Results confirm that the lithological origins of soils determines the properties defined by the geochemical environment of soilscapes (texture, pH, exchange complex and free oxides), and does not much influence organic properties. On the other hand, the type of plant cover and management do not influence the geochemical properties of the soil decisively, but do maintain a relative control of organic properties, especially those that define their quality (C/N ratio).
   The variability of surface properties is not well explained by environmental factors, and it is assumed that a large part may be related to the historical use of the soils.
   The specificity of soilscapes implies differences in vulnerability to forest management: the surface horizons in siliceous environments are more vulnerable than calcareous environments. It is necessary to better characterize soil properties in these forests and accordingly re-evaluate forest restoration efforts with respect to them. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Communicating the finiteness of the Earth system at sub-global scales is necessary to guide human activities within a safe operating space. Despite the numerous efforts committed to downscaling planetary boundaries (PBs) at multiple scales, neither top-down nor bottom-up approaches adequately account for the spatial heterogeneity and integrity of local and global natural systems. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed a hybrid approach that combines bottom-up aggregation and top-down adjustment for downscaling five crucial PBs (i.e., climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, freshwater use, and land use change) to Chinese provinces and industries. In addition to the widely applied equity principle, we further incorporated the eco-efficiency principle into the downscaling of PBs under the proposition that safeguarding finite PBs should be reconciled with the pursuit of maximizing human welfare. Environmental sustainability at multiple scales was subsequently assessed with the complementary use of environmental footprints and downscaled PBs. The results demonstrate that 1) China suffers from severe unsustainability because of the transgression of PBs for phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, carbon emissions, and cropland use; 2) provinces in West and North China perform worse than other provinces in terms of the eco-efficiency in manufacturing industries, including Electronic equipment, Textiles, and Wood processing and furnishing, rendering these industries that are more unsustainable; and 3) industries with varying eco-efficiencies account differently for the provincial PBs. Construction dominates the provincial shares of carbon PBs, whereas Agriculture and Food processing and tobacco contribute most to the other four PBs. Our findings suggest that improving eco-efficiency in most manufacturing industries is the key to saving resources, reducing emis- sions, and safeguarding local boundaries. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Land-use studies are challenging because of the difficulty of finding catchments that can be used as replicates and because land-use effects may be obscured by sources of variance acting over spatial scales smaller than the catchment. To determine the extent to which land-use effects on stream ecosystems are scale dependent, we designed a whole-catchment study of six matched pairs (pasture versus native tussock) of second-order stream catchments, taking replicate samples from replicate bedforms (pools and riffles) in each stream.
   2. Pasture streams had a smaller representation of endemic riparian plant species, particularly tussock grasses, higher bank erosion, a somewhat deeper layer of fine sediment, lower water velocities in riffles, less moss cover and higher macroinvertebrate biodiversity. At the bedform scale, suspendable inorganic sediment (SIS) was higher in pools than riffles and in pasture streams there was a negative relationship between SIS and the percentage of the bed free of overhanging vegetation. Differences between stream reaches (including any interactions between land use and stream pair) were significant for SIS, substrate depth and characteristics of riparian vegetation. There were also significant differences between replicate bedforms in the same stream reaches in percentage exotic species in overhanging vegetation, percentage moss cover, QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index - a macroinvertebrate-based stream health index) and macroinvertebrate density.
   3. Significant differences among stream reaches and among replicate bedform units within the same reach, as well as interactions between these spatial units and land-use effects, are neither trivial nor 'noise' but represent real differences among spatial units that typically are unaccounted for in stream studies. Our multi-scale study design, accompanied by an investigation of the explanatory power of different factors operating at different scales, provides an improved understanding of variability in nature.

AB  - The Suquia River middle-lower basin (Crdoba, Argentina) is subject to a strong anthropogenic impact because it receives pollutants from different sources. Recent studies have shown the importance and the need of approaching the monitoring process of water quality from integral perspectives through the use of chemical as well as biological methods. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the fish species Jenynsia multidentata as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquia River using biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes as well as gill and liver histopathology as biomarkers. We also studied the fish-assemblage characteristics through the fish species pattern variation and the application of a biotic index based on fish data. Our study also included the analysis of a water-quality index, heavy-metal concentrations in sediment and water, and pesticide concentrations in sediment. The chemical analyses of the middle-lower Suquia River basin showed a water-quality degradation gradient. Fish-assemblage structure changed with increasing water pollution, showing a simpler structure at the most polluted area. According to the bioitc index, the variation pattern of fish assemblages reflected the aquatic environmental deterioration. Both molecular and histopathological biomarkers reflected the same trend in relation to water quality. However, enzymes varied with more acute precision between seasons. In addition, each enzyme presented with different sensibility. At tissue level, the histopathological analysis detected chronic contamination at both stations and seasons. The present work, which comprises different levels of biological organization together with chemical analyses, generated particular although complementary information, thus evidencing the same trend of aquatic contamination. Thus, the development of integral investigations gives a comprehensive approach and becomes the most effective tool to construct policies both preventive and palliative. Our study constitutes a good model to be applied in other endorheic basins of South America.

AB  - Assessing chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) pigments in complex inland water systems is of key importance as this parameter constitutes a major ecosystem integrity indicator. In this study, a methodological framework is proposed for quantifying Chl-apigments using Earth observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The first step of the methodology involves the implementation of stepwise multiple regression (MLR) analysis of the available Chl-adataset. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore Greek lakes' potential interrelationships based on their Chl-avalues in conjunction with certain criteria: their characteristics (artificial/natural), typology, and climatic type. Additionally, parameters such as seasonal water sampling and the date difference between sampling and satellite overpass are taken into consideration. Next, is implemented a stepwise multiple regression analysis among different groups of cases, formed by the criteria indicated from the PCA itself. This effort aimed at exploring different remote sensing-derived Chl-aalgorithms for various types of lakes. The practical use of the proposed approach was evaluated in a total of 50 lake water bodies (natural and artificial) from 2013-2018, constituting the National Lake Network Monitoring of Greece in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). All in all, the results evidenced the suitability of Landsat data when used with the proposed technique to estimate log-transformed Chl-a. The proposed scheme resulted in the development of models separately for natural (R= 0.78; RMSE = 1.3 mu g/L) and artificial lakes (R= 0.76; RMSE = 1.29 mu g/L), while the model developed without criteria proved weaker (R= 0.65; RMSE = 1.85 mu g/L) in comparison to the other ones examined. The methodological framework proposed herein can be used as a useful resource toward a continuous monitoring and assessment of lake water quality, supporting sustainable water resources management.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive has been adopted by Member States to assess and manage the ecological integrity of surface waters. Specific challenges include harmonizing diverse assessment systems across Europe, linking ecological assessment to restoration measures and reaching a common view on 'good' ecological status.
   In this study, nine national macrophyte-based approaches for assessing ecological status were compared and harmonized, using a large dataset of 539 European lakes. A macrophyte common metric, representing the average standardized view of each lake by all countries, was used to compare national methods. This was also shown to reflect the total phosphorus (r(2) = 0.32), total nitrogen (r(2) = 0.22) as well as chlorophyll-alpha (r(2) = 0.35-0.38) gradients, providing a link between ecological data, stressors and management decisions. Despite differing assessment approaches and initial differences in classification, a consensus was reached on how type-specific macrophyte assemblages change across the ecological status gradient and where ecological status boundaries should lie.
   A marked decline in submerged vegetation, especially Charophyta (characterizing 'good' status), and an increase in abundance of free-floating plants (characterizing 'less than good' status) were the most significant changes along the ecological status gradient. Macrophyte communities of 'good' status lakes were diverse with many charophytes and several Potamogeton species. A large number of taxa occurred across the entire gradient, but only a minority dominated at 'less than good' status, including filamentous algae, lemnids, nymphaeids, and several elodeids (e.g., Zannichellia palustris and Elodea nuttallii). Our findings establish a 'guiding image' of the macrophyte community at 'good' ecological status in hard-water lakes of the Central-Baltic region of Europe.

AB  - The process of development has led to the modification of river landscapes. This has created imbalances between ecological, economic, and socio-cultural uses of ecosystem services (ESs), threatening the biotic and social integrity of rivers. Anthropogenic modifications influence river landscapes on multiple scales, which impact river-flow regimes and thus the production of river ESs. Despite progress in developing approaches for the valuation ecosystem goods and services, the ecosystem service research fails to acknowledge the biophysical structure of river landscape where ecosystem services are generated. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the literature to develop the understanding of the biocomplexity of river landscapes and its importance in ecosystem service research. The review is limited to anthropogenic modifications from catchment to reach scale which includes inter-basin water transfer, change in land-use pattern, sub-surface modifications, groundwater abstractions, stream channelization, dams, and sand mining. Using 86 studies, the paper demonstrates that river ESs largely depend on the effective functioning of biophysical processes, which are linked with the geomorphological, ecological, and hydrological characteristics of river landscapes. Further, the ESs are linked with the economic, ecological, and socio-cultural aspect. The papers show that almost all anthropogenic modifications have positive impact on economic value of ESs. The ecological and socio-cultural values are negatively impacted by anthropogenic modifications such as dams, inter-basin water transfer, change in land-use pattern, and sand mining. The socio-cultural impact of ground-water abstraction and sub-surface modifications are not found in the literature examined here. Further, the ecological and socio-cultural aspects of ecosystem services from stakeholders' perspective are discussed. We advocate for linking ecosystem service assessment with landscape signatures considering the socio-ecological interactions.

AB  - Biodiversity is vital for fully functional natural habitats, and the maintenance of biodiversity through effective conservation planning depends on reliable information on its spatial distribution and response to anthropogenic disturbance. However, gathering extensive data on multiple species is a difficult task, due to logistical and financial constraints and the lack of taxonomic expertise. A common resource to address this hurdle is the use of surrogate taxa: focusing on a limited set of species that provide information that can be extrapolated to wider patterns of biodiversity and ecological integrity. We examine this by (1) testing if species richness proportions among different taxa/methodology employed (ants, birds sampled with point counts, birds sampled with mist nets, dung beetles, trees and saplings) will be similar across different undisturbed Amazonian forests, and (2) if patterns of local congruence in richness and community composition are consistent in undisturbed forest and gradients of forest disturbed by forest fires. Our results indicate that species richness, across field sites, was positively associated at a regional scale. At a local scale, richness and community composition in unburned forest showed virtually no correlation between the taxa, but the inclusion of samples from burned forest increased the number of significant correlations. Vegetation (trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height) composition was the best indicator of overall community composition of all other taxa. The congruence of regional patterns of richness is likely a consequence of macro variables such as climate and biogeographical history, and should not be extrapolated to local scales. Although the use of community composition metrics increased congruence at a local scale, we highlight the importance of using a broad ecological gradient. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Species richness in itself is not always sufficient to evaluate land management strategies for nature conservation. The exchange of species between local communities may be affected by landscape structure and land-use intensity. Thus, species turnover, and its inverse, community similarity, may be useful measures of landscape integrity from a diversity perspective.
   Location A European transect from France to Estonia.
   Methods We measured the similarity of plant, bird, wild bee, true bug, carabid beetle, hoverfly and spider communities sampled along gradients in landscape composition (e.g. total availability of semi-natural habitat), landscape configuration (e.g. fragmentation) and land-use intensity (e.g. pesticide loads).
   Results Total availability of semi-natural habitats had little effect on community similarity, except for bird communities, which were more homogeneous in more natural landscapes. Bee communities, in contrast, were less similar in landscapes with higher percentages of semi-natural habitats. Increased landscape fragmentation decreased similarity of true bug communities, while plant communities showed a nonlinear, U-shaped response. More intense land use, specifically increased pesticide burden, led to a homogenization of bee, bug and spider communities within sites. In these cases, habitat fragmentation interacted with pesticide load. Hoverfly and carabid beetle community similarity was differentially affected by higher pesticide levels: for carabid beetles similarity decreased, while for hoverflies we observed a U-shaped relationship.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the effects of landscape composition, configuration and land-use intensity on the similarity of communities. It indicates reduced exchange of species between communities in landscapes dominated by agricultural activities. Taxonomic groups differed in their responses to environmental drivers and using but one group as an indicator for 'biodiversity' as such would thus not be advisable.

AB  - Direct measurement of biotic indices used in monitoring stream health is time consuming, costly, and usually limited to few sites and locations. This severely limits the spatial extent and the temporal interval of assessment; hence, continuous long-term monitoring of all reaches becomes impossible. Therefore, modeling approaches are commonly used as an alternative. However, modeling complex natural systems are not without challenges and the error in modeling these systems is usually high. This study focuses on modeling four biotic indices, including one fish and three macroinvertebrate indices, using 171 water quantity and 78 water quality variables. This study introduces a new two-phase approach in modeling biotic indices. In the first phase, an initial estimate of the biotic index along with an estimate of the error associated with those initial predictions is obtained. In the second phase, these initial estimates are combined to develop a new predictive model. Although different modeling methods can be used in each phase, to demonstrate the concept, in this study we tested Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The proposed approach was evaluated based on monitoring data form the Flint River watershed, located in Michigan, USA. The results demonstrate that the two-phase approach that uses PLSR (first phase) and ANFIS (second phase) is superior to common-single-phase approach (R-2 for the stream health predictive models increased on average from 0.5 in the first phase to over 0.9 in the second phase). Additionally, the two-phase approach eliminates the need for variable selection, a common pre-processing step, and provides satisfactory results despite the limited number of samples, which makes the approach more reliable, robust, and applicable. Although in this study the proposed two-phase approach is applied to biotic indices, the process can be extended to other natural and physical systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lack of landscape connectivity and habitat loss is major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in nature reserves aimed at conservation. In this study, we used structural pattern and functional connectivity metrics to analyze the spatial patterns and landscape connectivity of habitat patches for the Shangyong sub-reserve of the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve from 1970, 1990, and 2000. On the basis of vegetation and land cover data, we applied the equivalent connected area ECA(PC) indicator to analyze the changes in forest connectivity. Four distance thresholds (2, 4, 8, 12 km) were considered to compare the patch importance of connectivity by dECA values. The results showed the declining trends of landscape connectivity measured by ECA(PC) index from 1970 to 2000. The importance of connectivity in each forest patch varied with the increment of dispersal distances at the patch level, and some important habitat patches, which exhibit a potential to enhance landscape connectivity, should be given more attention. The least-cost pathways based on network structure were displayed under four dispersal distances in three periods. The results showed that the number of paths among the fragments of forest patches exhibited radical increases for larger dispersal distances. Further correlation analyses of AWF, ECA (IIC), and ECA (PC) showed the weakest and least-frequent correlations with the structural pattern indices, while H presented more significant correlations with the PD fragmentation metric. Furthermore, Kendall's rank correlations between the forest patch area and functional connectivity indicators showed that dECA (PC) and dAWF indicators should provided the area-based prioritization of habitat patches. Moreover, the low-rank correlations showed that dF and dLCP can be considered as effective and appropriate indicators for the evaluation of habitat features and network patterns.

AB  - Watersheds are distinct hydrologic units that comprise a range of terrestrial upland and riparian complex ecological sites. Since the hydrologic function of the entirety of the watershed is linked, other ecological functions and processes are also likely linked. No single assessment tool is available to describe the ecological status of both terrestrial upland sites and riparian complexes in a single watershed. We investigated the relationship by integrating two assessment tools, Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health protocol (IIRH) and stream geomorphic surveys in prairie ecosystems. The qualitative values from the IIRH protocol were different among upland sites associated with 35 intermittent stream reaches in North Dakota in the United States. Riparian complex sites were separated using three metrics of stream stability: stream channel type, bank-height ratio, and Bank Erosion Hazard Index. Stream channel type had the strongest relationship with two attributes of rangeland health, Soil & Site Stability and Hydrologic Function, while bank-height ratio had the strongest relationship with the Biotic Integrity attribute. The influences of individual indicators were identified using a principal components analysis, which revealed unstable streams were typified by departures from the reference state in compaction, soil loss, bare ground, litter dynamics, infiltration, and invasive species. These findings suggest that changes in these IIRH indicators should be monitored and managed by land managers to ensure that riparian function and ecosystem services are not compromised. Future research must continue to investigate the link between upland and riparian functions within a watershed, with special emphasis on vegetation dynamics. In the meantime, integrating these two assessments can provide land managers with vital information about maintaining ecological function throughout the watershed.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the alga Scenedesmus obliquus toxicity induced by textile-dyeing effluents (TDE). The toxicity indicator of TDE in alga at the physiological (algal growth), biochemical (chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) synthesis and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity) and structural (cell membrane integrity) level were investigated. Then we further study the relationship among toxicity indicators at physiological and biochemical level, and supplemented by research on algal biomacromolecules. According to the analysis of various endpoints of the alga, the general sensitivity sequence of toxicity endpoints of Scenedesmus obliquus was: SOD activity > Chl-a synthesis > algal growth. The stimulation rate of SOD activity increased from day 3 (57.25%similar to 83.02%) to day 6 (57.25%similar to 103.81%), and then decreased on day 15 (-4.23%similar to-32.96%), which indicated that the antioxidant balance system of the algal cells was destroyed. The rate of Chl-a synthesis inhibition increased gradually, reaching 19.70%similar to 79.39% on day 15, while the rate of growth inhibition increased from day 3 (-12.90% similar to 10.16%) to day 15 (-21.27%similar to 72.46%). Moreover, the algal growth inhibition rate was positively correlated with the inhibition rate of SOD activity or Chl-a synthesis, with the correlation coefficients were 0.6713 and 0.5217, respectively. Algal cells would be stimulating to produce excessive reactive oxygen species, which would cause peroxidation in the cells, thereby destroying chloroplasts, inhibiting chlorophyll synthesis and reducing photosynthesis. With increasing exposure time, irreversible damage to algae can lead to death. This study is expected to enhance our understanding of the ecological risks through algal tests caused by TDE.

AB  - Most states in the U.S. have a general water quality standard intended to protect water from all potential pollutants not specifically named or identified in other standards. Biological indicators are used, in part, to assess the level of water quality with respect to this general standard. Under EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program, impaired waters based on a biological assessment require an additional step compared with non-biological TMDLs. In non-biological TMDLs, the "pollutant" is typically the parameter being monitored, with a direct link to the impairment. In biological TMDLs, cause and effect must first be established between one or more pollutants and the impacted biological community. This article presents examples of approaches taken in different states to monitor and assess the biological health of our streams based on varying combinations of algal, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities. While fish are the ultimate integrator of lower ecological organisms, their occurrence and abundance has been greatly manipulated by humankind. Periphytic algae are perhaps the fastest responding biological population and can be used for some pollutant-specific diagnoses, but most states lack the expertise required for detailed taxonomic classification. Macroinvertebrates, the most commonly monitored biological community, are abundant in most streams, but most metrics are not diagnostic of specific stressors. Within the TMDL framework, issues are discussed related to setting TMDL targets, linking biological impairments with pollutants, and defining biological target endpoints. Although surrogate measures are often used for setting TMDL target loads, biological recovery is measured against biological endpoints. The use of biological indicators for assessment and development of biological TMDLs can be improved through modeling procedures that better define cause-and-effect relationships, through a better understanding of the limits of restoration, and through a more unified national policy that focuses on restoration.

AB  - The potential environmental impact of air pollutants emitted from the oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, has received considerable attention. The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts.Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest.
   Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.

AB  - The worldwide latest Cenomanian Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) was investigated for the planktonic foraminiferal assemblages in the type area of its sedimentary expression, the C-org-rich Bonarelli Level (Gubbio, central Italy). The 313 kyr preceding the onset of OAE2 and the 153 kyr following the end of this event were analyzed in the deep-water setting of the Bottaccione section (Umbria-Marche Basin). For the first time, a high-resolution approach and quantitative methods were applied.
   Several events and biotic changes, including the acme and crisis of different genera, were recognized. They provide evidence of a progressive and rapid deterioration of paleoenvironmental conditions, reaching a climax coincident with the Bonarelli Event, and of the subsequent, gradual (although not complete) recovery. Although no major mass extinction in planktonic foraminifera occurred across the Bonarelli Event, the extinction of the most specialized forms, i.e., the rotaliporids, and Globigerinelloides bentonensis, is recorded just before its onset.
   The observed pattern of marked changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages indicates five discrete phases of different degrees of environmental perturbation within the marine ecosystem. Phase I (313-55 kyr prior to the onset of OAE2) is characterized by a high planktonic foraminiferal abundance and diversity that imply a relatively stable environment, with different ecological niches occupied and stratified water column. On the other hand, relatively high percentages of hedbergellids and heterohelicids indicate a general meso-eutrophic environment and a well-developed oxygen minimum zone. Episodes of increased eutrophic conditions are indicated by pulses in abundance of radiolarians. A well-developed oxygen minimum zone may be related to a long-term change that precedes the onset of OAE2 (mid-Cenomanian Event). The most dramatic changes took place during Phase II and encompassed the last 55 kyr preceding deposition of the Bonarelli Level. The onset of a high-stress environment is clearly shown by the shift to a distinctly unstable planktonic foraminiferal structure, characterized by low species diversity and marked foraminiferal changes and events. Some of these took place at the same time (the rotaliporid crisis, the heterohelicid decline, the Hedbergella-Schackoina shift, the onset of the 'large form eclipse' when > 150 mum forms temporarily disappeared) followed by other sequential events (onset of dwarfism, schackoinid acme, and hedbergellid acme). The above-mentioned changes and events indicate for Phase II an increased surface productivity, enhanced oxygen minimum zone, and marked rapid changes of ecological parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity, trace metals). These marked foraminiferal changes culminate at the base of the Bonarelli Level with the temporary disappearance of all planktonic foraminifera. Phase III (100-900 kyr) coincides with the Bonarelli Level deposition and is characterized by highly eutrophic conditions, as indicated by radiolarian proliferation. Phase IV (35 kyr), similar to phase II except for the absence of rotaliporids, is characterized by the proliferation of the opportunistic hedbergellids and schackoinids, indicating that the environment remained ecologically unstable. The end of 'large form eclipse' marks the base of Phase V. During Phase V (118 kyr), planktonic foraminiferal. abundance and diversity return to values comparable to those of Phase I, showing the gradual recovery of the ecosystem. However, high numbers of hedbergellids and heterohelicids suggest that the environmental perturbation related to the Bonarelli Event did not end during this phase, but continued well beyond deposition of the organic-rich layers.
   Our analysis shows that, in deep-water settings, the severe paleoenvironmental perturbation induced by the Bonarelli Event led to assemblages dominated by the small-sized, opportunistic hedbergellids and schackoinids. At the same time, the small-sized and presumably low-oxygen-tolerant, opportunistic heterohelicids underwent a marked decline. This scenario may be related to the exceptionally high-nutrient and low-oxygen content of the seawater, but also to variation of other ecological parameters. The perforate, elongated chambers and tubulospines of schackoinids may represent the best survivorship tool to have achieved better oxygen and nutrient uptake. We infer that schackoinids are useful indicators for extremely stressed environments in low- to middle-latitude, open-marine, deep-water settings during the Late Cretaceous.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the relationships of combining ability, hybrid performance and genetic distance using Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) data and other data sets obtained from analysis of agronomic performance of the CIMMYT maize inbred lines. For this purpose, 13 lines and four testers were crossed through controlled pollination in a line x tester design scheme to develop 52 hybrids. These hybrids were evaluated together with two standard checks (KSC704 and KSC705) for grain yield under two soil moisture environments for two years (2014-2015). Pair-wise genetic distance (GD) was estimated based on Jaccard (J) and simple matching (SM) coefficients. The variance components of specific combining ability (SCA) were higher than general combining ability (GCA), hence non-additive gene effects contributed to hybrid performance. There was no coincidence between the SRAP data and morphological assessments in this study. Significant and positive association of general combining ability with mid parent heterosis (MPH) under drought stress conditions is an indicator that GCA can be useful to predict MPH during selections under water stress conditions. However, correlations of genetic distances with heterosis under both conditions were too low to be predictive of hybrid vigor.

AB  - Cocoa beans are produced all across the humid tropics under different environmental conditions provided by the region but also by the season and the type of production system. Agroforestry systems compared to monocultures buffer climate extremes and therefore provide a less stressful environment for the understory cocoa, especially under' seasonally varying conditions. We measured the element concentration as well as abiotic stress indicators (polyamines and total phenolic content) in beans derived from five different production systems comparing monocultures and agroforestry systems and from two harvesting seasons. Concentrations of N, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn were higher in beans produced' in agroforestry systems with high stem density and leaf area index. In the dry season, the N, Fe, and Cu concentration of the beans increased. The total phenolic content increased with proceeding of the dry season while other abiotic stress indicators like speimine decreased, implying an effect of the water availability on the chemical composition of the beans. Agroforestry systems did not buffer the variability of stress indicators over the seasons compared to monocultures. The effect of environmental growing conditions on bean chemical composition was not strong but can contribute to variations in cocoa bean quality.

AB  - The horticultural industry is significantly influenced by climatic factors that cannot be accurately predicted. The aim of this study is to substantiate the species and varietal composition of plantations that provide maximum profit, taking into account the attractiveness of the variety and the influence of weather conditions on the results of management. Using the methods of game theory, analysis, and comparison, a game-theoretic model of the species and varietal composition of fruit plantations has been developed. The first matrix of the game contains "pure" strategies that consider only the placement of stone fruits of different ripening periods and "pure" strategies of nature that characterize the possible weather conditions affecting stone fruits. The second matrix of the game consists of "pure" strategies that consider the setting of only pome crops of different ripening periods and "clean" strategies that characterize possible weather conditions affecting the sowing of pome crops. On the basis of the processed material and the calculated indicators, the composition of groups of varieties of pome and stone fruit crops by ripeness for the enterprise is proposed. The results obtained show that the use of a theoretical and game model is effective for the development and selection of the best production solutions under conditions of uncertainty when the production process is highly dependent on random factors.

AB  - Underground excavations in which an airflow is present are affected by both natural and technological sources of heat. As a result, the air flowing through the mine excavations is characterised by high temperatures, which-combined with high humidity-causes microclimatic conditions to deteriorate. Bad microclimatic conditions affect miners underground, causing a reduction of perception, concentration, attention, and perceptiveness. This negative influence of temperature and humidity on the human body is referred to as the climatic hazard. For this reason, the design of ventilation and air conditioning systems to be implemented in underground mining plants is an issue of increasing significance. This article investigates the performance of cooling systems in the Polish hard-coal mining industry. Based on the conducted research on air-cooling installations in six hard-coal mines, the actual efficiency of air-cooling is presented. The calculated values of cooling power were compared with the design intent. The obtained results have allowed identifying with greater precision the factors that diminish the efficiency of cooling systems in the mining plants under analysis. These factors may be treated on equal terms with key performance indicators (KPIs), which can be used to monitor the performance of cooling system components and to provide managers with high-level indicators on which decisions can be based.

AB  - Males and females share the same physiological transportation systems and phenomenological mechanism to exchange heat and mass with the environment. Nevertheless, a literature review shows that they have significantly distinctive anatomies, metabolic rates, and hormonal cycles, all of which influence individual comfort conditions. Moreover, how to obtain thermal environments that suit everyone?s thermal comfort conditions remains unclear. Therefore, computational models were proposed to compare thermal behaviors in different environments for two males (one dressed in a suit and the other in lighter clothing) and two females with the same office clothing (in the luteal and follicular phases). Exergy indicators were compared with traditional indices used to assess thermal comfort in air conditioning environments. The minimum points of destroyed exergy had similar occurrences to PMV = 0 and PPD = 5%. The environmental temperature in which the exergy minimums occurred varied by approximately 5% compared to traditional energy indices. It was concluded that females demand higher comfort temperatures than men. Women's comfort temperatures in the luteal phase were similar to men in lighter clothing and lower during the follicular phase. Higher environmental temperatures respecting the use lightweight clothing implies a lower energy expenditure, with a reduction of electricity by approximately 22%.

AB  - The Miran oilfield is one of the new oil fields in Kurdistan region, northern Iraq, located in the Sulaimani Governorate. Twelve Cuttings samples from the Upper Jurassic Naokelekan and Barsarin formations in well Miran-2 were selected for detailed organic geochemical investigations. All the samples were subjected to bitumen extraction in order to study any biomarkers present using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The dominance of low-molecular-weight n-alkanes and other calculated parameters indicate a marine source for the organic matter derived from planktonic algal and bacterial precursors deposited under anoxic conditions. The isoprenoids/n-alkanes ratios indicate type II and mixed II/III kerogen for both formations. The type II/III kerogen is characteristic of transitional environment under anoxic to dysoxic conditions as also indicated by the homohopane index for studied samples. More argillaceous carbonate rocks were deposited when reducing conditions were prevalent. Medium to high gammacerane index values in the rock extracts probably indicate a stratified water column during deposition of both formations. The studied samples from both formations have entered peak oil window maturity as reflected from the biomarker ratios from both aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the extracts.

AB  - Indoor climate affects health and productivity of the occupants in office buildings, yet in many buildings of this type indoor climate conditions are not well-controlled due to insufficient heating or cooling capacity, high swings of external or internal heat loads, improper control or operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, etc. However, maintenance of good indoor environmental conditions in buildings requires increased investments and possible higher energy consumption. This paper focuses on the relation between investment costs for retrofitting HVAC equipment as well as decreased energy use and improved performance of occupants in office buildings. The cost-benefit analysis implementation algorithm is presented in this paper, including energy survey of the building, estimation of occupants dissatisfied by key indoor climate indicators using questionnaire survey and measurements. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis is used in the proposed method for data processing. A case study of an office building is presented in order to introduce an application example of the proposed method. Results of the study verify the applicability of the proposed algorithm and TOPSIS analysis as a practical tool for office building surveys in order to maximize productivity by means of cost efficient technical building retrofitting solutions.

AB  - Previous attempts to identify the environmental conditions associated with the development of siliceous duricrusts have used differences in bulk chemical compositions and cement mineralogy amongst other criteria to distinguish between samples. High (up to 3.00%) levels of TiO2, together with petrographic characteristics, have been used as an indicator of past wetter climatic conditions, often failing to fully emphasise the potential importance of local controls upon micromorphology and chemistry. In southern Africa, silcretes from the Cape Coastal zone associated with deep-weathering profiles have been attributed to formation under wetter conditions whereas Kalahari silcretes are suggested to have formed under more arid, alkaline conditions.
   Petrographic and geochemical analyses of silcretes from five locations within the Kalahari Desert of Botswana (one site associated with deeply-weathered bedrock) indicate the great micromorphological complexity of Kalahari silcretes. It is suggested that variations in the host material composition of Kalahari silcretes are an important control of their chemistry. Silcretes have developed from unconsolidated Kalahari Sand with variations in the mineral content of the host sediment appearing to cause variation in silcrete geochemistry. Geochemical analysis confirms that TiO2 provides the main variation between Kalahari and Cape Coastal silcretes but the low levels of TiO2 in Kalahari samples are attributed to differences in host material as opposed to overriding climatic controls.

AB  - Background, Aim and Scope. Continuous application of pesticides may pollute soils and affect non-target organisms. Soil is a complex ecosystem; its components can modulate the effects of pesticides. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the potential environmental risk of these compounds in local conditions. We performed an integrated field-laboratory study on an Argentine soya field sprayed with glyphosate and chlorpyrifos under controlled conditions. Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of a series of endpoints for the assessment of adverse effects of the extensive use of these agrochemicals.
   Materials and Methods. A RR soya field in a traditional farming area of Argentina was sprayed with glyphosate (GLY) or chlorpyrifos (CPF) formulations at the commercially recommended rates, according to a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. In laboratory assays, Eisenia fetida andrei were exposed to soil samples (0-10 cm depth) collected between the rows of soya. Endpoints linked to behavior and biological activity (reproduction, avoidance behavior and bait-lamina tests) and cellular/subcellular assays (Neutral Red Retention Time NRRT; DNA damage - Comet assay) were tested. Field assays included litterbag and bait-lamina tests. Physico/chemical analyses were performed on soil samples.
   Results. GLY reduced cocoon viability, decreasing the number of juveniles. Moreover, earthworms avoided soils treated with GLY. No effects on either reproduction or on avoidance were observed at the very low CPF concentration measured in the soils sampled 10 days after treatment. Both pesticides caused a reduction in the feeding activity under laboratory and field conditions. NRRT was responsive to formulations of CPF and GLY. Comet assay showed significantly increased DNA damage in earthworms exposed to CPF treated soils. No significant differences in DNA migration were observed with GLY treated soils. Litterbag field assay showed no differences between treated and control plots.
   Discussion. The ecotoxicological effects of pesticides can be assessed by monitoring the status of communities in real ecosystems or through the use of laboratory toxicity tests. Litterbag field test showed no influence of the treatments on the organic matter breakdown, suggesting a scarce contribution of soil macrofauna. The bait-lamina test, however, seemed to be useful for detecting the effects of GLY and CPF treatments on the activity of the soil fauna. CPF failed to give significant differences with the controls in the reproduction test and the results were not conclusive in the avoidance test. Although the field population density of earthworms could be affected by multiple factors, the effects observed on the reproduction and avoidance tests caused by GLY could contribute to its decrease, with the subsequent loss of their beneficial functions. Biomarkers measuring effects on sub-organism level could be useful to predict adverse effects on soil organisms and populations. Among them, NRRT, a lysosomal destabilization biomarker, resulted in demonstrating more sensitivity than the reproduction and avoidance tests. The Comet assay was responsive only to CPE Since DNA damage can have severe consequences on populations, it could be regarded as an important indicator to be used in the assessment of soil health. Conclusions. Reproduction and avoidance tests were sensitive indicators of GLY exposure, with the former being more labor intensive. Bait-lamina test was sensitive to both CPF and GLY. NRRT and Comet assays revealed alterations at a subcellular level, and could be considered complementary to the biological activity tests. Because of their simplicity, some of these bioassays seemed to be appropriate pre-screening tests, prior to more extensive and invasive testing.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. This study showed deleterious effects of GLY and CPF formulations when applied at the nominal concentrations recommended for soya crops. Further validation is needed before these endpoints could be used as field monitoring tools in Argentine soya soils (ecotoxicological risk assessment - ERA tools).

AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria produce chains of magnetite crystals within a cell, Bacterial magnetites have characteristic morphologies and sizes that are strictly biologically controlled. We examined morphologies of fossil bacterial magnetites (magnetofossils) preserved in Pacific deep-sea sediments and their relations to organic carbon fluxes, Isotropic crystals dominate magnetofossils in sediments in relatively oxidized conditions, and anisotropic crystals predominate in more reduced conditions. Our finding has important implications for biomineralization processes and demonstrates the potential of magnetofossil morphology as a paleoenvironmental indicator.

AB  - In this review, we discuss the role of hedgerow structure and condition in determining the value of hedgerow habitat for biodiversity conservation within an agricultural context, to inform and evaluate hedgerow management decisions and policy. Through a systematic literature review, narrative synthesis and vote counting, key structural condition indicators were identified for a range of conservation priority taxa. Abundance, survival or fecundity of ground vegetation, birds, mammals and invertebrates were affected by height, width, woody biomass, foliar quality and quantity, and gappiness of hedgerows. Although general patterns may not occur, a response to a particular structural feature can vary both within and between taxonomic groups, many responses are synergistic and interdependent. In conclusion, the definition of a "good quality" hedgerow for biodiversity conservation should be expanded to include all those key structural features which are important across taxa. Furthermore, the importance of heterogeneity in hedgerow structural condition is highlighted, where no fixed set of hedgerow characteristics were found to benefit all taxa. If uniform hedgerow management is over prescribed, as has been the tendency with some agri-environment schemes, some species (including those of conservation concern) are likely to be adversely affected by a loss of suitable habitat or resource decline.

AB  - In many European shelters, dogs may spend many years confined. A poor environment and inappropriate management may lead to a low quality of life. The absence of harmonised European regulatory frameworks defining the minimum requirements for shelter facilities makes the definition of welfare standards for kennelled dogs challenging. Here, a new protocol was developed and tested to help identify the main welfare issues for shelter dogs. Twenty-six indicators were identified including management, resource and animal based measures. Accuracy and interobserver reliability were checked between four assessors. The protocol was applied in 29 shelters (n=1308 dogs) in six European countries. Overall prevalence of poor health conditions was below 10%. Test-retest reliability and validity of the protocol were investigated with encouraging results. A logistic regression was carried out to assess the potential of the protocol as a tool to identify welfare hazards in shelter environments. Inappropriate space allowance, for example, was found to be a risk factor potentially affecting the animal's cleanliness, skin condition and body condition. The protocol was designed to be concise and easy to implement. Systematic data collection could help identify welfare problems that are likely to arise in certain shelter designs and thus determine improvement in animal care standards.

AB  - Many traits associated with domestication are suggested to have developed as correlated responses to reduced fear of humans. Tameness may have reduced the stress of living in human proximity and improved welfare in captivity. We selected Red Junglefowl (ancestors of all domestic chickens) for four generations on high or low fear towards humans, mimicking an important aspect of the earliest period of domestication, and tested birds from the third and fourth generation in three different social tests. Growth and plumage condition, as well as size of eggs and offspring were also recorded, as indicators of some aspects of welfare. Birds selected for low fear had higher weight, laid larger eggs and generated larger offspring, and had a better plumage condition. In a social dominance test they also performed more aggressive behaviour and received less of the same, regardless of whether the restricted resource was feed or not. Hence, dominance appeared to increase as a consequence of reduced fear of humans. Furthermore, egg size and the weight of the offspring were larger in the less fearful birds, and plumage condition better, which could be interpreted as the less fearful animals being better adapted to the environment in which they were selected.

AB  - Animal welfare is a growing societal concern and the well-being of animals used for experimental purposes is under particular scrutiny. The vast majority of laboratory animals are mice living in small cages that do not offer very much variety. Moreover, the experimental procedure often takes very little time compared to the time these animals have been bred to the desired age or are being held available for animal experimentation. However, for the assessment of animal welfare, the time spent waiting for an experiment or the time spent after finishing an experiment has also to be taken into account. In addition to experimental animals, many additional animals (e.g. for breeding and maintenance of genetic lines, surplus animals) are related to animal experimentation and usually face similar living conditions. Therefore, in terms of improving the overall welfare of laboratory animals, there is not only a need for refinement of experimental conditions but especially for improving living conditions outside the experiment. The improvement of animal welfare thus depends to a large extent on the housing and maintenance conditions of all animals related to experimentation. Given the current state of animal welfare research there is indeed a great potential for improving the overall welfare of laboratory animals.

AB  - This study examined seasonal variations in tissue metal contamination and physiological condition of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from a clean lake (Halfway Lake) and a metal-contaminated environment (Whitson Lake) in spring, summer, and fall of 1999. Dietary metal content influenced liver metal concentrations, especially for cadmium. Fulton's condition factor (FCF), an indicator of recent feeding activity, was lower in Whitson fish except in summer, when higher FCF values corresponded with higher liver copper concentrations, presumably because of higher feeding rate. Tissue protein concentrations and indicators of biosynthetic capacities (nucleoside diphosphate kinase and RNA/DNA ratios) suggested lower biosynthesis in Whitson fish. Muscle aerobic and anaerobic capacities (using citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase as indicators, respectively) were consistently lower in Whitson fish, with maximal differences in summer. In contrast, although liver aerobic capacities were generally comparable among populations, anaerobic capacities were much higher in Whitson fish. Finally, gill sodium/potassium adenosinetriphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase) activity peaked in the spring in fish from both lakes, and higher activities were correlated with elevated gill copper concentrations. This study highlights the importance of seasonal variations in tissue metal concentrations and fish condition. This information is essential to evaluate the extent of impairment in condition faced by metal-contaminated wild fish.

AB  - Threats of changing climatic conditions on Himalayan agriculture communities are well established and observed. predisposed marginalized social and fragile ecological conditions have increased vulnerability of these communities. However, as vulnerability varies spatially and is effected by the bio-geographical conditions, the information on vulnerability distribution among the different biogeographic zones (BZs) is of value. This study aims to assess impact of social and ecological dimensions on vulnerability of agricultural communities in different biogeographical zones of Himalaya. Inherent vulnerability in different BZs was assessed at village level by performing hierarchal additive clustering. A total of 39 indicators (16 for ecological and 23 for social) were considered and weighed by Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP). The spatial distribution of different vulnerability indices was analyzed by Global and Local Moran's Index. The results show presence of very high social vulnerability (0.71 +/- 0.11) for middle Himalayas (BZ2) and higher ecological vulnerability (0.68 +/- 0.13) for lower Himalayas (BZ1). Among the different zones, middle Himalayas (BZ2) shows the maximum inherent vulnerability. The present study aids the policy-makers and stakeholders in identifying the regions requiring immediate intervention. The study also highlights the factors among social or ecological dimensions which require greater attention than others.

TI  - USING THE METABOLIC CAPACITY OF RHODOBACTER-SPHAEROIDES TO ASSESS HEAVY-METAL TOXICITY
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY
LA  - English
AB  - Heavy metals can produce differential toxic effects an bacterial growth depending on the kind of metabolism the cells are using in relation to oxygen. Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a purple, nonsulfur, photosynthetic, gram-negative bacterium that grows preferentially in anaerobic conditions acting as a photoheterotroph, but it can also behave as a photoautotroph. In aerobic conditions, this microorganism has a chemoheterotrophic metabolism. Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism may differ in their susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity. The metabolic duality of R. sphaeroides allowed us to assay this issue.
   After incubation of R. sphaeroides, several indicators of bacterial growth such as optical density, dissolved oxygen concentration, protein content, and pigment content were determined. The parameter values obtained showed that the inhibitory effect exerted by zinc and cadmium on R. sphaeroides was stronger in aerobic conditions than in anaerobic ones. Microbial growth was considerably reduced when heavy metal concentration was higher than 1 mg L(-1). Besides, R. sphaeroides was quite tolerant to copper. Cultures to which copper was added from 0.01 to 10 mg L(-1) showed a relatively constant growth, both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
   Thus, we have shown that assessment of heavy metal toxicity using bacterial tests must take into account that bacteria may react in a different way when grown in anaerobic environments. (c) 1993 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - A bioluminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum has been used widely as an indicator of pollutants where the presence of toxic chemicals decreases light output. The optimum conditions for the growth and bioluminescence of P. phosphoreum KCTC 2852 were investigated using modified Boss medium and two environmental conditions (pH and temperature). Optimized conditions that supported growth of P. phosphoreum with high bioluminescence intensities were: NaCl (20 g/L), glycerol (2.5 g/L), peptone (1.0 g/L), and yeast extract (1.0 g/L). Growth and bioluminescence gradually increased as pH increased reaching a maximum at pH 7.0. The maximum temperature for growth and bioluminescence was 20 degrees C. Based on these optimum conditions for bioluminescence, a continuous culture reactor of P. phosphoreum was operated. During the continuous operation, the optimized medium maintained bioluminescence with a high relative light unit (RLU) around 13,600 for more than 120 h. When zinc (0.5 mg/L) was added to the reactor, an EC50 was observed in 15 min. The detection limit was improved by using the modified Boss medium since the modified Boss medium contained less organic matter which minimizes the complexation and precipitation of heavy metals compared to other enrichment media with high levels of organic matter.

AB  - This work describes the experimental determination of the major degradation and sorption parameters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a sensitive marine environment, the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). The persistence and sorption of complex PAH mixtures were analysed in the laboratory in conditions mimicking open-sea and coastal sediments, which differ in grain size and organic carbon content and are characterized by different oceanographic conditions including abiotic influences. The study investigated how sediment type and texture and salinity, temperature and solar irradiation conditions affect the partitioning of low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs into aqueous and solid phase, which critically influence their behaviour. With regard to the change from offshore to coastal conditions, HMW PAHs were found to be more sensitive to the increased salinity (from 21 to < 37 parts per thousand), whereas LMW PHAs were more sensitive to the temperature increase (from 11 to 22 degrees C). HMW PAHs were more affected by sediment type changes in terms of distribution coefficient (K-d). Since the physicochemical properties of organic pollutants affect their distribution, transport, bioavailability and toxicity, analysing the accumulation and persistence of dissolved pollutants can provide useful information for environmental risk assessment and management.

AB  - The Bima Formation is the oldest lithogenetic unit occupying the base of the Cretaceous successions in the Yola Sub-basin of the Northern Benue Trough. It is differentiated into Lower (B1), Middle (B2) and Upper (B3) Bima Members. Integrated organic and inorganic geochemical studies were applied on the lacustrine sediments of the Bima Formation with the aim of reconstructing the palaeodepositional environment and organic matter input in response to climate and tectonism. The analysed sediments were deposited in a freshwater lacustrine environment with a low-salinity stratified water column and suboxic to relatively anoxic conditions, as indicated by the bulk geochemical parameters. The biomarkers provide evidence for a contribution of aquatic algae and microorganisms, with a significant amount of terrigenous organic matter input. The preservation of the organic matter is possibly attributed to the stratified water column with low salinity and suboxic to relatively anoxic conditions. Based on the geochemistry of major and trace elements, the sediments were deposited during semi-arid climatic conditions within passive continental margin setting. This agrees with the tectonic events in the West and Central African Rift System (WCARS) during the Early Cretaceous period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the temperate zone, food availability and winter weather place serious constraints on European Barn Owl Tyto alba populations. Using data collected over 22years in a Swiss population, we analysed the influence of early pre-breeding food conditions and winter severity on between-year variations in population size and reproductive performance. To estimate pre-breeding food conditions, we attempted a novel approach based on an index that combines Tawny Owl Strix aluco reproductive parameters and the occurrence of wood mice Apodemus sp. in their diet. Tawny Owls breed earlier in the season than Barn Owls and are strongly dependent on the abundance of wood mice for breeding. This index was strongly positively associated with the number of breeding pairs and early breeding in the Barn Owl. Winter severity, measured by snow cover and low temperatures, had a pronounced negative influence on the size of the breeding population and clutch size. Food conditions early in the breeding season and winter severity differentially affect the Barn Owl life cycle. We were able to use aspects of the ecology and demography of the Tawny Owl as an indicator of the quality of the environment for a related species of similar ecology, in this case the Barn Owl.

AB  - Some studies have found intermediate heritabilities for fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in traits, but almost all of these are flawed and/or based on laboratory experiments. We therefore tested if there was heritable variation for FA in bristle and wing traits in three field collections of Drosophila melanogaster by rearing F(1)s from field flies under laboratory conditions. One of the collections was reared to the F-2 generation in the laboratory to compare heritability estimates from the laboratory with those from the field-laboratory comparison. Trait means indicated an increase in size under laboratory rearing. FAs increased in one collection, decreased in another collection, and showed no changes in the third collection under laboratory rearing. FAs from the collections tended to converge under laboratory conditions. Morphological traits were heritable under field conditions. However, FA was not significantly heritable for any of the individual traits or when FA was determined by combining traits. Comparisons of the two laboratory generations showed that FA heritability was low under laboratory conditions, in contrast to the morphological traits themselves. These findings suggest a very low heritability for FA in held and laboratory Drosophila. FA in bristle and wing traits may therefore be a poor indicator of genetic quality in Drosophila..

AB  - The purpose of structural health monitoring is to provide information by making a simultaneous diagnosis of the status of the structure. Despite aging, environmental conditions and unforeseen circumstances, the construction should remain as specified in the design. Changing the environmental conditions causes the sensor and the host structure to change material properties. It is essential to take into account environmental conditions to prevent misdiagnosis. Therefore, the real cause of the change can be determined.
   In this study, the behavior of constrained piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS)/Al 7075 was investigated by using electromechanical impedance method (EMI) under changing environmental conditions. Numerical studies on this material in the literature are limited and all the experimental/numerical results are compensated for the temperature effect and analyzed using curve/probabilistic fitting approach for the first time. The sample used in the experimental work was modeled in ANSYS finite element program. In the experimental and numerical results, it has been observed that as the temperature decreases, the frequency shifts to the right and the amplitude increases. The experimental and simulation results were nearly the same. The temperature effect was compensated using the compensation algorithm for experimental and numerical studies. The results were compared using damage metrics. The experimental results were analyzed using a curve/probabilistic fitting approach.

AB  - Adaptive vegetation management is time-consuming and requires long-term colony monitoring to obtain reliable results. Although vegetation management has been widely adopted, the only method existing at present for evaluating the habitat conditions under management involves observations over a long period of time. The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has long been used as an indicator of environmental stress in plants, and has recently been intensely studied. Among such ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is relatively stable, and can be conveniently and accurately quantified. Thus, the quantification of plant H2O2 could be applied as a stress indicator for riparian and aquatic vegetation management approaches while evaluating the conditions of a plant species within a habitat. This study presents an approach for elucidating the applicability of H2O2 as a quantitative indicator of environmental stresses on plants, particularly for vegetation management. Submerged macrophytes and riparian species were studied under laboratory and field conditions (Lake Shinji, Saba River, Eno River, and Hii River in Japan) for H2O2 formation under various stress conditions. The results suggest that H2O2 can be conveniently applied as a stress indicator in environmental management. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - High voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs) play a critical role on providing the desired reliability, and resiliency in power systems. In order to extend their lifetime and predict the failures, various maintenance policies could be applied on these critical components. Amongst these strategies, condition-based maintenance (CBM) provides a satisfactory agreement with future smart environment. This paper aims to provide an insight into the relevant developments in this subject and to explore the viable visions compatible with future research stream. Accordingly, three directions, i.e., diagnostic signals, intelligent modelling and using monitoring data in asset management have been addressed in this paper. It presents challenges dealing with real-time assessment of the diagnostic signals relating to measurements, and analyses. Subsequently, the issues associated with using artificial intelligent (AI) and Machine learning for providing intelligent algorithms have been discussed. Finally, the connection between the monitoring data and the asset management approach is investigated. The latter is looking for the subjects including remaining lifetime estimation, prioritization, and health index definitions. This paper has attempted to make a bridge from past to future research trends in the failure diagnosis of HVCBs.

AB  - Background: Lactobacillus acidophilus has large beneficial impacts as a probiotic and the low viability of the bacteria and other probiotics in the extreme acidic-biliary conditions of gastrointestinal tract and food products have always encouraged researchers to seek approaches for improvement of these indicators. Material and method: Microencapsulation as one of the newest methods has revealed sub stantial out comes in this respect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological and protective features of beads obtained from the microencapsulation of L. acidophilus probiotic. Microencapsulation by calcium alginate and resistant starch was carried out through extrusion. Result and discussion: The strength of beads was determined within 12 h and the survival rate of encapsulated bacteria was as certained in the hydrochloric acid solution, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and a solution containing digestive powder during 120 min. conclusion: The results showed that the stability levels of beads were different in various media, whit physical tension playing an important role. Under adverse environmental conditions, microencapsulation with calcium alginate and resistant starch plays a critical role in the protection of L. acidophilus probiotic. The survival rate of microencapsulated bacteria in all conditions was significantly higher than free bacteria [p < 0.05].

AB  - Assessment of awake bruxism (AB) is problematic due to the inability to use continuous recordings during daytime activities. Recently, a new semi-instrumental approach was suggested, namely, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), via the use of a smartphone application. With the application, subjects are requested to report, at least 12 times per day, the status of their masticatory muscle activity (relaxed muscles, muscle bracing without tooth contact, teeth contact, teeth clenching, or teeth grinding). The aim of the present study was to test the association between a single observation point self-report and EMA assessment of AB. The most frequent condition recorded by the EMA was relaxed muscles (ca. 60%) and the least frequent was teeth grinding (less than 1%). The relaxed muscle condition also showed the lowest coefficient of variance over a seven-day period of report. Additionally, only the relaxed muscles and the muscle bracing conditions presented an acceptable ability to assess AB-positive and AB-negative subjects, as defined by single-point self-report questions. The combination between self-report and EMA may have the potential to promote our ability to assess AB. We suggest to re-consider the conditions of teeth contact and teeth grinding while using EMA to evaluate AB.

AB  - Broiler chicken welfare is under increasing scrutiny due to welfare concerns regarding growth rate and stocking density. This farm-based study explored broiler welfare in four conditions representing commercial systems varying in breed and planned maximum stocking density: (1) Breed A, 30 kg/m(2); (2) Breed B, 30 kg/m(2); (3) Breed B, 34 kg/m(2); (4) Breed C, 34 kg/m(2). Breeds A and B were 'slow-growing' breeds (<50 g/day), and Breed C was a widely used 'fast-growing' breed. Indicators of negative welfare, behavioural indicators of positive welfare and environmental outcomes were assessed. Clear differences between conditions were detected. Birds in Condition 4 experienced the poorest health (highest mortality and post-mortem inspection rejections, poorest walking ability, most hock burn and pododermatitis) and litter quality. These birds also displayed lower levels of behaviours indicative of positive welfare (enrichment bale occupation, qualitative 'happy/active' scores, play, ground-scratching) than birds in Conditions 1-3. These findings provide farm-based evidence that significant welfare improvement can be achieved by utilising slow-growing breeds. There are suggested welfare benefits of a slightly lower planned maximum stocking density for Breed B and further health benefits of the slowest-growing breed, although these interventions do not offer the same magnitude of welfare improvement as moving away from fast-growing broilers.

AB  - Evidence is limited regarding whether ambient monitoring can properly represent personal ozone exposure. We conducted a longitudinal panel study to measure personal exposure to ozone using real-time personal ozone monitors. Corresponding ambient ozone concentrations and possible influencing factors (meteorological conditions and activity patterns) were also collected. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze personalambient ozone concentration associations and possible influencing factors. Ambient ozone concentrations were around two to three times higher than personal ozone (43.1 mu g/m(3) on average) and their correlations were weak with small slopes (0.35) and marginal R square (R-M(2)) values (0.24). Larger R-M(2) values were found under high temperature (> 29.5 degrees C), low humidity (< 62.1%), good ventilation conditions (> 4 h) and for individuals spent longer time outdoors (> 0.6 h). In final model, personal ozone exposure was positively associated with ambient concentrations and ventilation conditions, but inversely correlated with ambient temperature and humidity. The models explained > 50% of personal ozone concentration variabilities. Our results highlight that ambient ozone concentration alone is not a suitable surrogate for individual exposure assessment. Meteorological conditions (temperature and humidity) and activity patterns (windows opening and outdoor activities) that affecting personal ozone exposure should be taken into account.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that generates piscirickettsiosis affecting salmonids in Chile. The bacterium has the adaptability to survive in the marine environment under multiple stressful conditions. In this sense, this work focused on the analysis of a gene battery associated with biofilm formation under different culture conditions and on the adaptability of this biofilm to different media. The results indicated that the strains LF-89, IBM-034 and IBM-040 were strong biofilm producers, evidencing adaptability to the media by increasing the amount of biofilm through successive growths. Transcript levels of six genes described in various bacteria and P. salmonis, considered to have metabolic functions, and playing a relevant role in biofilm formation, were analyzed to evaluate bacterial functionality in the biofilm. The genes mazE-mazF, implicated in biofilm and stress, were markedly overexpressed in the biofilm condition in the three strains. For its part, gene gltA, an indicator of metabolic activity and related to virulence inhibition in Salmonella typhimurium, also seems to restrain the pathogenesis process in P. salmonis by inhibiting the expression of the virulence-associated genes liso and tcf. Finally, the expression of the glnA gene suggests the use of glutamine as an essential element for the growth of the biofilm.

AB  - The evaluation of different genetic similarity indicators can assist to produce better designs for future breeding programs. In this study, RAPD, ISSR and AFLP markers and agro-morphological traits were used to investigate the genetic relationships in some barley genotypes. Phenotypic data were collected under water-limited (rainfed) and irrigation conditions during 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 crop seasons. Polymorphism was observed in reactions with 31 out of 34 tested RAPD primers, 20 out of 24 tested ISSR primers and 7 primer combinations in AFLP technique. ISSR and RAPD fingerprinting detected more polymorphic loci (44%) than the AFLP technique (18%). The average polymorphic information content (PIC), resolving power (Rp), marker index (MI) and effective multiplex ratio (EMR) values derived from the three different marker systems differed indicating that they vary in their discriminatory power (ISSR > AFLP > RAPD).
   RAPD primers OPC07, UBC51, E10 and UBC28, ISSR primers UBC841 and UBC864 and AFLP primer M-CAA + E-AAC were significantly more informative primers to distinguish barley genotypes. Out of three molecular marker systems, only RAPD-based genetic distance showed a poor correlation with the agro-morphological based distance under rainfed conditions. Either of three molecular markers systems were not significantly correlated with phenotypic trais under irrigation conditions.

AB  - We investigated if the foliar nutrient levels of trees, a proxy for tree nutrition, are closely related to the nutrient content of forest soils. In addition we investigated if the Yield Class, a proxy for the general growing conditions of a stand, is related to two common soil chemical indicators, the C:N ratio and the base saturation. We used a subset of the data from the Austrian Forest Monitoring System (WBS). Our analysis was restricted to sites on non-calcareous parent rock, where stands are dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies). Overall, the relation between tree nutrition, Yield Class, and soil chemical data was weak. Obviously spruce is able to extract the required sufficient amounts of nutrients at a wide range of soil chemical conditions. Spruce efficiently scavenges nutrients over a wide range of soil chemical conditions. Even on poor sites high foliar nutrient levels can be maintained, because nutrients taken up are kept in a tight biogeochemical cycle. We conclude that soil chemical conditions are weak predictors of the Yield Class. Other factors, such as climate and water relations, seem to exert a larger influence on the nutrition and growth rate of spruce forests.

AB  - Cattle often graze foothill rangelands in northern latitudes as a cost-effective alternative to being fed hay. In a 2-yr study, we determined whether exposure to winter wind elicits a stress response in pregnant cows (5-7 yr old) grazing a foothill rangeland. We measured several indicators of stress-response of cows which had (windbreak) or did not have (non-windbreak) access to windbreaks. In Winter 1 (1966-1997), backfat thickness increased on windbreak and non-windbreak cattle. Body condition scores of both groups were lower at the end of the trial. In Winter 2 (1997-1998), backfat thickness decreased for windbreak and non-windbreak cattle. Body condition scores did not change. Weight changes were minor both winters. Changes in backfat thickness indicated that cattle in Winter 1 were catabolizing more lean muscle tissue, whereas cattle in Winter 2 were catabolizing more fat. Cattle entered Winter 1 in lower body condition and mass than in Winter 2. Cattle with access to windbreaks tended to have a stronger cell-mediated immune response than non-windbreak cattle. Birth and weaning weights of calves, and calving interval were similar for windbreak and non-windbreak cattle. Neither winter elicited a strong stress response from cattle grazing this foothill rangeland, with or without access to windbreaks.

AB  - Studies on air quality within automotive vehicles are an emerging research area in Brazil, especially in the city of Sao Paulo, one of the most polluted cities in the world and with the largest fleet of vehicles in the country. Indoor air quality is an indicator of environmental health that takes into account, in addition to thermal comfort, factors that interfere in precarious air conditions, such as the presence of fungi, bacteria and carbon dioxide in indoor air-conditioned environments. The objective of the present study was to analyse the fungal contamination in air-conditioning filters collected from 21 automotive vehicles and the study found 17 fungal genera in all samples collected (100%), including toxigenic fungi such as Penicillium, Fusarim and Aspagillus, indicating that indoor air quality can compromise the health of a portion of the population, such as professional drivers. Among the Aspergillus genus, the results showed the presence of the A. flaves, A. niger, A. fumigatus, A. ochraceus and A. clavatus species, which cause severe allergic and pulmonary respiratory diseases. Air in artificially heated environments should provide comfort to its occupants but it may pose a risk to human health if the car filtration system is contaminated by pathogenic fungi.

AB  - The bacterial respiratory quinones and membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were measured to test the biochemical responses to the redox conditions after the respiration of diverse electron acceptors by microorganisms. Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN32 was examined for its growth with O-2, nitrate, ferrihydrite, ferric citrate, and sulfite as electron acceptors. The same parameters were also measured for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain G-20, Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15, Thioploca spp., two strains of magnetotactic bacteria (Magneteospirilum magnetotactium marine vibrioid strain MV-1 and M. sp. strain AMB-1), and environmental sediments. Microorganisms with aerobic respiratory of oxygen (MV-1 and AMB-1) have high ratios of mono-unsaturated to saturated straight chain PLFA and ubiquinone to menaquinone ratios; while those that conduct strict anaerobic respirations (G-20 with sulfate and GS-15 with ferric iron) have low ratios of mono-unsaturated to saturated straight chain PLFA and uniquinone to menaquinone ratios. The facultative respiratory of nitrate (Thioploca) has these parameters in the middle. The ratios of menaquinones to ubiquinones in CN32 cells systematically increase according to the increase of redox potential and bioavalibility of electron acceptors. The correlation between Sigma UQ-n/ Sigma MK-n ratios and redox conditions indicates the structure of respiratory quinone responses sensitively to the microbial ecophysiological conditions.

AB  - The Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration framework for making regional assessments of environmental flows requires a 'hydrologic foundation' of flow data for current and undeveloped conditions. This raises the question how long a record is needed for an adequate hydrologic foundation?

AB  - Lettuce growth under unstressed conditions was compared to growth under four limiting conditions, i.e. no phosphorus fertilization (0_P), no nitrogen fertilization (0_N), low light (LR) and water stress (WR) over two different growing periods. We investigated the adaptive changes in terms of the morphological and physiological leaf traits, identifying stress-specific and stable' indicators suitable for use in breeding programmes. The plants subjected to the WR treatments had lower leaf expansion and specific leaf area (SLA), as well as lower soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) values, stomatal conductance (POR), water index (WI) and leaf temperature (TIR) compared with plants in the unstressed CONTROL. Low light increased the leaf area (LA), SLA and leaf mass ratio (LMR). The 0_N treatment induced a general reduction in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, as well as strong changes in LMR and SLA. In general, 0_P induced less pronounced effects than the other treatments. Principal component analysis indicated that the stable and suitable selection indicators of adaptive changes for low nitrogen and low light conditions were LA, SLA, leaf area per unit total plant mass (LAR), LMR, SPAD and POR, while SPAD, POR, TIR and WI were suitable indicators for drought.

AB  - Fish rely on both chemical and visual cues to evaluate predation risk. Decisions with respect to activity partitioning in time (i.e., night vs. day) rely on accurate assessment of predation risk relative to energy intake; predation risk is generally thought to be lower at night at the expense of feeding opportunities. At night, the sensory complement model predicts greater reliance on chemical perception of risk. Under this condition, a lower ability to use vision should result in a more conservative response to chemical cues than during the day. We tested this hypothesis under natural conditions by comparing the alarm response of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar L., 1758) under summer day and night conditions in salmon nursery streams. We found that salmon responded to the alarm cues to a significantly greater extent at night. This suggests that the sensory complement model may be correct and that nocturnal perception of risk may be generally higher than previously believed for juvenile salmon in the wild. In the absence of a more precise indicator of risk (e.g., vision), a greater reliance on chemosensory risk assessment at night may cause fish to shift to more risk-adverse behaviour.

AB  - Light is an essential factor for organisms and affects the endocrine and stress regulation of fish in nature. However, sudden changes in light and dark conditions in artificial environments can negatively impact fish. In the present study, to evaluate the physiological and oxidative stress responses of goldfish (Carassius auratus) exposed to two different light conditions, sudden light changes and slowly dimming light changes for 24 h, we analyzed the mRNA expression and activity of stress indicators [corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)], levels of plasma cortisol and glucose, mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and activity of plasma oxidative stress indicators (superoxide dismutase and catalase). Consequently, the mRNA expressions and activities of CRH and POMC, plasma levels of cortisol and glucose, and mRNA expression of GR were found to be significantly increased during the light changes, particularly in the control group. Additionally, plasma levels of cortisol and glucose in the control group were significantly higher than those in the dimming group during the light changes. However, no significant differences in mRNA expression levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes both in the control and dimming groups were observed. These results indicate that dimming light induces less stress than sudden changes in light.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays) pollen is highly nutritious and can be used by predatory arthropods to supplement or replace a carnivorous diet. We demonstrate that maize pollen can be utilized by larvae of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) under laboratory conditions. Complete development on maize pollen was not possible, but 25% of neonates reached the third instar. When only one instar was fed with pollen and the other two instars with eggs of Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), 58-87% of the larvae reached the pupal stage. The experiments included pollen produced by nine cultivars: three genetically modified (GM) cultivars expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis proteins Cry1Ab or Cry3Bb1, their corresponding non-transformed near-isolines, and three conventional cultivars. Maize cultivars were grown in two batches in a glasshouse. Their pollen differed by up to 59% in total protein content, 25% in C:N ratio, and 14% in grain diameter, but the differences were inconsistent and depended on the batch. Lacewing performance was not affected by maize cultivar. For environmental risk assessment of GM plants, in planta studies must consider the variability among conventional cultivars, individual plants, batches, and environmental conditions when evaluating the ecological significance of differences observed between GM and near-isolines.

AB  - Using proteomic data as biomarkers of environmental pollution has the potential to be of a great interest in ecological risk assessment as they constitute early warning indicators of ecologically relevant effects on biological systems. To develop such specific and sensitive biomarkers, the use of a set of proteins is required and the identification of protein expression signatures (PES) may reflect the exposure to specific classes of pollutants. Using 2D-DIGE (Differential in Gel Electrophoresis) methodology, this study aimed at identifying specific PES on European eel (Anguilla anguilla) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 48 h in vitro exposure to two sublethal concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) (10 mu g/L and 1 mg/L) or cadmium (Cd) (1 mu g/L and 100 mu g/L). The present results have been supplemented with data of a first in vitro study on cells exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (10 mu g/L and 1 mg/L). A total of thirty-four protein spots, belonging to 18 different identified proteins found in all conditions, have been selected as possible biomarkers to develop a synthetic Integrated Biomarker Proteomic (IBP) index. IBP follows a dose response relationship with higher values at the highest tested concentration for each pollutant (Cd: 9.96; DDT: 7.44; PFOS: 7.94) compared to the lowest tested concentration (Cd: 3.81; DDT: 2.91; PFOS: 2.06). In a second step, star plot graphs have been applied to proteomic data in order to allow visual integration of a set of early warning responses measured with protein biomarkers. Such star plots permit to discriminate the type of pollutant inducing a proteomic response. We conclude that using IBP is relevant in environmental risk assessment, giving to this index the potential to be applied as a global index of proteome alteration in endangered species such as the European eel. Biological significance: In this study, 34 protein spots have been selected as possible biomarkers to develop a synthetic Integrated Biomarker Proteomic index (IBP). Results show that IBP follows a dose response relationship with higher values at the highest tested concentration for each pollutant compared to the lowest tested concentration. Star plot graphs have also been applied to proteomic data in order to allow visual integration of a set of early warning responses measured with protein biomarkers. Such star plots permit to discriminate the type of pollutant inducing a proteomic response. IBP is relevant in environmental risk assessment, giving to this index the potential to be applied as a global index of proteome alteration in endangered species such as the European eel.

AB  - Traditional effluent and ambient water column toxicity tests have been used widely for evaluating the contamination of stormwaters and sediments. These assays consist of a routine bioassay exposure design of 1 to 9 days using freshwater and marine/estuarine species known to be sensitive to a wide range of toxicants. While effluent toxicity may be indicative of sediment or stormwater toxicity in the receiving system, the exposure is different, and therefore toxicity cannot be readily predicted. Traditional, standardized, whole effluent toxicity (WET) test methods have been used effectively and also misused in evaluations of whole sediments, pore (interstitial) water, elutriates (extracts), and stormwaters. Results show these methods to be very sensitive to sediment and stormwater toxicity. These traditional toxicity tests are predictive of instream sediment or stormwater effects where significant contamination exists or where exposure concentrations are similar. Modifications of these standardized test methods to include sediments or pore waters have been shown to be as sensitive as short-term, whole sediment toxicity tests using benthic species. However, the added complexity of sediments and stormwaters (e.g., partitioning, high Kow compound bioavailability, suspended solids, sporadic exposures, multiple exposure pathways) dictates that traditional toxicity test applications be integrated into a more comprehensive assessment of ecologically significant stressors. The limitations of the WET testing approach and optimized sample collection and exposure alternatives are frequently ignored when implemented. Exposure to sporadic pulses of contaminants (such as in stormwaters) often produce greater toxicity than exposure to constant concentrations. Lethality from short-term pulse exposures may not occur for weeks after the high flow event due to uptake dynamics. Pore water and elutriate exposures remove sediment ingestion routes of exposure and alter natural sorption/desorption dynamics. Traditional toxicity tests may not produce reliable conclusions when used to detect the adverse effects of: fluctuating stressor exposures, nutrients, suspended solids, temperature, UV light, flow, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, endocrine disruption, or other important subcellular responses. This reality and the fact that ecologically significant levels of high K-ow compounds may not produce short-term responses in exposures dictates that additional and novel assessment tools be utilized in order to protect aquatic ecosystems. This inablilty to predict effects is largely a result of the complex biological response patterns that result from various combinations of stressor magnitudes, duration, and frequency between exposures and also the interactions of stressor mixtures, such as syngergistic effects of certain pesticides, metals, and temperature. In watersheds receiving multiple sources of stressors, accurate assessments should define spatial-temporal profiles of exposure and effects using a range of laboratory (such as WET tests) and novel in sine toxicity and bioaccumulation assays, with simultaneous characterizations of physicochemical conditions and indigenous communities.

AB  - Isoprenoid compound distributions were measured in sediment at two sites in Long Island Sound, one with oxygenated overlying water throughout the year, the other seasonally variable with hypoxia in summer. A comparison of these two sites showed that the initial rate and pathway of phytol degradation were strongly influenced by benthic faunal activity and environmental redox conditions. Solvent-extractable phytol (in detritus of phytoplankton origin) was rapidly converted into highly-bound phytol (in sediment matrix) after deposition. Paradoxically, dihydrophytol, a product of phytol reduction, was produced under oxic environmental conditions, apparently by macrofaunal digestion, Tn contrast, the 6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one and 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic acid, products of phytol oxidation, were formed under hypoxic environmental conditions during suboxic or sulfidic microbial metabolism. Incubation of planktonic material further revealed the difference in degradation pathway between oxic and anoxic conditions. Degradation processes of phytol and its derivatives were quantified based on a conceptual model and incubation data. Relatively greater preservation of isoprenoid compounds at the periodically low oxygen site may result from the higher input of planktonic detritus and slower degradation rate than at the continuously oxic site.

AB  - This paper presents a proposed method to search Maximum Power Point (MPP) based on the Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Control (AFLC), which is applied to photovoltaic (PV) systems under varying temperatures and radiations. The proposed system is composed of boost converter, two fuzzy controllers and load. Whenever environmental conditions change in wide range, using only Conventional Fuzzy Logic Controller (CFLC) is not adequate and causes more errors in tracking. The proposed AFLC comprises two stages: Online and Online tuning. The offline method, by accurately setting CFLC controller parameters, is applied for relatively stable atmospheric conditions. Meanwhile, the online method is considered for unstable atmospheric conditions and contains two fuzzy controllers - one primary, one secondary. The primary fuzzy controller is the CFLC, and the secondary controller is the decision-making, which due to atmospheric conditions, alters the primary fuzzy controller parameters in order to achieve a better answer compared to utilizing CFLC. Decision-making controller with changing in irradiation and temperature changes gain of inputs of CFLC, simultaneously, that it increases rate and accuracy of tracking in comparison with using only fuzzy controller. By simulating results using CFLC and AFLC controllers, the proposed method is able to improve performance indicators with respect to CFLC. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - Planning and decision making in forestry is characterized with a high degree of complexity due to multiple goals of forest management. The principle of the sustainable development is incorporated in management and utilization of forests and forest land in a way that adheres to biological diversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and potential of the forest to fulfill, now and in the future, its important economical, ecological and social functions. All of the above complicates the performing of daily forestry operations, while managers are conditioned to perform constant analyzes of all relevant management indicators. The emphasis in these analyzes is put on standardized natural and financial indicators of production and management. In this highly dynamical period for the management of natural resources forestry experts need models in which different accounting and financial data is transformed into easily usable information. In such circumstances methods and techniques that can contribute to more reliable planning and to more objective decision making are of great importance, as are the models of objective analysis and management result-scoring methods.
   This paper provides an overview of models which take into consideration simultaneously several criteria, so that they can provide more comprehensive measures of management, and to serve as a background for planning and decision making. Several methods of multiple-criteria decision making has been described and compared. Brief description and comparison presented in the paper includes following multi-criteria methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), outranking methods, voting methods and stochastic multicriteria analysis (SMAA). The goal is to explain for which types of tasks and problems these methods can be applied in the field of forestry. That provides an insight into characteristics of the respective methods and a guideline to eventual choice of which method to apply. A valuable contribution on the role and significance of the multiple-criteria decision making models in forestry is provided through cited papers, and specially through concrete example of the application of such models through the research performed within "Hrvatske sume" Ltd. Zagreb. In this research the efficiency of organizational units in the Croatian forestry is evaluated by applying DEA. The results of relative efficiency are based on calculation of output oriented CCR and BCC models. Frequency of efficient units in reference set of inefficient units is given. The sources and values of inefficiencies are established and the impact of structural characteristics on relative efficiency of forest offices is shown. Forest offices are also grouped by Forest Administrations and regions they belong to.
   In the selection and application of multiple-criteria decision making methods a special attention must be paid to the quality and availability of information which are needed for the analysis and grading of alternatives, according to the set criteria. An appropriate method must be chosen in a way in which all the data available with the reasonable amount of effort and dedication could be utilised as fully as possible. It is also good to apply models which decision makers and other stakeholders can understand, and whose results and calculations they can easily illustrate and interpret. However, practical multiple-criteria decision making applications are usually too "technical", so real cases and situations are either over-simplified, or they are too complex for application, comprehension and interpretation. In such conditions their application in decision making and management often needs special knowledge and/or help of trained experts. At the same time, the differences in the types of individuals involved in the process of planning and decision making has to be also taken into consideration. People differ between each other in knowledge and skills, and they are differently prepared do participate in analyzes and decision making. Recent studies demonstrate to the usage of hybrid methods, or to the usage of several models and techniques simultaneously Interactive application of several methods contributes to the efficiency of the analyzes, that is to the objectivity and to the reliability of estimates, but also to learning and raising capacities.
   In forestry, planning and decision making is often based on more or less incomplete information, missing information, or sometimes on purely descriptive information. In that way the process of forest management is tackled with much of insecurity, incertitude and risk, which does not allow precise estimates and planning. In that context the methods of multiple-criteria decision making, such as AHP and SMAA, have potential for the wider acceptance in forestry and natural resource management. Multiple-criteria models cannot replace traditional tools and procedures in forest planning; on the contrary, they should be complementary. In that sense, the numerical simulations and optimizations are important for the estimation of future production abilities and decision making related to production planning, although they may not be able to enlist all the relative problems of multi-functional forest management. In that cases their estimations and results, as any other information sources (such as GIS, expert judgments, subjective preferences of descriptive data) can be used within a common framework with the methods of multiple-criteria decision making.
   In the last few years, the research and the application of multiple-criteria decision making models has been widely represented in many areas, and especially in the management of natural resources. Additionally, besides scientists and researchers these methods have gained interest of experts and practitioners. In forestry they are applied with an intention of better responding to current challenges in forest management. The complexity of business environment, the imperative of ecological acceptability and business success with simultaneous sustainable management of forests creates a demand for new and more precise models and techniques in forestry. Through development and application of analysis which encompasses different models of multiple-criteria decision making it is possible to contribute to more simplified analysis, planning and foreseeing in forest management. Generally, it is considered that multiple-criteria decision making models in forestry, as in other business systems, can be very strong support to planning and decision making.

AB  - Hydrogen production from renewable electricity in power-to-gas concepts is promising for future energy storage systems since hydrogen offers high energy density and can be used emission free. Economically viable power-to-gas applications require high efficiency and thus low specific energy demand of the hydrogen production. Energy is required for hydrogen production via water electrolysis, but also for gas conditioning. Gas conditioning includes mechanical gas compression to a defined storage pressure and gas drying to purify the raw hydrogen. The energy demand of gas conditioning can be reduced by operating pressurized electrolyzers. However, pressurized operation increases the energy demand of the electrolyzer. To determine the optimal operating pressure of the electrolyzer, the overall power-to-gas process has to be considered. In this paper, the energy demand of the overall power-to-gas plants is optimized considering compression and temperature swing adsorption (TSA)drying of hydrogen. It is shown that an optimum pressure for each operating condition in the electrolyzer in relation to the efficiency exists. This optimal operating pressure depends on the current density in the stack and the hydrogen storage pressure. When operating the system with load adapted operating pressure efficiencies between 55% and 73% for the whole power-to-gas plant can be achieved.

AB  - Ecological monitoring is key to successful ecosystem restoration. Because all components within an ecosystem cannot be monitored, it is important to select indicators that are representative of the system, integrate system responses, clearly respond to system change, can be effectively and efficiently monitored, and are easily communicated. The roseate spoonbill is one ecological indicator species that meets these criteria within the Everglades ecosystem. Monitoring of roseate spoonbills in Florida Bay over the past 70 years has shown that aspects of this species' reproduction respond to changes in hydrology and corresponding changes in prey abundance and availability. This indicator uses nesting location, nest numbers and nesting success in response to food abundance and availability. In turn, prey abundance is a function of hydrological conditions (especially water depth) and salinity. Metrics and targets for these performance measures were established based on previous findings. Values of each metric were translated into indices and identified as stoplight colors with green indicating that a given target has been met, yellow indicating that conditions are below the target, but within an acceptable range of it, and red indicating the measure is performing poorly in relation to the target.

AB  - Environmental unpredictability is one of the most common global ecological problems, although few studies have explored its effect on pro-environmental behavior (PEB). The present research addresses this gap by viewing PEB as an investment in the environment for the sake of long-term benefits and redesigning the public goods game. For the game, the current public goods game, named the public forest game, is combined with the forest resource game such that investing and curtailing processes could be encompassed in one game in which PEB has direct indicators (some of which were distinguished from cooperation for purely profit-seeking). Participants played the game in fixed groups of five persons for five rounds randomly in either the low or high environmental unpredictability condition, followed by another five rounds in the other condition. The results show that when the environment becomes uncertain and unpredictable, both individual and group pro environmental behavior decrease. The present research identifies the negative effect of environmental unpredictability on pro-environmental behavior, suggesting that climate change may erect a barrier to sustainable behaviors by increasing environmental unpredictability and highlighting the importance of environmental prediction.

AB  - Each newly-created pond which is supplied with mine water gives the opportunity to study a unique ecosystem in context of possible conditions for biotic live. Therefore, this research aimed to assess a phytoplankton-based ecological potential against the trophic conditions and the risk of contamination with trace elements, and demonstrate the possibility to stabilize at least good water quality of a clarification pond. The gradual decrease in turbidity-related variables (including suspended solids and iron) and nutrients, on the one hand, and an increase in phytoplankton-related indicators, on the other hand, were the most evident. Besides, relative stability in trace elements (the best water quality class), trophic level (slightly eutrophic level) and ecological potential (maximum potential), and relative instability in sulfates and calcium were also recorded. The final stabilization of water habitat resulted in abundant growth of charophyte Nitella mucronata. This all suggested a new ecological opportunity for settlement of a rare species and important for biodiversity enhancement. Furthermore, the study revealed that a clarification pond did not pose any toxic risk from the elevated content of trace elements or the growth of toxic or potentially toxic cyanobacteria which is essential for proper functioning and management of water ecosystems.

AB  - The abundance of certain spionid species can be closely linked to environmental disturbances producing quantifiable changes in community structure. We hypothesize that in stress conditions, the spionids would tend to localize in the upper level of the sedimentary column near to the sediment-water interface. The aim of this work was to analyze, through an ex situ experiment, the effect produced by two concentrations of crude oil on the spionids at different depths of the sedimentary column and identify possible pollution indicators. A simulated oil spill at two input levels was carried out in the laboratory for 30days. The effect of the adding of crude oil was significant only in the superior level of the sedimentary column. The differences in the abundance between levels by experimental conditions were significant in all the cases. Sensitive species like Scolelepis (Parascolelepis) sp. and Rhynchospio glutaea disappeared while other species like Boccardia proboscidea had a higher resistance to the addition of crude oil. This study constitutes the first characterization of spionid assemblages of the Patagonian coasts altered by crude oil in sediments, and the first identification of species, which can be useful pollution indicators.

AB  - Using a state, pressure, response framework, we provide an evidence-based reflection on environmental outcomes in Australia and New Zealand across the domains of climate change, biodiversity, freshwater and marine management, emphasising the role of Indigenous and business perspectives. Significant developments have occurred in the past 20 years through affirmation of Indigenous rights and responsibilities. Responses to climate change have tended to emphasise passive risk management with unclear outcomes. Despite meeting biodiversity protection targets, outcomes are worsening, suggesting a need to challenge the dualistic preservation/production land categorisations. In freshwater and marine management, a mix of collaborative and market-based responses has emerged, although their efficacy remains untested. A reliance on voluntary approaches by business makes critical assessment of progress difficult. Thus, despite strong progress in some areas, the adaptiveness of environmental management remains limited, and many indicators suggest continuing decline in environmental condition. Our responses have been largely pacifying in nature, leading to perverse outcomes and failure to acknowledge alternatives that might address deteriorating environmental conditions. A shift is needed towards deliberative policy experimentation that truly values the application of novel and diversified approaches and facilitates integrated learning across environmental domains.

AB  - The genesis and development of the submerged notch occurring along the Northern Adriatic limestone coasts, surveyed at depth ranging between -0.35 and -2.8 m and amplitude consistent with the local tide is discussed using new and published data on its elevation and data on limestone lowering rates, collected using a micro-erosion meter and a traversing micro-erosion meter. Coastal limestone lowering rates in the Northern Adriatic range between 0.008 and 1.170 mm/y and they are about eight times higher than inland limestone lowering rates. Data support the hypothesis that notch is presently carving, even if no present-day notch has been surveyed in the area.
   The lack of a modern notch, and the presently submerged notch position, could be related to (1) a rapid still-acting tectonic downdrop or (2) an increase in weathering/erosion rates causing by different environmental conditions, e.g. during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, marked by more aggressive weathering, both chemically, biologically and/or mechanically, than present conditions, due to an increase in rainfall or variations in the acidity of seawater. Pros and cons of these hypotheses are discussed in the paper. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Dry ecosystems, despite their relative levels of aridity, are very diverse, and play a vital role in the livelihoods of many dryland inhabitants. It is therefore critical to investigate the relationship between land-use change and soil quality parameters to offer a scientific basis for optimizing land-use planning and improving soil quality status in dry ecosystems and ecologically vulnerable areas. This study, therefore, analyzed the physicochemical properties of soils in five different land-use types namely farmland, abandoned farmland, natural grassland, artificial lemon forest, and poplar woodland at YongDeng County. The soil quality status of the aforementioned land-use types was also evaluated through Principal component analysis. The results revealed that abandoned farmland and natural grassland recorded the highest average values of soil coarse particles of 24.0% and 23.4% respectively compared to the other land-use types. The highest average value (46.1%) of fine soil particles was recorded in poplar woodland followed by natural grassland (36.6%) and the average value of very fine soil particles was higher in farmland (40.8%) and artificial lemon woodland (38.3%) than in the other land-use types. The average value of clayey particles was highest in farmland (11.1%), followed by artificial lemon woodland (9.3%), and abandoned farmland (6.5%), then poplar woodland which recorded an average value of (4.2%). The average values of Soil water content, soil pH, soil electrical conductivity, and soil total nitrogen content were significantly higher in farmland compared to the other land-use types. Soil organic carbon content was significantly higher in abandoned farmland at (P < 0.03) and lemon woodland at (P < 0.01) than in farmlands, natural grasslands, and poplar stands. The soil quality indicators of the different land-use types were significantly correlated with each other. Among them, the correlation coefficient of each evaluation index was highest in poplar woodland, followed by natural grassland, lower in farmland and artificial lemon woodland, and lowest in abandoned farmland. The overall soil quality scores were in the following order: farmland > abandoned farmland > 0 > grassland > lemon woodland > poplar woodland. In the study area, the soil quality of farmland that has been finely managed and naturally restored to grassland following abandonment is superior, whereas the soil quality of natural grassland, artificial lemon woodland, and poplar forest land is substandard. The comprehensive analysis of soil quality demonstrates that conservation tillage and fine management of water-irrigated farmland, as well as the natural conversion of abandoned farmland to grassland, can significantly improve the soil quality of sandy soils, reduce water and soil loss, increase fertility, and gradually improve regional ecological environmental conditions.

AB  - The sustainability of the environmental management programs such as watershed intervention program relies on the understanding of the nexus of the community's perception, participation, and livelihoods. However, there are little studies on the interactions of these very important parameters. This study examined the nexus of farmers' perception, participation, livelihoods and their implication for sustaining watershed management program in Ethiopia, case of upper Gibe basin. To this end, household survey, focus group discussion and key informant interview were employed to collect and analyze the data. Likert-scale was used to rate the indicators or items of perception, participation, socio-ecological indicators; Coefficient of Crobach alpha to test the reliability of items; Independent t-test to compare the mean value of livelihood assets between program participant and non participant households and Rader diagram to depict the overall livelihood assets value. Descriptive (mean, percentage) analysis was use summarize the results of local perception, community participation, socio-ecological benefits of watershed management while, chi-square statistics were applied to analyze the association between important components of watershed management such as local perception, community participation, intensity of adoption and livelihoods. The results of the study indicated that local communities were well aware of the degradation of watershed as a problem constraining agricultural production in their farm lands and surrounding landscapes. Problems of watershed degradation were better perceived in the upper and middle topographic settings and for watershed program participant households implying the need for site-specific appropriate watershed management alternatives. While the ecological benefits of watershed management were perceived better in the upper topographic areas, the socio economic benefits were in the middle and lower areas suggesting an integrated approach to address the biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The overall community participation index value showed moderate levels of participation indicating that only some decisions were taken in consultation with local people. Specific adoption rates for many of the practices and the intensity of adoption were low. There were gaps in the progress of the five dimensions of livelihood assets-human, natural, financial, social, physical. The interaction of perception, participation and livelihoods in watershed management practices suggested more participatory and integrated approach need to be encouraged to upscale and sustaining of watershed management practices. Less awareness and extension services, lack of finance, interest in short-term agricultural production are the major challenges constraining the sustainability of watershed management. Hence, local administrators and planners need to recognize heterogeneity in households' socio economic and topographic specific characteristics as well as the aforementioned constraints so as to involve community fully in various activities of watershed management. The nexus between watershed management and ecosystem services, climate change and variability are areas for future research.

AB  - The article outlines the causes of the ecological crisis in Ukraine and various factors affecting the natural environment, such as air pollution, depletion and degradation of land resources, exhaustion of forest and water resources, caused by agricultural production. Thus, in Ukraine, as of 1 January 2018, more than 1.1 million hectares of degraded, unproductive and technogenically contaminated lands counted to expand, and there were 315.6 thousand hectares of unproductive lands that needed improvement; 57% of the territory of the country was affected by wind and water erosion, about 12% were flooded lands and 20% more polluted lands. The authors detail the consequences of the impact of agricultural activities on the environment.
   It is necessary to reflect environmental activities in accounting, including environmental assets (natural resource potential, production waste, non-current assets of environmental protection purposes), liabilities (environmental liabilities) and results of activities (environmental incomes, environmental expenses, financial results from environmental activities). The components of natural resource potential, which are to be reflected in the accounting system, are determined. The authors of the research provide an analytical estimation of the state, structure and changes of land resources in Ukraine and define the degree of compatibility between the modern system of agriculture and new environmental and technological requirements. The article discusses normative and legal provisions concerning land protection in Ukraine, as well as normative legal acts on ecologisation of agriculture. The tendency of the recent years shows that the mechanism of combining measures of financial incentives and legal responsibility in the field of land protection, as well as the establishment of legally determined environmental restrictions in land use by means of land management, remains insufficient in terms of optimising the use and protection of land in Ukraine.
   The study covers the main problem aspects of the land use in Ukraine. Analytical data describing the anti-desertification measures planned until 2030, as well as measures for the restoration of degraded lands and soils, including lands affected by desertification, droughts and floods, are presented. The need to reflect the costs of implementing measures to protect and restore the natural resource potential (including land resources) is emphasised. The authors generalise the information on three groups of accounting objects in terms of the use of agricultural land: objects affecting the qualitative condition (natural fertility) of land, objects representing land capital with a certain level of natural fertility which are at the disposal of enterprises, and objects that depend on the type of agricultural lands and their natural fertility.
   It is suggested to generalise the information on the objects of ecological accounting in the form of the Environmental Activity Report, which will increase the effectiveness of the managerial decisions on the environment at micro-and macro-levels.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a stochastic Holling type II model from the commonly used deterministic Holling type II model by introducing Brownian motion as a stochastic perturbation, which can naturally account for the external environmental effects on a multispecies community. We study the existence and uniqueness of positive solutions to the stochastic model, and we establish sufficient conditions for strong persistence and extinction.

AB  - The use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to detect mold growth in damp buildings depends on a comprehensive knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways available to indoor molds as well as their biological variation. Recent reports concerning (VOCs) formed during the growth of molds from damp buildings on laboratory substrates indicate considerable variation, presumably because of the sensitivity of mold VOC biosynthesis to environmental conditions or large biological variation.

AB  - Reducing animal stress and mortality associated with bycatch and discard in fishing, aquaculture, and live-market trade depends upon improvements in fishing gear and the practices employed in capture, holding, handling, and transport. Several approaches have been used to evaluate the likely mortality of commercially important crustaceans: (1) assess external injuries assuming a direct relationship to mortality, (2) extrapolate from direct observations of mortality under specific environmental conditions and handling practices, (3) evaluate the physiological condition of test animals to predict the associated mortality, and (4) assess behavioral indicators of vitality. Intrinsic variables, such as animal size, gender, and shell condition, and external variables, such as season, fishing and environmental conditions, and type of injury (physiological and mechanical), all have large effects on the complex interactions between stressors and mortality. This review shows that physiological parameters provide insight into the mechanisms of stress and stress responses, but they are often unrelated to mortality outcomes, and the methods are difficult and expensive to carry out in routine field or factory applications. In contrast, behavioral indicators, particularly those utilizing observations on multiple reflex actions, can provide excellent tools where predicting mortality is the primary goal.

AB  - In real classification problems intrinsically vague information often coexist with conditions of "lack of specificity" originating from evidence not strong enough to induce knowledge, but only degrees of belief or credibility regarding class assignments. The problem has been addressed here by proposing a fuzzy Dempster-Shafer model (FDS) for multisource classification purposes. The salient aspect of the work is the definition of an empirical learning strategy for the automatic generation of fuzzy Dempster-Shafer classification rules from a set of exemplified training data. Dempster-Shafer measures of uncertainty are semantically related to conditions of ambiguity among the data and then automatically set during the learning process. Partial reduced beliefs in class assignments are then induced and explicitly represented when generating classification rules. The fuzzy deductive apparatus has been modified and extended to integrate the Dempster-Shafer propagation of evidence. The strategy has been applied to a standard classification problem in order to develop a sensitivity analysis in an easily controlled domain. A second experimental test has been conducted in the field of natural risk assessment, where vagueness and lack of specificity conditions are prevalent. These empirical tests show that classification benefits from the combination of the fuzzy and Dempster-Shafer models especially when conditions of lack of specifity among data are prevalent.

AB  - Wetlands are increasingly exposed to human activities, resulting in degradation. As the wetland degrades, it loses functionality. In South Africa, wetlands can play an important water-regulating role. This study aims to establish the ecological condition of a historically utilised wetland on the Lions River floodplain in the uMngeni catchment, to provide a guide for the planning and implementation of rehabilitation interventions. A comprehensive assessment of the wetland's structure was undertaken in 2014, using vegetation and soil parameters, mapped and compared with changes in landuse on the wetland from historical aerial photographs. The study concluded that the wetland's ecological condition had declined, as a result of historical cultivation and commercial forestry. The wetland vegetation present is still generally aligned with the prevailing hydro-edaphic gradient and soil water regime; however, some areas of the wetland showed a mismatch in the soil water indicators and vegetation wetness indicators (the level of wetness based on vegetation being higher than that showed by the soil), suggesting localised drying out. A moderately high abundance of ruderal indigenous and invasive alien species in 61% of the wetland, particularly the drier areas of the wetland, contributed to the altered ecological condition.

AB  - In Africa, the direct use of wetlands has long contributed to livelihoods, but use may lead to the degradation of wetlands. In order to better understand how the biophysical features of a wetland influence the sustainability of its use, an investigation was undertaken of the ecological condition and use of three wetlands in the Kasungu District, Malawi, where human pressures on wetlands are high. The first wetland, at the head of the catchment, had sandy soils and a gentle longitudinal slope, the second wetland, lower in the catchment, had clay soils and a steeper longitudinal slope, and the third wetland was intermediate. A framework was applied to score five functional components of ecological condition: hydrology, geomorphology, soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation, nutrient cycling and vegetation composition in terms of human impact, based on pre-defined field indicators. The framework highlighted particular vulnerabilities of individual wetlands in the face of human pressure. Vulnerability varied greatly across the wetlands in terms of: recovery of native vegetation composition following cultivation, geomorphic change through gully erosion and depletion of SOM. The framework is recommended for wider application in Africa as a means of highlighting the specific vulnerabilities of individual wetlands and for the improved focus of organizations which promote the ecologically sustainable use of wetlands.

AB  - Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, has become the predominant farmed abalone species in Fujian, southern China, since 2006. As an introduced abalone species from northern China, mass mortality of the farmed Pacific abalones in Fujian often occurred during summer in recent years. However, this phenomenon of summer mortality still lacks thorough investigation. We conducted a field investigation to monitor biological conditions of the 2-year-old animals, including monthly survival rates; visual gonad index; monthly variation in metabolic parameters including protein, glycogen, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) content; and enzyme activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and antioxidative capacities including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) from April to October 2014. A range of environmental parameters were assessed and correlated against biological indicators for abalone conditions, metabolic parameters, and antioxidative capacities. Results showed a total mortality rate of 58.58% over the sampled period. Visual gonad index assessment showed that the sampled animals had similar gonad development levels during each sampling date. Environmental parameters and abalone mortality monitored during the study showed significant positive correlation between seawater temperature and mortality of abalones. All energy resources tended to be depleted at the end of summer. Results also showed that both SOD and T-AOC increased in the first few months and then decreased in September and October. The variations of metabolic parameters and antioxidative capacities indicated an insufficient energy supply and peroxidative damage in the farmed animals during summer. This study provided the biological data of farmed Pacific abalone by field investigation in terms of summer mortality for the first time in southern China. These findings that might be applicable to the management and development of Pacific abalone aquaculture in sea-based farms of southern China were also discussed in the study.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened by global and local stressors such as ocean acidification and trace metal contamination. Reliable early warning monitoring tools are needed to assess and monitor coral reef health. Symbiont-bearing foraminifers (Amphistegina gibbosa) were kept under ambient conditions (no sea water acidification and no copper addition) or exposed to combinations of different levels of sea water pH (8.1, 7.8, 7.5 and 7.2) and environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved copper (measured: 1.0, 1.6, 2.3 and 3.2 A mu g L-1) in a mesocosm system. After 10- and 25-d exposure, foraminifers were analyzed for holobiont Ca2+-ATPase activity, bleaching, growth and mortality. Enzyme activity was inhibited in foraminifers exposed to pH 7.2 and 3.2 A mu g L-1 Cu for 25 d. Bleaching frequency was also higher at pH 7.2 combined with copper addition. There was no significant effect of sea water acidification and copper addition on mortality. However, test size was smaller in foraminifers exposed to copper, with a positive interactive effect of sea water acidification. These findings can be explained by the higher availability of free copper ions at lower water pH. This condition would increase Cu competition with Ca2+ for the binding sites on the organism, thus inhibiting Ca2+-ATPase activity and affecting the organism's overall fitness. Findings reported here suggest that key processes in A. gibbosa, such as calcification and photosynthesis, are affected by the combined effect of global (sea water acidification) and local (copper contamination) stressors. Considering the experimental conditions employed (mesocosm system, possible ocean acidification scenarios, low copper concentrations, biomarkers of ecological relevance and chronic exposure), our findings support the use of foraminifera and biomarkers analyzed in the present study as reliable tools to detect and monitor the ecological impacts of multiple stressors in coral reef environments.

AB  - The objective of this study was to establish an additional prognostic parameter to assess animal welfare. We explored the validity of using the thiol antioxidant barrier (SHp) and determination of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) as indicators of stress and welfare in sheltered dogs. The shelter is a stressful environment for a dog because of its unpredictable and uncontrollable nature. The dogs enrolled in the present study belonged to 2 types of animal shelters (shelter 1 and shelter 2) that differed for social and spatial restrictions for the dogs. Animals were tested for leishmaniosis and ehrlichiosis and divided into 4 groups on the basis of their negative (group A and B) or positive (group C and D) status and the shelter they belonged to. The Student t test showed significant differences on SHp concentrations between groups A and B (negative titers; different shelters) (P < 0.0001; t((10)) = 11.08), groups C and D (positive titers; different shelters) (P < 0.02; t((7)) = 2.998), and groups A and C (different infection status and same shelter) (P < 0.004; t((8)) = 3.975). Levels of dROMs showed significant differences between groups A and C (different infection status and same shelter) (P < 0.03; t((8)) = 2.552) and groups B and D (different infection status and same shelter) (P < 0.02; t((9)) = 2.817). The high dROMs values recorded in all dogs during the study may be because of the stressful environment of animal shelters, in general. The low SHp concentrations that we found in dogs from shelter 1 may suggest a highly stressful condition related to the poor social environment for interaction. SHp and dROMs may provide useful information about the responsiveness of sheltered dogs subjected to different environmental (social and spatial restrictions, management practices, and diet) and health (negative or positive status for leishmaniosis and ehrlichiosis) conditions and may suggest the possibility of establishing an additional prognostic tool for the assessment of welfare and health in sheltered dogs.

TI  - Influence of environmental humidity and dietary protein on pyramidal growth of carapaces in African spurred tortoises (Geochelone sulcata)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
LA  - English
AB  - The carapaces of captive-raised tortoises (terrestrial chelonians of the zoological family Testudinidae, often develop pyramidal-shaped osseous growth centrally within the horny plates. With very few exceptions (e.g. Geochelone elegans , Psammobates sp.), this conical growth pattern is considered to be pathologic. This very common defect is believed to be an important indicator of the quality of captive tortoise management. This study was designed to examine the effect of dietary protein level and environmental humidity on the degree of pyramidal growth in the carapaces. Fifty recently hatched African spurred tortoises (G. sulcata ) were raised for 5 months under artificial conditions of varying environmental humidity and dietary protein content (14% vs. 19% vs. 30% crude protein in dry matter). Humps of the carapaces that developed and blood values of calcium, phosphorus and haematocrit were measured and compared among groups. Dry environmental conditions (24.3-57.8% and 30.6-74.8% relative humidity) produced taller humps than humid conditions (45-99% relative humidity). Hump formation differed significantly (pless than or equal to0.001) between these three groups kept under different humidity conditions. Variable dietary protein had a minor, positive impact on this pathological formation of humps (pyramidal growth syndrome, PGS). Analysis of blood (calcium, phosphorus and haematocrit) offered no further explanation as to the development of the humps.

AB  - In this study we evaluated the effects of changes in salinity, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen on the spatiotemporal variation of zooplankton. Samples were collected in January-March, May; October-December 2010; and January-March 2011 in the Araruama lagoon, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There were eight fixed stations sampled using a WP2 net equipped with a flow meter. The zooplankton diversity of the Araruama lagoon was low and dominated by Cirripedia larvae and by the copepod Acartia tonsa, which is an indicator species of eutrophication. In general, a few species from the Cabo Frio region were able to adapt to the conditions of this hypersaline lagoon. In addition, a specimen of Monstrilla bahiana (Monstrilloidae) was found at a salinity of 46 parts per thousand. This is the first record of the order Monstrilloida in the region of Cabo Frio. Temperature, salinity and pH were shown to be limiting factors for the species present in the lagoon since Cirripedia seemed to avoid releasing their larvae under unfavorable environmental conditions. The abundance of A. tonsa was always associated with that of Cirripedia larvae, and it was higher at cooler temperatures.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of using heart rate (HR) as a metric parameter that can be used for the characterisation of behaviour of primitive horses and their relatives, related to reactions to the stress resulting from the contact with humans and adaptation to living in various conditions, including natural environment. This characterisation served the authors to expand the knowledge of such behaviour of primitive horses, and to assess the impact of the environmental and genetic factors. Studies were conducted in three populations of horses: two herds of Polish Konik and one herd of Bilgoraj horses. The studies were performed between 1993 and 2010. They concerned the behaviour of horses during grooming - breeding procedures (hooves clearing, body measurements) performed cyclically and the daily observations when HR was monitored continuously. HR results for the respective age categories, during particular grooming - breeding procedures and reserve observations indicate that Polish Konik horses, closely related to the primitive Tarpan breed, are genetically better adapted to living in conditions similar to the natural (reserve) than the Bilgoraj horses. They show less stress symptoms, which are evidenced by HR values noted during inhabiting the natural environment.

AB  - Two Panamic fish species and one species from the Cortez-San Diegan Provinces were recorded for the first time in and near Bahia de San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico, during 2014 and 2015. The area is normally cold because of locally intense upwelling. However, during 2014 and 2015, warm water prevailed, which appears to have led to the presence of these fish species within and outside of the bay. Five specimens of Selene brevoortii (Mexican lookdown) were recorded, one individual in October 2014, and three more individuals during July 2015; another specimen, completely dry, was provided by a fisherman as evidence of their presence at an intermediate date within this period. Also in 2015, seven individuals of fish were captured with a commercial gill net set just outside of the bay; five of these were identified as Lobotes pacificus (Pacific tripletail) and the other two individuals as Albula gilberti (Cortez bonefish). Captures of these tropical species, in an usually cold-water environment are evidence of a substantial fish movement from the tropical Pacific toward the temperate waters of Baja California and California, USA, during warming conditions.

AB  - Waterholes in intermittent dryland rivers are important biotic refugia, but detailed water-quality descriptions of these habitats are rare. Their possible variability in water quality, due to variable flow regimes, may impede development of appropriate water-quality guidelines. We investigated this issue by describing spatial and temporal variation in water quality in waterholes in a tropical Australian dryland system. Water quality varied considerably among three rivers, between sites within rivers and within sites, reflecting lithology, hydrology, bathymetry, local catchment influences, stratification and within-site patchiness. Seasonal variation was due to differences in insolation, temperature, flow and depth. Diel variation was high for pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) at some sites. Variation among locations within waterholes was low for DO, temperature and pH, but higher for chlorophyll and nutrients, due to shade-related patchy photosynthesis. Neither the rivers nor the waterholes within them could indicate water-quality reference conditions because of their different characteristics. Our results highlight the need for strategic timing and location of sampling to capture spatial and temporal variation in key water-quality variables and to identify critical ecological conditions in dryland riverine waterholes.

AB  - Changes in agro-pastoral production systems affect the livelihoods and development of rural communities. Thus it is important for planners and policy makers to be able to document land or ecosystem conditions and trends in relation to managerial actions at specific locations. Quantification of ecosystem parameters that are used for condition and trend assessment has been difficult, time consuming and expensive resulting in very few locations worldwide with detailed records. We report monitoring techniques that can be used at local scales, to speed up the collection, processing and storage of indicators of agro-ecosystem health. By coupling digital photography, differential global positioning systems technologies, information collected with accessory devices and computer software applied in a strict monitoring protocol enabled rapid sampling and recording geographic position (latitude/longitude) of quadrates (1 to 25 m(2)) with vegetation, litter and soil parameters. If vegetative species are visually distinctive, plants can also be identified. Repeated measurements over time at the same locations provide information regarding environmental trend and rate of change. Coupling our local scale measurements with landscape scale remote sensing data such as satellite or high altitude aerial photography, we have a complete picture of vegetation dynamics and system change, which facilitates interpretation.

AB  - Blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, inhabiting tidal zones, are naturally exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., fluctuations in temperature and salinities), while horse mussels, Modiolus modiolus, live under relatively invariable shelf water conditions. The present investigation tested the hypothesis: blue mussels, in comparison to horse mussels, have an increased ability to tolerate the stress of pollution combined with low salinity. To assess the response of blue mussels and horse mussels to oil pollution at seawater salinities of 25 psu (normal) and 15 psu (low), we used a combination of heart rate and lipid composition as physiological and biochemical indicators, respectively. A sharp decrease in heart rate as well as important fluctuations in cardiac activity was observed under all oil concentrations. Modifications in the concentrations of the main membrane lipid classes (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol) and storage lipids (primarily triacylglycerols) in response to different crude oil concentrations were time- and dose-dependent. Both chosen indicators showed a high sensitivity to crude oil contamination. Furthermore, both bivalve species showed similar responses to oil pollution, suggesting a universal mechanism for biochemical adaptation to crude oil pollution.

AB  - Biodiversity is a key concept in finding important features of new microorganisms. Microorganisms play an important role in the soil ecosystem and participate, among others, in such processes as the maintenance of soil structure, humification, release of organic compounds, disposal of pollutants and transformation of organic matter. The maintenance of competent state of soil microbial communities, i.e. the appropriate microorganism count, activity and diversity, is a necessary condition for the functioning of a highly complex system such as the soil. Phyllosphere bacteria have the potential to influence plant biogeography and ecosystem function through their influence on plant performance under different environmental conditions, but the drivers of variation in leaf-associated bacterial biodiversity among host plants are not well understood. Hence, undoubtedly, an important research aspect is the selection and development of indicators to evaluate microbial biodiversity of the soil and plant phyllosphere. In this publication, selected molecular methods used for the diversity assessment of microorganisms have been presented.

AB  - Explaining variation in life expectancy between individuals of the same age is fundamental to our understanding of population ecology and life history evolution. Variation in the length and rate of loss of the protective telomere chromosome caps has been linked to cellular lifespan. Yet, the extent to which telomere length and dynamics predict organismal lifespan in nature is still contentious. Using longitudinal samples taken from a closed population of Acrocephalus sechellensis (Seychelles warblers) studied for over 20 similar to years, we describe the first study into life-long adult telomere dynamics (117 similar to years) and their relationship to mortality under natural conditions (n similar to=similar to 204 individuals). We show that telomeres shorten with increasing age and body mass, and that shorter telomeres and greater rates of telomere shortening predicted future mortality. Our results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions.

AB  - Genomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to gain insights into the relationship between soil management and bacterial-mediated functions in an olive orchard agroecosystem. Four management practices were assessed in a 30-year trial in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Transcriptional activity of bacterial 16S rRNA genes increased in noncovered soils, indicating higher microbial maintenance requirements to thrive in less favorable environmental conditions. The 16S rRNA transcript: gene copy ratio confirmed this assumption and pointed toward a much higher constitutive expression from rRNA operons in noncovered soils and to even higher expression levels when spontaneous vegetation was removed chemically. As described for 16S rRNA, potential transcription did not reveal the real transcription of bacterial beta-glucosidase genes, and higher gene expression in noncovered soils plus herbicides was evidenced. Since no relationship between total or soluble organic carbon and bacterial beta-glucosidase transcription was found, the above hypothesis could indicate either that soluble organic carbon is not the main pool of enzyme-inducing substrates or that constitutive production of bacterial beta-glucosidase enzymes increases as soil conditions worsen.

AB  - This article discusses the development Of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Brazil from the perspective of the Ethos Institute of Business and Social Responsibility. The Institute is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization, that has played a leading role in the Brazilian CSR effort. In Brazil, CSR initiatives have a long tradition of philanthropy, a consequence of the country's great social inequalities. The increased attention to corporate social responsibility has paralleled growing concern about sustainable development and the intensifying activities of pressure groups (consumers, customers, investors, NGOs, labour unions, the media, among others) that have been increasing since the 1990s as natural resources are progressively becoming exhausted, social tensions rising and environmental conditions deteriorating worldwide. This article identifies problems and obstacles to the growth of corporate social responsibility in Brazil, as well as advances and alternatives for CSR and towards creating conditions for the country to be internationally competitive and sustainable in the financial, social and environmental areas.

AB  - The rootability of soils is an important parameter in laboratory tests as well as on the scale of agricultural landscape for characterizing ecological functions of the soil. Rootability is an indicator for soil structure properties, for the effect of land management measures, especially for soil compactions, and informs about the suitability of a soil as plant site. While the root number serves as indicator for the mechanical state of the soil and for permeability properties, the root length density provides information on the efficiency of root systems at supplying water and nutrients to the whole plant. Both parameters are in a close mathematical relation, which can vary in dependence of the thickness of the tested soil layer and the stage of plant ontogenesis. The tested plant species and varieties react to soil compactions with different intensity, some of them even have a remarkable tolerance. The underground biomass can also vary in dependence on soil conditions. This is important for the determination of landscape carbon balances. Rootability results of soils in an agricultural landscape element provide knowledge of the state of soil structure, the growth conditions in different soil substrates and the suitability for agricultural use.

AB  - Swimming advisories are commonly posted at public beaches across the United States every year. In Iowa, weekly monitoring of public swimming areas at state and county beaches have resulted in the impairment of numerous lakes for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) contamination, as detected by E. coli. An extensive study was established to assess the relationships between E. coli contamination of nearshore beach water environments, open lake conditions and beach sands in three recreational beach/lake systems currently impaired for FIB contamination across Iowa. A transect/grab sample based sampling design was implemented across the systems with collections spanning from April through October of 2015 and 2016. Collections of E. coli along water transects identified strong near to far shore gradients of decreasing concentrations in all systems. Results indicate that concentrations of E. coli observed in swimming waters consistently disassociate with concentrations in the broader lake environment. Swimming water E. coli concentrations correlated with elevated beach sand E. coli, samples collected from beach sands uncovered concentrations up to 86,500 times higher than adjacent swimming waters. Results from this study indicate that foreshore beach sands and other beach proximate FIB sources serve as the major contributing source for swimming zone advisories. The current methodology used by state and federal officials includes impairing entire lake waterbodies for FIB contamination of the swimming area. These impairment listings do not accurately reflect the condition(s) of the larger lake environment outside the swimming area and fail to account for beach proximate conditions in the assessment process. Further, this approach provides potentially misleading information to the public and may undermine implementation strategies deployed by resource managers aimed at addressing FIB contamination at recreational swimming areas.

AB  - This paper examines the level of payment for ecosystem services (PES) concept implementation in the financing of water-related forest ecosystem services (ES) in the Republic of Croatia, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FB&H), the Republic of Slovenia, and the Republic of Serbia. The focus is on water-related forest ES recognised by the millennium ecosystem assessment (MEA). For the purpose of this paper, the termpure PESdescribes schemes that comply to all five conditions set by Wunder definition and termPES likefor those schemes that miss some of those conditions. In the first step, the most important legislative documents related to forests, water, and environmental protection were selected. The second consists of a content analysis; focusing on the definition of ES; the definition of fees or payments; the establishment of 'forest funds', 'water funds', or 'environmental funds'; and the way these funds were spent. Here we looked at the flow of funding into the forestry sector recognising forest management as the main water-related forest ES provider. Research revealed existence of well-established payments schemes in forestry in Croatia for almost 30 years and in FB&H for some 20 years which were assessed as closest topure PES. In Serbia and Slovenia, there were no PES orPES likeschemes in the forestry sector. In the water sector the well-establishedPES likepayments schemes existing in all four countries. The environmental protection sector, however, rely more on thetax likerather than on thePES likeschemes. Legislation in general recognised the link between forests and water, but this was much more evident in the forestry than in the water or environment sector. The role of the state is strongly pronounced in all countries studied, and was the main driving force behind all payments. However, this position of the state represents also the main obstacle for the development ofpure PESschemes, together with underdeveloped private forestry and complex socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, there is room for further development ofpure PESandPES likeschemes based on EU or global experiences.

AB  - Generic hydrochemical modelling of a grantoid-groundwater system, using the Russian software "HydroGeo", has been carried out with an emphasis on simulating the accumulation of uranium in the aqueous phase. The baseline model run simulates shallow granitoid aquifers (U content 5 ppm) under conditions broadly representative of southern Norway and southwestern Siberia: i.e. temperature 10 degrees C, equilibrated with a soil gas partial CO2 pressure (P-CO2, open system) of 10(-2.5) atm. and a mildly oxidising redox environment (Eh = +50 mV). Modelling indicates that aqueous uranium accumulates in parallel with total dissolved solids (or groundwater mineralisation M - regarded as an indicator of degree of hydrochemical evolution), accumulating most rapidly when M = 550-1000 mg L-1. Accumulation slows at the onset of saturation and precipitation of secondary uranium minerals at M = c. 1000 mg L-1 (which, under baseline modelling conditions, also corresponds approximately to calcite saturation and transition to Na-HCO3 hydrofacies). The secondary minerals are typically "black" uranium oxides of mixed oxidation state (e.g. U3O7 and U4O9). For rock U content of 5-50 ppm, it is possible to generate a wide variety of aqueous uranium concentrations, up to a maximum of just over 1 mg L-1, but with typical concentrations of up to 10 mu g L-1 for modest degrees of hydrochemical maturity (as indicated by M). These observations correspond extremely well with real groundwater analyses from the Altai-Sayan region of Russia and Norwegian crystalline bedrock aquifers. The timing (with respect to M) and degree of aqueous uranium accumulation are also sensitive to Eh (greater mobilisation at higher Eh), uranium content of rocks (aqueous concentration increases as rock content increases) and P-CO2 (low P-CO2 favours higher pH, rapid accumulation of aqueous U and earlier saturation with respect to uranium minerals).

AB  - Assessing water quality in streams is usually measured at the local scale and often it is spatially restricted. To scale-up water-condition assessment, there is a need to use new tools that enable prediction of large-scale changes in water quality by expanding the analysis to landscape-levels and bioclimatic predictors. In addition, the traditional use of linear models in biomonitoring can be inappropriate in detecting complex relationships, such as changing patterns of aquatic community structure and complex environmental gradients. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Rough Sets Theory (RST) can be particularly useful for dealing with vague, imprecise, inconsistent and uncertain knowledge involving biotic and abiotic data to enable the classification and prediction of changes in stream water. Here, we applied RST to estimate the water quality in streams of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by analyzing connections between landscape and climate data with the inclusion of up to 15 families of aquatic insect groups from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (usually known as EPT taxa). First, we developed different decision sets which were the arrangements of the response variable (EPT index) and the predictor classifications. Then, we applied the best decision sets to monitor the condition of stream water in the Atlantic Forest on a large-scale. Our results showed the best decision rules were 61% accurate. Depending on the initial stream condition, this approach on a large-scale led to variable accuracy. By combining the development of different decision sets, the application of the best one on a large-scale, and the use of open-access data (landscape and climate predictors), our study approach demonstrated the potential applicability to evaluate streams in an objective with low-cost manner. This method can complement the environmental assessment of streams based only on local variables. Our framework also creates new perspectives in the analysis of water quality to generate scenarios of changes in streams based on landscape measurements to optimize monitoring networks.

AB  - A field study was conducted from May to October 1995 to assess ozone (O-3) phytotoxicity in Catalonia (NE Spain) by determining a percentage value of leaf area injured by ozone on three tobacco cultivars, Bel-W3, Bel-C and Bel-B as bioindicators. Colorimetric parameters were also determined in an effort to have an objective assessment of ozone injury. The study was conducted simultaneously on eight sites where ozone levels and several meteorological parameters were continuously monitored. Two sets of plants were used at each site. The first one was composed of six plants of each cultivar which were changed every two weeks while the second one involved two plants of each cultivar which were kept in the plots throughout the whole experimental period. Open Top Chambers were also used to test the response of the three cultivars to ozone under controlled conditions. The ozone levels correlated well with ozone injury on the Bel-W3 cultivar but not as well on the other two cultivars. The ozone levels did not fully account for all the observed injury. The response of tobacco plants to ozone concentrations and therefore its biomonitoring capacity depended also on different environmental conditions linked to stomatal behaviour such as temperature, humidity, wind or altitude. These environmental conditions had some effects on the intensity of Ozone injury. Ozone concentrations accumulated over a threshold of 60 ppb (AOT60) when VPD was below I KPa. Correlated well with the ozone injury and best explained the intensity tobacco injury symptoms. For large plants growing throughout the whole period of study, Bel-C was the best indicator cultivar for AOT60 over the 3 days prior to the last ozone injury assessment. The colorimetric parameters were indicators of seasonal changes but they were not good ozone damage indicators. It is concluded that tobacco cultivars were good bioindicators but meteorological and other environmental factors need to be considered in there use as biomonitors.

AB  - To define the larval fish habitat distributions in the Upper Gulf of California and their response to interannual environmental variability, satellite and hydrographic data and zooplankton samples, from three cruises made in early summer (June 2008, June 2010, and June 2013) were analyzed. Monthly averages of SST satellite data from June 2002 to June 2017 indicated negative anomalies during June 2008 and 2010. In spite of this, a recurrent larval fish habitat was defined in the shallowest (<39 m) and saltiest (>36.5 g kg(-1)) part of the northern UGC. The indicator species of this habitat were the demersal fishes Gobulus crescentalis and Cynoscion othonopterus. A second habitat associated with an oxygenated stratification front (>4.8 mu mol kg(-1)) located in the middle of the UGC, was defined during Junes with SST negative anomalies (2008 and 2010); with Opisthonema spp. being the indicator species. In the southern part of the UGC, sampling station groups were defined with different indicator species. This could be related to the variability of the adjacent circulation of the Northern Gulf of California, and the influence of remote ocean conditions that could be impacting the pelagic ecosystem.

AB  - Climate change is now the leading cause of coral-reef degradation and is altering the adaptive landscape of coral populations(1,2). Increasing sea temperatures and declining carbonate saturation states are inhibiting short-term rates of coral calcification, carbonate precipitation and submarine cementation(3-5). A critical challenge to coral-reef conservation is understanding the mechanisms by which environmental perturbations scale up to influence long-term rates of reef-framework construction and ecosystem function(6,7). Here we reconstruct climatic and oceanographic variability using corals sampled from a 6,750-year core from Pacific Panama. Simultaneous reconstructions of coral palaeophysiology and reef accretion allowed us to identify the climatic and biotic thresholds associated with a 2,500-year hiatus in vertical accretion beginning similar to 4,100 years ago(8). Stronger upwelling, cooler sea temperatures and greater precipitation-indicators of La Nina-like conditions-were closely associated with abrupt reef shutdown. The physiological condition of the corals deteriorated at the onset of the hiatus, corroborating theoretical predictions that the tipping points of radical ecosystem transitions should be manifested sublethally in the biotic constituents(9). Future climate change could cause similar threshold behaviours, leading to another shutdown in reef development in the tropical eastern Pacific.

AB  - Phytoplankton growth in estuaries is controlled by factors such as flushing, salinity tolerance, light, nutrients and grazing. Here, we show that biodiversity of estuarine phytoplankton is related to flushing, and illustrate this for some European estuaries.
   The implications for the definition of reference conditions for quality elements in estuaries of different types are examined, leading to the conclusion that constraints on the number of estuarine and coastal types that may be defined for management purposes require that quality classes take into account natural variability within types, in order to be ecologically meaningful. We develop a screening model to predict the growth rate required for a phytoplankton species to be present under different flushing conditions and apply it to estuaries in the EU and US to show how changes in physical forcing may alter biodiversity. Additional results are presented on the consequences for eutrophication, showing that changes in residence time may interact with species-specific nutrient uptake rates to cause shifts in species composition, potentially leading to effects such as harmful algal blooms.
   We discuss applications for integrated coastal zone management, and propose an, approach to normalization of estuarine phytoplankton composition as regards species numbers.. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The characteristics of ground total electric field of HVDC transmission lines impacted by temperature and midity are of significance in line design and environmental protection assessment. In this paper, an experimental setup encompassing wire-plate electrodes is built, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the ground total electric field under HVDC lines are studied under three conditions: constant temperature with variable humidity, constant humidity with variable temperature, and coupling change of temperature and humidity. The experimental results show that when the temperature and humidity increase separately, the ground total electric field increases, and it is of polarity dependence. When the coupling change of temperature and humidity natural environment is simulated, that is, with the increase of relative humidity and decrease of temperature, ground total electric field increases when the HVDC line is in positive corona, and it increases first and then decreases when the line is in negative corona. An important inference from the results is that the characteristics of ground total electric field obtained under the conditions that temperature and humidity change separately not applicable for the analysis of ground total electric field in natural environment where temperature and humidity vary simultaneously.

AB  - This article offers a critical analysis of the applicability and relevance of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in the post-conflict period in Colombia as a means to support societal sustainability transition and avoid the depletion of natural resources and the emergence of new conflicts. Colombia, emerging from decades of war between the Colombian government and the FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), is experiencing an urgent need to allocate financial resources to large-scale projects with the aim of supporting post conflict development activities, potentially resulting in rapid and hyper-development conditions and causing severe environmental impacts. Theoretically, SEA can be seen as one way to assist the Colombian government in their strategic decision-making and planning. However, the use of SEA will be bound by the post-conflict conditions and the more general institutional setting in Colombia. This article is focused on identifying the opportunities and challenges arising from the post-conflict context and the SEA action arena in Colombia. By doing this, the article provides a better understanding of institutional processes and resources in Colombia and contributes to the limited scholarly literature that is available on the application of SEA in post-conflict contexts, including research on the institutional capacity involved.

AB  - Attempts to study biodiversity hotspots on a regional scale should combine compositional and functionalist criteria. The detection of hotspots in this study uses one ecologically similar group of high conservation value species as hotspot indicators, as well as focal habitat indicators, to detect the distribution of suitable environmental conditions. The method is assessed with reference to thermophilous forests in Poland - key habitats for many rare and relict species. Twenty-six high conservation priority species were used as hotspot indicators, and ten plant taxa characteristic of the Quercetalia pubescenti-petraeae phytosociological order were used as focal habitat indicators. Species distribution data was based on a 10 x 10 km grid. The number of species per grid square was interpolated by the ordinary kriging geostatistical method. Our analysis largely determined the distribution of areas with concentration of thermophilous forest flora, but also regional disjunctions and geographical barriers. Indicator species richness can be interpreted as a reflection of the actual state of habitat conditions. It can also be used to determine the location of potential species refugia and possible past and future migration routes.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the potential of forest humus forms as indicators of soil C storage. To this purpose, Mediterranean forest soils in Southern and Central Italy were examined. Sites, differed for elevation, climate, parent material and vegetation conditions, while summer drought was the common ecological factor. A morpho-functional criterion, based on holorganic layers thickness and A horizon properties, was used to classify humus forms, which ranged from Dysmoder to Eumull. Such variability allowed understanding of factors influencing organic matter storage. The relations between carbon stock and humus form were investigated for the topsoil layer (0-20 cm), which was supposed to contain the soil C pools most sensitive to climate change. We found that humus forms can be grouped in statistically different populations, with respect to topsoil C stocks. The use of A horizon structure was the main diagnostic criterion and represented the most effective approach to humus classification in Mediterranean conditions. It appears that humus forms have a clear potential as indicators of organic carbon status in Mediterranean forest soils.

AB  - A comparative study, in illuminated and non-illuminated systems, was made to determine the survival strategies of plasmid-carrier and plasmidless bacteria in sterile river water. Two strains of Escherichia coli from river water were selected: one plasmidless, EC1, and one antibiotic-resistant strain, EC7, which showed plasmid bands. By matings with EC7 as donor and E. coli K12 strain J62 as recipient, transconjugants were generated, the J62(7) strain, which showed both antibiotic resistance and plasmid bands. Ethidium bromide curing of the EC7 strain generated the EC7(2) strain which showed a partial loss of resistance and a reorganization of plasmid bands. Under non-illuminated conditions the total number of cells detected by direct count and the number of culturable cells (injured and non-injured cells) remained practically constant throughout the period of incubation. In the illuminated systems, however, the number of cfu decreased in four of the five strains studied. The greatest decreases are those of the J62 strain, followed by those of the J62(7), EC1, EC7(2) and EC7 strains. Differences in survival strategies as a consequence of the presence or absence of plasmids are discussed.

AB  - Stream metabolism is a fundamental, integrative indicator of aquatic ecosystem functioning. However, it is not well understood how heterogeneity in physical channel form, particularly in relation to and caused by in-stream woody debris, regulates stream metabolism in lowland streams. We combined conservative and reactive stream tracers to investigate relationships between patterns in stream channel morphology and hydrological transport (form) and metabolic processes as characterized by ecosystem respiration (function) in a forested lowland stream at baseflow. Stream reach-scale ecosystem respiration was related to locations (hotspots) with a high abundance of woody debris. In contrast, nearly all other measured hydrological and geomorphic variables previously documented or hypothesized to influence stream metabolism did not significantly explain ecosystem respiration. Our results suggest the existence of key differences in physical controls on ecosystem respiration between lowland stream systems (this study) and smaller upland streams (most previous studies) under baseflow conditions. As such, these findings have implications for reactive transport models that predict biogeochemical transformation rates from hydraulic transport parameters, for upscaling frameworks that represent biological stream processes at larger network scales, and for the effective management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The Sierras Chicas from Cordoba is the mountain range with the highest fire frequency in central Argentina. However, the response to fire frequency of Chaco Serrano plant communities has not yet been assessed. Based on 23-year fire history, we surveyed all vascular plants in unburned, low and high fire frequency sites in the Chaco Serrano district located on Sierras Chicas from Cordoba. We found that fire frequency induces changes in vegetation structure, plant richness, and composition. Specifically, we observed a decrease in total plant richness at sites with a higher number of fire events. All life forms showed decreases in richness to the effects of fire, except the graminoids that showed no changes. In addition, we recorded a change in the species composition between the burned sites (both frequencies) and unburned sites, evidenced through the emergence of indicator species that define both conditions. These results indicate that fire is a strong ecological process that shapes plant communities, selecting species with life history traits (i.e., resprouting and lifespan) that confer adaptative value to new environmental conditions imposed by the regime of high fire frequency.

AB  - In many models of sexual selection, conspicuous ornaments are preferred by mates because they indicate heritable signaler viability. To function as indicators, ornaments must exhibit a proportional relationship between expression and viability. In cases where the evolutionary interests of signaler and receiver diverge, selection favors exploitative exaggeration by low-viability individuals producing unreliable signals. Theory suggests that the evolutionary stability of such communication systems requires costs that prevent lowviability males from expressing disproportionately intense signals. Therefore, given ecological variation in signaling cost, the reliability of signaling systems will vary concomitantly. In this study, we assess the effect of a variable signal cost, predation, on signal intensity and reliability among 16 populations of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) that use colorful dorsal fins in courtship displays. We found that fin coloration was more intense in low-predation sites and could be used to predict body condition. However, this predictive relationship was apparent only in populations subject to predation risk. We demonstrate an important role for ecological signaling cost in communication and show that ecological heterogeneity drives interpopulation variation in both the intensity and the reliability of a sexual signal.

AB  - Understanding trends in assemblage composition of key invertebrate groups can provide important insight into the 'condition' of, or changes in, the environment. Species density, abundance and composition of Hemiptera (true bugs) were assessed in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest and a chronosequence of restored bauxite mine pits near Boddington, Western Australia, in order to evaluate how restoration was progressing. A significant difference was uncovered for hemipteran species density between the youngest restored treatment and forest. In contrast, hemipteran composition was distinct between the forest and all restored treatments. Hemipteran composition was associated with the presence of the plant species Conostylis setigera and Trichocline spathulata, and plant structure between 160-180 cm and 260-280, plus soil pH. Restoration was successful in returning Hemiptera with respect to species density, but restoration was yet to attain a similar composition of Hemiptera to that of unmined forest, despite some of the restored sites being almost 20 years old. These results are similar to those of other studies that have assessed the response of Hemiptera to disturbance, and highlight the need to wait for considerable periods in order to achieve restoration goals. This study also confirms the utility of Hemiptera as bioindicators of environmental 'condition' and change.

AB  - Spinosad is a reduced-risk insecticide with a novel mode of action that provides an alternative to older classes of insecticides such as organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. A comprehensive ecological risk assessment for spinosad use in US cotton crops is presented within a framework of tiered levels of refinement following the guidelines of the US EPA for ecological risk assessments. Toxicity information for a variety of species is documented and utilized, environmental concentrations estimated, and risk characterizations in the form of risk quotients are quantified. Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict off-site transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species. Spinosad is acutely toxic to bees under laboratory conditions, but toxicity of residue studies and field studies indicate that under actual use conditions the impact on bees is minimal.

AB  - BackgroundThe Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta japonica lives in the alpine zones of central Japan, which is the southern limit of the global distribution for this species. This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential L. muta japonica habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for L. muta japonica under current and future climates. We used 24 general circulation models (GCMs) for 2081-2100 as future climate conditions.ResultsThe predicted potential habitat for L. muta japonica was similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area of Japan's northern Alps (36.25-36.5 degrees N, 137.5-137.7 degrees E). Future potential habitat for L. muta japonica was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities. Some potential habitats in the central and northwestern part of the study area were predicted to be sustained in the future, depending on the GCMs.ConclusionsOur model results predicted that the potential habitats for L. muta japonica in Japan's northern Alps, which provides core habitat for this subspecies, would be vulnerable by 2081-2100. Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of L. muta japonica populations under future climatic conditions. Impact assessment studies of the effect of climate change on L. muta japonica habitats at a nationwide scale are urgently required to establish effective conservation planning for this species, which includes identifying candidate areas for assisted migration as an adaptive strategy.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) cause adverse effects on ecosystems and organisms from aquatic environments due to their toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation characteristics. Furthermore, PAH exposure in fish can induce hepatic damage and physiological/biochemical disorders. The use of biomarkers can be a useful diagnostic tool to measure the health of an ecosystem, detecting alterations in organisms that can serve as early warning indicators of pollution. The present study assesses the levels of 17 PAHs in sediments and muscle of a wild fish (Cynoscion guatucupa) from the Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE), Argentina. The concentrations of PAHs found in fish were correlated to lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARs), the activity of metabolic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) in liver and muscle tissues, and the condition factor (CF) to test their usefulness as integrated biomarkers of PAH pollution in field samples. Results showed most frequency of 2-3 ring PAHs and higher concentrations of 4 ring PAHs; total PAHs ranged from 11.27 to 52.80 ng.g(-1) (w.w) for fish and 37.5 to 380.5 ng.g(-1) (d.w) for sediments. Total PAHs in fish positively correlated to muscle TBAR levels (p< 0.05),suggesting that lipid peroxidation could be produced by the pollutants. Moreover, total PAHs in fish muscle correlated positively with muscle LDH activity (p< 0.01) and negatively with liver AST and ALT activities, suggesting a shift to anaerobic metabolism under stress conditions and possible hepatic damage in C. guatucupa, respectively. The minimum CF and the maximum growing coefficient were observed with maximum concentrations of total PAHs in muscle. According to the methods and data presented, we can propose TBARs, LDH, AST/ALT, and CF as integrated early warning tools to assess PAH pollution effects in the native commercial fish Cynoscion guatucupa in South American marine environments.

AB  - Molecular-genetic analysis is widely used in various fields of science. In particular, molecular ecology for environmental assessment is the basis of the modern methodological base. Different species and populations contain a large pool of genetic variability, which plays a major role in the adaptation of species to various environmental conditions. A significant part of this variability does not have a clear phenotypic expression, which greatly complicates the study of the huge genetic potential of genera, species, and populations. More convenient markers for studying these issues are seed proteins and DNA, which are characterized by significant intraspecific polymorphism and independence from the external conditions of plant development; the most suitable methods are the electrophoresis of seed storage proteins and all methods for the PCR amplification of genomic DNA. This review shows the role of molecular-genetic methods in solving traditional environmental issues related to taxonomy, phylogeny, evolution, the study of genetic variability, and the identification of inbreeding depression in natural and artificially created populations of endemic, rare, and endangered species, as well as in their certification (by barcoding) and creating DNA genebanks.

AB  - Assessing the impacts of forest harvest on biodiversity is a key mandate for demonstrating sustainable forest management in many jurisdictions, yet the identification of an appropriate suite of wildlife and habitat indicators remains a challenge. We used individual species-based modelling and a spatially extensive dataset of forest-dependent bird, amphibian, and mammal species to measure the strength of response and prominent patterns among taxa to variation in forest habitat conditions, ranging from understory site characteristics to landscape level patterns. Our findings revealed that understory habitat was a significant contributor to species relative abundance. Stand level features and climate were generally more important than disturbance or landscape patterns in affecting wildlife response. There was much variability among species in the specific habitat conditions and scales of importance, consistent with the inherent complexity and diversity of forest ecosystems. Our work highlights that setting targets and monitoring for a diverse range of wildlife and habitat indicators at multiple scales, including understory features, may be needed to adequately assess biodiversity response to sustainable forest management activities.

AB  - A dominant share of Croatian cogeneration capacity and future cogeneration potential belongs to district heating systems currently operating in almost all bigger mainland and coastal towns. Since public cogeneration and public heating plants cover only 10% of heating requirements of households and services sectors it is reasonable to assume that in future energy supply district heating could take a bigger relative and absolute share even in conditions of reduced heat demand imposed by implementation of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. However, development of future district heating projects will inevitably depend on capability to bridge financing barriers usually manifesting in large investment costs and long pay-back time. The public involvement will be necessary either at state or/and at municipal level since private companies are focused on short-term profitability. In this paper comparison of various concepts of district and individual buildings heating has been performed with respect to efficiency and environmental indicators. Taking a midsize town as an example profitability of operation of both biomass and of natural gas fired district heating cogeneration plants have been analysed. Calculated results indicate levels of financial support required for sustainability of district heating projects in specific conditions of Croatian energy market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In ecological risk assessment, exposure is generally modelled assuming static conditions, herewith neglecting the potential role of emission, environmental and biomass dynamics in affecting bioavailable concentrations. In order to investigate the influence of such dynamics on predicted bioavailable concentrations, the spatially-resolved dynamic model "ChimERA fate" was developed, incorporating macrophyte and particulate/dissolved organic carbon (POC/DOC) dynamics into a water-sediment system. An evaluation against three case studies revealed a satisfying model performance. Illustrative simulations then highlighted the potential spatio-temporal variability of bioavailable concentrations after a pulsed emission of four chemicals in a system composed of a pond connected to its inflow and outflow streams. Changes in macrophyte biomass and POC/DOC levels caused exposure variations which were up to a factor of 4.5 in time and even more significant (several orders of magnitude) in space, especially for highly hydrophobic chemicals. ChimERA fate thus revealed to be a useful tool to investigate such variations and to identify those environmental and ecological conditions in which risk is expected to be highest.

AB  - Aquatic fireflies are important indicators of the quality of freshwater environments and key models for research on insect adaptation to freshwater environments. For these investigations, gene expression analyses using quantitative real-time PCR are heavily dependent on reliable reference genes. In this study, based on a transcriptome assembly and annotation for the aquatic fireflyAquatica leiiat the adult and larval stages, 10 candidate reference genes (alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, beta-actin,EF1A,SDHA,UBQ,GST,GAPDH,RPS31, andRPL13A) were identified for analyses of expression stability. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses for each candidate reference genes inA. leiiwas conducted for four developmental stages, four adult tissue types, two adult sexes, and two ecological stressors [adults exposed to five temperatures and larvae exposed to four concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene]. Results were evaluated by three independent algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) and one comparative algorithm (RefFinder). The expression stability of candidate reference genes inA. leiidiffered under various conditions. Reference genes with the most stable expressions levels in different tissues, temperatures, sexes, developmental stages, and concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene were alpha-tubulin,GST, beta-actin, beta-tubulin, and alpha-tubulin, respectively. Furthermore, the optimal normalization factors (NFs) for the quantification of the expression levels of target genes by quantitative real-time PCR analyses ofA. leiiwere identified for each experimental group. In particular, NF = 2 for different tissues (alpha-tubulin+ beta-tubulin), different sexes (beta-actin+EF1A), and larvae exposed to different concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene (alpha-tubulin+EF1A); NF = 3 for developmental stages (GST+GAPDH+SDHA) and adults exposed to different temperatures (beta-tubulin+EFA+GST). In addition, we surveyed the expression profiles of two target genes (CYP3AandCSP8) in larvae exposed to different concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene and in different adult tissues. The results further validated the reliability of the reference genes. The optimal reference genes for various experimental conditions identified in these analyses provide a useful tool for ecological studies of aquatic fireflies.

AB  - The long-lived migratory fish in the lower Athabasca region (including the Athabasca oil sands region) are valued ecosystem components and good bio-indicators of changes in habitat condition, water quality and quantity over the entire stream network. Changes in this region may have been caused by a variety of human activities including oil sands development, forestry, urban development, and recreational activities. We reviewed existing data to examine whether community composition and health of migratory fish (such as northern pike, walleye, and suckers) in the lower Athabasca region have changed over the past 40 years and whether these could be explained by changes in hydrology or water chemistry. Declines of 53%-100% in the abundance of three migratory fish species were detected in the Muskeg watershed (15% land change). Significant changes in fish health were detected. The largest decreases in body condition of fish in the region occurred in the late 1990s and coincided with elevated levels of fin erosion, the most frequently occurring external abnormality, and with extreme discharge conditions. Fish habitat can be affected by both increases and decreases in discharge, and the most pronounced changes were increases in some watersheds of up to 20% of average discharge post-development. In contrast, decreases in discharge post-development in the Muskeg and Steepbank rivers correlated with a decrease in precipitation. Our results show that climatic events and landscape features such as wetlands are important for understanding changes in the system. Further research is needed to examine potential ecological consequences of the observed changes in hydrology for fish and to explore what caused the changes in migratory fish communities and fish health. This will require a better understanding of the trophic structure of the system and a better monitoring program for migratory fish.

AB  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined in two rain forest streams (Salto, Pantano) draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. There, SRP levels can be naturally high due to groundwater enriched by geothermal activity within the surfically dormant volcanic landscape, and subsequently discharged at ambient temperature. Combined field and laboratory approaches simulated high but natural geothermal SRP input with the objective of estimating the magnitude of amended SRP retention within high and low SRP settings and determining the underlying mechanisms of SRP retention. First, we examined short-term SRP retention/transport using combined SRP-conservative tracer additions at high natural in situ concentrations. Second, we attempted to observe a DIN response during SRP amendment as an indicator of biological uptake. Third, we determined SRP release/retention using laboratory sediment assays under control and biologically inhibited conditions. Short-term in situ tracer-SRP additions indicated retention in both naturally high and low SRP reaches. Retention of added SRP mass in Upper Salto (low SRP) was 17% (7.5 mg-P m(-2) h(-1)), and 20% (10.9 mg-P m(-2) h(-1)) in Lower Salto (high SRP). No DIN response in either nitrate or ammonium was observed. Laboratory assays using fresh Lower Salto sediments indicated SRP release (15.4 +/- 5.9 mu g-P g dry wt.(-1) h(-1)), when incubated in filter sterilized Salto water at ambient P concentration, but retention when incubated in filter sterilized river water amended to 2.0 mg SRP l(-1) (233.2 +/- 5.8 mu g-P g dry wt.(-1) h(-1)). SRP uptake/release was similar in both control- and biocide-treated sediments indicating predominantly abiotic retention. High SRP retention even under biologically saturated conditions, absence of a DIN response to amendment, patterns of desorption following amendment, and similar patterns of retention and release under control and biologically inhibited conditions all indicated predominantly abiotic P flux.

AB  - 1-Alkyl-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenes and a high relative amount of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (TTMB) have been previously detected in the marine oils and asphaltenes in the oils from the Tarim Basin. In the present study, the stable carbon isotopic compositions of TTMB and n-alkanes in the pyrolysates of asphaltenes in the marine oils from the northern Tarim Basin and Silurian tar sands from the Tarim Basin were determined. TTMB has stable carbon isotopic compositions in the range from -23 parts per thousand to -24 parts per thousand and are about 12 parts per thousand more enriched in C-13 than concomitant n-alkanes (-35 parts per thousand to -37 parts per thousand) in the pyrolysates. The results indicate a contribution from green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) to TTMB. Thus, the depositional environments of the source rocks for the marine oils and the bitumen in tar sands from the Tarim Basin are characterized by periods of euxinic conditions within the photic zone.

AB  - The aim of this work is to outline a general picture of life style and conditions of a population living in Magna Graecia between the 7th and the 4th c. BC by the study of human skeletal remains found in two necropoles from the Matera province, Timmari and Montescaglioso, neighbouring Metaponto, one of the main Ionian Greek colonies. The biological reconstruction was attempted by a holistic approach which foresees the use of anthropometric, anthroposcopic, palaeodemographic, palaeopathological data, the study of skeletal and dentoalveolar indicators of environmental stress and the integration with archaeological and historical information. Interpretation of the results was also based on comparisons with coeval sites from Central-Southern Italy, from Greece and with earlier and later sites from the same region.
   The two samples from Matera did not show appreciable differences with the other Southern Italian coeval series when compared on the basis of metric and morphometric traits. The comparison with Greek samples was hampered by the scarcity of pertinent data. A high level of muscular activity was observed in males and females, with males clearly more mobile than females. Sexual dimorphism and limb bone lateralisation were marked. Health conditions and nutritional status were good.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY TOPICS IN LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Common methods used to decontaminate and disinfect laboratory animal areas are difficult to standardize, labor-intensive, and Potentially hazardous for staff members and the environment. As an alternative to traditional methods, we tested fumigation with vaporized hydrogen peroxide by using the VHP 1000 Biodecontamination System. The design of our air-conditioning system allowed the connection of the generator to any animal room by using the ventilation piping, thus forming a closed circuit. A 3-h cycle consisting of dehumidification, conditioning, sterilization, and aeration was developed and shown to be effective. The biodecontamination process was monitored during five independent trials using chemical and biological (Bacillus stearothermophilus spores) indicators. Contact plates for testing surfaces and room air for environmental bacteria, yeasts, and fungi consistently showed fewer than 10 colony-forming units per 100 cm(2) or per 1 liter air. In addition, this method proved successful with heat-sensitive equipment like the blower units of individually ventilated caging systems. Overall, the system was easy to use and very effective in biodecontaminating animal rooms and equipment in a reproducible manner. There were no signs of corrosion or functional damage after more than 10 fumigation cycles. Work load and potential health risk for staff members and the environment was negligible.

AB  - Particulate matter is a common health hazard, and under certain conditions, an ecological threat. While many studies were conducted in regard to air pollution and potential effects, this paper serves as a pilot scale investigation into the spatial and temporal variability of particulate matter (PM) pollution in arid urban environments in general, and Beer-Sheva, Israel as a case study. We explore the use of commercially off the shelf (COTS) sensors, which provide an economical solution for spatio-temporal measurements. We started with a comparison process against an A-grade meteorological station, where it was shown that under specific climatic conditions, a number of COTS sensors were able to produce robust agreement (mean R2=0.93, average SD=17.5). The second stage examined the COTS sensors that were proven accurate in a mobile measurement campaign. Finally, data collected was compared to a validated satellite prediction model. We present how these tests and COTS sensor-kits could then be used to further explain the continuity and dispersion of particulate matter in similar areas.

AB  - Research suggests that children living in areas with more greenspace may have better self-regulation, but to date no studies have investigated this capacity immediately following exposure to natural vs. urban environments. To explore this, two studies using between-subjects experimental designs were conducted. Participants, between eight and eleven years old, completed a delay of gratification task (as an indicator of self-regulation) before and after a short (3 min) video of either a natural or built environment or a control display. Potential cognitive and emotional mechanisms underpinning any self-regulation effects were explored using a selective attention task (Stroop test) and by monitoring mood (adapted Cantril's ladder). Results were mixed. Supporting earlier work, post-test delay of gratification scores were significantly better after exposure to a natural than urban environment, however, compared to controls, it appeared that this effect was due to the depleting effect of the built condition, rather than any restorativeness of the natural condition. Although we also found a marginally significant increase in mood after exposure to the natural environment, this did not mediate the effects of environment on self-regulation.

AB  - Most experimental work on the origin of life has focused on either characterizing the chemical synthesis of particular biochemicals and their precursors or on designing simple chemical systems that manifest life-like properties such as self-propagation or adaptive evolution. Here we propose a new class of experiments, analogous to artificial ecosystem selection, where we select for spontaneously forming self-propagating chemical assemblages in the lab and then seek evidence of a response to that selection as a key indicator that life-like chemical systems have arisen. Since surfaces and surface metabolism likely played an important role in the origin of life, a key experimental challenge is to find conditions that foster nucleation and spread of chemical consortia on surfaces. We propose high-throughput screening of a diverse set of conditions in order to identify combinations of "food," energy sources, and mineral surfaces that foster the emergence of surface-associated chemical consortia that are capable of adaptive evolution. Identification of such systems would greatly advance our understanding of the emergence of self-propagating entities and the onset of adaptive evolution during the origin of life.

AB  - Halobacterium salinarum is an extreme halophile archaeon with an absolute requirement for a multimolar salt environment. It accumulates molar concentrations of KCl in the cytosol to counterbalance the external osmotic pressure imposed by the molar NaCl. As a consequence, cytosolic proteins are permanently exposed to low water activity and highly ionic conditions. In non-adapted systems, such conditions would promote protein aggregation, precipitation, and denaturation. In contrast, in vitro studies showed that proteins from extreme halophilic cells are themselves obligate halophiles. In this paper, adaptation via dynamics to low-salt stress in H. salinarum cells was measured by neutron scattering experiments coupled with microbiological characterization. The molecular dynamic properties of a proteome represent a good indicator for environmental adaptation and the neutron/microbiology approach has been shown to be well tailored to characterize these modifications. In their natural setting, halophilic organisms often have to face important variations in environmental salt concentration. The results showed deleterious effects already occur in the H. salinarum proteome, even when the external salt concentration is still relatively high, suggesting the onset of survival mechanisms quite early when the environmental salt concentration decreases.

AB  - Sediment toxicity bioassays using planktonic organisms are widespread tools in environmental quality assessment, but they have limitations because the method for extracting and diluting the liquid phase may affect the final toxicity. The present study compares the toxicity on sea urchin embryos and larvae of elutriates and pore water obtained from intertidal sediments by various methods, The effects of mixing method, dilution protocol, aeration, and pH adjustment of the pore water are discussed. For a quantitative assessment of toxicity, a posteriori dilution of the elutriate yielded results comparable to mixing the equivalent proportions of sediment and sea water. The highest sensitivity was found by using pore water. Rotator mixing in air-tight closed flasks was a second-best choice. In both cases the geochemical parameters of the liquid phases obtained were not suitable for the incubation of water-column organisms. To avoid the environmentally irrelevant toxicity caused by these natural conditions typical of highly reduced sediments, gentle aeration or dilution with O-2-saturated control sea water is necessary prior to testing, despite the unavoidable changes in redox conditions. Measuring length of 48-h-old larvae improves the sensitivity and the discriminating power of the test.

AB  - Pollution by heavy metals (HM) represents a serious threat for both the environment and human health. Due to their elemental character, HM cannot be chemically degraded, and their detoxification in the environment mostly resides either in stabilization in situ or in their removal from the matrix, e.g., soil. For this purpose, phytoremediation, i.e., the application of plants for the restoration of a polluted environment, has been proposed as a promising green alternative to traditional physical and chemical methods. Among the phytoremediation techniques, phytoextraction refers to the removal of HM from the matrix through their uptake by a plant. It possesses considerable advantages over traditional techniques, especially due to its cost effectiveness, potential treatment of multiple HM simultaneously, no need for the excavation of contaminated soil, good acceptance by the public, the possibility of follow-up processing of the biomass produced, etc. In this review, we focused on three basic HM phytoextraction strategies that differ in the type of plant species being employed: natural hyperaccumulators, fast-growing plant species with high-biomass production and, potentially, plants genetically engineered toward a phenotype that favors efficient HM uptake and boosted HM tolerance. Considerable knowledge on the applicability of plants for HM phytoextraction has been gathered to date from both lab-scale studies performed under controlled model conditions and field trials using real environmental conditions. Based on this knowledge, many specific applications of plants for the remediation of HM-polluted soils have been proposed. Such studies often also include suggestions for the further processing of HM-contaminated biomass, therefore providing an added economical value. Based on the examples presented here, we recommend that intensive research be performed on the selection of appropriate plant taxa for various sets of conditions, environmental risk assessment, the fate of HM-enriched biomass, economical aspects of the process, etc.

AB  - Long-term data are needed to explore the interaction of weather extremes with habitat alteration; in particular, can 'refugia' buffer population dynamics against climate change and are they robust to disturbances such as timber harvesting. Because forest bats are good indicators of ecosystem health, we used 14 years (1999-2012) of mark-recapture data from a suite of small tree-hollow roosting bats to estimate survival, abundance and body condition in harvested and unharvested forest and over extreme El Nino and La Nina weather events in southeastern Australia. Trapping was replicated within an experimental forest, located in a climate refuge, with different timber harvesting treatments. We trapped foraging bats and banded 3043 with a 32% retrap rate. Mark-recapture analyses allowed for dependence of survival on time, species, sex, logging treatment and for transients. A large portion of the population remained resident, with a maximum time to recapture of nine years. The effect of logging history (unlogged vs 16-30 years post-logging regrowth) on apparent survival was minor and species specific, with no detectable effect for two species, a positive effect for one and negative for the other. There was no effect of logging history on abundance or body condition for any of these species. Apparent survival of residents was not strongly influenced by weather variation (except for the smallest species), unlike previous studies outside of refugia. Despite annual variation in abundance and body condition across the 14 years of the study, no relationship with extreme weather was evident. The location of our study area in a climate refuge potentially buffered bat population dynamics from extreme weather. These results support the value of climate refugia in mitigating climate change impacts, though the lack of an external control highlights the need for further studies on the functioning of climate refugia. Relatively stable population dynamics were not compromised by timber harvesting, suggesting ecologically sustainable harvesting may be compatible with climate refugia.

AB  - Predicting the environmental impact of a proposed development is notoriously difficult, especially when future conditions fall outside the current range of conditions. Individual-based approaches have been developed and applied to predict the impact of environmental changes on wintering and staging coastal bird populations. How many birds make use of staging sites is mostly determined by food availability and accessibility, which in the case of many waterbirds in turn is affected by water level. Many water systems are regulated and water levels are maintained at target levels, set by management authorities. We used an individual-based modelling framework (MORPH) to analyse how different target water levels affect the number of migratory Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii staging at a shallow freshwater lake (Lauwersmeer, the Netherlands) in autumn. As an emerging property of the model, we found strong non-linear responses of swan usage to changes in water level, with a sudden drop in peak numbers as well as bird-days with a 0.20 m rise above the current target water level. Such strong non-linear responses are probably common and should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.

AB  - The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is highly dependent on sea ice conditions, and future climate change may affect its distribution and numbers. Most studies on the demography and population dynamics of emperor penguins in relation to sea ice characteristics were conducted at a single colony (Pointe Geologie). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dramatic decline of this colony, including changes in sea ice conditions, predation, flipper banding and human disturbance. Here, we report and analyse updated long-term trends in numbers of breeding pairs made at two colonies (Pointe Geologie and Haswell Island) where counts are comparable. Similar changes were observed for both colonies and paralleled changes in sea ice extent. At Pointe Geologie and Haswell Island, populations declined similarly and later growth rates were also similar since the early 1990s for Haswell and early 1980s for Pointe Geologie. The magnitude of the decline was similar between both colonies when numbers of breeding pairs were assessed. This study suggests that a common large-scale environmental factor has probably negatively affected both colonies.

AB  - A comparative analysis of three regional groups of phytocoenoses dominated by Phragmites australis was undertaken in order to find if they reveal any interregional differentiation in the habitat (water and substratum) conditions and if the differences are followed by floristic composition. A group of 60 phytocoenoses studied in mesotrophic and (mostly) eutrophic lakes of midwestern Poland were compared to two groups investigated in moderately nutrient-rich lakes of northeastern Poland (32 phytocoenoses) and nutrient-poor lakes of northern Poland (20 phytocoenoses). Statistical analyses revealed significant habitat differences. Although the groups of phytocoenoses were studied in different regions and different types of water bodies, they,occupied habitats poor in bioavailable forms of nutrients in water and organic matter content and sodium in the substratum, which is inconsistent with the general opinion concerning the reed community as indicative for the high trophy level of lakes. Floristic differences among the studied groups of phytocoenoses are not significant in phytocoenotic terms and relate more to the type of lakes than to established habitat differences. This might suggest that the habitat-forming power of Phragmites australis is the main factor to influence habitat properties.

AB  - Mechanisms influencing initiation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are diverse, and are not likely to be mutually exclusive. Rather, initiation of HABs is a result of interactions between processes, which result in biological, physical, and chemical conditions optimal for a bloom. Due to the complexity of some bloom initiation processes, bloom-preventative management may be possible. Results from a modeling exercise and a laboratory experiment indicated that a phytoplankton bloom could be circumvented through manipulation of the nutrient-loading mode, i.e., pulsed vs. continuous loading. These findings, should they prove consistent in more robust field experiments, may provide insights for the development of new management approaches for some HABs. Optimal bloom conditions, however, vary between HAB species. Consequently, it is unlikely that a single management solution will exist. Preventative management efforts will require early warning of HAB initiation, perhaps even before the appearance of an HAB species. An indicator based on the dynamic nature of phytoplankton succession events and phytoplankton species diversity may prove useful for this purpose. Applying this index to an existing plankton data set showed that Microcystis blooms might have been predicted months before the start of the bloom.

AB  - Wetland restoration has been implemented widely but evaluation of the effectiveness of wetland restoration has been limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the utility of aquatic invertebrate assemblages as potential indicators of restoration condition in wetlands of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China. Results from non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of invertebrate assemblages showed that study wetlands (n = 16) divided into two groups: natural wetlands and wetlands that have been restored for 4 years were classified as a group, and impaired wetlands and wetlands restored for only 1 year were classified into another group. After 4 years of recovery, 47.9% of invertebrate taxa found at the natural wetlands could also be found at the restored wetlands, primarily insects with aerial dispersal capabilities for rapid colonization. Indicator species analysis identified differences in community composition among wetland types, and Amphiagrion sp. and Bezzia sp. were indicators of the restored wetlands. In Northeastern China, aquatic invertebrate assemblages and certain indicator species may provide robust measures of wetland restoration. It is urgent for further exploration to monitor restored wetlands in the long-time series and fully assess the efficiency of the restoration.

AB  - Water from mining drainage is turbid because of suspensions. We tested the hypothesis that the chemical composition as well as shape and size of particles in suspensions of natural origin affect the density and functional diversity of zooplankton. The suspensions were analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Elements found in the beidellite clays were also identified in the mineral structure of the particles. As the size of the microparticles decreased, the weight proportions of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine increased in the suspensions. These conditions facilitated the biomass growth of large and small microphages and raptorials. As the size of the nanoparticles decreased, the shares of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium increased. These conditions inhibited raptorials the most. Ecosystem functionality was the highest with intermediate suspension parameters, which were at the lower range of the microphase and the upper range of the nanophase. The functional traits of zooplankton demonstrate their potential for use as sensitive indicators of disruptions in aquatic ecosystems that are linked with the presence of suspensions, and they facilitate gaining an understanding of the causes and scales of the impact of suspensions.

AB  - Bivalve shell chemistries provide valuable insights into past environments if relationships between shell chemistry and environmental conditions are known. This study assessed the suitability of Goolwa cockle (Donax deltoides) shell element composition as an environmental proxy for southern Australia, a region lacking high-resolution environmental records. Cockles were collected along an environmental gradient and the element composition of corresponding water and shell samples were quantified using a combination of ICP-AES and ICP-MS (for water samples), and LA-ICP-MS (for shells). Of the elements analysed, Ba/Ca, Li/Ca and Mg/Ca in shells reflected ambient water chemistries. Shell Ba/Ca concentrations showed a significant, negative relationship with recorded salinities, and a positive (non-significant) trend was observed between Mg/Ca and water temperature. Further assessment of environmental and biological controls on element incorporation are required; however, Ba/Ca in D. deltoides shells appears a suitable palaeo-salinity tool and has the potential to provide an easily accessible and valuable proxy to gain insights into past environmental conditions over extensive time scales.

AB  - Wheezing and childhood asthma are not synonymous but rather comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions that have different outcomes over the course of childhood. Most infants who wheeze have a transient condition associated with diminished airway function at birth and have no increased risk of asthma later in life. However, children with persistent wheezing throughout childhood and frequent exacerbations represent the main challenge today. Studying the natural history of asthma is important for the understanding and accurate prediction of the clinical course of different phenotypes. To date, a great improvement has been achieved in reducing the frequency of asthma symptoms. However, neither decreased environmental exposure nor controller treatment, as recommended by the recent National Asthma Education And Prevention Program, can halt the progression of asthma in childhood or the development of persistent wheezing phenotype. This review focuses on the recent studies that led to the current understanding of asthma phenotypes in childhood and the recommended treatments. Mt Sinai J Med 78:645-660, 2011.

AB  - Mitigation wetlands are expected to compensate for the loss of structure and function of natural wetlands within 5-10 years of creation; however, the age-based trajectory of development in wetlands is unclear. This study investigates the development of coupled structural (soil properties) and functional (nitrogen cycling) attributes of created non-tidal freshwater wetlands of varying ages and natural reference wetlands to determine if created wetlands attain the water quality ecosystem service of nitrogen (N) cycling over time. Soil condition component and its constituents, gravimetric soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total N, generally increased and bulk density decreased with age of the created wetland. Nitrogen flux rates demonstrated age-related patterns, with younger created wetlands having lower rates of ammonification, nitrification, nitrogen mineralization, and denitrification potential than older created wetlands and natural reference wetlands. Results show a clear age-related trajectory in coupled soil condition and N cycle development, which is essential for water quality improvement. These findings can be used to enhance N processing in created wetlands and inform the regulatory evaluation of mitigation wetlands by identifying structural indicators of N processing performance.

AB  - The present study investigates the potential use of haemocyte lysosomal fragility as a reliable indicator of toxic injury in snails subjected to herbicide atrazine. Two cytochemical assays were used. The first one was based on microscopic observations of neutral red dye, and the second one on a fluorescence spectroscopy approach using acridine orange, which had the advantage of being more reliable in assessing minor cell damage. Two sets of experiments were carried out in controlled laboratory conditions (temperature. photoperiod) and in outdoor microcosms. which produce more realistic ecological conditions. An unequivocal relationship was shown, linking atrazine exposure to Lymnaea stagnalis haemocytes lysosomal permeability. High temperatures also had a negative effect on the lysosomal membrane. In the microcosms, the response was affected by seasonal factors, and led to an integrated cell response. It was concluded that lysosomal sensitivity reflects environmental changes. Moreover, the technique using acridine orange was shown to be sufficiently sensitive and reliable to serve as a lysosomal marker in a controlled environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Adequate time lying down is often considered an important aspect of dairy cow welfare. We examine what is known about cows' motivation to lie down and the consequences for health and other indicators of biological function when this behavior is thwarted. We review the environmental and animal-based factors that affect lying time in the context of animal welfare. Our objective is to review the research into the time that dairy cows spend lying down and to critically examine the evidence for the link with animal welfare. Cows can be highly motivated to lie down. They show rebound lying behavior after periods of forced standing and will sacrifice other activities, such as feeding, to lie down for an adequate amount of time. They will work, by pushing levers or weighted gates, to lie down and show possible indicators of frustration when lying behavior is thwarted. Some evidence suggests that risk of lameness is increased in environments that provide unfavorable conditions for cows to lie down and where cows are forced to stand. Lameness itself can result in longer lying times, whereas mastitis reduces it. Cow-based factors such as reproductive status, age, and milk production influence lying time, but the welfare implications of these differences are unknown. Lower lying times are reported in pasture-based systems, dry lots, and bedded packs (9 h/d) compared with tiestalls and freestalls (10 to 12 h/d) in cross-farm research. Unfavorable conditions, including too few lying stalls for the number of cows, hard or wet lying surfaces, inadequate bedding, stalls that are too small or poorly designed, heat, and rain all reduce lying time. Time constraints, such as feeding or milking, can influence lying time. however, more information is needed about the implications of mediating factors such as the effect of the standing surface (concrete, pasture, or other surfaces) and cow behavior while standing (e.g., being restrained, walking, grazing) to understand the effect of low lying times on animal welfare. Many factors contribute to the difficulty of finding a valid threshold for daily lying time to use in the assessment of animal welfare. Although higher lying times often correspond with cow comfort, and lower lying times are seen in unfavorable conditions, exceptions occur, namely when cows lie down for longer because of disease or when they spend more time standing because of estrus or parturition, or to engage in other behaviors. In conclusion, lying behavior is important to dairy cattle, but caution and a full understanding of the context and the character of the animals in question is needed before drawing firm conclusions about animal welfare from measures of lying time.

AB  - There is no doubt Sustainability reaching is essential. Natural resources rational use is extremely important to human development. Beyond the years, this preoccupation led various institutions to elaborate legislation and international guides, as Kyoto protocol, to satisfy sustainability conditions. Agenda 2030 is the most recent instrument, whose proposals attempt to these conditions. Within this context, human activity related to Chemistry is noteworthy: to guarantee all sustainable aspects in a procedure is a great challenge. The assessment of Sustainability in Chemistry is performed by green metrics calculations, whose utility is most appropriate in comparison of procedures than in a single procedure assessment. Due to problematics with the utilization of metrics, related to: simplifications leading to pseudo-results, need of various misunderstanding calculations and incorrect adoption of metrics, an environmental metric that attempts to current necessities related to materials and energetics consumption and to assessment of sustainability in individual chemistry procedures is proposed. The metric was elaborated aiming to attempt all environmental requirements of chemical sustainability in a simplified and reliable manner, basing on bibliographic search and expertise. The metric elaboration has a combined approach, in which reference values are established to the main indicators of sustainability, using a Soft System Methodology (SSM).

AB  - To better understand the relationship between soil bacterial communities, soil physicochemical properties, land use and geographical distance, we considered for the first time ever a European transect running from Sweden down to Portugal and from France to Slovenia. We investigated 71 sites based on their range of variation in soil properties (pH, texture and organic matter), climatic conditions (Atlantic, alpine, boreal, continental, Mediterranean) and land uses (arable, forest and grassland). 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial communities highly varied in diversity, richness, and structure according to environmental factors. At the European scale, taxa area relationship (TAR) was significant, supporting spatial structuration of bacterial communities. Spatial variations in community diversity and structure were mainly driven by soil physicochemical parameters. Within soil clusters (k-means approach) corresponding to similar edaphic and climatic properties, but to multiple land uses, land use was a major driver of the bacterial communities. Our analyses identified specific indicators of land use (arable, forest, grasslands) or soil conditions (pH, organic C, texture). These findings provide unprecedented information on soil bacterial communities at the European scale and on the drivers involved; possible applications for sustainable soil management are discussed.

AB  - Reintroducing fish to previously occupied habitats appears promising for recovery of extirpated fish populations in cold water systems. Uncertainty still exists surrounding the ecological effects of reintroductions however, particularly when they involve historically sympatric taxa. We initiated a study to estimate any potential impacts to rainbow/steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that may arise from reintroducing coho salmon (O. kisutch) in Taneum Creek, Washington, following their extirpation approximately 100 years ago. Prior to reintroducing coho salmon into Taneum Creek, we conducted a formal risk assessment to predict potential impacts to rainbow trout that might result from restoring coho salmon natural production in this stream. Following the assessment, adult coho salmon were released to spawn naturally in experimental reaches in Taneum Creek during a five year period, 2008-2012. Rainbow trout abundance, average size, condition, and growth were not reduced in our experimental reaches relative to control locations following the reintroduction of coho salmon; a result predicted from our ecological risk assessment. Our findings validate the utility of the ecological risk assessment for predicting and reducing undesirable effects of reintroductions involving historically sympatric salmonids.

AB  - Changing climate conditions are having an appreciable impact both on the adaptive response of the species growing in urban and peri-urban forests (UPF) and on their evolutionary dynamics. This study sought to chart the evolution and pollen dynamics of major species growing in the La Alhambra peri-urban forest (Granada, Spain) over the last 22 years, to examine correlations with weather-related parameters and to estimate potential trends in the event of future climate change. Findings showed that overall pollen levels have gradually increased over the study period, reflecting both plant species diversification and the ability of Mediterranean species-particularly Pinus and Quercus-to adapt to short-term water stress situations. Nevertheless, the climate conditions expected over the coming years in the Mediterranean region, with considerable increase in winter temperatures and a drop in precipitation by up to 24 % for summer rainfall, there is likely to be a reduction in the intensity of pollen emissions, at least from species with strict environmental requirements. The results confirm that pollen emission is a valuable biological indicator for estimating the adaptive response of various species and the resilience of the forest mass to climate-change events.

AB  - Hordeum geniculatum is considered as an obligate halophyte, but exact data about ecological requirements of the species are lacking. Therefore, species response curves of H. geniculatum were obtained for soil reaction and nutrients using Borhidi's indicator values and LOESS smoother response model in the programme CANOCO. Our data showed that H. geniculatum can be regarded as an obligate halophyte preferring slightly to moderately saline soils with relatively high content of nutrients. The Hordeetum hystricis association, indicating grazed vegetation on salt-rich soils, is a plant community that occurs only in central and southeastern Europe. Because this plant community has only been documented in a relatively small area, details about its vegetation ecology are inaccurate. Therefore, the ecology and species composition of this community were studied in three countries within the Pannonian Basin (Hungary, Serbia and Slovakia). A detrended correspondence analysis of 95 releves from the Pannonian Basin confirmed that the community is characterised by the cover of H. geniculatum above 25%, which may even reach 75%. The association was species-rich; we sampled 91 taxa in 95 releves. The widespread presence of many accessory species was dependent on environmental conditions, particularly the nutrient and salt content and animal disturbance.

AB  - This research was designed to compare allergenic flora of various cities of central Italy. Because the data on this problem are rather scant, we wanted to highlight the relationships among the ecological conditions of the urban habitats, and the plants whose pollens cause allergic manifestations in the human population. Our results pointed out that the structural design of the urban land use types play an important role in the distribution of allergophytes. The compact structure of the historic city center does not impede the establishment of allergophytes. Actually, it promotes some species that come from the dry pastures and rocky walls of the surrounding ecosystems. Allergenicity was revealed throughout the urban area, with a prevalence of species with monoporate pollens characteristic of the Poaceae. Highly allergenic plants are present in the central zone (within the city walls) and in some peripheral land use models (urban road verges). The particular abundance of Urticaceae with small triporate pollen grains and of various cultivated species, introduced by man for aesthetic reasons, contributes to the increase of allergophytism. The study points out the role of the interactions between the allergenic flora, human impact through the land use patterns, urban fauna, and the meso- and microclimatic conditions of the cities studied.

AB  - Ecological water use efficiency (WUE) is a crucial indicator of hydrological and vegetation carbon cycle coupling and can drastically affect water and energy exchanges. However, little is known about the sensitivity of WUE to water-energy exchange in semiarid regions. Moreover, few studies have considered the link between WUE and water-energy exchange models, i.e., the Budyko-type framework. Here, we investigated the relationships between WUE and a Budyko-type model in a semiarid basin. Seven primary indicators were selected to represent the water, energy, and vegetation variations in the ecosystem: gross primary productivity (GPP), air temperature (T), potential evapotranspiration (PET), evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation (P), soil water content (SWC), and snow water equivalent (SWE). Three similar ecological WUEs were defined as GPP/ET, GPP/P, and GPP/SWC to analyze the factors of the water-energy exchange model (i.e., ET/P, PET/P, SWC/P, and SWE/P). Based on the results, four linear Budyko-type models were proposed for the basin (GPP/P, ET/P, SWC/P, and SWE/P as a function of PET/P). The results suggested that both SWC and P influenced the trend of GPP variation, whereas P influenced the lower limit of GPP or GPP/P within the Budyko model for grassland areas. The results indicated that the rate of increase of SWC was lower than that of P in forest areas because of differences in canopy structure. The results also revealed a nonlinear (s-type) relationship between the WUEs and the underlying surface parameter m within the Budyko framework, suggesting that unit plant productivity consumes less water when the water-energy supply condition is invariant, if the variation of the underlying surface characteristics promotes the increase of m. Our research provides new insight regarding quantification of the sensitivity of WUE to the water-energy balance in a semiarid region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) contamination from Fusarium graminearum colonization is particularly important in food and feed wheat, especially during post-harvest storage with legislative limits for both food and feed grain. Indicators of the relative risk from exceeding these limits would be useful. We examined the effect of different water activities (a(w); 0.95-0.90) and temperature (10-25 degrees C) in naturally contaminated and irradiated wheat grain, both inoculated with F. graminearum and stored for 15 days on (a) respiration rate; (b) dry matter losses (DML); (c) ZEN production and (d) relationship between DML and ZEN contamination relative to the EU legislative limits. Gas Chromatography was used to measure the temporal respiration rates and the total accumulated CO2 production. There was an increase in temporal CO2 production rates in wetter and warmer conditions in all treatments, with the highest respiration in the 25 degrees C x 0.95 a(w) treatments + F. graminearum inoculation. This was reflected in the total accumulated CO2 in the treatments. The maximum DMLs were in the 0.95 a(w)/20-25 degrees C treatments and at 10 degrees C/0.95 a(w). The DMLs were modelled to produce contour maps of the environmental conditions resulting in maximum/minimum losses. Contamination with ZEN/ZEN-related compounds were quantified. Maximum production was at 25 degrees C/0.95-0.93 a(w) and 20 degrees C/0.95 a(w). ZEN contamination levels plotted against DMLs for all the treatments showed that at ca. <1.0% DML, there was a low risk of ZEN contamination exceeding EU legislative limits, while at >1.0% DML, the risk was high. This type of data is important in building a database for the development of a post-harvest decision support system for relative risks of different mycotoxins.

AB  - This study investigated the bio-optical conditions of Uummannaq Fjord and Vaigat Disko Bay, two neighboring, semi-enclosed coastal systems in West Greenland. Though close to each other, the systems differ in their hydrographic structure influencing the bio-optical conditions and, subsequently, the biological activities. Both systems showed high inorganic suspended particulate matter (SPMi) concentrations near river runoff or meltwater influxes (max. of 15.28 mg L-1 at the surface) and low colored dissolved organic matter (aCDOM@350nm, < 1.50 m(-1)) abundance throughout the systems. High chlorophyll levels (as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass) were measured in the Vaigat (max. of 11.44 Kg L-1), which represents the outflow arm of Disko Bay. Light penetration depth as indicated by the 1 % depth of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) was dominated by chlorophyll and SPMi alike, ranging from 12.2 to 41.2 m. Based on these characteristics, an effective two component parameterization for the diffuse attenuation coefficient kpAR was developed in order to model light penetration depth as a relevant factor for bio-optical studies in Arctic environments under glacial meltwater influence.

AB  - The methods and approaches selected in a restoration project depend on the degree of ecosystem degradation and on future land use plans. Programs of monitoring and evaluation must therefore compare restoration progress and effectiveness relative to untreated conditions and to target conditions, particularly with respect to the attributes and functions essential to land use objectives. It is usually not feasible to directly monitor all important forest attributes and functions, so a few indicators must be selected. It is argued that natural recovery (or passive restoration) should always be considered a management option, and that the most appropriate evaluation of restoration techniques is by comparison with untreated areas that have been left for the same period of time as treated areas. Unambiguous evaluation therefore requires all restoration projects to be considered as formal experiments with proper controls, replicates, and the randomized application of treatment options. Adaptation to anticipated levels of climate change can be incorporated by emulating forest compositions and structures currently prevailing elsewhere under analogues of future climates and associated disturbance regimes. A structured program of monitoring and evaluation within a framework of adaptive management will engender management flexibility and resilience in an uncertain future.

AB  - Primary treated sewage effluent from the city of Vancouver, Canada was deposited directly onto the intertidal ecosystem of Sturgeon bank, Fraser river estuary between 1962 and 1988. In response to the degraded sediment conditions an azoic zone developed near the discharge outfall, Effluent discharges into the intertidal zone were almost completely stopped in 1988 with the construction of a Submerged outfall, Our studies. conducted between 1994 and 1996. showed considerable improvement in the environment of the mudflat ecosystem, including increased dissolved oxygen, decreased sediment chlorophyll, decreased organic material in the sediment, reduced heavy metals in surficial sediment and increased grain size. The amphipod Corophium salmonis, important in the food web for juvenile salmon and other fish species. recolonized the previously azoic location. At reference stations, C salmonis density was similar to that observed in previous surveys two decades earlier, Our data strongly suggest that improvement of sediment conditions near the former sewage outfall was a major factor enabling colonization by C salmonis.

AB  - In this study we present a paleoecological interpretation based on quantitative analysis of middle Karpatian (latest Burdigalian) benthic and planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils from Hole BL 503 (Wienerberger) drilled at Laa an der Thaya, Lower Austria. Multivariate statistics based on the Bray-Curtis Similarity, non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (nMDS) and Similarity and Dissimilarity Term Analyses are applied to raw data to identify the ecological gradients subtending the assemblages. Species abundance curves (%) were also plotted. A paleoelimatic curve was obtained using the algebraic sum of planktonic foraminifers warm- and temperate-water indicators (positive) and cool-water indicators (negative) to highlight the paleoelimatic trend during the middle Karpatian. Our data indicate that the sediments drilled at Lau Th. were deposited in water depth not exceeding 200 in, relatively "near shore" in an environment characterized by a generally high concentration of organic matter, suboxic to dysoxic conditions, high nutrient availability, variable salinity and generally cool paleoclimate. On the basis of nannoplankton distribution we also suggest that nutrient availability and upwelling conditions, rather than other ecological factors, control the distribution of calcareous nannoplankton in the Molasse Basin.

AB  - We examine the ecological aspects concerning the status of the surface waters in the delta of the Selenga river for the low-water conditions which have been observed since 1996. The ongoing changes in the most important indicators of the status of the waters in the river delta are assessed on the basis of results of hydrological, hydrochemical and hydrobiological investigations made by these authors in 2013-2015 and with consideration for earlier research efforts. It is established that the low-water conditions resulted in a decrease of the role of the main delta branches, Kharauz and Levoberezhnaya, in streamflow. An increase in the contribution of groundwater in the alimentation of the river led to an increase in concentrations of main ions: for the current low-water period their total content has varied from 119 to 780 mg/L, with a maximum in small delta branches in the wintertime. Changes in concentrations of biogenic elements were recorded: total phosphorus from 10 to 190 mu g P/L, mineral phosphorus from 0 to 35 mu g P/L, and nitrate nitrogen from 0.01 to 0.81 mu g N/L. A minimum of mineral phosphorus compounds and nitrogen was observed at the time of mass development of algae. It is established that the dynamics of organic matter content is determined by changes in hydraulicity, and by the intensity of phytoplankton development. Within the long-term context, a deterioration of water regime and vegetation infill and swamping of shallow delta branches were recorded. The development level of the phytoplankton and changes in its structure point to a progressive eutrophication of the Selenga waters. According to the value of the saprobic index, the quality of the Selenga waters corresponds largely to the category of "moderately polluted" waters (class II and III), and it decreases at low-water periods, especially in shallow delta branches with a high population of cryptophytic algae, to the category of "polluted" waters.

AB  - Dehydrogenase activity (DHA) in soils contaminated by arsenic-bearing tailings was correlated with total arsenic and total water-soluble arsenic (As(III)+As(V)) to evaluate the impact of tailings dispersion on the oxidative capacity of soil microorganisms. Georeferenced surface soil samples (0-10 cm depth) were collected at different distances from a tailings dam. In the samples farthest from the dam, all water-soluble arsenic (avg. 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg kg(-1)) was As(V). The highest concentration of water-soluble As(III)+ As(V) (> 1.9 mg kg(-1)) was found where As(III) was present. DHA averaged 438.9 +/- 79.3 mu g INTF g(-1) h(-1) at the greatest distance from the dam and decreased to 92.3 +/- 27.1 mu g INTF g(-1) h(-1) with decreasing distance from the dam. Pearson correlation coefficient between DHA and samples containing water-soluble As(V) (r = -0.87) was greater than that between DHA and total water-soluble arsenic (r = -0.57). The correlation between DHA and soluble arsenic containing both As(V) and As(III) was not significant (r = 0.24). In soils with detectable As(III) concentrations where wet conditions prevail (i.e., reducing conditions), there is an abiotic response in addition to a biotic one. The correlation between DHA and total water-soluble As(III)+ As(V) was higher (r = -0.79) when the abiotic response was excluded. Our study demonstrated the importance of distinguishing between total and available fraction and its species and the need to evaluate biological functions in addition to purely geochemical analyses. DHA bioassay combined with other microbial properties offers a good tool for evaluating soil microbial activity and status and is a suitable indicator of the oxidative capacity of soil microorganisms affected by tailings in an oxidizing environment; however, under reducing conditions, abiotic responses must also be studied.

AB  - In biodesulfurization (BD) at haloalkaline and dO(2)-limited conditions, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) effectively convert sulfide into elemental sulfur that can be used in agriculture as a fertilizer and fungicide. Here we show which bacteria are present in this biotechnological process. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of biomass from ten reactors sampled in 2018 indicated the presence of 444 bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). A core microbiome represented by 30 ASVs was found in all ten reactors, with Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus as the most dominant species. The majority of these ASVs are phylogenetically related to bacteria previously identified in haloalkaline BD processes and in natural haloalkaline ecosystems. The source and composition of the feed gas had a great impact on the microbial community composition followed by alkalinity, sulfate, and thiosulfate concentrations. The halophilic SOB of the genus Guyparkeria (formerly known as Halothiobacillus) and heterotrophic SOB of the genus Halomonas were identified as potential indicator organisms of sulfate and thiosulfate accumulation in the BD process.

AB  - Development of substrate organisms (oysters, barnacles) and the health of a monitored oyster reef were investigated in the Yangtze Estuary. Very low salinity suppressed oyster survival. Nevertheless, middle- to high-salinity significantly increased the abundance and biomass of substrate organisms, and macrobenthos species and diversity. Long-term variation in substrate organisms was steady after a major fluctuation, yet the macrobenthic community structure lagged behind that of oysters. Overall, the oyster reef was in a healthy state. The M-AMBI results showed that its ecological status under high-salinity was better than medium-salinity conditions. Redundancy analysis indicated these results were associated with changes in water salinity and substrate factors. Taken together, our results suggest this constructed intertidal oyster reef has had a positive effect on the community and health status of macrobenthos in the Yangtze Estuary. Further, these ecological benefits increased going from medium- to high-salinity waters, but were generally absent under low salinity.

AB  - Ciliated protozoa are important components of the microbial food web in various habitats, especially aquatic environments. These organisms are useful bioindicators for both environmental quality assessment and the wastewater purification process. The pathogenic parasitic protozoan species Giardia and Cryptosporidium represent a significant concern for human health, being responsible for numerous disease outbreaks worldwide. The predation of cysts and oocysts in 15 ciliate species from water and sewage samples collected in Campinas, So Paulo, Brazil were verified under laboratory conditions. The ciliated protozoan species were selected based on their mode of nutrition, and only bacterivorous and suspension-feeders were considered for the experiments. The species Blepharisma sinuosum, Euplotes aediculatus, Sterkiella cavicola, Oxytricha granulifera, Vorticella infusionum, Spirostomum minus, and Stentor coeruleus ingested cysts and oocysts, the resistance forms of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., respectively. This is the first time that the ingestion of Giardia cysts by ciliated protozoa has been reported. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the biological removal of these pathogens from aquatic environments.

AB  - The effects of principal mechanisms (selection and complementarity) of biodiversity on ecosystem functionality have been well studied. However, it remains unknown how environmental conditions affect the relative strength of these two mechanisms. To answer this question, a controlled pot experiment was conducted in which species diversity was manipulated in low (natural soil) and high stress (mine tailing) plots, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the principal mechanism underlying the increasing biomass shifts from the selection to complementarity with increasing abiotic stress. The shift occurs because species interactions varied with increasing abiotic stress. Competition prevails in low stress plots, while facilitation dominates in high stress plots. In low stress plots, the monoculture biomass of a specific species is a good indicator of the competitive ability of that species in the mixture, and the dominant species significantly affects the plot biomass. In high stress plots, the tolerance indexes of all individual species increase with the manipulated species richness, providing clear evidence for the increasing role of facilitation.

AB  - Y Aim: This study aims to determine Chironomidae diversity and distribution in three small rivers at Cameron Highlands in relation to their response to water quality conditions.
   Methodology: Fifteen sites from three rivers (Palas River, Pauh River and Bertam River) were chosen for water quality measurements and Chironomidae sampling. Water quality was analysed following APHA standard methods and chironomid was identified to genus level. The rivers were classified based on Malaysian's Water Quality Index (WQI) and macroinvertebrates diversity and distribution was analysed using diversity indices. Comparison between sites and river was undertaken using one-way ANOVA and chironomid appearance in relation to water quality was evaluated using Pearson correlation test.
   Results: Chironomidae (Order: Diptera) distribution at high altitude rivers in Malaysia is not well documented although this group of insect has a wide range of distribution in tropical region. Based on Malaysian water quality index (WQI), result shows all rivers were in Class I. Although still in Class I, Bertam River has slight lower water quality due to higher ammoniacal nitrogen and total suspended solids. The diversity indices also demonstrate that Bertam Rivers was in stress conditions, and other two were in moderate conditions. Three subfamilies (Chironominae, Orthocladiinae and Tanypodinae) were recorded, which comprises of 1963 individuals. Tvetenia (Subfamily: Orthocladiinae) was the most dominant but only dominated Palas River and Pauh River. Another genus from Orthocladiinae (Crocotopus and Rheocrocotopus) also recorded dominant only in Palas River and Pauh River, but lesser in Bertam River. Only Polypedilum (Subfamily: Chironominae) which was second highest recorded, dominated in all rivers, even highest in Bertam River. Amongst dominant genus, only Polypedilum was found dominant in all rivers, others were only dominating Palas River and Pauh River only.
   Interpretation: This findings exhibit wide range of adaptations and potential use of Polypedilum as biological indicator. Due to availability of incomplete keys, identification to species level cannot be undertaken. However, this study reveals thirteen different sub-group of Polypedilum based mouthpart organs, which represent different species for tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Water pollution is a critical management issue, with many rivers and streams draining urban areas being polluted by the disposal of untreated solid waste and wastewater discharge, storm water and agricultural runoff. This has implications for biodiversity, and many rivers in the developing world are now considered compromised. We investigated benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and composition in relation to physico-chemical conditions of the water column and sediments. The study was conducted in an Austral catchment subject to both urban and agricultural pollutants in two different seasons. We assessed whether sediment characteristics were more important drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition than water column characteristics. We expected clear differences in macroinvertebrate community composition and in the associated community metrics due to distinct flow conditions between the two seasons. A combination of multivariate analyses (canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)) and biological indicator analysis were used to examine these patterns. Chironomidae was the most abundant family (>60%) in the upper mainstem river and stream sites. Stream sites were positively associated with CCA axis 2, being characterised by high turbidity and lower pH, salinity, phosphate concentration, channel width and canopy cover. Canopy cover, channel width, substrate embeddedness, phosphate concentration, pH, salinity and turbidity all had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate community composition. Using CCA variation partitioning, water quality was, however, a better predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate composition than sediment chemical conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that seasonality had little effect on structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this south-eastern zone of South Africa, despite clear changes in sediment chemistry. This likely reflects the relative lack of major variability in water chemistry compared to sediment chemistry between seasons and the relatively muted variability in precipitation between seasons than the more classic Austral temperate climates.

AB  - The egg parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko ( Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is the most important and widely distributed species of Trichogramma in Iran. It attacks eggs of several lepidopterous pests, and is a major biological control agent. Rearing parasitoids is necessary for experimental work, and, potentially, for mass release in the field. Selecting a suitable host is critical for developing a successful rearing method. If other conditions are the same, the rate of population increase will be a suitable indicator of parasitoid performance on different hosts. However, conclusions based on a single generation can be misleading because of the learning ability of parasitoids. Life history parameters of T. brassicae were studied on two hosts easily reared in the laboratory, Anagasta kuehniella Zeller, and Plodia interpunctella Hubner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). All the experiments were carried out at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 10% RH, and 16:8 L:D photoperiod. Eight parameters including gross and net reproductive rates (GRR and R-0 respectively), intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), finite rate of population increase (lambda), intrinsic birth and death rates (b and d respectively), cohort generation time (T), and doubling time (DT) were compared between two hosts for two generations. All parameters showed a highly significant difference (alpha = 0.01) between hosts. GRR, R-0, r(m), lambda, and b were higher, while d, T, and DT were lower in Anagasta than Plodia. The intrinsic rate of natural increase was 0.2912 and 0.2145 female/female/day and net replacement rate was 45.51 and 19.26 female/female/generation in Anagasta and Plodia respectively. Differences between generations were significant except for r(m), lambda, and d. The net replacement rate was 28.56 and 39 in the 1(st) and 2(nd) generations respectively. These results showed that A. kuehniella was a better host than P. interpunctella. Higher reproduction occurred in the second generation that may be due to increased adaptation to experimental conditions.

AB  - This paper, taking Beiwenquan Town of Beibei, Chongqing as an example, assessed the impacts of land use on ecological health by comprehensive index method, and discussed methodological system of sustainable land use planning based on ecological health. Results indicated that: 1) From 1992 to 2002, land use changes focused on 12 patterns with the total conversion area of 92.11%, which were related to cultivated land, residential and industrial-mining area, and orchard land. Urbanization and economic reconstruction were the leading driving forces. 2) There was obvious difference of the areas of ecotypes driven by land use change in wide valley and mild slope between 1992 and 2002, while there were little or no difference in steep slope and very steep slope. 3) Both of the conditions of ecological health in 1992 and 2002 were sound, and the ecotypes focused on the types of health and sub-health. But, health ecosystem in 1992, with an area of 764.64ha, accounting for 38.51% of the total evaluation area, was better than that in 2002, with an area of 636.10ha, accounting for 34.19% of the total evaluation area. 4) The ecotypes involved into different ranges have already degenerated, due to humankind's disturbance, while the conditions of ecological health in the same ranges in 1992, regardless of stability and reconstruction, were better than that in 2002.5) The planning scenario based on ecological health was accorded with the practice condition of Beiwenquan Town: 388.29ha of cultivated land could meet the Beiwenquan demand of food and byproduct; 1045.26ha of forest land area, the Beiwenquan demand of ecological health; and 1004.73ha of the residential and industrial-mining area, the Beiwenquan building demand. 6) Sustainable land use planning based on ecological health had higher useful value, because it not only stood to ecological theory, but also satisfied the developmental demand of society and economy.

AB  - The black shale facies contains several discrete chemical groupings of Mn, Fe and V in visually similar rocks. These groups are related to four thermodynamic zones based on changing pE and pH, are identified from a collection of approximately 200 Paleozoic and Mesozoic finely-laminated, low-calcic ([Ca] < 0.4%) black shales. The low-calcic nature of this data set permits the simplifying assumption that CaCO3 is not present as a significant complicating factor. The relative variations in the concentrations of Mn and Fe can be used as indicators of pE-pH conditions. In Group 1 (oxic conditions: high pE), Mn and Fe occur as Mn(III, IV)- and Fe(III)-oxides, and appear in relatively high concentrations (average concentrations 1,300 and 56,000 ppm, respectively). In Group 2 (anoxic: nitrate-reducing to sulfate-reducing at intermediate pH), Mn is reduced to Mn2+ as is evidenced by low Mn concentration (310 ppm average); in Group 2, Fe remains bound in oxides or sulfides with concentrations comparable to those in Group 1 (52,000 ppm). In Group 3, both Mn and Fe are reduced and relatively soluble, reflecting anoxic, but non-sulfate reducing, pE at intermediate to low pH. This solubility, and Mn and Fe species instability, is shown in lower average concentrations 170 and 23,000 ppm, respectively, in Group-3 sediments. Group-4 black shales have V concentrations > 300 ppm, averaging 1500 ppm and indicating deposition under conditions of high organic preservation. Mn and Fe concentrations are low - the Mn concentration is < 260 ppm and averages 80 ppm; Fe is < 36,000 and averages 19,000 ppm. The high V concentration with the relatively low Mn and Fe content suggests low pH and possible methanogenesis at low pE. This study demonstrates the wide variety of black shale depositional environments from oxic to methanic. Accordingly, black shales cannot all be assigned to anoxic, sulfidic environments without additional chemical analysis and interpretation.

AB  - Damage caused to pine forests by industrial pollution is observed even several decades after emissions have stopped down. A simple morphological feature - the leaf fluctuating asymmetry - was used for assessing the condition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands growing in a heavily degraded area. In 2011, a study was performed on the developmental instability of needles in four naturally reforested Polish populations of P.sylvestris. Studies were conducted within the protective zone at a zinc smelter, a copper smelter, a cement plant and train tracks. All selected areas manifested a high extent of anthropogenic pollution-induced environmental degradation until the end of the 90s. Currently, a reduced level of environmental pollution is recorded at these sites. Control group was a natural population of Scots pine from the region of National Park of Wielkopolska. The results confirm the usefulness of fluctuating asymmetry as a highly sensitive indicator of non-specific stress. Also, it was shown that in areas degraded by human activity, poor condition of Scots pine persists that the stress factor has been eliminated. This tendency occurs particularly to areas contaminated by heavy metals.

AB  - Potassium salt modified NaY zeolite along with methanol-water mixture as solvent under microwave irradiation offers an environmentally benign way to synthesize beta-nitroalcohols rapidly with excellent yield and selectivities. Here, NaY zeolite was modified with 0.5-20 % KF (w/w) by a wet impregnation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and Hammett base strength measurement methods. It was observed that framework structure preserved even after 20 % loading of KF while crystallinity decreased from lower to higher loading. The obtained materials showed quite different base strengths with varying percentage of the salt over the support and with change of their activation temperatures. The effects of different reaction parameters such as amount of solvents, nature of solvents, microwave power and microwave irradiation time were studied to minimize the reaction time without compromising the yields. Among the loaded catalysts, 10 wt% KF loaded catalyst was found to be the best catalyst and gave 97 % yield within 2 min under optimized reaction conditions. Recovery of the catalysts was tested for three times and it showed similar conversions in each cycle.

AB  - Questions Land-use change is a key driver of biodiversity change. Delayed biotic responses to land-use change impede the establishment of causal links between specific anthropogenic changes and resulting biodiversity change. Therefore, we aimed at investigating changes to plant species pools: (a) at time scales long enough to encompass past land-use changes, even changes that have ceased from collective memory; and (b) at spatial scales wide enough to encompass landscape-wide changes to habitat quantity and quality. Location Denmark, 10 regions in the range 54 degrees 3 '-56 degrees 7 ' N and 10 degrees 4 '-12 degrees 4 ' E. Methods We assessed changes to regional plant species pools over ca 140 years by comparing high-quality legacy data to recent re-surveys in ten Danish regions. To identify anthropogenic drivers of plant compositional change, we assessed ecological properties of winning and losing plant species and compared observed biotic changes to land-cover data spatially and temporally matching the regional flora data. Results Winner species were strongly associated with shaded, fertile, well-drained conditions. Loser species were associated with open, infertile conditions with either moist or xeric soils. The major land-use changes driving biotic change were: (a) drainage of moist and wet biotopes; (b) active afforestation and passive scrub overgrowth due to ceased grazing; and (c) landscape-wide increased nutrient availability. However, the magnitude of increase or decrease in the area of a land-cover type was a poor predictor of the number of habitat-associated winner or loser species. This suggests that degradation of extant biotopes and/or low quality of new biotopes limits plant species richness, in particular of habitat specialists. Conclusions We demonstrate a displacement of plant ecospace towards mesic, shaded and fertile conditions, with profound effects on plant diversity, and mainly driven by intensified agricultural/silvicultural use of the landscape matrix, which has strongly affected the main plant habitats in scattered semi-natural fragments.

AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems characterized by redoximorphic environments producing typical soil forming processes and organic carbon accumulation. Assessments and management of these areas are dependent on knowledge about soil characteristics and variability. By reflectance spectroscopy, information about soils can be obtained since their spectral behaviors are directly related to their chemical, physical, and mineralogical properties reflecting the pedogenetic processes and environment conditions. Our aims were: (a) to characterize the main soil classes of wetlands regarding their spectral behaviors in VIS-NIR-SWIR (350-2500 nm) and relate them to pedogenesis and environmental conditions, (b) to determine spectral ranges (bands) with greater expression of the main soil properties, (c) to identify spectral variations and similarities between hydromorphic soils from wetlands and other soils under different moisture conditions, and (d) to propose spectral models to quantify some chemical and physical soil properties used as environmental quality indicators. Nine soil profiles from the Pantanal region (Mato Grosso State, Brazil) and one from the Serra do Espinhaco Meridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) were investigated. Spectral morphology interpretation allowed identifying horizon differences regarding shape, absorption features and reflectance intensity. Some pedogenetic processes of wetland soils related to organic carbon accumulation and oxide iron variation were identified by spectra. Principal Component Analysis allowed discriminating soils from wetland and outside this area (oxidic environment). Quantification of organic carbon was possible with R-2 of 0.90 and low error. Quantification of clay content was masked by soils with organic carbon content over 2% where it was not possible to quantify with high R2 and low error both properties when dataset has soil samples with high organic carbon content. By reflectance spectroscopy, important characteristics of wetland soils can be identified and used to distinguish from soils of different environments at low costs, reduced time, and with environmental quality.

AB  - This study represents a detailed micropalaeontological investigation of the composition and diversity of planktonic foraminiferal assemblages from the upper Turonian to Maastrichtian interval of two deep exploration wells (Al Mahr-1 and Palmyra-1) in the Palmyride area of Syria. In combination with lithostratigraphic analysis, this detailed biostratigraphic study provided important new palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic interpretations and insights into the nature of deposition along the northern passive margin of Gondwana during the Late Cretaceous.
   The investigated strata belong to three lithostratigraphic units (from base to top): the upper part of the Judea Formation (upper Turonian-lowermost Santonian), the Soukhne Formation (Santonian-lower Campanian), and the Shiranish Formation (upper Campanian-Maastrichtian). The results represent the first detailed determination of planktonic foraminifera from the Palmyride region. The presence of rich and diverse foraminiferal associations enabled the establishment of the following nine late Turonian to Maastrichtian biostratigraphic zones, based on documented indextaxa and/or the entire microfossil assemblages: I) Biozone I; II) Biozone II; III) Biozone III; IV) Contusotruncana plummerae Zone; V) Biozone V; VI) Globotruncanella havanensis Zone; VII) Pseudoguembelina palpebra Zone; VIII) Racemiguembelina fructicosa Zone; and IX) Abathomphalus mayaroensis Zone. The late Turonian to early Campanian foraminiferal assemblages (biozones I-IV) are dominated by opportunistic taxa (r-strategists) and suggest a generally fluctuating subtropical climate and deposition an outer shelf environments. The well-preserved and highly diversified late Campanian to Maastrichtian foraminiferal assemblages (biozones V-IX) imply the presence of a well-stratified water column, tropical to subtropical climate, and deposition in outer shelf to upper bathyal environments. A decrease in the number of globotruncanid species during the late Maastrichtian indicates a less stratified water column and unfavourable environmental conditions for K-strategists.
   The common occurrence of phosphate grains in the Soukhne Formation (Santonian-lower Campanian) represents an important indicator of specific geological and palaeoenvironmental conditions, such as oxygen deficiency, up-welling and transgression. These conditions support the interpretation of the domination by opportunistic planktonic foraminiferal taxa (heterohelicids and muricohedbergellids) in Biozone II.

AB  - Assessments of flow reduction in streams often focus on changes to biological communities and in-stream physical characteristics, with little consideration for changes in ecosystem functioning. It is unclear whether functional indicators of ecosystem condition may be useful for assessing the impacts of reduced discharge on small streams. Using weirs and diversions to reduce stream discharge during summer baseflow conditions, we tested the response of leaf breakdown, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) retention, and primary production to one month of water abstraction in before-after, control-impact (BACI) designed experiments. Discharge at impact (downstream) reaches decreased by over 85% in each of three small New Zealand streams compared to controls (upstream). There also were decreases in velocity, depth, and wetted width. Sediment cover increased at impact reaches, but there were only small changes to conductivity, pH, and surface water temperature. We installed mesh bags filled with willow leaves in-stream for one month to measure leaf breakdown. Reduced discharge had little influence on leaf breakdown rate in these streams. Travel distances and retention structures for CPOM were evaluated using releases of paper strips and wooden dowelling over a range of discharges. The distance traveled by released CPOM increased with increasing discharge, and the importance of riffles as retention structures increased at lower discharges. We measured the accumulation of chlorophyll a after one month on artificial substrates as an estimate of the relative primary production of control and impact reaches. The differences in chlorophyll a concentrations between control and impact reaches were inconsistent among streams. These ecosystem functions have responded inconsistently to water removal in these streams. However, the strong response of CPOM retention to reduced discharge could complement measures of biological community structure when the influence of reduced discharge is assessed. We recommend further investigation in a wide range of streams to assess the utility of these processes as functional indicators of reduced discharge.

AB  - Biological marker and carbon isotopic compositions of coals and carbonaceous shales from the Upper Carboniferous strata of the Upper Silesian (USCB), Lower Silesian (LSCB), and Lublin (LCB) coal basins were determined to assess depositional conditions and sources of the organic matter. n-Alkane, sterane, and isoprenoid distribution, and carbon isotope ratios are consistent with an origin from higher plants. In some cases, pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios of carbonaceous shales (roof and floor shales) are < 1.0, while the associated coals have high ratios (much greater than 1.0). This suggests that reducing conditions prevailed during deposition of the shales, but a period of oxidizing conditions accompanied deposition of the coals. Steranes present in coal extracts are dominated by the 14alpha(H)17alpha(H)20R C-29 stereoisomers, typical, but not conclusive, of higher plant origin. Carbonaceous shales exhibit a wider range of sterane composition, suggesting local, significant input of algal organic matter. Significant amounts of benzohopanes and gammacerane are present in some coals. Although benzohopanes are present at least in small amounts in samples from many different environments, they have been reported to occur most commonly in marine environments. The present study seems to provide the first example where benzohopanes have been reported in significant amounts in terrestrial organic matter. Gammacerane is abundant in rocks or sediments deposited in carbonate or highly saline marine environments. The finding of high gammacerane concentrations in the coals expands the depositional settings in which it has been observed and questions its utility as an independent indicator of hypersaline carbonate environments. Stable carbon isotope composition of coals, and type III kerogen in carbonaceous shales as well as correlation of stable carbon isotope composition of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons in carbonaceous shales from both the USCB and the LSCB indicate terrigenous origin. Bitumens are always co-genetic with associated coals and kerogens. Isotopic data reveal that Sofer's genetic classification of oils is not applicable to organic matter in coals.

AB  - A cost-efficient approach to long-term monitoring is to focus on one species or group of organisms as indicators of ecological condition. Through the use of autonomous monitoring technologies, monitoring programs can efficiently expand the biological community surveyed and inferences made. Amphibians have been monitored in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks by the Greater Yellowstone Inventory and Monitoring Network (GRYN) since 2006, yet other taxa dependent on wetlands have not been systematically studied. Our main aim was to explore what additional insights we could gain about wetland biodiversity by combining GRYN's amphibian surveys with multiple autonomous technologies. We deployed wildlife cameras and acoustic recorders (for audible and ultrasonic sounds) at 4 permanent wetlands in Grand Teton National Park, WY during early and late summer 2017 and used descriptive metrics to summarize our findings. During GRYN's surveys, 3 of 4 native amphibians were detected. With autonomous monitoring tools, we also documented avian and mammalian communities and detected changes in the degree of activity over the summer. Combining multiple, complementary technologies with field-based surveys provides a more comprehensive picture of wetland biodiversity and enhances insights about ecological condition and change.

AB  - The Mississippi River experienced historic flooding during 2019, inducing >150 days of floodplain wetland inundation. We evaluated flood effects using repeated measures of hydrogeomorphic (HGM) wetland assessment variables prior to the flood (October 2018), immediately post-flood (August 2019) and one year after initial assessment (October 2019). The flood had little/no impact on 11 of 13 assessment variables, but altered the abundance of woody debris and forest floor litter. Immediately after the flood, these changes decreased the functional capacity of wetlands to 1) detain floodwater (mean - 9.7% reduction) and 2) precipitation (-17.3%); 3) cycle nutrients (-7.5%); and export organic carbon (-23.8%). Subsequent sampling documented the detain precipitation function returning to pre-flood conditions. The export organic carbon function also improved, yet remained below pre-flood levels. Other functions will likely require additional recovery time due to the persistence of accumulated excess woody debris. Across all sample intervals, floodplain wetlands displayed high wetland function capacities and appear resilient to surface water inundation. This analysis highlights the utility of the HGM assessment to detect responses to changing environmental conditions over short time intervals. The study also emphasizes the need to incorporate metrics with appropriate impact-response characteristics when developing and implementing ecological assessments.

AB  - Cerrado vegetation is associated with the semi-humid climate of the Central Brazil highlands. The presence of this vegetation in small and sparse areas in Parana, Southern Brazil, can be associated with its past climate conditions. Paleoenvironmental changes of Cerrado vegetation in the Campo Mourao region (24 degrees 06'S - 52 degrees 23'W) are discussed in this study. The environmental changes were characterized using proxy data that includes stable isotopes and phytolith analyses in peaty sediments. Two drill cores obtained in alluvial plains were analyzed. Results were compared with the isotopic record (delta C-13) from a trench in the Cerrado Ecological Station. Based on the results, we can infer that in similar to 48,800 +/- 270 yrs BP, the vegetation was mainly composed of grasses and at similar to 42,280 cal yrs BP a wetter climate allowed the expansion of arboreal vegetation. During the Middle Holocene (similar to 7280 cal yrs BP), a drier period is also reported. Current climatic conditions (wet) were established since similar to 3280 cal yrs BP, after which the data suggests the expansion of subtropical forests over the Cerrado.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a new legislative framework to manage, use, protect, and restore surface water and groundwater resources and coastal waters in the European Union (EU). The aim is to ensure sustainable water management and to reach good water quality by 2015. The assessment of the ecological status and setting of the practical management goals require several steps. The process has started with the characterisation of the river basins including identification of surface water bodies and types, and identification of significant anthropogenic pressures and impacts. The water bodies will be classified in five quality classes (high, good, moderate, poor, bad) based on the Ecological Quality Ratio, which is a ratio between reference conditions and measured status of the biological quality elements. The normative criteria for high, good and moderate ecological status described in the WFD need to be made operational because those will be used to set the practical quality targets for surface water management. National ecological assessment systems and classifications will be harmonised through the WFD intercalibration exercise in order to ensure an equal level of ambition in achieving good surface waters status all over Europe.

AB  - The macro-alga Cladophora glomerata is found in streams and lakes worldwide. High concentrations of Escherichia coli and enterococci have been reported in Cladophora along the Lake Michigan shore. The objective of this study was to determine if Cladophora supported growth of these indicator bacteria. Algal leachate readily supported in vitro multiplication of E coli and enterococci, suggesting that leachates contain necessary growth-promoting substances. Growth was directly related to the concentration of algal leachate. E coli survived for over 6 months in dried Cludophora stored at 4degreesC; residual E coli grew after mat rehydration, reaching a carrying capacity of 8 log CFU g(-1) in 48 h. Results of this study also show that the E coli strains associated with Cladophora are highly related; in most instances they are genetically different from each other, suggesting that the relationship between E. coli and Cladophora may be casual. These findings indicate that Cladophora provides a suitable environment for indicator bacteria to persist for extended periods and to grow under natural conditions.

AB  - The San Francisco Estuary Regional Monitoring Program for Trace Substances (RI;LP) began in 1993 and is sponsored by 74 local, state, and federal agencies and companies through their discharge or Bay use permits. The RMP monitors water, sediment, toxicity, and bivalve bioaccumulation at 25 sites in the Bay that are considered to represent "background" conditions. Several major environmental issues have been identified by the RMP. Polychlorinated biphenyls and mercury were often above water quality guidelines, and often occurred in fish tissues above U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) screening values. Concentrations do not appear to be decreasing, suggesting continuing inputs. Episodes of aquatic toxicity often occurred following runoff events that transport contaminants into the Bay from urbanized and agricultural portions of the watershed. Sediment toxicity occurred throughout the Bay, and has been correlated with concentrations of specific contaminants (chlordanes, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) at some locations; mixtures of contaminants were probably also important. Since the RMP does not monitor all ecosystem components, assessments of the overall condition of the Bay cannot be made. However, in terms of contamination, the RMP samples suggest that the South Bay, and North Bay sites are moderately contaminated.

AB  - The organic-rich claystone and shale sediments of Lower Cretaceous Abu Gabra Formation are considered an important regional source rock in the Muglad Basin. Sudan. A total of 20 cutting samples from these organic-rich sediments were collected from six wells drilled at oilfields in the Fula sub-basin, Muglad Basin, in order to geochemically assess the type of organic matter, thermal maturity, and palaeoenvironmental conditions, Results reveal that Abu Gabra organic-rich sediments contain high organic matter more than 2.0 wt% TOC and have a very good to excellent oil-generation potential. This is supported by high bitumen extractions and hydrocarbon yields with values exceeding 5, 000 and 3,000 ppm, respectively. The investigated biomarkers indicated that the Abu Gabra sediments contain a mixture of algal and amorphous organic matter that were deposited in a lacustrine environment setting. This has been identified from kerogen microscopy and normal alkane distributions, which are characterized by dominance of types C-27 kerogen and low-medium molecular weight n-alkane compounds, respectively. This is also supported by high abundance of C-27 regular sterane concentrations, high C-27/C-29 regular sterane ratios and relatively low value of the biomarker sterane/hopane ratio as well as the presence of tricyclic terpanes. A mainly suboxic to relatively anoxic preservation conditions is inferred from Pr/Ph ratios (1.01-2.51). This is further supported by lower amounts of acyclic isoprenoids compared to n-alkanes (e.g., ptistane/n-C-17 and phytanei/n-C-18 ratios). Based on the analyzed biomarker thermal maturity indicators, it may be deduced that the Abu Gabra sediments have entered an early mature stage for oil generation. This is also supported by vitrinite reflectance values of 0.58-0.72 % Ro indicative that these sediments have reached oil window maturity.

AB  - This study presents systematic analysis and optimization of an integrated system consisting of internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) as a topping system that feeds the waste heat to a bottoming system consists of a steam cycle (ST) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with HFE7000 as working fluid. The study includes energy, exergy, exergo-economic, and environmental analysis. We investigate the possibility of adding SOFC to the existing GT-ST combined powerplant and evaluates the improvement in exergy efficiency and levelized cost of electricity. Also, we propose a novel setup to eliminate the necessity of the water pump and auxiliary steam generator for SOFC's fuel reforming process. The system uses the Stirling engine to heat supplied liquid natural gas (LNG) fuel to a usable temperature condition; Using the Stirling engine increases the system's overall efficiency by eliminating the need for the fuel compressor and suppression valve. A mathematical model of the system is developed to evaluate system conditions in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) program and a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is used in MATLAB to promote the best operating condition in which minimal levelized cost of electricity is achieved while maximizing exergy efficiency is considered. The results show that energetic and exergetic efficiencies reach the value of 72.66% and 69.23%, respectively. The cost of electricity is calculated as 14.46 [cent kWh-1], of which 1.33 [cent kWh-1] is related to environmental taxes due to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This study can be used as a road map to how existing gas-steam hybrid cycle powerplants can be improved by adding additional equipment without the need to replace currently installed equipment.

AB  - Black shales in the Holy Cross Mountains area of Poland provide a record of environmental change across the Ordovician-Silurian boundary. The changing depositional conditions have generated a variation in organic matter contents above and below the boundary. Investigating the organic constitution of these black shales has the potential to reveal how their organic matter contents were generated and how suitable these rocks and their lateral equivalents may be for exploitation as shale gas reservoirs. One outcrop at the Holy Cross Mountains with a continuous section across the Ordovician-Silurian boundary occurs near the village of Bardo Stawy in the Kielce region, and contains sandy-silty mudstones, as well as grey and black shales. Organic geochemical analyses of samples at Bardo Stawy reveals low Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents for Ordovician samples and higher TOC values for Silurian samples. Organic biomarkers indicate that the Ordovician rocks were deposited in a shallow-marine shelf setting, while the Silurian rocks were deposited in a deeper marine environment. The progressive increase in TOC from the uppermost Ordovician to the lowermost Silurian rocks reflects increasingly oxygen-poor depositional conditions during the post-glacial transgression. Following the deposition and preservation of organic matter in the Ordovician and Silurian rocks, these rocks were buried and subjected to thermal maturation. Rock Eval and biomarker thermal maturity parameters all indicate that the organic matter is mature and lies within the oil window. The Ordovician and Silurian shales have direct relevance to recent attempts to discover and exploit shale gas reservoirs in Poland. Our data and interpretations suggest that the relatively low TOC values (<2%) and low maturities for gas generation render these rocks unsuitable for commercial shale gas production. The progressive improvement in conditions for preserving organic matter across the Ordovician Silurian boundary does, however, leave the possibility that more suitable deposits occur in Early Silurian rocks in the other parts of the basin.

AB  - The article presents data on the study of the diversity of crustacean communities in the Moscow-river basin. Two most common are two species of amphipods, invasive species Gmelinodes fasciatus and the native species Gammarus lacustris, were detected and studies during the study. However, the number of one of the most important bioindicator species of crustaceans, Asellus aquaticus found in our samples is insufficient for quantitative conclusions. At the same time, population of G. fasciatus can be characterized as stable at all studied stations and the species can be used as bioindicator of the natural condition of the river flowing within the Moscow City. The species seems to be significantly less sensitive to environment conditions and especially anthropogenic pollution than the native amphipod species G. lacustris and can successfully replace A. aquaticus as bioindicator species in the area where the latter species is absent. Thus, a new bioindicator pair Gammarus lacustris / Gmelinoides fasciatus is suggested for using in estimation water pollution In European part of the Russian Federation and adjacent areas.

AB  - 91 taxa of benthic diatoms were recorded at several sites in the lake district Xochimilco-Tlahuac representing an increase of over 50 % in the floristic inventory of diatoms in this area. The study was based on analysis of 13 collections with fortnightly and monthly sampling during the dry and rainy seasons, simultaneously recording several environmental factors that supported a comparative analysis for changes in species richness between study sites and collections. An ecological categorization of species allowing to associate their presence with the environmental conditions of the lake area, arguing that the dominant species distinguished floristically a region, while frequent distinguish the local flora and rare species indicate habitat fragmentation. The composition and species richness showed a clear relationship with environmental factors and highlighted the presence of Nitzschia frustulum, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Fragilaria bidens, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata, Fragilariforma virescens, Staurosira construens, S. construens var. binodis, Staurosirella leptostauron y S. pinnata, which are species typically found in the sediments of shallow and eutrophic bodies of water. Species richness was statistically correlated with the variation of silica and pH, which showed that benthic diatoms can be used as ecological indicators for monitoring environmental conditions in the lake district of Xochimilco-Tlahuac.

AB  - Ideal nutritional conditions are crucial to sustainable aquaculture due to economic and environmental issues. Here we apply stable isotope analysis as an indicator of fish growth and feeding balance, to define the optimum diet for efficient growing conditions. Juveniles of gilthead sea bream were fed with six isoenergetic diets differing in protein to lipid proportion (from 41/26 to 57/20). As protein intake increased, delta N-15 and Delta delta N-15 of muscle and Delta delta N-15 and Delta delta C-13 of its protein fraction decreased, indicating lower protein turnover and higher protein deposition in muscle. This is reflected in the inverse relationship found between Delta delta N-15 and growth rate, although no differences were observed in either parameter beyond the protein/lipid proportion 47/23. Principal component analysis (PCA) also signaled 47/23 diet as the pivotal point with the highest growing efficiency, with isotopic parameters having the highest discrimination load. Thus, muscle isotope composition, especially N-15, can be used to evaluate nutritional status in farmed fish.

AB  - The Callovian (Middle Jurassic) fossiliferous carbonate concretions from the clay-pit at Lukow, eastern Poland, have been analysed using organic geochemistry, petrography and pyrite framboid size distribution in order to retrieve information about early diagenetic conditions during clay sedimentation. Additionally, a fossil wood sample was also analysed. The carbonate concretions are formed almost entirely by fine-grained, pure calcite. Other main minerals occurring in the concretions are quartz, feldspars and bright mica with features of muscovite. The clay fraction obtained from the concretions are mainly composed of quartz, but also contains pyrite, muscovite, mid-order kaolinite and chlorite with an admixture of a mix-layered structure. Small admixtures of siderite, ankerite, rutile and feldspars were also detected. The most plausible source of the terrigenous phases occurring in the concretions investigated is the Fennoscandian Shield, where sodic magmatic and metamorphic rocks are common. In the fossil wood, the main mineral phase is calcite, which fills the wood-cells. Fluoroapatite also occurs, but is generally confined to the margins of the cells. The other phase detected is pyrite, which may also fill the cell interiors and replace the cell walls. The Callovian organic matter (OM) from Lukow is immature. The vitrinite reflectance (R-r) of the analysed concretion samples ranges from 0.45 to 0.54%, and is higher than from the fossil wood (R-r = 0.33%). Moreover, the concretion samples contain hopanoids with biological configurations, such as beta beta-hopanes and hop-17(21)-enes and characterized by low values of beta beta/(alpha beta + beta alpha)-hopane and 31S/(S+R) homohopane biomarker parameters. The occurrence of acyclic ketones with odd over even carbon number predominance in the concretions studied, suggests intensive microbial degradation of OM. The pyrite framboid size distribution does not indicate euxinic or anoxic conditions in the water column and the sea-floor. Although small-sized framboids (< 5 mu m), which may form during euxinic conditions in the water column, occur in all samples investigated, the mean sizes of framboids in all samples are well above 6 mu m and large framboids (up to 29 mu m) are also present. Their size distribution points to the lower dysoxic conditions at most, because during such conditions the mean values of framboid sizes begins to increase and larger framboids (> 10 mu m) are present. The oxic to suboxic depositional conditions during OM sedimentation are also confirmed by low concentrations or absence of C-33-C-35 homohopanes, moderate Pr/Ph values and no organic compounds characteristic of anoxia and water column stratification.

AB  - Barium (Ba) is a trace element which occurs predominantly as barite mineral (BaSO4) in the marine environment. Previous work suggests that barite concentrations are related to the organic carbon flux and marine biological debris in the water column suggesting a direct or indirect involvement in the marine biological cycling. In addition, barite has a high preservation rate (similar to 30%) in sediments and it is less affected by early diagenesis than other proxies for productivity such as carbonates (similar to 10%) and organic carbon (similar to 1%), for example. Therefore, Ba is considered an excellent proxy for ocean (paleo) productivity. However, correlating barite to productivity involves some caveats. Specifically, the post-depositional formation of barite in oxic sediments can lead to Ba release into porewaters under anoxic conditions, which can form barite again under oxic conditions. This diagenetic formation is not correlated to export production as the seawater authigenic barite formed with decaying organic matter in the water column. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to briefly review the marine Ba cycle and highlight its importance for (paleo) productivity research.

AB  - The Narippara area, which is nestled in the Banasuramala of Wayanad district, witnessed initiation of landslide, which was manifested in the form of curvilinear cracks running for a length of 170 m. In the event of continuous rainfall, these cracks may get reactivated, leading to a major landslide. This could affect the life and livelihood of a large number of families living downslope and could cause extensive damage to property. Extensive mining for building stones in this area has been a cause for much concern amongst the local population. This study aims at understanding the impact of quarrying on slope stability through geotechnical, geophysical and environmental impact assessment (EIA). Geotechnical analysis shows that the area is stable under dry condition but parts of the area are critical under wet and saturated conditions. Moreover, resistivity studies revealed that the cracks that had developed extend up to the bedrock and the suspected mechanism of failure will be translational in nature. EIA reveal that due to quarrying and mining operations, the possibility of land disturbances cannot be ruled out during the monsoon season. In the present study, an attempt is also made to suggest management strategies for mitigating further effects of landslides in this area.

AB  - I aimed to determine when and under which seasonal environmental conditions gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), a small nocturnal primate species endemic to Madagascar, utilize daily, torpor Using temperature-sensitive radio collars, I measured skin temperature (T-sk) of free-ranging mouse lemurs under natural conditions. My, results showed that male and female mouse lemurs in the wild enter torpor spontaneously over a wide range of ambient temperatures (T-a) during the dry season, but not during the rainy, season. Mouse lemurs that remained normothermic had significantly, lower body, masses (mean: 59.7 g) than individuals that used torpor (mean: 80.2 g). Skin temperatures dropped to 20.9 degreesC and the mean torpor bout duration is 10.3 h. The use of torpor on a given night varied among individuals, whereas the propensity for torpor did not differ significantly between males and females. I found no evidence that T-a can be used to predict whether mouse lemurs will remain normothermic or enter torpor It appears that the most reliable indicator for the occurrence of torpor in free-ranging Microcebus murinus is time of the year, i.e., photoperiod.

AB  - Socio-economic development of any territory is inherently connected with population reproduction, which is predetermined by demographic behavior. Recently, the models for the dynamics of Russia's demographic indicators have been changing, which is characterized by a decrease in the birth and death rates, as well as a relative stabilization of the migration situation. The transformation of demographic dynamics models is a natural result of society's adaptation to the new socio-economic reality. The changes in the behavior of the population are particularly noticeable under the conditions of abrupt transformations of the external environment, observed in the transitional periods of socioeconomic systems functioning. In this regard, the purpose of the study was to determine the main models of the dynamics of demographic indicators of the Russian Federation at the present stage of development, which is characterized by a rapid change in the conditions of life activity. Based on the use of the concept of adaptation in the "human-environment" coordinates, we showed the two-dimensional adaptation of the population to changes in the external environment and constructed a decision-tree for the acts of demographic behavior. In empirical part of the study, using methods of logical and statistical analysis, we studied the dynamics of indicators of reproductive, self-preservation and migration behavior of the population in the period from 2000 to 2019, using, respectively, a set of indicators of birth rate, mortality, life expectancy and migration growth. Based on highlighting the specific characteristics of Russia's socio-economic development in 2000-2006, 2007-2015, and 2016-2019, we identified three stages of demographic indicators dynamics, in accordance with which we proposed three models of demographic indicators dynamics, in order to expand our understanding of this phenomenon. The results obtained allowed us to form a methodological basis for future interdisciplinary research in the field of demographic behavior. They can also be used as a methodological basis for the development of demographic policy measures.

AB  - The vulnerability of a sociocultural locus in three groups of factors - natural, anthropogenic and technogenic - predetermines habitat degradation under their unregulated influence. The habitat considerably loses its historical and cultural uniqueness, but risk escalation connected with the destruction of the visual shape of cultural and historical landscapes can negatively influence the identity of people living in these territories. Owing to the compatibility with the riskogenic environment the consciousness, emotional condition and behaviour of people change. Risks become social, they are accumulated when people design their own social reality and are concretised in ideas of it, influencing not only the perception of external environment, but people's life. The analysis of the connection was carried out on the basis of the data of expert and mass polls in regions with the maximum and minimum levels of environmental and technology-related risks that have an impact on the sociocultural subenvironment locus. The threats experts noted - the destruction of historical and cultural objects, historically developed cultural infrastructure and the basic foundations of national identity - are reflected on by the population in a different way. Due to the assessment of the level of life stability, satisfaction with life conditions, assessment of the social atmosphere in the region, the perception of the environment as riskogenic is not the same in different age groups. There is a raised reflection on threats connected with cultural monuments demolition, losses of historical memory, cultural traditions, ethical standards destruction, feelings of uncertainty and risk. A decrease in satisfaction with life conditions happens, to a great extent, under the influence of historical monuments demolition. Deterioration of the cultural atmosphere in the region and, in this regard, growth of social tension in the regions correlate with the demolition of cultural monuments, loss of historical memory, destruction of moral values. Herewith, the analysed threats ambiguously impact the social feeling of the youth with their greatest optimism towards social reality as well as the modern approach to the preservation of historical and cultural heritage which combines protection of material objects of culture with the updating of cultural traditions and moral standards.

AB  - This study reports the seasonal variability in aspects of the physiology of the shore crab Carcinus maenas from three estuaries in South-west England, each with varying anthropogenic inputs: Avon Estuary ('relatively low' impact), Yealm Estuary ('intermediate' impact) and Plym Estuary ('relatively high' impact). Crabs collected over 12 months from the Avon had a significantly 'lower' physiological condition in winter and spring compared to summer and autumn: in particular, haemocyte phagocytic capability (a general indicator of immune function) was significantly higher in winter and spring compared to summer and autumn, and total haemolymph antioxidant status (an indicator of oxidative stress) was significantly lower in winter compared to the remainder of the year. Potentially, shore crabs may be more susceptible to the effects of contaminant exposure, such as increased immunotoxicity (thus, reduction of immune function) and/or oxyradicals (or reactive oxygen species) exposure) especially in seasons of increased susceptibility i.e. summer/autumn (lower phagocytic capability) and winter (lowest antioxidant function). As the Avon was taken to represent the 'reference' site, this pattern is considered to reflect the 'normal' seasonal variability in shore crab physiology. Shore crab physiological condition from the 'relatively high' impact estuary (Plym) revealed increased cellular viability and antioxidant status in autumn and winter compared with that of the 'standard' pattern (Avon) However, crabs from the intermediate impact estuary (Yealm) only demonstrated significant physiological differences in summer as shown by a lower cellular viability. All crabs had been exposed to PAHs (confirmed by the presence of PAH metabolites in their urine) which may account for the observed differences in shore crab physiology. In conclusion, to aid understanding of the potential contaminant impacts on biota it is imperative that the 'normal' seasonal variability of physiological condition be established. Biological effects-based monitoring studies should therefore be employed seasonally to potentially highlight 'windows of sensitivity' to contaminant impact. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Small rivers (<= 100 km length) are likely to drain fewer rock types. Therefore, their solutes and sediments are good indicators of weathering environments typical of their basins and help constraining the nature of their source rocks. To understand this, the texture, mineralogy, major and trace element compositions of the sediments deposited by the River Hemavati, a northern upland tributary of the Cauvery River in southern India, are analyzed and discussed.
   The Hemavati sediments are overall of fine sand size (mean 2-3 phi), and have high concentrations of FeO (<= 7wt.%), TiO2 (<= 1.2 wt.%), Cr (<= 350 ppm) and Ni (<= 125 ppm). Major and trace element distribution call for a binary source for the sediments, and particularly point to contrasting climatic conditions of their provenances. The source areas in the upstream and downstream parts are exposed to sub-humid high relief and sub-arid low relief conditions, respectively, with distinct weathering characteristics. The CIA values (85-48) decrease from near the source to downstream, suggesting that the downstream rain-shadow part of the catchment suffered only minor chemical weathering.
   On the other hand, the REE distribution in the Hemavati sediments indicates contrasting lithologies in their provenance, and is not controlled by chemical weathering. On the basis of REE patterns, the sediments are divided into two compositional groups. The Type 1 sediments have a REE chemistry similar to the upper continental crust, and have been derived from the > 3.2 Ga composite peninsular gneisses occurring in the low-lying, semi-arid Mysore Plateau. The Type 2 sediments, however, have dominantly intermediate to mafic granulite contributions from the tectonically uplifted Western Ghats, weathered under sub-humid conditions. High concentrations of FeO, TiO2, Cr and Ni in the sediments suggest matic-dominated source lithologies in the upper catchment, a feature also confirmed by field observations and petrographic study.

AB  - Environmental policies fall short in protecting freshwater ecosystems, which are heavily threatened by human pressures and their associated stressors. One reason is that stressor effects depend on the context in which they occur and it is difficult to extrapolate patterns to predict the effect of stressors without these being contextualized in a general frame. This study aims at improving existing decision-making frameworks such as the DPSIR approach (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) or ERA (Environmental Risk Assessment) in the context of stressors. Here, we delve into stressor-impact relationships in freshwater ecosystems and develop a guideline which includes key characteristics such as stressor type, stressor duration, location, the natural levels of environmental variables to which each ecosystem is used to, among others. This guideline is intended to be useful in a wide range of ecosystem conditions and stressors. Incorporating these guidelines may favor the comparability of scientific results and may lead to a substantial advancement in the efficacy of diagnosis and predictive approaches of impacts.

AB  - Like aquatic diatoms, terrestrial diatoms are sensitive to multiple environmental factors such as pH, anthropic disturbances, soil moisture and nitrogen. While most aquatic diatom species have well-known autecological values for several important variables, qualifying them as biological indicators, this potential has not yet been untapped for terrestrial diatoms. Here, we aim to establish autecological values for pH and soil moisture content using weighted averaging for common, widespread terrestrial diatoms and compare them with previous calculated indicator values and tolerance ranges. In order to provide robust autecological values, we combined the data of ecological studies carried out across a range of climate conditions. We found that our validation metrics improved considerably after removing samples collected in anthropic disturbed habitats, suggesting that anthropic disturbance is the principal factor defining taxon occurrences. Besides our results showing similarities with previous studies, they also showed a significant improvement on the existing indicator values. Moreover, we expanded the list of terrestrial diatoms to 249 taxa that may serve as environmental markers in different research fields.

AB  - Sinai Peninsula in Egypt is of special ecological interest because of its variable environment, landscape, distinctive flora. In the present study, 75 species were recorded, belonging to 65 genera and 29 families, and 90.7 % of these species are perennials. The most frequent life form was the chamaephytes (49.4 %) and the Saharo-Sindian taxa were the best represented ones (73.3 %). The classification of the 31 stands gave four communities: Nitraria retusa, Atriplex halimus, Cornulaca monacantha, and Retama raetam. According to the two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, the ordination of stands showed that the groups A and B are markedly distinguishable, while the groups C and D are superimposed. Chlorides, sulfates, Na, Ca, Mg, K, calcium carbonate, and electrical conductivity are the community distribution controlling parameters. Results of this study demonstrated that the distribution of the plant communities and their composition over a small geographic area in desert ecosystems is related to heterogeneous topography and landform pattern. The heterogeneity of local topography, edaphic factors, and microclimatic conditions leads to variation of the distributional behavior of the plant associations of the study area.

AB  - Phytomanagement in terms of phytostabilisation is considered a suitable method to decrease environmental risks of metal(loid) enriched mine tailings. The goal of this study was to identify plant-favourable edaphic niches in mine tailings from a semiarid area, in order to obtain relevant information for further phytostabilisation procedures. For this purpose, a transect-designed sampling from non-disturbed soils to two mine tailings was performed, including the description of soil and plant ecology gradients. Plant ecological indicators showed several stages in plant succession: from weeds to stable patches of late successional plant species. PCA results revealed that plant distribution at the tailings was driven mainly by salinity while metal(loid) concentrations played a minor role. The presence of soil desiccation cracks generated low salinity patches which facilitated favourable niches for plant establishment. Edaphic-patch distribution may condition phytostabilisation since ploughing or the employment of certain amendments should take into account favourable niches for plant growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One strand of British comparative plant ecology has used experimental measurements of innate traits under standardized conditions to confirm plant 'strategies' or 'functional types'. The Sheffield (Grime) school has now established CSR-signatures for 1010 species. In contrast, a Central-European approach (Gottingen or Ellenberg school) has emphasized the unity of plants with their natural habitats by allocating I ecological indicator values' (EIV's; German: Zeigerwerte) for over 2700 species, which describe the ecological behavior of each species in their plant associations. In this paper we assess the levels of compatibility and congruence between these two approaches using large datasets that include some previously unexamined traits. Despite there being a wide gap between these plant- and environment-based starting, points, we discover that both approaches lead to similar conclusions regarding patterns Of evolutionary tradeoffs and ecological processes. In particular, the comparisons support the major evolutionary generalization that plant life has, in effect, aligned itself along a Continuum between one trait-group that confers rapid acquisition Of resources and another that confers long-term resource conservation.

AB  - It is demonstrated that palynomorphs can occur in fired ancient potsherds when the firing temperature was under 350 degrees C. Pollen and phytoliths recovered from incompletely fired and fully fired potsherds (ca. 2700 yrs BP) from the Yanghai Tombs, Turpan, Xinjiang, NW China can be used as potential indicators for reconstructing past vegetation and corresponding climate in the area. The results show a higher rate of recovery of pollen and phytoliths from incompletely fired potsherds than from fully fired ones. Charred phytoliths recovered from both fully fired and incompletely fired potsherds prove that degree and condition of firing result in a permanent change in phytolith color. The palynological data, together with previous data of macrobotanical remains from the Yanghai Tombs, suggest that temperate vegetation and arid climatic conditions dominated in the area ca. 2700 yrs BP.
