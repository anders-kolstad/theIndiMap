AB  - The ecological state of 18 small rivers in Minsk Region was for the first time estimated by jointly used macrophyte-based characteristics, including saprobity index, biological macrophyte index for rivers, and a scale of cenotic/supercenotic organization of aquatic and coastal-aquatic plants. Rivers with relatively safe ecological status were shown to dominate, while other rivers are in a safe and satisfactory state. The proposed approach to determining the ecological quality of watercourses is based on the calculation of a complex characteristic, i.e., an integral macrophyte index of small river ecological status; this index has been developed in the context of a classification scheme of surface water quality in the National Environmental Monitoring System of the Republic of Belarus.

AB  - The aim of the Norwegian Nature Index (NI) is to provide an overview of the state of biodiversity within and across major ecosystems. The index is composed of a series of indicators, each representing individual species or diversity measures. The indicators are standardized and scaled in relation to a reference state, and combined for ecosystems or geographical regions, to give a number between 1 (reference state) and 0 (seriously degraded biodiversity). In 2010, the state of biodiversity was highest in mountains, ocean, coastal waters, and freshwater (NI=0.690.80), intermediate for mires and wetlands (NI=0.55), and lowest for open lowlands and forests (NI=0.430.44). The NI increased 810% in freshwater and the ocean (bottom and pelagic) from 19902010, but decreased by>10% in open lowlands during the same period. Since its launch in September 2010, the Nature Index has been approved by the Ministry of Finance as an indicator for biodiversity in the set of sustainable development indicators and approved by the Ministry of Environment as an indicator of the state of major ecosystems.

AB  - The body condition index (i.e., body mass corrected for age or size differences) is commonly used to investigate offspring condition in nestling birds. The body condition index reflects different parameters related to the general nutritional state of nestlings and may predict survival prospects. Since conditions experienced during the growth period can affect the fitness of nestlings in adulthood, we investigated proximate and ultimate factors underlying body condition index variation in kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) nestlings in a 9-year field study and we carried out two cross-fostering experiments to disentangle the origin (genetics plus maternal effects) and rearing (environment effect) components of body condition index variation. In total, we sampled 2,065 nestlings from 464 broods and used 121 nestlings from 24 broods in the cross-fostering experiments. We found that nestlings from larger broods had higher body condition index than nestlings from smaller ones, but this pattern did not emerge in two of the 9 years of study; nestlings born later in the breeding season had lower body condition index in some years but not in others; the decrease of body condition index over the breeding season emerged in all but three-chick broods; males and females did not differ neither in body condition index nor in the covariation between body mass and wing length, while this result was limited to one of the nine field study years; the annual mean value of body condition index did not covary with the total rainfall; both the origin and rearing components explained body condition index variation, but their relative contributions varied from a year to another. Overall, these results suggest that the brood size is not a good predictor of body condition index; the rule "nesting early in the season is better" is less general than previously thought; the body condition index may contain origin variance, whose expression may be modulated by environmental conditions.

AB  - The main goal of the present study was to develop an ecological integrity index for littoral wetland management and conservation in semiarid Mediterranean areas that have been highly impacted by agriculture, including the selection of pressure and state indicators at landscape and wetlands scales that reflect the status, condition, and trends of wetlands ecosystems. We used a causality framework based on the relationship between pressure of anthropogenic activities and the ecological state of wetlands and their catchments, integrating environmental, biologic, economic, and social issues. From the application of 51 indicators in 7 littoral wetlands in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, we selected 12 indicators (5 at catchment scale and 7 at wetland scale) to constitute the ecological integrity index proposed. The potential nitrogen export per area at catchment scale and the potential relative nitrogen export from the area surrounding the wetlands were the best pressure single predictors of state indicators with a causal relationship with environmental meaning. Wetlands in catchments with more agriculture had less ecological integrity than those in less impacted areas. A wide riparian zone in some wetlands acts as a buffer area, diminishing the effects of intensive agriculture. The index of ecological integrity developed here has a number of essential characteristics that make it a useful tool for ecosystem managers and decision-makers. The index can be used to (1) assess and control ecological integrity, (2) diagnose probable causes of ecological impairment, (3) establish criteria for protecting and restoring wetland ecosystems, and (4) integrate catchment management.

AB  - The problems of stability of technogenic landscapes (dumps of overburden rocks) of different ages of formation in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly (KMA) are discussed. Abiotic factors (physicochemical characters of the rocks and time of dumping) were found to be the most important indices of biopedocenosis formation on dump surfaces. A shortened profile of gray forest soil is formed on loam dumps over 25 years, and floodplain soil is formed of Callovian clays. An integrated index of the ecological state of biopedocenoss is suggested on the basis of studied characters.

AB  - Drought is a complex hazard, and it has an impact on agricultural, ecological, and socio-economic systems. The vegetation condition index (VCI), which is derived from remote-sensing data, has been widely used for drought monitoring. However, VCI based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) does not perform well in certain circumstances. In this study, we examined the utility of the vegetation index based on the universal pattern decomposition method (VIUPD) based VCI for drought monitoring in various climate divisions across the continental United States (CONUS). We compared the VIUPD-derived VCI with the NDVI-derived VCI in various climate divisions and during different sub-periods of the growing season. It was also compared with other remote-sensing-based drought indices, such as the temperature condition index (TCI), precipitation condition index (PCI) and the soil moisture condition index (SMCI). The VIUPD-derived VCI had stronger correlations with long-term in situ drought indices, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI-3, SPI-6, SPI-9, and SPI-12) than did the NDVI-derived VCI, and other indices, such as TCI, PCI and SMCI. The VIUPD has considerable potential for drought monitoring. As VIUPD can make use of the information from all the observation bands, the VIUPD-derived VCI can be regarded as an enhanced VCI.

AB  - In budwood certification programs, routinely used, technology-based laboratory methods for detecting known citrus pathogens need to be complemented with biological indexing to confirm the absence of known and unknown graft transmissible pathogens (GTPs). We report here a procedure for biological indexing using very young indicator plants, 75-90 days old. Assay results of traditional biological indexing and mini-plant indexing conducted for 51 quarantine accessions and 29 positives infected with known pathogens were compared. The evaluation indicated similar sensitivity of detection between the two methods. Traditional bioindexing requires premium greenhouse resources and a lengthy incubation period; the use of mini-plants for indexing can provide a viable alternative since the technique can be conducted with a fraction of the resources typically needed. In southern California, we were able to index for GTPs requiring cooler temperatures during summer by placing mini-bioindicator plants near the cooling pads in an evaporatively-cooled greenhouse. Indicator plants kept under favorable conditions expressed symptoms throughout the year. Limited greenhouse space is required due to the small size of the indicator plants, and they can be used for biological indexing within 3 months as compared to 9-12 months with traditional indicator plants. Young plants require much less space with 240 plants/m2 of bench space as compared to 30 plants/m2 using the conventional approach for biological indexing. The use of mini-plant biological indexing will enable citrus 'clean stock' and certification programs to function more efficiently with limited resources and facilities.

AB  - While environmental composite indexes are useful tools in ranking the relative performance of countries on characteristics of interest, critiques are being made about their lack of relevance and responsiveness pertaining to changes in the environment; this negatively affects their usefulness and relevance. In this paper, an alternative to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is proposed by constructing a proof-of-concept index based on component variables whose changes reflect the actual state of the environment and the environmental sustainability on the particular dimensions measured. The proposed Environmental State and Sustainability Index (ESSI) also takes into account the relationships between variables in constructing the composite index by checking the relevance of the theoretical environmental dimensions against factor components, which explains the complex relationships between environmental variables and aims at achieving a relevant weighting of the component variables. Results indicate that ESSI scores are comparable with EPI and reflect better the actual situation of some countries with high-rank differences. Thus, ESSI can be used as a basis for constructing or revising environmental indicators that are closer to the objective of achieving a truly overarching measure of the state of the environment that is relevant in informing policy and reflect actual changes in the component dimensions as relevant data becomes available.

T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE ZOOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE
LA  - English
AB  - This study is the first on condition index monitoring for Fulvia fragilis, a non indigenous and invasive species in Tunisia. It is a simultaneous hermaphroditic cockle with a diffuse gonad. Condition indices (total and those relating to the visceral mass (gonad and-digestive gland). and the rest, of the flesh) were monitored monthly in two northern Tunisian sites (Bay of Tunis and lagoon of Bizerte). In favourable conditions, as found in the Bay of Tunis, the condition index reflects the progress of gametogcnesis with synchronous increases in maturation and spawning periods. In the Bay of Tunis population, the strong correlation between the total condition index (CI) and partial spawning stage reflects low gamete emission. This index can be used as an ceo-physiological index, since it reflects well the deterioration of the cockle metabolism in polluted environments, such as Bizerte lagoon. In addition, seasonal and synchronous development of the visceral mass condition index (CIvm) and the remaining tissues condition index (CIR) indicates simultaneous gonadic and somatic development in favourable conditions (nutrient availability and temperatures) in this non indigenous cockle.

AB  - In this study an effort has been made to analyze and compare the position of different countries by using the different environmental indicators responsible for the diversity in environment for which the Environmental Performance Index (ER) has been constructed. The study attempts to establish the relationship between economic development and environmental quality as a whole instead of using individual indicators. A composite environmental index which summarizes the environment condition of a region or country or state is more meaningful than individual indicators. Efforts have also been made to find the relationship between environmental performance and economic development. For constructing the EPI, 'Factor Analysis' has been employed to determine the relative weight of the selected indicators. In order to develop the Environmental Performance Index, twelve environmental indicators of 96 countries (maximum number of countries for which the data were available) have been used for the year 1990 and 2005. For year 2014. seventeen environmental indicators of 94 countries have been used.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing the ecological status of the Kinyankonge River using a zooplankton-based Biotic Integrity Index (BII-zooplankton). This was achieved through monthly collections of zooplankton from four stations along the river over 18 months (from July 2015 to June 2016, then from January 2017 to June 2017). Chemical parameters of the water were also measured using the AFNOR and APHA methods. Organic loads of water samples were assessed using Leclercq's Organic Pollution Index. Zooplankton levels of disturbance were evaluated by Karr's Biological Integrity Index. From this study, it was calculated that the Organic Pollution Index had two levels of pollution: strong organic pollution and very high organic pollution for upstream and downstream stations, respectively. Zooplankton populations were more disturbed during dry season than rainy season. The calculated Biotic Integrity Index highlighted a degradation of the ecological quality, especially in the upstream stations along the Kinyankonge River. Based on the zooplankton species diversity as an indicator of the ecological status of the river, the Biotic Integrity Index revealed a spatio-temporal variation highlighting four states of ecological quality of the Kinyankonge River: bad, moderate, good and very good, whereMicrocyclopssp. indicates bad ecological status,Brachionus angularisandTropocyclopssp. indicate moderate ecological status, whereasRotariasp. indicates very good ecological status. No species was identified as indicator of good ecological status. Therefore, the BII-zooplankton can be used as an indicator of the ecological health of the Kinyankonge River, and extended to other aquatic ecosystems in Burundi.

AB  - In ecological and morphological studies, researchers often use body condition index as a measure of an individual's fitness. Our research shows that body condition index may be an unreliable method for this purpose, because changes in lizards' body proportions are not stable during their lifetime. Results obtained from a Polish population of the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) show that the body length increases faster than the body mass, meaning that the correlation between these 2 parameters is not linear. Herpetologists frequently use the body condition index to compare the fitness of lizards of different ages. Our study demonstrates that this method may not be accurate; in the future, research should strive to develop new ways of measuring lizards' fitness.

AB  - Various drought indices are developed to monitor drought conditions. Each drought index applies to specific environments given its own characteristics. This article aims to compare the drought conditions of continental China detected by remote sensing. We compare diverse types of remote sensing-based indices for studying drought situation in 2017. The Station-based precipitation data with different scales are used to evaluate drought phenomena. The drought indices compared in this article include the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission data, vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectra-radiometer (MODIS) data, and other integrated drought indices, which combine VCI, TCI, and PCI. Vegetation health index (VHI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), and synthesized drought index (SDI) constitute the integrated drought indices. The results indicate that numerous indices have different applicability across continental China. VHI has the optimal correlation with short-term and long-term precipitation. The SDI, SDCI, VCI, TCI, and temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are also reliable for monitoring drought conditions and are more suitable for long-term than short-term precipitation. Furthermore, combined indices (VHI, SDI, and SDCI) perform better than single drought indices (PCI, TCI, and VCI). VHI, SDI, and SDCI did not show good consistency in croplands when monitoring agricultural drought.

AB  - Ecological integrity is important to fully describe the development of an economy. We calculated an aggregate index that quantifies the closeness of a forested region to a natural state. This naturalness index was based on the diversity of native tree species and sizes for ecological subregions in a seral condition. The index used the spatial-temporal array of sample plots from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database of the USDA Forest Service. In the 70 survey units of the southern US between 1961 and 2005 the naturalness of forests generally improved with per capita personal income and population. The increase with income was consistent with the hypothesis of an environmental Kuznets curve for forested landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Starting in 1997, mortality outbreaks in cultured oysters Crassostrea gigas have been reported in northwestern Mexico. Previous studies have shown that massive die-offs result from multi-factor processes related to reproduction of the species. We studied the reproductive cycle and the condition index of cultured oysters in the coastal lagoon of El Soldado, Sonora, as well as the relationship of the life cycle with environmental parameters. We used oocyte diameter to determine reproductive stages and the condition index to describe the physiological state of oysters. Additionally, the temperature, salinity, seston and chlorophyll a were recorded at the study site. The results showed that C. gigas began accelerated reproductive activity in March under the influence of high temperature and increased concentrations of food. No spawning events were recorded and gametes were reabsorbed within the gonad in September and October. The results showed a period of nutrient storage during autumn-winter and another period of gamete production in spring-summer. A mortality event occurred at the end of winter, tied to significant increases in temperature and availability of food and in accelerated reproductive activity and high condition index. These conditions were very similar to those reported in other countries during summer die-offs of C. gigas.

AB  - Gamogenetic cycle, the condition index and meat yield of the Arca noae Linnaeus, 1758 (Noah's ark shell) were followed in Gerence Bay (Aegean Sea, Turkey), between August 2009 and July 2010. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, particulate organic and inorganic matter were monitored during the sampling period. According to histological observation, inactive stage was determined as 100% in September. The spawning period was observed through the year except September, with a peak from April to June. Sex ratios were not equal and females were dominant during the study period (2: 1). Meat yield, condition index and gonad index reveal a positive relationship between each other (P=0.05). Among environmental parameters, inverse relationship was only found between particulate inorganic matter and reproduction (P=0.05).

AB  - Valid modeling of habitats and populations of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus ) is a critical management need because of increasing concern about population viability. Consequently, we evaluated the performance of two models designed to assess landscape conditions for Greater Sage-Grouse across 13.6 million ha of sagebrush steppe in the interior Columbia Basin and adjacent portions of the Great Basin of the western United States (referred to as the basin). The first model, the environmental index model, predicted conditions at the scale of the subwatershed (mean size of approximately 7800 ha) based on inputs of habitat density, habitat quality, and effects of human disturbance. Predictions ranged on a continuous scale from 0 for lowest environmental index to 2 for optimal environmental index. The second model, the population outcome model, predicted the composite, range-wide conditions for sage grouse based on the contribution of environmental index values from all subwatersheds and measures of range extent and connectivity. Population outcomes were expressed as five classes (A through E) that represented a gradient from continuous, well-distributed populations (outcome A) to sparse, highly isolated populations with a high likelihood of extirpation (outcome E). To evaluate performance, we predicted environmental index values and population outcome classes in areas currently occupied by sage grouse versus areas where extirpation has occurred. Our a priori expectations were that models should predict substantially worse environmental conditions (lower environmental index) and a substantially higher probability of extirpation (lower population outcome class) in extirpated areas. Results for both models met these expectations. For example, a population outcome of class E was predicted for extirpated areas, as opposed to class C for occupied areas. These results suggest that our models provided reliable landscape predictions for the conditions tested. This finding is important for conservation planning in the basin, where the models were used to evaluate management of federal lands for sage grouse.

AB  - Gross biochemical composition, energy value and condition index were investigated in two populations of Tapes philippinarum differently exploited by fishing in the Lagoon of Venice during the period July 2000-July 2001. Proteins, lipids, total carbohydrates and glycogen showed similar patterns in clams from all areas, highlighting the importance of the reproductive cycle and physiological features of the species in determining biochemical composition. The influence of environmental conditions and the effects of different fishing impact could also be observed. Carbohydrates exhibit minima in winter and maxima in spring-summer, while proteins have an irregular trend. Lipid seasonal variations are inversely related to glycogen contents; furthermore, lipids are higher in females than in males. Condition index and total energy content were influenced by both endogenous stress and environmental factors. In particular, the condition index, which gives an indication of the general physiological status of the animals, shows highest values in clams from the control area, not affected by fishing.

AB  - Viroids are graft- or mechanically transmissible agents, disseminated through budding. Biological indexing of commercially important citrus cultivars grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas showed that many are infected with citrus viroids. Most of these trees carried more than one viroid. In most cases, the infected trees are asymptomatic carriers because sour orange, the predominant rootstock used in Texas, does not show symptoms of viroid infection. Detection of viroids through biological indexing on sensitive indicator plants followed by sequential polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sPAGE) is the gold standard but is time-consuming and requires plants to be kept at optimum conditions. A conditional use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides an efficient and alternative detection of viroids for use in the Texas virus-free citrus budwood certification program. RT-PCR could be useful in Texas to help expedite the evaluation for the presence of viroids before conducting the final biologic indexing.. Using RT-PCR, we could detect, clone, and sequence full-length viroids of Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) (both cachexia and noncachexia variants), Citrus viroid-III (Citrus dwarfing viroid), and Citrus viroid-IV (Citrus bark cracking viroid) from a collection of viroid-inoculated grapefruit plants. The source plants were previously shown to be viroid-infected by biological indexing on Etrog citron plants. Based on our results, RT-PCR can be a conditional substitute for biological indexing of mother trees in foundation blocks and shoot tip-grafted trees in the virus-free budwood program. A positive RT-PCR result has a serendipitous value because those trees can be discarded from the pool before expensive biological indexing.

AB  - The influence of environmental parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter, chlorophyll a) on the condition indices and gametogenic cycle of the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis L.) was analyzed in the Mar Menor (Murcia, Spain) between January 1990 and December 1992. The highest condition index values were recorded during the prespawning season at temperatures between 11-12 degrees C. Condition index values gradually decreased from 14 degrees C, coinciding with the appearance of the first larvae in the plankton. Condition index values were lowest in summer. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the condition indices were correlated mainly with temperature and to a lesser extent, with dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and suspended matter. Absolute chlorophyll concentrations were low and presented a negative correlation with the condition index values, though this correlation was less pronounced than that of temperature. Gametogenesis was continuous all year round, but spawning took place only at temperatures of 14 degrees C or higher, and larvae were present in the plankton to 28 degrees C. The low absolute values of chlorophyll a and suspended matter found in the oligotrophic Mar Menor did not seem to affect the gametogenesis, spawning or the larval development of the oysters, which feed on picoplankton, principally composed of dinoflagellates and bacteria.

AB  - Molluscs have been for a long time a very important food resource for humans. Therefore, oysters, clams, and mussels are highly required at seafood markets. Like any commercial food, it is necessary that molluscs present good quality standards, concerning some criteria such as amount of meat and appearance. In bivalves, condition index or fattening index is considered a satisfactory method for estimating the amount of meat related to the shell cavity. Molluscs gatherers of Paraiba State coast, northeastern Brazil, state that molluscan meat production increases during spring tide (designated by them as mare de lancamento) in opposition to the meat decrease which happens during neap tide (mare de quebramento) (they are designated technically in Portuguese as mare de sizigia and mare de quadratura, respectively). Weperformed a survey on the production of unha-de-velho or 'oldman'snail' (Tagelus plebeius) caught by molluscs gatherers in the estuary of River Paraiba do Norte, by observing locally their work, applying questionnaires, searching for a possible scientific relation of that molluscs condition to the gatherers empirical statement. Thus, we estimatedthe molluscs condition index through the method of solids percentage determination. We studied their work and the molluscs condition index during a full lunar-tide cycle. Determinations were carried out between 2nd September and 20th October, 1998, through 20 catches performed to obtain condition index from 400 bivalves. We observed that several biotic and abiotic ecological factors, namely reproduction cycle, biochemical components variations, animal size, and even parasitism, may affect the animal condition index. Despite this aspect, our present results confirmed a high overlapping (80%) of the condition index curve with lunar-tide cycle, in agreement with the gatherers statement. Although we recognize the need for formulating and testing other hypotheses, we consider a priori that the gatherers empirical assertion a unha ta gorda de acordocom a mare ('the "oldman's nail" is fat according to the tide', roughly translating) is justified by the observations here performed when the condition index increased during spring tide and decreased during neap tide.

AB  - Various drought indices have been developed to monitor drought conditions. Each index has typical characteristics that make it applicable to a specific environment. In this study, six popular drought indices, namely, precipitation condition index (PCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), vegetation health index (VHI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), and temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), have been used to monitor droughts in the Greater Changbai Mountains(GCM) in recent years. The spatial pattern and temporal trend of droughts in this area in the period 2001-2018 were explored by calculating these indices from multi-source remote sensing data. Significant spatial-temporal variations were identified. The results of a slope analysis along with the F-statistic test showed that up to 20% of the study area showed a significant increasing or decreasing trend in drought. It was found that some drought indices cannot be explained by meteorological observations because of the time lag between meteorological drought and vegetation response. The drought condition and its changing pattern differ from various land cover types and indices, but the relative drought situation of different landforms is consistent among all indices. This work provides a basic reference for reasonably choosing drought indices for monitoring drought in the GCM to gain a better understanding of the ecosystem conditions and environment.

AB  - The aim of this work was to compare various ecological indexes to assess the state of urbanized ecosystems of the Issyk-Kul region in the Kyrgyz Republic. Soil samples were analyzed for Pb, Zn, Fe, Cu and Cd using AAS. Heavy metal contamination status was assessed using indexes for enrichment factor, geo accumulation, contamination factor, degree of contamination, pollution load, potential ecological risk and integrated risk using the Triad approach. Results show marked variations of heavy metal concentrations within the study area. The concentrations of heavy metals in soils of Issyk-Kul had the following increasing order: Zn> Pb> Cu> Cd. Indexes such as enrichment factor and contamination factor showed the Issyk-Kul soils to be moderately polluted with Pb, Zn and Cd; geoacumulation revealed extreme contamination with Pb, Zn and Cu. Potential ecological risk estimated low risk, while the Triad approach characterized soil as highly contaminated. The Triad approach shows that using biotic components in evaluating the contamination degrees is informative. The results of this study show that adequate measures should be put to checkmate and regulate human activities around Issyk-Kul Lake in order to protect soil from further deterioration and contamination.

AB  - Egg quality is one of the most important factors determining larval viability. The study of oocytes released by 'wild' broodstock will contribute to the definition of quality criteria applied to hatcheries as well as being an indicator of the oyster reproduction potential and aquaculture ongrowing systems. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between condition of Crassostrea gigas spp. angulata (Portuguese strain) from 'wild' broodstock (condition index, gonadal maturity and number of oocyte released), oocyte biochemistry and hatching rate of eggs during the spring/summer of 1995. Stages of gonadal maturity and condition index indicated that natural spawning of this species occurred between April and August with the highest spawning intensity occurring in June. Analyses demonstrated that C. gigas oocyte organic matter consist of 44-74% proteins, 16-38% lipids and 7-12% carbohydrates. A significant relationship was observed between some biochemical parameters - organic matter and lipid content - and broodstock condition index and hatching rate. It seems that these two oocyte parameters (organic matter and total lipids) could be used to define quality of oocyte and thus larval viability. The oocyte protein content was also found to be associated with broodstock and larval quality. In summary, these data are a contribution to the knowledge of the reproductive cycle of oysters in Europe and may be useful in improving hatchery management of this species.

AB  - We analyze changes in the seasonality of tornado reports and related environmental conditions over the central U.S. Tornado counts are normalized by annual totals to reduce effects of changing reporting practices. Wavelet analysis of the normalized tornado counts shows significant power at semiannual and annual frequencies. An environmental index based on convective available potential energy and storm relative helicity shows power at the same frequencies. Reconstruction of the normalized tornado counts and the environmental index at these frequencies provides a time-filtered description of their seasonal variation. Onset and peak dates of the tornado season defined from the reconstruction are significantly correlated with those of the environmental index over the period 1979-2013 and are found to have trends of -3.7 and -3.8days/decade, respectively. The agreement between changes in tornado report seasonality and those of the environmental index is evidence that the trends have a physical origin.

AB  - Somatic condition of the clam Polymesoda solida (Veneroidea: Corbiculidae) in the rainy season of the Salamanca Island Natural Park, Colombian Caribbean. The estuarine clam Polymesoda solida is the main fishery resource in the Salamanca Island Natural Park. I sampled the clam in three interconnected lagoons (Poza Verde, El Torno and Atascosa) during the rainy period (April to November 2004). Sixty individuals were monthly collected by hand on each lagoon; 30 to analyze two condition indexes (relationship between body and shell weight and between soft dry and wet weight), yield (meat percentage) and length-weight relationships. Maturity of female gonad smears was assessed on the remaining individuals. Measures of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, transparency and depth, were also taken at the collection places. Increases of the condition indexes occurred when the Magdalena River showed some decreases in its level, especially at Poza Verde and El Torno. The condition indexes were higher at 27-331nm, (range where maturity size was reached). Clams from Poza Verde, the lagoon nearest to the Magdalena River, had the highest values in condition indexes, yield, fresh weight and maturity frequency. Yield was directly correlated to the condition indexes and sexual maturity. The condition index (body weight/shell weight) showed a highest multiple regression coefficient with salinity, pH and transparency (R-2=74%), indicating the relevance of the hydrological regime in the regulation of the condition of the organisms. P solid() seems to be more adapted to the lowest salinities of the system (0.0-0.4), corresponding to Poza Verde, where the influence of the Magdalena river is more direct and steady. Additionally, differences found between sites in the assessed variables, emphasize the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity of this kind of lagoon estuaries, and should be taken into account for future fisheries management in the rainy period and conservation of P. solida populations.

AB  - Drought is a complex and poorly understood natural hazard in complex terrain and plains lie in foothills of Hindukush-Himalaya-Karakoram region of Central and South Asia. Few research studied climate change scenarios in the transboundary Chitral Kabul River Basin (CKRB) despite its vulnerability to global warming and importance as a region inhabited with more than 10 million people where no treaty on use of water exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This study examines the meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018 and their future trends from 2020 to 2030 in the CKRB. To study meteorological and agricultural drought comprehensively, various single drought indices such as Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and combined drought indices such as Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) and Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI) were utilized. As non-microwave data were used in MIDI, this index was given a new name as Non-Microwave Integrated Drought Index (NMIDI). Our research has found that 2000 was the driest year in the monsoon season followed by 2004 that experienced both meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018. Results also indicate that though there exists spatial variation in the agricultural and meteorological drought, but temporally there has been a decreasing trend observed from 2000 to 2018 for both types of droughts. This trend is projected to continue in the future drought projections between 2020 and 2030. The overall study results indicate that drought can be properly assessed by integration of different data sources and therefore management plans can be developed to address the risk and signing new treaties.

   In concept, ecological restoration will improve ecosystem characteristics of degraded habitats, but in practice, restoration success assessments typically target vegetation communities. We sought to determine if estuarine emergent marsh restoration projects (Galveston Bay, Texas) that had successfully achieved permit-mandated plant coverage were comparable to reference sites at an ecosystem level. We used a Rapid Assessment Method developed specifically for this habitat (Galv-RAM) to compare restored (ages 5-15 y) and reference marshes. Thirteen biotic and abiotic characteristics were used to calculate an ecosystem index score, whereby a pristine habitat would score 100%. The average Galv-RAM ecosystem index score for reference marshes (81%) was typical for urbanized estuaries. Restored marshes scored 75%, indicating that they were relatively well developed, although there was substantial variability in ecosystem index scores among sites. Discriminant function analysis revealed that reference sites had more benthic epifauna (periwinkles, fiddler crabs); epifauna were virtually absent from restored sites. Overall, Galv-RAM scores did not vary with restored marsh age, but some individual features changed over time: older restored sites tended to have higher plant diversity and belowground plant biomass than younger restored sites. The ultimate goal of coastal wetland restoration is to improve the integrity of the regional wetland landscape by augmenting many different ecosystem functions. Therefore, although not all measured variables scored optimally in all restored sites, each of the sites had relatively high ecological value and contributed to the integrity of a larger scale matrix of wetland habitat.

AB  - For the aims of European Water Frame Directive, indexes of biological element macrophytobentos were established for estimation of ecological state classes. Two models for assessment of the ecological status were applied. One of them is proposed by Minicheva, 2003, about the specific surface, and the other, by Orfanidis 2001. Both methods use the same approach grouping of species according to similar functional characteristics.
   For implementation of the monitoring aims, 18 transects were explored, from which 12 were in the north part of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast), and 6 were in the south part. The south part of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast (Sinemorets, Varvara, Maslen nos) is characterized with good ecological state, which correlates with hydrochemical parameters in this zone, lower level of eutrophication and more restricted number of anthropogenic pressure sources. Most influenced of the pollution are Burgas, and the south part of Varna bay.

AB  - A periphyton-based index for biological integrity was developed to assess the ecological status of lakes and reservoirs in Baiyangdian Watershed, China. Periphyton and environmental surveys were conducted at 20 sites during 2009-2010. A total of 22 surveyed metrics of periphyton, which were classified into 6 categories: biomass groups, community structure, pigment ratios, bacteria diversity, enzyme activities, and metabolism were evaluated in order to understand their responsiveness to environmental degradation. Out of these 22 metrics, six metrics were selected to constitute the periphyton-based index for biological integrity: chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c: chlorophyll a ratio, alkaline phosphatase activity, bacteria dominance, net daily metabolism, and autotrophic index by sensitivity and redundancy analysis. Then the periphyton-based index for biological integrity was verified by an independent validation-site data set. The test results indicated the index could not only discriminate disturbed sites from reference sites, but also be triggered by land use types. The scores of periphyton-based index for biological integrity were significantly correlated with the environmental parameters, especially ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus. These results suggest that this index may be a potential tool for assessing the ecological status of lakes and reservoirs, polluted mainly by organic contaminants in Baiyangdian Watershed.

AB  - 1. Body condition indices, measures of body 'plumpness' or mass relative to frame size, are often used as a proxy for lipid reserves or fitness-related traits of animals and assumed to be positively related to fitness.
   2. The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional concerns with the use of body condition indices.
   3. First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally, neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs.
   4. A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition - even relatively simple measures - can inform understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary studies.

AB  - Drought is one of the deadly natural disasters that leave tearstained faces and broken dreams in its wake. Lifecycle as we know it comes to a halt during a dry season in a region. The purpose of this study was to observe the temporal and spatial variation of droughts in the rain-fed area of Potohar plateau (22,254 km(2)), Punjab, Pakistan, from 2000 to 2015, through remotely sensed satellite data, available at the database of Google Earth Engine. Potohar consists of four major districts of the country; Chakwal, Attock, Rawalpindi, and Jhelum. From 2000 to 2015, indices calculated were: standard precipitation index (SPI), standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), vegetation condition index (VCI), precipitation condition index (PCI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI), and temperature condition index (TCI). In this study, SPI and SPEI pointed out meteorological droughts in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2012, which were taken as base years for drought in the study. The study concluded that the main factor involved in the drought severity is not one, but rather a combined accumulation of temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. Soil moisture and precipitation affect the vegetation in the area more so than the temperature of the land surface. Soil moisture was heavily influenced by the amount of precipitation. The land surface temperature was seasonal dependent. The surface temperature was warmest in Chakwal and Attock, while Rawalpindi had the coldest land surface temperature. Soil moisture increased with precipitation. Soil moisture was high in Rawalpindi and Attock during drought years.

AB  - The growth response of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, and the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians, to varying degrees of food limitation was evaluated. Under conditions of low current speed, dense assemblages of shellfish can rapidly deplete ambient food concentrations, resulting in measurable effects on growth and condition index. A flume study demonstrated significant growth and condition index responses to resource competition after reductions as small as 27% in relatively high ambient food concentrations (approximate to 4.6 mu g/l chlorophyll). Growth rates and condition index are linearly correlated with the average chlorophyll ration consumed. A field study demonstrated similar growth responses when the shellfish were cultured over a range of densities in a commercial aquaculture setting. By comparing the growth and condition index responses in the two experiments, we infer the degree of resource depletion occurring in the field from the correlations constructed in the flume study. Although physiological responses to food limitation will necessarily be site specific to varying combinations of temperature, current speed, and food concentration or quality, this work provides a unique opportunity to compare the growth response of oysters and scallops under a wide range of food availability in both laboratory and commercial aquaculture settings. Doubling the stocking density from 2.5 to 5.0 kg of oysters per bag resulted in a 20% decrease in both the condition index and the growth rate (percent increase in weight). These observations may assist commercial growers determine optimal stocking density for their aquaculture grow-out systems. Natural food availability in Point Judith Pond, a classic salt wedge estuary, is highly variable on a daily basis and is related to the tidal exchange. The variation in food concentration superimposed on the tidal current oscillation leads to massive changes in food flux and the degree of local resource competition. Scallop and oyster clearance rates (milliliters per minute) were constant over a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations, suggesting that these species will filter natural seston at a near-constant rate despite fourfold tidal variations in food concentrations. Scallop clearance rates were reduced when chlorophyll concentrations were depleted to below 12% of the natural levels, suggesting a threshold feeding response.

AB  - Ecological Integrity is one of the main scientific measures in the comprehensive assessment of ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to: (a) find a way to depict the disturbance gradient of our case study in northern Iran (b) develop an index of biotic integrity; (c) finally provide a baseline for assessing ecological integrity. Analytical metrics of spatial composition and configuration were applied to identify the disturbance gradient. Estimating of these metrics helped to define three levels of disturbance using the Ward's method of clustering analysis. A quantitative index of integrity was constructed, using three types of bird guilds including structural, functional and compositional. Results showed the range of integrity index at Miankaleh Peninsula was a value from 26 to 68. Statistical analysis including One-Way ANOVA and Pearson Correlation and paired sample t-test were conducted to investigate the validity and reliability of the Index. Findings of this research showed that biotic integrity in parts of the Miankaleh Peninsula was far from its intact condition. Developed index of biological integrity in this research can help to assess effects of the disturbance factors on the natural ecosystem of Miankaleh to prioritize the best management actions for restoring of this ecosystem.

AB  - A methodology for indexing river environmental condition was developed and applied to 269 subsections of national rivers located in the Republic of Korea, based on a river management perspective. The resulting index has been called the River Environment Index (REI). To develop the methodology, a total of 32 factors related to a river's environment were initially investigated, from which 16 were chosen based on their measurability, predictability, measurement regularity and obtainability. Then, using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and based on a survey of 62 river management experts in Korea, the weighting coefficient for each of the 16 factors was determined. Finally, the REI values were estimated by linearly combining the 16 measured factors for the 269 river subsections and mapped using a geospatial information system platform. We expect that the REI will be used to increase the efficient allocation of national budgets for environmentally-friendly river restoration projects of the country's national rivers. Through this new index, prioritization of these rivers will be made using an holistic river management perspective.

AB  - The high costs and lengthy time commitments associated with traditional monitoring and the remoteness of many wetlands have necessitated the development of techniques for rapid wetland appraisal. A rapid appraisal condition index based an four attributes of wetlands, soil, fringing vegetation, aquatic vegetation and water quality, was developed for assessing the health of permanent floodplain wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin of south-eastern Australia. The index, composed of 13 indicators related to wetland function, was tested in the field for scientific validity relative to an independent long-term monitoring data set, replicability of indicator scores by different investigators and the responses to the seasonality in wetland processes, indicator values were based on a mixture of visual estimates and measurements using simple instruments or procedures and all data could be collected in the field in less than 3 h. There was a significant positive correlation between rankings of the condition of 10 wetlands based on an independent long-term monitoring data set and the wetland condition index. There were also highly significant positive correlations between indicator scores collected by different investigators. Indicator scores for physical factors and fringing vegetation did not differ between autumn and winter but winter rainfall had a significant impact on aquatic vegetation and water quality indicators. The results indicate that the wetland condition index is a valuable and reliable tool for the rapid surveying of the condition of permanent floodplain wetlands. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - Since 1990, Industry and Investment New South Wales' (NSW) Sydney rock oyster (SRO) breeding programme has successfully used selective breeding to improve oyster growth rates. But, some oyster growers have observed that selected oysters condition at a different rate and to a different extent compared to naturally caught oysters grown under similar conditions. The condition index, sex, gametogenic stage and gonad area of fifth generation SROs selectively bred for fast growth were investigated by collecting monthly samples at a northern, mid and southern site in NSW between June 2005 and July 2006. Non-selected oysters farmed under the same conditions were also sampled at the same time. Overall, selected and non-selected oysters developed and spawned at each site synchronously, however, selectively bred oysters, in most instances, had a lower condition index, different meat conditioning cycle and reduced gonad area than their non-selected counterparts. Although selective breeding for fast growth hasn't changed reproductive timing, the variation in meat condition is consistent with oyster grower's observations and has encouraged further research to better understand the environmental responses of selected oysters and improve reproductive condition in SRO through breeding.

AB  - Some indices (the condition index, the state index, the condition factor, the meat yield index and gonadosomatic index) were tested and compared to estimate the degree of shell filling with meat for cultivated M. galloprovincialis from (Crimea). The peaks of values of the the state index, the condition factor and the meat yield index had noted in September (150 +/- 8.8%, 3.6 +/- 0.2%, 35.8 +/- 2.2%, respectively). All the indices can be used as indicators of quality of mussel production. If using gonadosomatic index to defend optimal harvest time for M. galloprovincialis cultivated it is shown that mollusks reaches commercial quality at gonadosomatic index >8.5. The meat yield index has been proposed as easy and handy for assessing the degree of shell filling with meat. Mussels acquire optimal commercial quality if the meat yield index is more than 20%. It has been shown the total weight of ten mussels it is enough for convenient determination of the meat yield index. Harvesting time depends on environmental factors and marine farm location. It is rational to collect M. galloprovincialis all year round, except for December and March at the north of the Black Sea (Crimea).

AB  - Gross biochemical composition and condition index were investigated in two geographically separated populations of the baby clam, Marcia opima during December 1998 - January 2000. Proteins, lipids, total carbohydrates and glycogen showed similar patterns of the variation according to the reproductive cycles in clams from both the areas, highlighting the importance of the reproductive cycle and physiological features of the species and also the influence of environmental conditions in determining biochemical composition. Proteins and lipids were maximum in the mature clams and decreased during and after spawning. Lipids were higher in females. Seasonal variations of lipid were inversely related to glycogen contents. Total carbohydrates and glycogen increased during summer and decreased during monsoon. Condition index was influenced by environmental conditions, which further determined the spawning season.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of forest cover in close proximity to breeding ponds (N = 29) together with the effect of the presence or absence of other amphibian species on the residual body condition index of Bombina variegata (N = 106). PCA and ANOVA analysis showed that body condition index was higher in toads found in breeding ponds with higher forest cover within a radius of 50 m. This observation confirms the results of other authors. Other amphibian species (Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria, Triturus montadoni) occurred together with Bombina variegata mostly in ponds surrounded by larger deforested areas. Furthermore, the significantly lower body condition index of Bombina variegata was observed mostly in ponds occupied by other amphibian species (p<0.001). Results suggest that Bombina variegata is better adapted to shaded environments in comparison to other amphibians and therefore is able to achieve higher body condition in forest ponds not only due to higher nutrient availability and higher moisture but also decreased competition.

AB  - Choosing an alternative species of mussel for the aquaculture industries, will be possible if it has equal or greater yield than the mussel cultivated. This study compares the growth of the chilean native mussel Mytilus chilensis with the non-native Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and evaluate if environmental variables and cultivation depth affects mussels growth. Mussel were seeded in summer, with the same mean total weight and shell length for both species. At the end of the experiment, shell length (SL), condition index and gonadosomatic index were compared over month, depth and species. Highly significant differences were found in shell length between month and depth and between month and species (p < 0.05). The linear relationship between the gonad weight and wet meat weight in M. chilensis present a higher gonad weight for the same wet meat weight than M. galloprovincialis. It can be concluded that at the end of the harvest size cultivation M. chilensis presents a greater gonad weight, condition index and gonadosomatic index.

AB  - The article has investigated the ecological state of hydroecosystems of the water basin of Kalmius River (WBK). The investigations were carried out with the account of new information methods of monitoring over indicators and their parameters of the development of water ecosystems, which made it possible to understand causal connections in the system hydroecosystems-nature-anthropogenic water ecosystems-socio-economic systems. It has been shown that a self-reconstructive potential of WBK quantitatively agrees with the maximum technogenic load. Proposed methods of monitoring the ecological state of WBK made it possible to determine potentially possible causes of hydrosystem degradation.

AB  - Drought is a multidisciplinary concept that can have major impacts on ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic spheres. The accurate monitoring and information of spatio-temporal distribution of agricultural drought are effective means of reducing the farmers' losses. The space-based technology is proven to provide the detail of land information, which helps to quantify different natural resources and even severity of climate extremes. The biophysical parameters such as precipitation, temperature, soil, and vegetation significantly influence drought monitoring in the regions. An artificial Neural Network (ANN) model based on the integration of Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Soil Condition Index (SCI) derived from multi-source remote sensing satellite imagery was applied for assessment and prediction of drought. The study was implemented in Sangli, Maharashtra, India from the period 2003-2016 to assess the efficiency of the ANN model for near real-time drought monitoring. In our research, the investigation results for 2006, 2011, and 2016 (a typical dry year) were accurately explored using the ANN model. The multiyear ANN model results were also checked with the actual drought intensity of government records and observation. The proposed system demonstrated 92% accuracy and matched the trend with the ground base stations, hence the ANN model demonstrates the potential of using as drought monitoring indicator capturing both meteorological and agricultural drought information. The output of the study can be utilized for contingency planning by state and local governments.

AB  - This study forms the first attempt to assess the health status, studying parasites and pathologies in wild or natural and farmed or cultured populations of the Indian backwater oyster, Magallana bilineata (= Crassostrea madrasensis Preston, 1916), the mainstay of oyster farming in the country. The Condition index, prevalence of infection, intensity, and seasonal variations in parasites and pathological conditions were studied. Wild oyster population was infected/infested with protozoan (Perkinsus beihaiensis, Nematopsis sp., Sphenophrya sp., and Stegotricha sp.), metazoan (cestodes and crustaceans), and shell (Polydora spp. and Cliona spp.) parasites and pathological conditions (digestive tubule atrophy, ceroid bodies, haemocytic infiltration, tissue necrosis, neoplastic disorders, and prokaryotic inclusions). Farmed population exhibited only a single protozoan (P. beihaiensis), a metazoan (Polydora sp.) infection and two pathological conditions (digestive tubule atrophy and ceroid bodies) in the tissues. The occurrence, prevalence and intensity rates for parasites and pathological conditions were significantly lower in farmed population compared to the wild population at the study site. Prevalence for parasites and pathologies were observed to be higher during dry season. The condition index (CI) values, which indicate the general health status of the oysters, were also significantly higher for the farmed population. The exposure period and the location of oysters in the habitat had a significant influence on the condition index and parasitic load in the population. None of the parasites were OIE listed; however the presence of a potential pathogen (P. beihaiensis) and pathological conditions warrants regular monitoring of the stocks and water quality at the culture site.

AB  - This study quantifies habitat-specific small mammal patterns in the Caledon Nature Reserve, Free State province, South Africa. Small mammal community variables were correlated with an Ecological Index, the current method used to interpret habitat integrity in Free State nature reserves. It also reports on the seasonal abundance, species richness and diversity of small mammals present in specific habitats and addresses the most successful methods to sample these taxa, such as the duration of trapping to ensure unbiased sampling, and in which season should effort be concentrated to obtain optimal results. Our results support expectations that small mammal species richness increase with Ecological Index value, the number of specialist species in Free State grasslands increases with succession up to the climax phase, and that Mastomys coucha dominance acts as an indicator of habitat disturbance. It also supports previous studies that have shown a minimum trapping period of 3 days and nights, and best trap success and species richness at the end of autumn-early winter.

AB  - The complexity of the environment demands a well-constructed composite environmental index (CEI) to provide a useful tool to draw attention to environmental conditions and trends for policy purposes. Among the common difficulties in constructing a proper CEI are uncertainties due to the selection of the most representative underlying variables or indicators. A degree of uncertainty accompanies experts' judgments, and to deal with vague, subjective or inconsistent information, logic other than classic is required. This study analyzes a procedure that uses different experts' opinions in constructing a CEI. with the use of paraconsistent annotated logic. For this, a sensitivity analysis of the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI 2005) was used as an example to assess the reliability of experts' opinions. The uncertainty due to the disagreement in experts' opinions clearly indicates that the forms we presently use to measure and monitor the actual environment are insufficient, that is, there is a lack of a "science of sustainability".

AB  - In order to solve regional water security issues, such as shortage of water resources, the aggravation of water pollution, the destruction of the ecological environment, etc., this study proposed the flood control security index, resource security index and ecological security index, respectively, according to the construction principle of human development index. Based on the above security indexes, a novel water security comprehensive evaluation model is established by combining the coupling coordination degree model and the state space model. The proposed model has the advantage of simple operation and fast data speed, which is convenient for water security evaluation in different periods and regions. Taking China as an example, the water security conditions were evaluated from 2007 to 2016 for 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China, including flood control security index, resource security index, ecological security index and water security level of each region, and the specific problems of water security in each region were obtained. The evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation in each region, which provides the scientific basis for the local government authorities to formulate the corresponding regional water security policy.

AB  - A study on the reproductive cycle of the blood cockle Anadara granosa (Bivalvia: Arcidae) was conducted at three different areas in the northern region of the Strait of Malacca. A total of 1,920 samples of adult A. granosa (38-71 mm length) were collected from June 2009 until September 2010. Qualitative techniques (gonadal microscopic fresh smear test and histology analysis) as well as quantitative techniques (analysis of condition index and gonadal index) were used to predict monthly gonadal development stages of A. granosa. The gonadal index of A. granosa from Banda Aceh (Indonesia) (r=0.469, P > 0.05) and Pulau Pinang (Malaysia) (r=0.123, P > 0.05) did not show any correlation to their condition index, whereas the gonadal index of A. granosa from Lhokseumawe (Indonesia) (r=0.609, P < 0.05) showed moderate positive correlation to the condition index. During the 16 month sampling period, four reproductive cycles were observed: each from three to six months. The process of releasing gametes is termed dribble spawning, and is the same in all populations. The principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that A. granosa reproduction was affected by interaction between internal physiological factors and indigenous environmental factors. In all sampling areas, phytoplankton density played a key role in the reproductive cycle in A. granosa. Information on the reproductive biology of this species is essential for species management and to improve the sustainability practices of the fisheries industry. These findings will provide basic information on the biology of the blood cockle A. granosa for stock management in the region.

AB  - The combination of salinity and temperature has synergistic effects on virtually all aspects of the biology of estuarine organisms. Of interest were site-specific characteristics in the response of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, from the St. Lucie River Estuary to the interactive effects of temperature and salinity. This estuary, one of the largest on the central east coast of Florida, is strongly influenced by anthropogenic modifications due to management needs to control the patterns of freshwater flow in the St. Lucie River watershed. Crassostrea virginica is designated a valued ecosystem component for monitoring the health of this estuary. Our approach used a multidimensional response surface design to study the effects of temperature and salinity on sublethal measures of oyster performance: (1) body condition index as an overall indicator of bioenergetic status and (2) the RNA/DNA ratio as a biochemical indicator of cellular stress. The results showed that there was a greater ability to withstand extreme salinity conditions at lower temperatures. However, there were no site-specific attributes that differentiated the response of the St. Lucie Estuary population from populations along the distribution range. Condition index was a less variable response than the RNA/DNA ratio, and the final models for mean condition index and the RNA/DNA ratios explained 77.3 and 35.8% of the respective variances.

AB  - This study provides information on biological (gonadosomatic index), commercial quality (condition index and meat yield) and biochemical aspects (proximate composition, fatty acids) of the soft tissues of Flexopecten glaber reared in suspended cages in the Ionian Sea. The results showed that condition index (CI) and meat yield (MY) peaked in December (60 and 30%, respectively) and in April, May and June (from 53 to 60% for CI and from 34 to 36% for MY). Gonadosomatic index showed three main peaks in winter, spring and summer months. Contents of protein 8.18-11.9 g/100 g), lipid (0,.78-1.18 g/100 g) and carbohydrate (1.19-3.30 g/100 g) varied significantly during the study period. Saturated fatty acids was the dominant group, except in December when polyunsaturated fatty acids showed the highest proportion (43% of total FAs). Fatty acids of the n3 group were dominant with docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids. Highest n3/n6 ratios were recorded in spring-summer specimens, with values > of 5. The results showed a better nutritional quality of scallops in May, July and December.

AB  - Traditional pavement distress index such as the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) developed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines coefficients of distresses based on subjective ratings. This study proposed an asphalt pavement distress condition index based on various types of distress data collected from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The SEM method treated the overall distress index as a latent variable while various distresses were treated as endogenous and other influence factors such as age, layer thickness, material type, weather, environment and traffic, were exogenous observed variables. The SEM method modeled the contributions of various distresses as well as the influence of other factors on the overall pavement distress condition. Influences of age, layer thickness, material type, environment and traffic on the latent distress condition were in accordance with previous studies. Compared with previous attempts to model latent pavement condition index utilizing SEM method, more pavement condition measurements and influencing factors were included. Specifically, this study adopted the robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) to estimate parameters for non-normally distributed data and derived the explicit expression of latent variables with intercepts. A multiple regression prediction model was built to calculate an overall condition index utilizing those measured distress data. The established pavement distress index prediction model provided a rational estimation of weighting coefficients for each distress type. The prediction model showed that alligator cracking, longitudinal cracking in wheel path, non-wheel path longitudinal cracking, transverse cracking, block cracking, edge cracking, patch and bleeding were significant for the latent pavement distress index.

AB  - New original data on the ecology of 18 saproxylic Diptera species were obtained as a result of research of xylobionts in the Lazovsky State Nature Reserve (Russia). Ten species were registered for the first time from this territory. The material was acquired by the collecting of immature individuals in nature with consequent rearing in the laboratory. The species determination was based on the emerged imagos. Similar data on the same Diptera species collected in State Nature Reserve "Khingansky", State Nature Reserve "Ussuriyslciio", State Nature Reserve "Kedrovaya" Path and State Nature Reserve "Bolshekhekhtsirskiy" were used for comparison. The type of larval food was determined from specific observations in nature and under laboratory conditions. Related species complexes were described according to notes from field diaries. Literature data as well as results of original investigations were summarised to analyse insect confinement to various tree species in the territories of the State Nature Reserve "IChingansky", State Nature Reserve "Ussuriyskii", State Nature Reserve "Kedrovaya Pad" and State Nature Reserve "Bolshekhckhtsirskiy". We found that the largest number of investigated Diptera species was collected from Populus suaveolens and Alaackia amurensis. Since the larvae of xylobiont dipterans inhabit the passages of other insects, the majority of larvae of investigated species proved to be sapronecrophages. The study of the saproxylic Diptera biology in combination with other insects allows us to identify the species-bioindicators of the tree stand damage in a forest. The ability to diagnose the presence of several serious forest pests such as Hylecoetus dermestoides (Coleoptera, Lymexylonidae) by the presence of saproxylic Diptera species (e.g. Libnotes longistigma (Limoniidae), Pseudoseioptera demonstrans (Ulidiidae) and Lenitovena pteropleuralis (Tephritidae)) has been discussed for the first time. The results of the present study can be used for further monitoring activities of the insect diversity in the Lazovsky State Nature Reserve, State Nature Reserve "Khingansky", State Nature Reserve "Ussuriyskii". State Nature Reserve "Kccovaya Pad" and State Nature Reserve "Bolshekhelitsirsky" and in forests of neighbouring countries.

AB  - In this paper an effort has been made to analyze and compare the position of Indian states with respect to environmental quality level by using different environmental indicators of air, water, forest and other indicators responsible for the diversity of environment, for which the air index, water index, forest index and composite environmental performance index has been constructed. The study found that the better performing states with respect to overall environmental quality in terms of composite environmental performance index (EPI) were Goa, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On the other hand. Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Nagaland, West Bengal and Gujarat are poor performing states in terms of overall environmental quality. The comparison of environmental performance index (EPI) with different economic development indicators shows that there is positive relationship of EP/with share of industry and literacy rate. However, negative relationship has been found between EPI and population density. No clear relationship emerges between EPI and NSDP per capita as well as EPI and urban population.

AB  - We examined the spatial variation in carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry and condition index of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), non-indigenous species, in four Swedish lakes with different productivity. Within-lake variability was observed in tissue C:N molar ratios of Dreissena in all lakes and in tissue C:P ratio only in three lakes. Depth had no effect on tissue C:P and N:P ratios of Dreissena. A positive correlation was found between C:N:P stoichiometry of seston and elemental composition of zebra mussel in one of the lakes. Tissue C:N and N:P ratios were the main factors that related to zebra mussel condition index. Zebra mussel condition was positively related to tissue C:N ratio. Smaller Dreissena had higher C:N ratio than larger Dreissena in two of the four lakes. Zebra mussels in the lake with highest productivity had lower C:P and N:P ratios than zebra mussels in the lake with lowest productivity. Our study suggests that the zebra mussel may modify their phosphorus content in relation to lake trophic state, and therefore cope with stoichiometric constraints which may explain the invasion success of this and other related species.

AB  - Drought or dryness occurs due to the accumulative effect of certain climatological and hydrological variables over a certain period. Droughts are studied through numerically computed simple or compound indices. Vegetation condition index (VCI) is used for observing the change in vegetation that causes agricultural drought. Since the land surface temperature has minimum influence from cloud contamination and humidity in the air, so the temperature condition index (TCI) is used for studying the temperature change. Dryness or wetness of soil is a major indicator for agriculture and hydrological drought and for that purpose, the index, soil moisture condition index (SMCI), is computed. The deviation of precipitation from normal is a major cause for meteorological droughts and for that purpose, precipitation condition index (PCI) is computed. The years when the indices escalated the dryness situation to severe and extreme are pointed out in this research. Furthermore, an interactive dashboard is generated in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for users to compute the said indices using country boundary, time period, and ecological mask of their choice: Agriculture Drought Monitoring. Apart from global results, three case studies of droughts (2002 in Australia, 2013 in Brazil, and 2019 in Thailand) computed via the dashboard are discussed in detail in this research.

AB  - The quality of ecological environment is not only an important basis for judging the sustainable development of economy but also an important factor to complete the construction of ecological civilization. Therefore, this paper puts forward the application of remote sensing ecological index to evaluate the lake wetland ecotourism resources. In this study, the Manas Lake wetland area in Xinjiang was taken as the research object, and based on the remote sensing ecological index evaluation method, the ecological resources of Manas Lake wetland were evaluated. The results showed that RSEI (Remote Sensing Based Ecological Index) showed a steady upward trend from 2000 to 2016, which reflected that the ecological environment of the study area had been improved in the past 20 years; the area with poor ecological environment condition was 4.02 km(2), the area improved was 8.18 km(2), and the area with little change or unchanged was 3543 km(2); the area around the downstream corridor was the main area with poor ecological quality, around the lake, and far away surrounding the area for improvement. Climate change and human activities have a common effect on the ecological environment of Manas Lake wetland. Increasing human activities are the main reason for wetland degradation. Over the years, extensive agricultural development has caused serious imbalance among population, economy, and ecological environment in Manas River Basin. From the perspective of optimizing the allocation of water resources, it is proposed that the ecological value and sustainable development of tail lake wetland should be paid attention to while the large-scale development of water and soil resources in the main source river basins.

AB  - Evaluation of the river ecological environment can provide a basis for river management and ecological restoration. To conduct a comprehensive health assessment of the rivers in Tianjin, their biological, physical, and chemical indicators are investigated on the basis of 32 river monitoring sites from August to September 2018. The comprehensive pollution and ecological integrity indexes of the rivers are analyzed. Results of the two evaluations, compared to achieve the river ecological environment evaluation, are as follows. 1) Index of Ecological Integrity evaluation shows that among the sampling points, 18.8% are "healthy", 28.1% are "sub-healthy", 40.6% are "fair", 6.3% are "poor", and 6.3% are "very poor". 2) The comprehensive evaluation of the chemical properties of the 32 river ecosystems in Tianjin shows severe overall river pollution and low standard water function area. Of the total sampling sites, 16 (50%) are heavily contaminated and 10 (31.3%) are moderately contaminated. Excessive chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen are the main causes of water pollution. 3) The Index of Ecological Integrity (IEI) has high correspondence with environmental factors. Pearson correlation analysis results show that the IEI index is significantly correlated with permanganate index (R = - 0.453; P = 0.023 < 0.05). Analysis results using BEST show that ammonia nitrogen is the best environmental parameter to explain the changes in IEI (R-ho= 0.154; P = 0.02 < 0.05) and those using RELATE show significant correlation between the biotic index and the environmental parameter matrices (R-ho= 0.154; P = 0.034 < 0.05).

AB  - Numerous drought indices have been developed to monitor drought conditions. However, different drought indices have differing characteristics, and are suitable for specific environments. The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of drought, as detected by remote sensing across the Continental United States (CONUS). We used drought events during 2011 and 2012 to compare various indices developed for the study of drought phenomena. Three in situ drought indices, the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), Z-index and standardized precipitation indices (SPI) with different time scales were used to evaluate drought conditions in different climate divisions. The drought indices compared in this study include the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), the perpendicular drought index (PDI) and modified PDI (MPDI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data, and the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer - earth observing system (AMSR-E). Other synthesized drought indices, which combine indices such as VCI, TCI, SMCI and PCI, were also compared in this study. These included the vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), the microwave integrated drought index (MIDI), the synthesized drought index (SDI), the optimized meteorological drought index (OMDI), and the optimized vegetation drought index (OVDI). The results include a wide variety of drought conditions based on different drought indices. Meteorological drought indices indicated that more regions were under severe drought than agricultural drought indices did. Drought indices appear to be more similar to standard drought indices than PDI, MPDI and TVDI. The results also indicate that different indices have strengths and weaknesses in different climates across CONUS. SMCI has a good correlation with short-term SPI, and the sensitivity of SMCI is strongly dependent on terrain, as it performs worse in regions with heavy tree cover than in regions with a low density of vegetation. TCI, VCI, PDI and MPDI are more similar to 3-month SPI data, but correlate weakly with station-based indices located in areas of high precipitation, higher soil permeability, large-scale agriculture and forests. PCI is more strongly correlated with short-term drought conditions in almost all climate divisions than other single indices. VCI would be more reliable if there were only red and NIR surface reflectance bands available, while VHI would be a better choice if only NDVI and LST data were available. Condition index-based drought indices (PCI, TCI, VCI, SMCI, VHI, SDCI, SDCI, MIDI, OVDI, OMDI) performed better than other categories of drought indices, and the use of time series analysis may be a contributing factor to this difference in performance.

AB  - Determination of the best genetic model, mode of inheritance, gene action and effective breeding strategy to improve the important morpho-physiological traits such as harvest index and biological yield is very important especially in drought stress conditions. Therefore, this study was conducted using two drought susceptible and tolerant wheat cultivars. Cultivars Sakha8 (tolerant) and Pishtaz (susceptible) as parents alongwith F-1, F-2, BC1, and BC2 generations were sown in a randomized complete block design with three replications in drought stress conditions. Results of analysis of variance indicated significant difference between generations for harvest index and biological yield. Degree of dominance revealed over-dominance for all the traits. Fitting the simple additive-dominance model demonstrated this as the best model to justify the genetic variations of harvest index and biological yield. Estimation of heritability and mode of gene action indicated that selection for improvement of traits studied in stress condition and specifically in early generations had medium genetic gain. In conclusion, the traits harvest index and biological yield had efficacy as indirect selection criteria for improvement of plant grain yield in drought stress condition.

AB  - The state of Nayarit is the main oyster producer in the Mexican Pacific, this derived from artisanal crops of Crassostrea corteziensis and collecting of wild seeds. Despite its importance, there are no studies on the reproduction of this species in Boca de Camichin, Nayarit, Mexico, which is the area with the highest production (around 90%). The aim of this study was to evaluate sex ratio, condition index (CI), reproductive cycle, and recruitment size for reproduction and its relationship with environmental factors. Sixty oysters were sampled monthly at La Palicienta Lagoon for one year. The organisms were weighed and measured, then fixed with 10% formalin for histological analyses. Subsequently, the gonads were processed by histology. Sex ratio was different from 1: 1, with a predominance of females. The condition index (CI) was higher from March to July. Oyster spawning was most prevalent in May, August, and October. The temperature had a positive relationship with reproduction. Recruitment size at reproduction was 57.1 mm. The results of this study could supply useful information about reproduction of the species at La Palicienta and seed collection in Boca de Camichin, Nayarit.

AB  - Biochemical compositions, condition index (CI) and percentage edibility (PE) of an estuarine clam, Paphia malabarica, were studied from two estuarine regions of Goa during March 2009 to March 2010. Relationships between nutritive components and ambient environmental parameters were also established. Significant (P <0.001) spatio-temporal changes in biochemical composition, CI and PE were noticed. Protein content was higher (15.64-86.79%) round the year, followed by carbohydrate (4.29-72.73%) and lipid (2.25-5.12%) contents. Maximum nutritive values i.e. protein; (64.37-86.78%), lipid (2.85-5.21%), calorific values (4.61-6.52Kcal/g), CI (31.75-62.06%) and PE (17.27-21.00%) during premonsoon (February-May) period are suggestive of suitable harvesting period for P. malabarica.

AB  - The comparison analysis and assessment of certain landscapes and landscape units is an effective tool for the decision makers for meeting appropriate land use decision. In our analysis we compared various groups of indices applicable for ecological landscape assessment applying them on three lowland landscape units. The assessed indices characterize the landscape from the point of view of vegetation (vegetation-based natural capital index) and birds (diversity of birds species of agricultural areas). The vegetation-based natural capital index values have been derived from the META database collected between 2003 and 2008. The ornithological survey was carried out in the spring of 2011 by modified Danish point counting system. Our sample areas were the geographical micro-regions Csepeli-sik, Hortobagy and Nagyberek, which are landscapes dominated by agricultural lands and grasslands. The major question was whether different naturalness indicators characterize basically similar but differently used landscape areas in a similar way. We found that while a higher NCI value corresponds to a higher abundance of birds, it also corresponds to a lower diversity of bird species. This contraintuitive effect partially might be explained by the variance of the large-scale landscape structure of the assessed landscape areas.

AB  - Allometry and condition index of the freshwater mussel Parreysia favidens (Benson, 1862) inhabiting the west flowing river Seeta at Seetanadi in the Western Ghats, India was studied between April 2005 and May 2006. Monthly sampling was carried out and a total of 2728 bivalves were collected for the study. The length-breadth and length-width relationships for the entire study period were L = 1.540 + 0.6742B and L = -0.0873 + 0.4561W respectively. The length-total weight, length-wet weight, length-shell weight and length-dry weight relationships were W = 0.0003805L(3.066), W = 0.0000255L(3.54), W = 0.0000705L(3.139) and W = 0.0000042L(3.10) respectively. The values of b indicated the relative growth in body weight and superior physiological condition of the mussels. The monthly mean data on condition index showed fluctuation. The maximum (16.36) condition was noticed during August 2005 and the minimum (4.16) in December 2005. The condition of mussels was fairly high from during May to September. The best period for harvest of P. favidens in river Seeta could be between May and September. The hierarchical cluster analysis showed three major groups of biological variables and sample size alone formed a separate group.

AB  - This study examined growth, gametogenic activity. condition index. as well as the relationship of the life cycle to environmental parameters of the Cortez oyster Crassostrea corteziensis,. which was cultured for 25 mo in the lagoon of Las Guasimas (Sonora, Mexico). We used oocyte diameter and cytological characteristics of the gonad to determine reproductive stages in females and males. The condition index was used to describe the oyster's physiological health. Temperature, salinity, seston, and chlorophyll a, h, and c were recorded at the study site. The Cortez oyster had isometric shell growth. reaching 103.2 +/- 1.82 mm height and 150.3 +/- 4.98 g total weight. Data were adjusted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation (L-infinity = 132.2 mm and K= 1.08 y(-1)), and survival was about 70 %. This native specics exhibited a distinctive gametogenic cycle. with the beginning and end of the cycle controlled by seawater temperature fluctuation (15-33 degrees C), which once started, is continuous over a 9-mo period (March to November). Elevated temperature (>25 degrees C) produced high gatnctogcnic activity. exhibiting primary, growing. and mature oocytes, and partial spawning in April. September. and November. The peak spawning event occurred in August. when seawater reached peak temperatures of 31 degrees C to 33 degrees C, which was followed by a significant reduction of the condition index. During winter, storage or nutrients took place, and this appears to be used in the following season for gatnetogenesis. In general, the condition index was high throughout the study period. Energy for growth and reproduction came from phytoplankton blooms in summer and high concentration throughout the year of nonchlorophyll particulate organic matter. Observations show that this oyster is a protandrous species. High survival, elevated yields, and a long. continuous gametogenic cycle indicate that C. corteziensis has importance in aquaculture in Gulf of California.

AB  - Several spectral indices have been used to estimate droughts, however, these indicators only give evidence of a dry spell leaving out its impacts on significant economic activities performed in a given region. In this context, livestock breeding in one of the most important activities to analyze in the Brazilian semiarid region. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the drought indices, obtained through remote sensory devices, and annual milk production (2004 - 2014), identifying the most affected cities by the drought and were considered the most vulnerable and in need of special attention during dry periods. In order to analyze the data, the hierarchical grouping technique and correlation analyses between milk production and VCI - Vegetation Condition Index, TCI - Temperature Condition Index, VHI Vegetation Health Index, PCI - Precipitation Condition Index and SDCI - Scaled Drought Condition indices were used. The intense correlation between milk production and the drought indices may be related to the dependency of the cities' economies on natural resources. On the other hand, the diversification of the cities' economic activities may enable access to various resources and drought vulnerability reduction.

AB  - Over the last ten years, there has been a major decline in the condition of the Coorong, the estuary for Australia's largest river system, the River Murray. This decline is due to prolonged drought combined with past management of the Murray-Darling Basin. In order to successfully manage the estuary in the future, predictions are needed to evaluate the effect of possible management actions on the Coorong ecosystem under a variety of climatic scenarios. The alternative stable state concept can be extended to non-equilibrium systems, allowing for modelling of condition. Rather than constraining the definition of alternative states to those that are stable, we identify a suite of ecosystem states that occur naturally, but also include those that arise during the decline of the system. Eight distinct states were defined, with thresholds between them based on a combination of environmental characteristics associated with co-occurring biota. Threshold values for environmental characteristics define the transition rules between states. Mapping these states allows us to characterise the condition of the estuary in both space and time. The distribution of these states, and the diversity of states supported can be used to create an ecosystem condition index. By calculating the value of the index over time, the trajectory of ecosystem condition merges, and predictions can be made about future condition, should the current situation continue. This trajectory modelling can then form a baseline against which to evaluate possible management actions under a variety of climatic scenarios to identify those most likely to improve the condition of the Coorong.

AB  - Human use and management have a marked effect on wetland from different scales; it is necessary to develop a multi-scale integrated method to assess wetland conditions. So, this research aids the development of the wetland condition index (WCI) for humid regions of China by combining two main sub-indices: (i) the landscape development intensity index (LDI), which assesses human-dominated impacts; and (ii) the water environment index (WEI), which assesses changes in water quality and phytoplankton. We measured terrain and land use in the watersheds of wetlands using remote imaging data with geographic information systems (GIS) software. Also, we monitored the physical and chemical variables of the water bodies of 27 wetlands in urbanized and moderately urbanized areas in Nanjing City of China for this study. There were significant inconsistencies between the city's level of development and the values of the WCI and its sub-indices. The WCI of urbanized areas was better than that for moderately urbanized areas, and the sub-indices LDI and WEI were only slightly correlated. In other words, wetlands with a low LDI value did not necessarily have a low water environment index value. Due to wetland restoration and human management activities, integrating the LDI and WEI is increasingly necessary for wetlands in urbanized areas than for moderately urbanized areas. This method could guide the design of wetlands to optimize their qualities and benefits to residents and reinforce wetland conservation.

AB  - Body condition is important because it is correlated with population and habitat quality parameters. Since the direct measurements are either lethal or unreliable, a wide range of non-lethal body condition indices has been proposed. The aim of our study was to apply and compare three body condition indices (Fulton's index, relative body condition mass index and residual index) using body size indicator - body mass data for 24 populations of the yellow bellied toad (Bombina variegata). The condition index should be independent of body size indicator, in this case snout vent length (SVL). Therefore we tested all three indices for the statistical independence of SVL and for the normality of distribution. Fulton's index violated the independence assumption, whereas the relative body condition mass index did not have a normal distribution. Residual index was found both independent of SVL and normally distributed. Moreover, the residual index highlighted biological significant differences on the basis of altitude and season. Our results recommend the residual index as a useful tool in amphibian monitoring and conservation.

AB  - In this work, contamination levels in two Moroccan coastal zones (Ouled Ghanem near El Jadida and Dar Bouazza near Casablanca) through spatial and temporal monitoring of the levels of some metallic elements (Cd, Hg and Zn) in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis by calculating the Condition Index (CI: the ratio between dry flesh weight and dry shell weight) were examined. Heavy metal bioaccumulation measurements in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in the studied zones show a seasonal pattern with a maximum in spring and a minimum in summer because of physiological variations including metabolism and reproduction (gametogenesis, egg laying) without neglecting the effect of geographical distribution. Computation of the Condition Index enables us to adjust the levels of heavy metals measured. Adjusted concentrations of heavy metals in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, after taking into account their CI, are supposed to be representative of the state of marine environmental contamination. They also make it possible to compare the contamination levels in two studied zones. In our case, results show that Ouled Ghanem area is more contaminated by Cd than Dar Bouazza.

AB  - Specimens of the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea commercialis were deployed for a 3-month period at control and sewage disturbed marine locations in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia. The DNA damage product, 8-hydroxyguanine, was measured by GC/MS-SIM from chromatin extracts of the gill tissues of oysters to assess oxidative damage. The levels ranged from 11.5 to 18.8 modified bases per 10(7) guanine bases. Although the condition indices were significantly different between the Redhead control site (178.3 +/- 3.6) and the Burwood sewage disturbed location (140.4 +/- 4.4), no significant differences in 8-hydroxyguanine concentrations were detected between the sites, and the concentration of 8-hydroxyguanine was not correlated to condition index. However, levels of the DNA base modification were correlated with the concentrations of bioaccumulated lead (r = 0.84, P = 0.036). This association provides in vivo evidence that the bioaccumulation of lead results in oxidative damage to DNA. An additional control and sewage disturbed site were included to investigate the relationship between heavy metal bioaccumulation and the condition index of deployed oysters. After the 3-month deployment period, the condition index was negatively correlated to concentrations of bioaccumulated mercury (r = -0.80, P < 0.001), cobalt (r = -0.65, P < 0.01), and nickel (r = -0.69, P < 0.01), suggesting a strong negative influence of these metals at relatively low concentrations on the physiological condition of the oysters.

AB  - Taking Lake Gehu located in the Yangtze River Delta as the research object, the phytoplankton community and environmental variables at 18 sampling sites in Lake Gehu were monitored and investigated during the dry season (March) and the wet season (July) of 2020. On this basis, the phytoplankton biological integrity index (PIBI) was established during dry and wet periods, and the health of the lake water ecosystem was evaluated. The results showed that the P-IBI in dry and wet periods was consistent throughout Lake Gehu, and the overall water ecological health assessment results were "moderate". To test the stability of the P-IBI, the relationships between the P-IBI, its constituent parameters and a single water quality environmental factor were analyzed through redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that total nitrogen, the hypermanganate index, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, and transparency were highly correlated with the P-IBI system. Comparing the composition of the P-IBI during dry and wet periods and the relationships between the P-IBI system and water quality factors in the two hydrological periods, it was found that the parameters of the P-IBI system differed greatly between the dry and wet periods. The number of significantly related water quality factors in the dry period was greater than that in the wet period, and the two-axis characteristic values, the correlations between the P-IBI system and the water quality factors, and the cumulative percentage of the dry period were higher than those in the wet period. In conclusion, the P-IBI exhibits temporal variation between hydrological periods, and the stability of the P-IBI evaluation system during the dry season is significantly better than that during the wet season.

AB  - The Venice Lagoon has been the focus of many environmental studies due to its heavy contaminant load derived from a variety of sources, including industrial activity, oil tanker traffic, and waste runoff from the mainland. In recent years, there has been increasing concern about water quality in the urban areas of Venice related to the discharge of untreated sewage directly into canals, adding to the pollutant load already existing in these areas. One way of gauging the impact of these chemicals is monitoring the local fauna. In the search for good indicators of water quality in the Venice urban area, two physiological indices for mussels-survival in air and condition index-have been evaluated. In 2002, a seasonal study was undertaken; mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected in three sites located in the canals of the city and a clean reference site. At the same time, two transplantation experiments were performed, deploying farmed mussels for 1,2, 4, and 12 weeks in the historic centre of Venice and also at a reference site. Data from survival in air test and the condition index of native and transplanted mussels are reported. The results suggest an impact of the complex mixture of pollutants on mussel health status. Both native mussels and those transplanted to the urban area showed reduced survivability in air and decreased condition index values, indicating a less healthy status in animals from the canals of the city. Data are discussed in relation to pollutant bioaccurnulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We evaluated the biological water quality in relation to chemicals discharged through sewage outfall during both dry and rainy season. The lowland area of the Cuenca River basin in the southern Andes of Ecuador, including the city of Cuenca, constituted the study area. To perform an integrated water quality assessment, data were collected of macroinvertebrates, physicochemical conditions and morphological characteristics in 43 sites in the Cuenca River and its tributaries. The Andean Biotic Index (ABI) and the Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted to Colombia (BMWP-Col) were used to evaluate the biological water quality. Both biological indexes were higher upstream than downstream from the city. Moreover, these indexes indicated better conditions during the rainy season than in the dry season, based on the presence of more sensitive families. The biological indexes related more to the oxygen saturation than to the five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), nutrients and chloride concentrations. The relationship between BOD5 and nutrient concentrations with the variation of both biological indexes was clearer in the dry season than in the rainy season. However, in some sites, these indexes were influenced more by morphological aspects than by pollutants. Both biological indexes showed similar patterns along the rivers, generally the BMWP-Col scored higher than the ABI index. The latter index was shown to be more suitable for the high Andes region. These results could be used to support the implementation of river restoration actions, such as determining priorities for splitting sewer and precipitation water transport systems and needs for improved wastewater treatment facilities in specific locations.

AB  - Lightning-caused forest fires can cause serious damage to the social economy and public property and even threaten human life. Therefore, lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment is very important for forest management agency, because the risk rating assessment results could provide important information to prevent fires and allocate extinguishing resources. The existing forest fire risk rating assessment methods are more difficult for the area with sparse meteorological stations, imperfect lightning monitoring systems and complex terrain conditions. Based on remote sensing data and case-based reasoning principle, this paper proposed a method to overcome the limitations of existing forest fire risk rating assessment methods. The proposed method uses three dynamic and two static indexes to characterize the potential fire environment. The dynamic indexes are temperature condition index, vegetation condition index and water condition index. The static indexes are terrain fluctuation and LIS/OTD lightning density. In DaXingAn Mountains of China, the fire risk rating spatial distribution maps with 8-day cycle before the occurrences of historical lightning-caused fires were produced by using the lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment method during 2000-2006 in this paper. The results showed that most of the historical lightning-caused fires occurred in the region with high fire risk rating, and the spatial-temporal distribution changes of the lightning-caused fire risk rating followed the same trend as the changes in the number of lightning-caused fires. Therefore, the lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment method proposed in this paper could assess the fire risk rating effectively, and this method could also provide a reference for other countries and regions with sparse meteorological stations and imperfect lightning monitoring systems.

AB  - Wedge clam, Donax scortum occurrence was studied from February 2009 to January 2010 in Padukere sandy beach, Karnataka (India). The following biological parameters were measured in 2367 individuals of the wedge clam, Donax scortum: length, breadth, width, total weight, shell weight, wet meat weight, dry meat weight and number of clams. The calculated linear equation of length-breadth and length-width relationships were B = 3.5968 + 0.5421L and W = 0.8191 + 0.4345L respectively. The length-total weight, length-wet meat weight, length-dry meat weight and length-shell weight relationships were 0.0001414L(3.0224), W = 0.0000037L(3.5204), W = 0.0000011L(3.4513) and 0.0000852L(2.9912) respectively. The values of correlation coefficient for different shell dimensional relationships were very close to unity. It was clear from the study that the most ideal period for clam harvest was April, June and December, especially when condition index was maximum. Length showed a strong correlation with silt and clay. Dry meat weight was negatively correlated with air temperature. Shell weight showed positive correlation with length, breadth, width and dry meat weight, and abiotic parameters, silt and clay. Condition index was positively correlated with electrical conductivity, whereas it was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. It showed a strong positive correlation with salinity. Seasonal fluctuation of condition index in D. scortum was probably related to reproductive activity. The harvesting of wedge clam could be carried out considering the maximum sustainable yield without over-exploitation

AB  - Wetlands are vital natural resources thereby providing ecological and socio-economic benefits to the people. However, anthropogenic activities have seriously changed the ecological conditions of wetlands worldwide, especially in developing nations like Ethiopia. Predominantly, the absence of biomonitoring tool greatly hampers the protection and management of wetlands. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a plant-based index of biological integrity for facilitating the management of wetlands. Accordingly, 122 plant species belonging to 37 families were collected and identified from forested, urban and agricultural wetland types and included in the analysis of the plant metrics. Initially, we reviewed and screened 35 potential metrics. Then, we selected four core metrics (% cover of native species, sensitive plant species richness, tolerant plant species richness and% of shrub species richness) using the decrease or increase responses to human disturbances, Mann-Whitney U test and redundant metric test. A trisect quartile range system using box plots of the reference or impaired sites of wetlands was established to provide values for each core metrics. Then after, we combined the core metrics to develop the plant based index of biological integrity. Finally, we validated the index by comparing the index response to different wetland types. Additionally, the index was validated based on the measured environmental variables that characterize the human disturbance gradient of wetlands. We found that the plant-based index is robust to discriminate the reference wetlands from impaired wetlands and can also be used as an effective tool for evaluating the long term natural wetland conditions of the Eastern African wetlands in the future.

AB  - The Caspian seal (Pusa caspica) from Phocidae family is the only living mammal that exclusively inhabits the landlocked Caspian Sea. This study was first of its kind conducted on the Caspian seals in the southeastern region of the Caspian Sea from 2010 to 2016. Seasonal observations, gender, maturity, biometric parameters and condition index of each observed Caspian seal were studied. Totally 74 live Caspian seals including 42 males and 32 females were observed in this study. The Caspian seals observed in autumn were significantly greater in number than in the other seasons (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the number of the males and females (p>0.05), however, the number of juvenile seals were significantly more than adults (p<0.05). This study revealed no significant difference in each biometric parameter and condition index in different seasons, and also between female and male Caspian seals (p>0.05). A significant difference was observed between adult and juvenile seals in biometric parameters (p<0.05), however condition index was not significantly different (p>0.05). Since Caspian seals are listed as endangered species in the IUCN Red List, further research is required to understand the status of this population and conserve the only mammals of the Caspian Sea.

AB  - Environmental assessment of agricultural production systems is an increasing concern within the international community. When evaluation involves biodiversity indicators, as richness or diversity in certain taxa or their roles in ecosystems, the participation of specialists is required to identify, classify and interpret diversity at the level of species, communities and ecosystems. Due to costs and time demand, this can be an important obstacle when a widespread use of these assessments is needed to contribute to policy making and evaluation, field management decision-making or implementation of a specific technology. We developed a new index that combines different environmental characteristics which can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with a basic training, can be implemented quickly and each index component is directly associated with key aspects for the assessment of ecosystem capacity to sustain wildlife and ecosystem services. The Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) evaluates the status of a specific ecosystem under agricultural use, referred to an optimal condition that must be established for the ecoregion. Its application involves a qualitative and quantitative visual evaluation considering four components: vegetation structure, plant species, soil and riparian areas. Each component is valued on a 0-5 scale, where 5 is the best possible condition. EII is a simple and robust tool for evaluating and monitoring integrity of agroecosystems and the primary validation demonstrates good correlation with other environmental variables such as wildlife diversity and soil organic carbon.

AB  - Monthly variability of Cd, Hg, Zn, Mn and Al concentrations in mussels (Mytilus californianus) soft tissue and brown seaweed (Macrocystis pyrifera) was studied at a pristine rocky shore off San Quintin Bay, Baja California, Mexico. The results were related to climatic and hydrographic conditions and to the physiological state of the mussels (condition index) by correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). A "normalization" to account for the variability induced by the physiological state of the mussel was performed. The PCA was performed in two ways to relate the environmental variables and the condition index to: (1) the metal concentrations in mussels, and (2) the "normalized" mussel concentrations. The association of the variability of Cd with the upwelling season was revealed in both PCAs. The temporal variability of this metal in mussels was highly correlated to that in seaweed, suggesting that the dissolved phase determined the variability of Cd in mussels. However, for Hg, Zn, Mn and Al the results from both PCAs were different. The first PCA showed the relationship of these metals to pluvial precipitation and to the condition index. The PCA for the normalized mussel concentrations showed that, after eliminating the effect of the condition index, only Al was related to pluvial precipitation. Manganese, and to a less degree Zn, were related to these metals in seaweed. Because zinc is an essential element in mussels, some regulation of their internal concentrations is likely. Mercury was not detected in seaweed, but because of its reactive nature, it is not expected that the dissolved fraction could be a significant pathway; therefore, it can be concluded that its temporal variability was determined by the variability in the condition index only.

AB  - Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) are widespread on the South Georgia shelf, Antarctica, and have been fished commercially since the early 1970s. They are known to feed predominantly on krill. An index of condition which uses the ratio of the measured total mass to the estimated mass is shown to provide a good indicator of local krill density. The index is likely to be little affected by the reproductive cycle unless there is high krill availability during the months around the spawning time, and even then the effect is much less than the highest observed values, The condition index responds rapidly to changes in krill density and therefore can provide indications of short-term variations in krill availability. Condition index provides a useful proxy for krill density and is likely to be of considerable value in interpreting the results from ecosystem assessments such as that in progress under the auspices of CCAMLR.

AB  - During recent decades, remarkable long-term changes have taken place in many coastal ecosystems of north-west European shelf seas. These changes have been described in many papers, but an overall quantification is lacking. An ecological development index (EDI) is proposed here, consisting of two parts - a statistical description of the state of the ecosystem and a metric in a multi-dimensional space of statistical descriptors of states for quantitatively characterizing the change of any number of state variables by only one characteristic number. The concept of the EDI is generally applicable by yielding a measure of the distance between system states. Indices are comparable between different ecosystems and within different subspaces of the ecosystem's state space, provided the same characterization is used. The concept is applied to the 32-year time series (1962-1993) of measurements of nine physical (sea-surface temperature, salinity), chemical (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, silicate), and biological (biomass of diatoms and flagellates) state variables at Helgoland. The analysis of consecutive 5-year quantiles of monthly mean values, which are used as statistical descriptors, elucidates the long-term perturbations of the coastal marine system in the German Bight. It is shown that the states of the ecosystem in the 1970s and 1980s have abandoned the region of the 1960s, but are possibly returning in the 1990s to the situation of the 1970s.

AB  - The coast of Goa receives anthropogenic stress through its major rivers, which carry mining wastes, including iron and manganese ores from upstream mining sites, and petroleum hydrocarbons from shipping activities. These contaminants show seasonal variation in concentration and may be bioaccumulated by fauna inhabiting these waters. These fauna, including the bivalve molluscs, are particularly at risk due to these insults. In the present study, the use of the bacicwater clam, Meretrix casta (Chemnitz), as a bioindicator species was evaluated, comparing two sites (Vasco and Palolem) on the Goan coast. DNA damage was assessed in the gill cells using the micronucleus and comet assays; physiological condition was determined from the condition index. These values were tested for correlations with the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons and trace metals in the whole soft tissues and with the physico-chemical parameters of water from these sites. Specimens collected from Vasco showed high incidence of micronuclei and % tail DNA and a low condition index ratio compared to those from Palolem, which correlates with the higher level of pollutants in the bivalves the former site. We believe that M. costa is a suitable species for biomonitoring studies of this type.

AB  - An ecosystem health index methodology (EHIM) was developed for assessing lake ecosystem health. A scale from 0 to 100 was chosen as a basis for ranking where an ecosystem health index (EHI) of zero indicates the worst possible health state and one of 100 the best possible health state. There are five necessary steps in the EHIM: (1) to select basic and additional indicators; (2) to calculate sub-EHIs for all selected indicators; (3) to determine weighting factors for all selected indicators; (4) to calculate a synthetic EHI using the sub-EHIs and weighting factors for all selected indicators; (5) to assess ecosystem health based on synthetic EHI values. The EHIM was successfully applied to a series of Italian lakes for assessment and comparison purposes. Phytoplankton biomass (BA) was selected to serve as a basic indicator, while zooplankton biomass (BZ), the ratio of BZ to BA (BZ/BA), and exergy and structural exergy were used as additional indicators. The results suggest that the EHIM is a valuable relatively uncomplicated methodology with simple principles, ease of calculation, reliable and intuitive results. As a practical planning tool, it can be widely used for the quantitative assessment and comparison of ecosystem health states for a single lake, a series of different lakes, or more complicated lake systems.

AB  - We describe the development of a bird integrity index (BII) that uses bird assemblage information to assess human impacts on 13 stream reaches in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We used bird survey data to test 62 candidate metrics representing aspects of bird taxonomic richness, tolerance or intolerance to human disturbance, dietary preferences, foraging techniques, and nesting strategies that were affected positively or negatively by human activities. We evaluated the metric responsiveness by plotting each one against a measure of site disturbance that included aspects of land use/land cover, road density, riparian cover, and stream channel and substrate conditions. In addition, we eliminated imprecise and highly correlated (redundant) metrics, leaving 13 metrics for the final index, Individual metric scores ranged continuously from 0 to 10, and index scores were weighted to range from 0 to 100. Scores were calibrated using historical species information to set expectations for the number of species expected under minimally disturbed conditions. Site scores varied from 82 for the least disturbed stream reach to 8.5 for an urban site. We compared the bird integrity index site scores with the performance of other measures of biotic response developed during this study: a fish index of biointegrity (1131) and two benthic macro invertebrate metrics, The three assemblages agreed on the general level of disturbance; however, individual sites scored differently depending on specific indicator response to in-stream or riparian conditions, The bird integrity index appears to be a useful management and monitoring tool for assessing riparian integrity and communicating the results to the public. Used together with aquatic indicator response and watershed data, bird assemblage information contributes to a more complete picture of stream condition.

AB  - Variation among four commonly used health indices was examined in the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus. The four indices were liver glycogen content (LGC), liver-somatic index (LSI), condition index (K) and RNA-DNA ratio. Fish were collected from five coastal locations in southeastern Connecticut. Fish health, as determined by these four indices, varied considerably among estuaries and between sexes. The relationship between each index and specimen length was significantly different among estuaries for either sex. When regressed against length, the slopes for the indices ranged from positive to negative. For each index, significant differences existed among some of the length-centered means at each estuary for either sex. Estuary rank for one index did not necessarily correlate with the estuary rank for another index. The significance of this variability and its impact on the use of the indices as bioindicators of environmental perturbation is discussed.

Another objective was to estimate contribution of environmental index (($) over bar X(-j)-($) over bar X(-), where ($) over bar X(-j) is mean of all genotypes in the jth environment and ($) over bar X(-) is mean of all genotypes across all environments), minimum temperature, maximum temperature, preseason rainfall, rainfall during the growing season, and relative humidity to GE interaction by determining heterogeneity (nonadditivity) attributable to each of these environmental factors. In five of eight trials, heterogeneity due to environmental index was significant. Heterogeneity due to the other environmental factors was not significant in any trial. A comparison of sigma(i)(2) (stability-variance statistic derived from total GE interaction) and s(i)(2) (stability-variance statistic derived from residual GE interaction following removal of heterogeneity due to a covariate) helped identify genotypes that performed stably or unstably because of a linear effect of environmental index. In three of the five trials showing significant heterogeneity due to environmental index, the YSi statistic selected a reduced number of unstable genotypes as compared with selection based solely on yield. However, the circumstances or conditions under which YSi and solely yield-based method select the same or different genotypes are not fully understood.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) (Lenoir & Coste 1996) for the estimation of water quality in the central section of the Pilica River, located in central Poland in AdA(0) province. The BDI has never been used before to monitor Polish surface waters. An analysis of the correlations between the values of the BDI and selected physico-chemical parameters was performed, as was an assessment of water quality using the BDI. On the basis of value ranges proposed by Descy and Ector (1996), a good ecological status in the Pilica River was obtained, but this did not correspond with the results achieved from the physico-chemical analysis. This study proposes new value ranges for the BDI. With these new values, the ecological state of the Pilica River changed from good to moderate, which corresponded with the physico-chemical analysis of the water. The new, proposed value ranges for the BDI assess more precisely the quality of water in lowland Polish rivers.

AB  - The natural chemical compounds radicicol, polygodial and ubiquinone-10 (Q10) have previously been identified as inhibitors of metamorphosis in ascidian larvae. Accordingly, they have potential as a specific remedy for the costly problem of fouling ascidians in bivalve aquaculture. In this study, these compounds were screened for their effects on the physiological health of an aquaculture species, the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus Gmelin, at or above the 99% effective dose (IC99) in ascidians. Three physiological biomarkers of mussel health were screened: growth (increases in shell height and wet weight), condition (condition index) and mitochondrial respirational function (Complex I-mediated respiration, Complex II-mediated respiration, maximum uncoupled respiration, leak respiration, respiratory control ratios and phosphorylation system control ratios). While polygodial and Q10 had no effect on mussel growth or the condition index, radicicol retarded growth and decreased the condition index. Mitochondrial respirational function was unaffected by radicicol and polygodial. Conversely, Q10 enhanced Complex I-mediated respiration, highlighting the fundamental role of this compound in the electron transport system. The present study suggests that polygodial and Q10 do not negatively affect the physiological health of P. canaliculus at the IC99 in ascidians, while radicicol is toxic. Moreover, Q10 is of benefit in biomedical settings as a cellular antioxidant and therefore may also benefit P. canaliculus. Accordingly, polygodial and Q10 should be progressed to the next stage of testing where possible negative effects on bivalves will be further explored, followed by development of application techniques and testing in a laboratory and aquaculture setting.

AB  - The magnitude and urgency of the biodiversity crisis is widely recognized within scientific and political organizations. However, a lack of integrated measures for biodiversity has greatly constrained the national and international response to the biodiversity crisis. Thus, integrated biodiversity indexes will greatly facilitate information transfer from science toward other areas of human society. The Nature Index framework samples scientific information on biodiversity from a variety of sources, synthesizes this information, and then transmits it in a simplified form to environmental managers, policymakers, and the public. The Nature Index optimizes information use by incorporating expert judgment, monitoring-based estimates, and model-based estimates. The index relies on a network of scientific experts, each of whom is responsible for one or more biodiversity indicators. The resulting set of indicators is supposed to represent the best available knowledge on the state of biodiversity and ecosystems in any given area. The value of each indicator is scaled relative to a reference state, i.e., a predicted value assessed by each expert for a hypothetical undisturbed or sustainably managed ecosystem. Scaled indicator values can be aggregated or disaggregated over different axes representing spatiotemporal dimensions or thematic groups. A range of scaling models can be applied to allow for different ways of interpreting the reference states, e.g., optimal situations or minimum sustainable levels. Statistical testing for differences in space or time can be implemented using Monte-Carlo simulations. This study presents the Nature Index framework and details its implementation in Norway. The results suggest that the framework is a functional, efficient, and pragmatic approach for gathering and synthesizing scientific knowledge on the state of biodiversity in any marine or terrestrial ecosystem and has general applicability worldwide.

AB  - Pond ecosystem not only provides essential agricultural irrigation and washing water, but also stores rainwater in rainy seasons. However, the pollution status of pond system around Poyang Lake was seldom studied. Here, we investigated the water and sediment chemical characteristics, phytoplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates, as well as habitat conditions of 23 rural ponds around Poyang Lake. Results showed that water quality of 91.3% rural ponds was inferior V (National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard of China) with the main pollutants of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In rural ponds, fifty-nine species of phytoplankton and nineteen benthic macroinvertebrates were identified, Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta were the dominant phytoplankton groups, and oligochaetes and aquatic insects were the most dominant taxa among all benthic macroinvertebrates. And an integrated evaluation system based on chemical, biological and physical index was set up to assess the pollution status of rural ponds. According to the composite integrity index, 2 rural ponds (8.70%) were classified as Very poor, 9 rural ponds (39.13%) were classified as Poor, 9 rural ponds (39.13%) were classified as Fair, and 3 rural ponds (13.04%) were classified as Good. And the composite integrity index in 4 counties followed the sequence of Xingzi County (0.598, Fair) > Jinxian County (0.425, Fair) > Xinjian County (0.379, Poor) > Nanchang County (0.335, Poor). Therefore, measures should be taken for improving the water quality, habitat conditions and biotic community of rural ponds, especially for the severely polluted rural ponds in Xinjian and Nanchang County.

AB  - The specific adaptation of 15 rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) clones was assessed by analyzing yield during a normal year (1997-98) and a year (1998-99) in which the yield was exceptional. Differences in yield in response to changes in weather conditions over the years were evident with clones RRII 203, RRIM 703, PB 5/51 and PB 235 which all exhibited a negative trend with increasing wind velocity during 1997-98, these clones also exhibited a negative correlation with minimum temperature during 1998-99. The prominent yield differences across the years made selection based on both yield and stability inevitable through computing weather variables and environmental index as covariant. To determine the contribution of variable(s) to genotype-environment (GE) interactions, the GE interaction was partitioned into heterogeneity and residual GE interaction. Heterogeneity only for environmental index was highly significant (p = 0.01), meaning that stability or instability of clones was due to a linear effect of the environmental index. The non-significant values of heterogeneity for the weather variables revealed that none of these factors individually was sufficient to explain heterogeneity. A QBASIC computer program called STABLE was used to select simultaneously for yield and stability. Clones PB 235, RRII 118, RRII 203, RRIM 703 and RRIM 600 were stable over the years investigated.

AB  - Modeling energy content and gain of individuals is of increasing importance in ecosystem modeling, especially in aquaculture and fisheries. Traditional models for estimating the content and gain are either imprecise or expensive, in part because of intensive data requirements. Here we show how routine biometric data (length and wet weight or condition index) can be used to estimate total energy content of fish. Starting with theoretical partitioning between structure and reserves, we create a model to relate energy to the Fulton's condition index. We then use data from cultured sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) to show that the model based on structure should be used to calculate energy content from biometric data. Validation using independent data shows remarkable ability of the model to predict energy content (R-2 >0.99), while comparison with previously used models demonstrates marked differences in predictions when fish condition is variable. Unlike traditional methods, our model predicts different energy content and gain (or loss) for small fat and large thin fish of equal weight, and can therefore give considerable additional value to biometric data commonly collected in aquaculture, fisheries, and related citizen science programs.

AB  - This paper constructs quarterly financial conditions indexes (FCIs) for eight Asian economiesnamely, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailandusing a common factor methodology based on Hatzius etal. (2010). A wide array of financial data is included in the indexes based on identified monetary transmission channels in the literature. Bank-related indicators, various measures of financial stress and risk, and credit surveys, where available, are incorporated to fully reflect the state of the financing environment. The FCIs for Asia successfully capture important episodes in each economy's financial history, but only the indexes of financially advanced economies Japan and Singapore have sufficient forecasting power to predict output growth and inflation. High co-movement of Asian FCIs suggests highly similar monetary policies in the region that are strongly linked with monetary policy in the United States.

AB  - Measurement of performances in asset management is an enabling factor to define an effective strategy. The scope of this research concerns the investigation on the Facility Condition Index (FCI): one of the most common metrics related to the built environment. The research aims at providing a critical review concerning the FCI and its use. The research methodology has been developed according to three steps: bibliographic research, bibliometric analysis and critical review. Most of the sources agree that FCI provides a reliable economic measurement of maintenance needs, though it must be tied to a strong condition assessment methodology. Moreover, different methodologies for computation of the deferred maintenance and the current replacement value can be found in literature and many researchers emphasised the limits of FCI when dealing with components characterised by a considerable difference in replacement costs. In conclusion, FCI is included in the wider framework of asset management business process.

AB  - The development and use of indicators and indices is increasingly necessary to understand and properly size matters connected with the living conditions of the population at different levels. In Argentina, however, there is delay in the production of environmental indices in relation to others associated with social and economic variables. To fill this gap this paper proposes the development of an Environmental Quality Index (EQI) composed of 23 variables grouped into three indicators: (1) nature-based recreational resources; (2) socially constructed recreational resources; and (3) environmental problems. The index is applied to the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (Argentina) at a municipal level. The mapping of the environmental contrasts and spatial inequities of this megalopolis indicates the utility of the index which can also be used to formulate appropriate policies for environmental planning.

AB  - An ecosystem is a complex composition of physical, chemical and biological components. This complex system remains in a healthy state if the system can maintain the ecological equilibrium among its components. Anthropogenic disturbances are the prime stressors that affect this equilibrium through creating fragmentation, ecosystem sensitivity, loosening landscape connectivity and disrupting ecological integrity. As different types of ecosystem are interconnected, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluating criteria is needed for measuring its integrity at regional level for conservation planning. A Regional Index of Ecological Integrity can be a suitable approach for sustainable management of regional ecosystem. Therefore, this paper presents (i) the characteristics of ecological integrity, (ii) the spatial processes induced by anthropogenic stressors and (iii) an approach to develop a composite Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI). The prime objective is to establish a thought and a way to develop a composite index of ecological integrity at the regional level. Here, we demonstrate different compositional, structural and functional indicators/indices related to fragmentation, representativeness of protected area, ecosystem sensitivity, and landscape connectivity for the development of a Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI).

AB  - The presence of riparian vegetation provides microclimatic regulation of stream conditions [e.g. luminosity (lux), air temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%)], which varies naturally throughout the day. These variables explain the diurnal behaviour patterns of ectotherms such as Odonata in natural areas. However, human land uses (e.g. pastures) modify the abiotic conditions of riparian environments, favouring the presence of disturbance-tolerant species. In this context, we assess relationships between riparian land use (control streams-natural areas and pasture), abiotic conditions habitat integrity index (in control and pastures streams), (air temperature, luminosity and humidity in control streams), and Odonata diversity (between pasture and control streams and throughout the time of day) in Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) streams. First, the control streams had higher habitat integrity index than pasture. Higher abundance and difference in composition of Odonata species were observed in streams surrounded by pasture relative to natural areas. The conversion of natural areas to pasture near streams was also accompanied by an increase in overall body size of Odonata species. Odonata species richness and abundance in natural areas varied throughout the day, but peaked around 12:00h, coinciding with changes in air temperature and luminosity. Our study highlights that changes in the physical characteristics of streams through conversion of natural habitats to pasture will change environmental conditions and act as a filter on the distribution and persistence of Odonata species in Cerrado streams.

AB  - Inter-observer variability in ecological surveying can reduce the robustness and reliability of measures used to inform habitat management. Grassland management is important across southern Africa. The Veld Condition Index (VCI) is a technique that combines field data on the relative abundance of grasses identified during a standardised survey with knowledge of how different grass species respond to grazing. This allows calculation of an Ecological Condition Index (ECI) for a particular site. The ECI value is related to threshold values to indicate grazing pressure. Here, for the first time, the effects of inter-observer variation in trained surveyors on condition assessment and resultant management recommendations are examined. There was substantial and statistically significant inter-observer variation in ECI values, driven primarily by differences in the number of times an observer identified grasses within the sample transect as being one of the species listed in the "Decreaser" category of the standardised protocol (i.e. species that decrease with grazing). Variation was random with respect to observers rather than being due to systematic (and thus predicable and potentially correctable) differences between observers. In 44% of sites, inter-observer variation resulted in important differences in assessment of grassland condition because the assessment spanned outcome threshold categories. In such cases, this could result in unnecessary or detrimental management being recommended by some observers including inappropriate burning, needlessly translocating or culling herbivores, or failing to align herbivore populations to the carrying capacity with negative effects on both grazers and veld. We recommend that a cautious approach be taken in using VCI/ECI to inform management and that identification training be focused on species in the Decreaser ecological category that drive inter-individual variation in overall ECI.

AB  - Urban environmental quality indices can provide policy makers and the public with valuable information. However, common assessment tools have several shortcomings: most indices do leave out some important components of the state of urban environmental quality; they use a relative assessment in which urban environmental performance is evaluated relative to other cities, not against established environmental benchmarks; and only a few assessment tools compare urban performance to environmental quality standards. This paper presents a new multi component urban performance (EMCUP) index aiming to tackle those shortcomings. It analyses the overall state of urban environmental quality by using a list of indicators to evaluate key urban environmental quality topics such as air, water, open space, sanitation and solid waste. It presents an absolute score calculated in relation to both the standard and desired optimum levels. The use of the index is demonstrated by three Israeli cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The mussel Perna perna was used to monitor and assess areas suspected of oil contamination by transplanting animals from unimpacted to impacted sites and vice versa. The deployment lasted for three months during which total PAH were measured in seawater samples collected every 15 days. PAH concentrations were determined in mussel tissue monthly. The lysosomal neutral red assay and the condition index were used as biomarkers of the adverse biological effects. The PAH concentration in mussels at unimpacted sites, prior to deployment was ca. 100 mu g kg(-1) but increased to 300 mu g, kg(-1) after three months at the contaminated site. Mussels transplanted to the uncontaminated site showed a decrease from 380 to 80 mu g kg(-1). Significant changes in lysosomal stability occurred within one month of the beginning of the transposition; in contrast condition indexes were not correlated with the observed changes in PAH concentration.

AB  - An ecosystem is a complex system in which biotic and abiotic factors interact and influence each other both directly and indirectly. Each of these factors has to comply with a specific function in the different processes that occur inside the ecosystem, whether transporting or transforming energy or both. When anthropogenic emissions are produced, part of the useful energy of the ecosystem is used to assimilate or absorb those emissions, and the energy spent, loses its function and becomes lost work in accordance with the Gouy-Stodola theorem. Thus, the work that an ecosystem can carry out varies as a function of the lost work produced by anthropogenic sources. The permanency or loss of the ecosystem depends on how many irreversibilities it can support. The second law of thermodynamics through a systematic use of the exergy and lost work is the basis of this paper where a general environmental impact index, based on exergy, is proposed. For the purpose of this work, the ecosystem is divided in subsystems-water, soil, atmosphere, organisms and society-all of them inter-related. The ideal work variation can be obtained from each subsystem within the selected ecosystem, and a global index can be determined by adding the partial lost work of each subsystem. This global index is then used to determine the trend followed by the ecosystem from its pristine, original or environmental line base state. This environmental impact index applicability is presented for a simple combustion example.

AB  - In Irbid City, Jordan, soil tests and pavement evaluations have shown that expansion of clay subgrade is a predominant problem, especially in the absence of effective drainage systems, Forty-one pavement sections from different parts of Irbid City were examined and tested.
   The Pavement Condition Index (PCI), as described by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the pavement evaluation system PAVER, was utilized in this study. This objective evaluation procedure depends on measuring the severity and density of every single distress observed, Physical and engineering properties were obtained from laboratory testing for the subgrade soil at each pavement section, including: Atterberg Limits, compaction characteristics, Field Density, Natural Water Content, Free Swell, and Unconfined Compressive Strength.
   The effect of soil properties on pavement conditions were investigated and the soil parameters that affect pavement deterioration were identified. Empirical regression models that correlate the loss in Pavement Condition Index (PCI) to soil properties were developed.

AB  - This paper provides a characterization of meaningful environmental indices. Based on the interpretation of environmental indices as representations of a preference ordering on multi-dimensional environmental states, a meaningful index is defined as an index whose underlying preference ordering is independent of admissible transformations of the variables which describe environmental states. Admissible types of transformation are classified into categories of measurability and comparability, and these categories determine which indices are meaningful. One major finding is that indices in the form of an arithmetic mean are mostly not meaningful because the variables do not satisfy the required property of interval-scale unit comparability. For environmental variables in the non-negative domain whose observations are strictly positive and whose admissible transformations are mere expansions meaningful indices take the form of a geometric mean.

AB  - Mytilus galloprovincialis is an ecosystem engineer that provides habitat and generates environmental heterogeneity, increasing local biodiversity. Moreover, it is an economically important species representing 14% of the global production of marine bivalves. Natural drivers and the increase of anthropogenic pressures, such as sediment stress, influence its populations on rocky shores. The objective of this study was to explore the spatial-temporal patterns of different M. galloprovincialis attributes along the north of Portugal. For that purpose, six rocky shores were selected and sampled six times along the year 2019. The percentage of cover, density, spat density, condition index, clump thickness, size classes and clump sediment content were considered. Results showed the lack of seasonality in M. galloprovincialis along the north coast of Portugal. However, density, spat stage, clump thickness, condition index and size classes showed some variability among dates and shores. The percentage cover and sediment content only significantly differed among shores. Our results indicated an absence of seasonality for all the studied variables, probably because temperature was always within the optimum range for this species and the abundance of food supply in the study area independently of the season. The accumulated sediment on mussel clumps did not show any temporal variability with only significant differences among shores. The accumulated sediment was composed mainly by medium and coarse sand and it was correlated with mussel average size, condition index, but especially with the mussel clump thickness.

AB  - The environmental impact assessment has gained a very important role in the decision making regarding different projects, investments, actions and proposals. The environmental impact assessment is a systematic process which deals with the consequences of the future developments in advance. The methodology of the assessment includes several techniques. The quantitative methods focus on the evaluation of the impacts by assigning importance values to the environmental parameters and quality scores. The method devised by Robu was further developed and protocol for the determination of the complex environment state index was devised. This method is adapted for a car part manufacturing company and conclusions are made on the environmental impacts of the company.
   The objective of the paper is to test this method on a manufacturing facility in Hungary in light of the legal stipulations and limit values to support the more efficient operation of the environmental management system of the company with identification of the significant environmental impacts.

AB  - Environmental problems caused by mines have been increasing. As one of the most serious types of mining damage caused to the eco-environment, open pits have been the focus of monitoring and management. Previous studies have obtained effective results when evaluating the ecological quality of a mining area by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). However, the calculation of RSEI does not consider that the ecological environmental impact is limited under natural conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved RSEI based on a moving window model, namely the moving window-based remote sensing ecological index (MW-RSEI). This improved index is more in agreement with the First Law of Geography than RSEI. This study uses Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS images to extract MW-RSEI information of a case area in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, central China, in 2009 and 2018. The results revealed that the average value of MW-RSEI declined from 0.668 to 0.611 from 2009 to 2018, and the main drivers of the deterioration of the eco-environment were land use/cover (LUCC) changes, most of which were derived from urban expansion and mining. The serious impact of open pits on the eco-environment in mining areas is mainly due to their low vegetation cover; therefore, some effectively managed open pits can have a positive impact on the mining environment. The use of MW-RSEI provides valuable information on the eco-environment surrounding the open pit, which can be used for the rapid and effective monitoring of the eco-environment in mining areas.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination and water quality may alter reproductive capacity of oysters in highly urbanized, eutrophic ecosystems. This study assessed physiological biomarkers and heavy metal body burdens in adult oysters, Crassostrea virginica, placed at a highly urban and reference site. Condition index and Vitellogenin-like proteins were significantly different between sites, but protein concentration and activity of the electron transport system were not. Accumulation of Cd and Hg occurred at both sites, and Cd body burden was greater at the urban site. There was a negative relationship between condition index and Cd body burden at the urban site, while no relationship was found between physiological biomarkers and metal burden at the reference site. The results suggest that oyster condition and reproductive potential may be negatively influenced by the biotic and abiotic factors typically found within urban, eutrophic ecosystems.

AB  - River red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) is the dominant floodplain tree of the River Murray in south-eastern Australia. Drought and over-allocation of water have seen tree condition decline and environmental water is being used to aid recovery. An eight-variable visual assessment method is widely used to assess river red gum condition. These variables have been combined into a single aggregated index, the Red gum Condition Index (RCI), which comprises the Crown Condition sub-index (CCsi), which contributes 60% of the final score and assesses the amount of foliage in the tree crown; and the Secondary Variable sub-index (SVsi) which contributes 40% of the final score and aggregates measures of new tip growth, epicormic growth, reproduction, leaf die-off, mistletoe and bark condition. Relationships between variables define six condition categories. The R software package RCI calculates the RCI and provides quantitative and graphical outputs. Applied to two sites in South Australia, the RCI detected changes in tree condition attributable to environmental watering. As a responsive index with transparent categories the RCI can measure the current condition of river red gum stands and assess their watering needs. The RCI approach is readily transferrable to other tree species.

AB  - Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential in the food industry's decision-making process, where vegetation condition index (VCI) and thermal condition index (TCI) coupled with machine learning (ML) algorithms play crucial roles. The drawback, however, is that a one-fits-all prediction model is often employed over an entire region without considering subregional VCI and TCI's spatial variability resulting from environmental and climatic factors. Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models' output. This study proposes a framework that (i) employs higher-order spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and (ii), exploits a combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) and ML (i.e., PCA-ML combination) to deal with the two challenges in order to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy. The proposed framework consolidates common VCI/TCI spatial variability into their respective subregions, using Vietnam as an example. Compared to the one-fits-all approach, subregional rice yield forecasting models over Vietnam improved by an average level of 20% up to 60%. PCA-ML combination outperformed ML-only by an average of 18.5% up to 45%. The framework generates rice yield predictions 1 to 2 months ahead of the harvest with an average of 5% error, displaying its reliability.

AB  - A physiological approach has been proposed for studying the ecological consequences of diseases and parasitism in bivalve molluscs. We investigated effects of some naturally occurring non-lethal parasites and histological changes in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis L., on some commonly used bivalve condition indices, viz the oxygen:nitrogen ratio, the scope for growth and the body condition index. We found no correlation between these physiological condition indices, which implies that an individual can be classified as in 'good condition' according to e.g. the O:N ratio and the body condition index, while at the same time this mussel may have a low scope for growth indicating a stressed status. This is probably because the O:N ratio, the scope for growth and the body condition index integrate metabolic processes over different periods of time. No general deleterious effects on these condition indices could be detected either due to parasitic infestation or general histological changes. Hence, it was not possible to translate detrimental effects of histological conditions directly into energy equivalents.

AB  - In recent years the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has designed a new AVHRR-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) that has showed to be useful for drought detection and tracking. Validations showed that the VCI has excellent ability to detect drought and to measure time of its onset, intensity, duration, and impact on vegetation. The VCI provides accurate drought information not only for well-defined, prolonged, widespread, and intensive droughts, but also for very localized, short-term, and non well-defined droughts. In addition to the VCI, the AVHRR-based observations in thermal bands were used to develop the Temperature Condition Index (TCI). This index was used to determine temperature-related vegetation stress and also stress caused by an excessive wetness. This paper provides principles of these indices, describes data processing, and gives examples of VCI/TCI application in different ecological environments of the United States.

AB  - The vegetation portion of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI), an index of biological integrity, provided consistent and repeatable measures of condition at eighteen wetlands sampled in two consecutive growing seasons. The sample wetlands reflected a gradient of adjacent land use from non-impacted reference areas to wetlands imbedded within silviculture, cattle pasture and residential areas. Wetlands were described as herbaceous depression (n=6), forested depression (n =5) and forested strand or floodplain wetlands (n = 7), and represented different states of succession. Even though the wetlands were unique from one another and occurred across a large geographic area in Florida, the FWCI results calculated for all the wetlands were representative of adjacent land use impacts and not sensitive to natural variation. During the duration of this study, changes in weather from drought to tropical storm conditions, as well as management activities such as fire and herbivoiy, impacted wetlands. These effects were apparent in the change of species composition between sampling periods; 23-56% of species were different when resampled. Even though composition changed, the proportion of indicators remained consistent. The resulting condition scores suggested a one-to-one relationship between sampling periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI) covers 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Finland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. It is based on an international expert perception survey among 173 members of the International Panel on Arctic Environmental Responsibility (IPAER), whose input is processed using segmented string relative ranking (SSRR) methodology. Equinor, Total, Aker BP, ConocoPhillips, and BP are seen as the most environmentally responsible companies, whereas Dalmorneftegeophysica, Zarubejneft, ERIELL, First Ore-Mining Company, and Stroygaz Consulting are seen as the least environmentally responsible. Companies operating in Alaska have the highest average rank, whereas those operating in Russia have the lowest average rank. Larger companies tend to rank higher than smaller companies, state-controlled companies rank higher than privately controlled companies, and oil and gas companies higher than mining companies. The creation of AERI demonstrates that SSRR is a low-cost way to overcome the challenge of indexing environmental performance and contributing to environmental governance across disparate industrial sectors and states with divergent environmental standards and legal and political systems.

AB  - The environmental impact assessment has gained a very important role in decision making processes regarding different projects, investments, actions and proposals. The environmental impact assessment is a systematic process which deals with the consequences of the future developments in advance. The methodology of the assessment includes several techniques. The quantitative methods focus on the evaluation of the impacts by assigning importance values to the environmental parameters and quality scores. A quantitative method devised previously was further developed and a protocol for the determination of the complex environment state index was devised. This method is adapted for a disposal facility and conclusions are made on the environmental impacts of the company.
   The environmental impact assessment method devised was used for a disposal facility exhibiting high environmental risks. The objective of the paper is to test this method on a red mud disposal facility in Hungary in light of the legal stipulations and limit values to support the more efficient operation of the environmental management system of the company with identification of the significant environmental issues.

AB  - This study examines the ratio between length and body weight of 4191 specimens of a prevalent, tertiary tropic level Teleost fish, red mullet (Mullus barbatus) sampled using a standard survey protocol from more than 2500 km by the coasts of Turkey extending along the Mediterranean, Aegean, and the Black Sea. The study's primary aim was to investigate whether there is a correspondence between the body condition of the red mullet and the environmental status independently determined based on lower trophic levels of the water masses the species inhabits. Possible impacts of some intrinsic (fish length), extrinsic factors (bathymetry, abundance, and site), and numerical condition expressions on the outcomes were analyzed and eliminated. The results displayed a strong positive correlation between the fish condition index values and the ecosystem descriptor; the body condition of fish increased as ecological status improved from "bad" to "good/high". Based on this relationship and to facilitate the use of red mullet body condition as an ecosystem indicator, a set of target reference values addressing different ecological states have been proposed.

AB  - As one of the largest Yangtze river-connected lakes in China, Lake Poyang's heath status has increasingly become a cause for concern. This study evaluated Lake Poyang's heath status using a newly developed index (ecosystem health index for Lake Poyang, LP-EHI). The evaluation results revealed a declining tendency in the lake's health status from 2010 to 2014. The health conditions for Lake Poyang were "good", "fair", and "fair" in 2010, 2013, and 2014, respectively. The individual indices for water quality, nutrient conditions, and benthic macroinvertebrate showed a deteriorating trend from 2010 to 2014 mainly due to human activities, such as industrial pollution. Further analysis revealed that the health status of Lake Poyang was strongly affected by hydrological processes. This study demonstrated the potential of LP-EHI in evaluating the ecological health of Lake Poyang. Such a heath status evaluation can be applied to other lakes, and can benefit lake management, restoration, and conservation.

AB  - The Sea of Azov is the smallest and shallowest sea in the world with low salinity. Such properties determine its susceptibility to degradation due to anthropogenic activities. The Azovstal Iron & Steel Works in Mariupol (Ukraine) is one of the main sources of pollution of the Azov Sea. Adverse impact of the steelworks is associated primarily with the large amount of technological and cooling wastewater discharged into the sea. The paper presents the impact assessment results of wastewater discharge on the sea water quality and the ecological conditions in the discharge zone. The assessment was performed using local Ukrainian methodologies as well as applicable surface water quality standards. The comprehensive assessment was based on the three numerical integrated indicators of sea water quality: the Water Quality Index (WJW), the Water Pollution Index (WZW), the Integrated Ecological State Index (ZWSE), and the so called principle of aggregation. Based on the assessment results it was demonstrated that the wastewater discharge from the Azovstal Iron & Steel Works leads to significant increase in water pollution in the coastal zone which brings threat to the marine ecosystem and limits all types of water consumption.

AB  - Today, environmental impact associated with pollution treatment is a matter of great concern. A method is proposed for evaluating environmental risk associated with Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) applied to wastewater treatment. The method is based on the type of pollution (wastewater, solids, air or soil) and on materials and energy consumption. An Environmental Risk Index (E), constructed from numerical criteria provided, is presented for environmental comparison of processes and/or operations. The Operation Environmental Risk Index (E-Oi) for each of the unit operations involved in the process and the Aspects Environmental Risk Index (E-Aj) for process conditions were also estimated. Relative indexes were calculated to evaluate the risk of each operation (E/NOP) or aspect (E/NAS) involved in the process, and the percentage of the maximum achievable for each operation and aspect was found. A practical application of the method is presented for two AOPs: photo-Fenton and heterogeneous photocatalysis with suspended TiO2 in Solarbox. The results report the environmental risks associated with each process, so that AOPs tested and the operations involved with them can be compared.

AB  - Groundwater discharge is today recognized as an important pathway for freshwater, nutrients and other dissolved chemical substances to coastal systems. While its effect on supporting primary production in coastal ecosystems is increasingly recognized, its impact on growth of animals at higher trophic level (primary and secondary consumers) is less well documented. Here, we investigate the impact of groundwater discharge on the growth of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in a coastal lagoon. Growth rates and condition index (tissue weight/shell weight) of mussels growing at groundwater-exposed sites and at a control site in Salses-Leucate lagoon (France) were measured. The mussels in this lagoon produce circadian (daily rhythm) growth increments in their shell, as opposed to semi-diurnal increments in tidally influenced systems. Mussels from groundwater-influenced sites have higher growth rate and condition index compared to those from a control site. Importantly, growth rates from groundwater-influenced sites are amongst the highest rates reported for the Mediterranean region (41 +/- 9 mu m d(-1)). The higher growth rates at groundwater-influenced sites are likely a consequence of both the higher winter temperatures of lagoon water as a result of groundwater discharging with relatively constant temperatures, and the groundwater-driven nutrient supply that increase the food availability to support mussel growth. Overall, this study demonstrates that groundwater discharge to Mediterranean lagoons provides favorable environmental conditions for fast growth of mussels of high commercial-quality.

AB  - The Diatom Index for Australian Rivers (DIAR), originally developed at the genus level, was reformulated at the species level with data from diatom sampling of rivers in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. The resulting Diatom Species Index for Australian Rivers (DSIAR) was significantly correlated with the ARCE (Assessment of River Condition, Environment) index developed in the Australian National Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA), and with nine of the ARC(E)'s constituent indices and sub-indices, across 395 river reaches in south-eastern Australia. These correlations were generally stronger than those shown by the biological index that was used to assess river condition in the NLWRA, the ARCB (Assessment of River Condition, Biota) index based on macroinvertebrates and the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS). At a finer spatial scale, DSIAR was strongly and significantly correlated with measures of catchment urbanisation for streams in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. DSIAR scores across south-eastern Australia bore little relationship to the latitude, longitude or altitude of sampling sites, suggesting that DSIAR is not greatly affected by macro-geographical position. In addition, DSIAR scores did not vary greatly among small-scale hydraulic environments within a site. DSIAR appears to have potential as a broad-scale indicator of human influences on Australian rivers, especially the effects of agricultural and urban land use, and also for impact studies at a local scale. Further evaluation is warranted to test the sensitivity of the index to natural variables such as catchment geology, and to assess its performance in northern, western and inland Australia.

AB  - The 11 marine reserves along the Leyte Gulf, Eastern Samar, Philippines were quantified in terms of reef slope composition, hard coral coverage and standing fish biomass by manta tow and transect dive survey from 1998 to 1999. Based on the assessed ecological conditions (Condition Index, CI; Coral Coverage Index, CCI; Reef Condition Index, RCI; Fish Biomass) and derived ranking, suitable small-scale alternative livelihoods (aquaculture or land-based) to be implemented nearby these reserves were discussed and developed with the involvement of the local stakeholders composed of fishers, farmers, Non-Government Organization and Local Government Units, in a 3-day planning workshop.
   The reserves' RCI (0.20 to 0.40) resulted in fair (9 reserves) and poor (2 reserves) conditions as indicated by 64 to 68% of non-living and 32 to 36% of living slope substrate, CI of 0.15 to 0.54, CCI of 0.15 to 0.49, and fish biomass of 1.8 to 19.6 t km(-2). One reserve with the highest ecological ranking was determined as a local monitoring station to educate local fishers and farmers. For other marine reserves with high ecological conditions and located outer of Leyte Gulf, the farming of Eucheuma sp., Holothuria sp. and Pinctada sp. were suggested. While, rearing of Haliotis sp., Siganus sp., or Scylla sp. in mangrove-friendly aquaculture systems, rice farming and eco-tourism were suggested for low ranking reserves. The potential benefits of these livelihoods and the success in conserving the marine resources may enhance the quality of life of the coastal populace if there is a strong multi-sectoral cooperation.

AB  - Because biological systems do not work in isolation, behavioral, biochemical, and physiological tests can give an overview of an individual's vital processes and reaction to stress. Two stress gradients were applied in this study, a short acute desiccation stress and a long-term density stress. These stress gradients were used to assess the usefulness of various techniques for quality assessment; namely, a standard salinity stress test, condition index, recessing speed of the scallop, adenylic energetic charge (AEC), and percentage carbohydrate content of the striated muscle. The results showed that AEC could be used effectively to measure the effect of a short-term stress. In the striated muscle, AEC levels were useful in discriminating between good and poor quality scallops. The total carbohydrate content in the striated adductor muscle and condition index were useful in assessing the effect of long-term stress on scallop quality. The most promising results arose from the recessing trials, because this nondestructive test successfully discriminated the different qualities of scallops arising from both long- and short-term stress.

AB  - Freshwater mussels, aquatic keystone species, are in global decline. Long life spans, sedentary lifestyles, and unique reproductive strategies involving obligate parasitic stages make unionid freshwater mussels particularly sensitive to environmental perturbations resulting from global climate change. A greater understanding of the mechanisms by which closely related species differ in their response to thermal challenge is critical for successful conservation and management practices. As such, both an acute heat shock and a chronic warming simulation were conducted in order to evaluate responses between hypothesized thermally tolerant (Villosa lienosa) and thermally sensitive (Villosa nebulosa) freshwater mussels in response to predicted thermal warming. Multiple biological responses were quantified, including mortality, condition index, growth rates, glycogen and triglyceride content, and candidate gene expression. During acute heat shock, both species upregulated HSP90 and HSP70, although V. lienosa showed consistently greater transcript levels during upregulation. This pattern was consistent during the chronic warming simulation, with V. nebulosa showing greater induction of HSP60. Chronic warming stimulated increases in condition index for V. nebulosa; however, declines in growth rates during a recovery period were observed with no concurrent change in tissue glycogen levels. This contrasts with V. lienosa, where tissue glycogen significantly increased during chronic warming, although no response was observed for condition index or growth rates. These biological differences might indicate disparate thermal stress response mechanisms correlated with metabolic demands and resource utilization, and could thus be a factor influencing current ranges of these two species and their ability to cope with future persistent warming in their native habitats.

AB  - Natural pavements are an important element of flights. Among other things, they allow the plane to be safely slowed down after it has exited the runway. For this reason, load bearing capacity of natural airfield pavements and strength of turf layer at a specified level are required. Currently used testing methods, such as CBR (Californian Bearing Ratio) tests or turf probe test, separately do not give a full image of pavement technical condition. The authors presented the methodology for assessing the technical condition of natural airfield surfaces based on the APCI (Airfield Pavement Condition Index). The index is based at the same time on the load bearing capacity of the surface layer up to 0.85 m and turf layer strength. The mathematical model and the classification of airfield pavements in terms of the APCI indicator are presented. The article also presents an example of using the APCI method to assess shoulders and end safety areas of the runway at one of the operating airport facilities.

AB  - Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk., were reciprocally transplanted between three cultivation rafts in the Ria de Arousa (Galicia, northwest Spain). After an 8-wk period, rafts were visited and individual measurements of clearance rate, absorption efficiency, and condition index were performed in the field under ambient conditions of temperature, salinity, and food availability. Clearance rate standardized to a common shell length was not significantly affected by the location of mussels in the Ria but varied according to their origin. Absorption efficiency was mainly affected by raft position, reflecting the spatial variability in the quality of available food. Origin-related differences in absorption efficiency showed the same trend as recorded for clearance rates. No gradient of environmental factors has been recorded in the Ria that might account for differences in physiologic parameters persistent after transplantation (i.e., origin effects). Associated evidence suggests that observed differences may have resulted from spatial variability in the degree of parasitic infestation. Condition index was dependent on both raft position and mussel origin and closely reflected the described variability in physiological parameters. Remaining variability in condition index can be attributed to different conditions before transplantation took place.

AB  - Biochemical composition, condition indices, water temperature, salinity, seston, particulate organic matter and chlorophyll-a were monitored for 1 y.
   Wet meat volumetric condition index ranged from 23.96% to 47.43%, with a mean of 29.71 +/- 1.99%. Mean dry weight condition index was 5.07 +/- 0.3% and ranged from 3.94% to 8.17%. Mean moisture, ash, lipid, protein and carbohydrate values were 82.99 +/- 0.43%, 6.7 +/- 0.22%, 8.7 +/- 0.58%, 60.21 +/- 1.47%, and 24.23 +/- 1.72%, respectively. Maximum values of condition indices were recorded in March. When condition indices and lipid values were maximum, moisture was minimum. Carboyhdrate was minimum when protein was maximum in February. The interaction of environmental factors, biochemical composition and condition indices are discussed.
   In general, the condition factors of mussels were affected by the amount of food, while there was no clear relationship between biochemical composition and environmental factors.

AB  - Local environmental conditions can have strong effects on ecophysiological responses in bivalve molluscs. Molluscs must allocate the energetic resources acquired in their habitats to survival and fitness. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of response in relation to byssus strength and soft tissue weight during the maximum growth stage in the subtidal mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis between March and July 2015 in the Ria de Arousa (NW Spain). Mussels growing in high-energy environments secreted stronger byssus than those inhabiting low-energy sites. The integrated values of wave height and food availability for the previous 15 days showed a positive relationship explaining 45% and 9% of total variability in tenacity of the byssus threads. Differences in condition index were greatest between the northern (highest values) and southern sites at the mouth of the ria owing to differences in food availability. Despite similar hydrodynamic energy values, the high food availability in the exposed northern zones supplied sufficient energetic resources for both strong byssus secretion and high CI. Despite lower food availability, high CI values were also reached in mussels in the innermost, sheltered sites, because of the low need for survival with strong attachment. The condition index was positively correlated with temperature and food availability integrated during 45 previous days prior explained a 57% and 13% of total variance, respectively, while wave height explained 2% but with an inverse relationship. Environmental differences between the geographical zones of the estuary modulated byssus secretion functionality affecting the soft tissues status of mussels.

AB  - Drought is one of the most expensive but least understood natural disasters. Remote sensing based integrated drought indices have the potential to describe drought conditions comprehensively, and multi-criteria combination analysis is increasingly used to support drought assessment. However, conventional multi-criteria combination methods and most existing integrated drought indices fail to adequately represent spatial variability. An index that can be widely used for drought monitoring across all climate regions would be of great value for ecosystem management. To this end, we proposed a framework for generating a new integrated drought index applicable across diverse climate regions. In this new framework, a local ordered weighted averaging (OWA) model was used to combine the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) developed using the Vegetation Index based on Universal Pattern Decomposition method (VIUPD), the Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observation System (AMSR-E), and the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). This new index, which we call the "Geographically Independent Integrated Drought Index (GIIDI)," was validated in diverse climate divisions across the continental United States. Results showed that GIIDI was better correlated with in-situ PDSI, Z-index, SP1-1, SPI-3 and SPEI-6 (overall r-value = 0.701, 0.794, 0.811, 0.733, 0.628; RMSE = 1.979, 0.810, 0.729, 1.049 and 1.071, respectively) when compared to the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), PCI, TCI, SMCI, and VCI. GIIDI also performed well in most climate divisions for both short-term and long-term drought monitoring. Because of the superior performance of GIIDI across diverse temporal and spatial scales, GIIDI has considerable potential for improving our ability to monitor drought across a range of biomes and climates.

AB  - Growth and survival of flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, juveniles of different sizes (15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm and 40 mm) from natural spatfall were studied in suspended culture in Mersin Bay Izmir, Turkey from April 2002 to August 2003. Environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, total particulate matter (TPM), pH were monitored each sampling time. Temperature was between 13.8 degrees C (December 2002) and 24.5 degrees C (July and August 2002). Average chlorophyll-a, TPM and pH were 1.7 +/- 0.64 mu g l(-1), 0.01311+/-0.00224 mg l(-1) and 7.65+/-0.22, respectively. Shell length increment for each size groups (from small to large) was determined as 49.99, 43.39, 39.10, 33.11, 39.36 and 25.67 mm, respectively. The smallest group was growth faster than others (P < 0.05). Significant differences in survival rates between size groups occurred (highest: 60% for 15.mm and lowest: 12.8% for 35 mm) (P < 0.05). Condition index and meat yield which showed many variations throughout the study changed from 2.65% to 5.11% and from 6.65% to 12%, respectively.

AB  - The morphometry, length-weight and condition index of green mussel P. viridis (L.) from St Mary's Island, off Malpe, near Udupi, were examined from December 2004 to December 2005. The calculated regression equations between length and breadth and length and width for the entire study period were L=0.5071+ 0.3921B and L=0.0179 + 0.3225W respectively. The monthly b values of length-breadth and length-width relationships varied from 0.3636 (March 2005) to 0.4374 (December 2004) and from 0.3022 (December 2005) to 0.3466 (August 2005) respectively. The data on length-total weight (W=0.0986L(2.9495)), length-wet tissue weight (W=0.031L(2.7173)), length-dry weight (W=0.005L(2.9337)) and length-shell weight (W=0.0351L(3.061)) showed a nonlinear pattern. The coefficient of allometry (b) values ranged from 2.7949 (April 2005) to 3.0999 (September 2005) for length-total weight relationship and from 1.5203 (August 2005) to 3.328 (March 2005) for length-dry weight relationship. The monthly mean values of the condition index varied from 5.17 (December 2004) to 7.76 (November 2005). The variation in condition index followed the breeding period and seasons. The maximum condition index (22-24) was recoded in May 2005. Based on the data on condition, it is suggested that the ideal period for commercial exploitation of Perna viridis from the Island is from March to August, when the meat yield is the highest. The hierarchical cluster analysis using complete linkage showed three major groups of biological parameters of mussels. The PCA showed a total of five components, which together accounted for 89.31% of total variance. The first component accounted for 44.08% of variance, followed by second component for 18.02% and the third component for 11.66% of variance. The remaining fourth and fifth components together accounted for 15.55% of variance.

AB  - The sublethal effects of simulated capture of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) were analysed using physiological responses, condition indexing, and performance variables. Simulated catch-and-release fishing included combinations of depth of capture and thermocline exposure reflective of environmental conditions experienced in the Gulf of Mexico. Frequency of occurrence of barotrauma and lack of reflex response exhibited considerable individual variation. When combined into a single condition or impairment index, individual variation was reduced, and impairment showed significant increases as depth increased and with the addition of thermocline exposure. Performance variables, such as burst swimming speed (BSS) and simulated predator approach distance (AD), were also significantly different by depth. BSSs and predator ADs decreased with increasing depth, were lowest immediately after release, and were affected for up to 15 min, with longer recovery times required as depth increased. The impairment score developed was positively correlated with cortisol concentration and negatively correlated with both BSS and simulated predator AD. The impairment index proved to be an efficient method to estimate the overall impairment of red snapper in the laboratory simulations of capture and shows promise for use in field conditions, to estimate release mortality and vulnerability to predation.

AB  - The Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) was developed by the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission as a global composite index that quantifies the vulnerability of an area's environment. Greece has been selected as reference area due to its current physical and anthropogenic conditions that may lead to environmental instabilities in the natural, social, and economic infrastructure environment. Hence, in the present approach, using data on Greece, an effort to define the range of information that the EVI may provide for the pertinent country is presented and a discussion on whether the index may be further developed is conveyed. Advantages as well as shortcomings of the Index are also delineated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a new biotic index (ESCA, Ecological Status of Coralligenous Assemblages), based on analyses of in situ records of coralligenous macroalgal assemblages in the Mediterranean Sea. The ESCA index was developed on the basis of previous impact evaluation studies carried out by traditional destructive methods. It was validated on an independent dataset collected during a 3-year study carried out at five localities in the north-western Mediterranean, and tested on a gradient of anthropogenic stressors. Assemblage descriptors selected as metrics of the ESCA index were: (a) presence/absence and abundance of sensitive taxa/groups (expressed as sensitivity level of assemblages, SL), (b) diversity of assemblages (expressed as a-diversity) and (c) heterogeneity of assemblages (expressed as beta-diversity). The three metrics were combined to give a final value for the multimetric ecological index, Ecological Quality Ratio, calculated as the ratio between the measured values and the value obtained in the reference condition. The Ecological Quality Ratio values ranged from 0 to 1 and five ecological status classes were defined in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. The ESCA index could be used to define the ecological status of the studied sites, providing differences between assemblages similar to those shown by multivariate analyses. Moreover, ecological quality values were quite steady throughout the study period. The ESCA index may represent a useful tool for monitoring programmes in coastal waters, since it has been developed in compliance with the Water Framework Directive; it synthesizes complex information in a simple and reliable way; and its application is simple and cost-effective. However, further studies are necessary to complete index development and to properly evaluate its strengths and weaknesses on a larger scale.

AB  - Protecting the ecological environment is an important goal of the world sustainable development. Rapid and quantitative evaluation of regional ecological environment is the technical support and necessary condition for this goal. The ecological environment index model (RSEI) which used to assess ecological environment is the most popular now. But it changed into two completely opposite models in the application. Most researchers choose which model to use based on the desired results. This article concludes the reason by studying the operating mechanism of the model and finds that it is the eigenvector direction in the principal component analysis causes this to happen. Taking Pingyu County as an example, this article calculates RSEI with Landsat 8 images in different periods in Google Earth Engine using the two existing models respectively and finds that two models show two opposite result trends in spatial distribution. Using any model to calculate the same image, the results are also opposite if changing the input order of the indicators. It is the eigenvector direction determines the spatial distribution by comparing and analyzing the eigenvector of each image and its corresponding RSEI. Then, this paper improves the model by fixing the eigenvector direction based on the actual effects on ecological environment of the four indicators, taking absolute values of the eigenvectors of NDVI and Wet which have a positive effect on the ecological environment and the opposite of absolute values of the eigenvectors of LST and NDSI which have a negative effect on the ecological environment, in order to improve the RSEI model. Using the improved model calculate each image, the results are consistently accurate. Furthermore, this paper also proposed a model for users who calculating the principal components through software where the eigenvector direction cannot be altered artificially. This paper proposes the improved model which is suitable for all users whether using software or conducting programming. The improved model is suitable for all images of any input order of the indicators. It provides the possibility of applying remote sensing big data to the ecological environment. At the same time, the study of the mechanism of the model provides a scientific basis for future scholars to calculate in batches.

TI  - Waterbirds as an ecological indicator for monitoring wetlands: an application to Tunisia
T2  - REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
LA  - French
AB  - We propose a simple ecological index to monitor wetlands, based on interannual changes in waterbird numbers and the hydro-ecological characteristics of their wintering sites. This new method provides a simple tool applicable to most types of wetlands in northern Africa with comparable waterbird species and hydrological attributes. Scores of this ecological index are calculated through a four-steps approach: (1) discriminate prospected sites into different associations based on their hydro-ecological characteristics; (2) compute indicator values for each waterbird species considered to quantify the strength of species-habitat relationships in each wetland associations; (3) calculate the relative rate of temporal change in indicator species abundances between two sampling events (in our example 2001-2013 and 1970/2000); (4) compute the weighted sum across species of the product of these two metrics within a given wetlands association. The application of our index to the monitoring of Tunisian wetlands suggests the degradation of wintering lagoons and salt pans and coastal environments. Nevertheless, applying the index in floodplains and garaets tends to indicate improved overwintering conditions, especially for man-tolerant waterbird species. Our new index targets environmental stakeholders seeking for an efficient tool for biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - In order to assess the effect of feeding deprivation on growth and condition of field-caught newly settled juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa, a 3 week starvation experiment was conducted and changes in RNA/DNA ratio, Fulton's K condition index and recent otolith growth were measured. Fed ad libitum and starved fish were analysed after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 16 and 22 days of starvation. In parallel, field newly settled juvenile plaice were collected weekly over the settlement period (between April and May 2005) in the adjacent intertidal zone of the Canche estuary (eastern English Channel, France) and fish performances were estimated. After starvation day 4, Fulton's K condition index and RNA/DNA ratio of juvenile plaice significantly differed between treatments while recent otolith growth differed between treatments after day 9 of the experiment procedure. Results indicate that the three biological parameters are sensitive indices and can be used to accurately assess nutritional condition of wild juvenile fish. Values of 0.32 for RNA/DNA, 0.83 mg. mm(-3) for Fulton's K index, and 3.99 mm for recent otolith daily growth were defined as critical threshold values below which juvenile plaice can be classified as 'starving'. When comparing these experimental values with those from field-caught newly settled juvenile plaice, less than 1% of wild individuals can be classified as 'starving' whatever the index. Our results suggest that feeding conditions throughout the settlement period on the Canche intertidal nursery ground are favourable to juvenile plaice development and survival, and hence to the recruitment success.

AB  - The quantification of circulating plasma immunoglobulins represents a valuable diagnostic tool in human and veterinary immunology, although its application is very limited in reptile medicine to date. The objectives of our study were the development and standardization of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for the measurement of total plasma immunoglobulins (Igs; both IgM and IgY) in loggerhead sea turtles (LST; Caretta caretta; n = 254) and green turtles (GT; Chelonia mydas; n = 111), the establishment of reference intervals for Ig for both species, and the examination of associations between Ig and total protein (TP), condition index, and water temperature. The cELISA for Ig was successfully developed and optimized. Reference intervals for Ig were 0.38-0.94 g/dL in LST (median: 0.59 g/dL; range: 0.16-2.15 g/dL) and 0.40-0.85 g/dL in GT (median: 0.58 g/dL; range: 0.18-1.80 g/dL). In LST, there were positive linear relationships of Ig with TP, and TP with Ig and condition index, and a negative relationship of Ig with condition index. The positive linear relationships of Ig with TP, and TP with Ig were also identified in GT. These positive associations of Ig and TP were expected, as Ig represents fractions of TP, and TP reportedly increases with straight carapace length and weight. The negative association of Ig with condition index may indicate potential biological variations. The cELISA and reference intervals for total Ig of LST and GT presented herein have the potential to be useful as a diagnostic and research tool for sea turtle immunology.

AB  - The dynamics of the white clam's (Spisula solida) reproductive cycle along with its nutrient storage and exploitation strategy in the Algarve coast (Portugal) was studied throughout the year 2003. The timing of gametogenic development and spawning of S. solida were analysed through histological preparation using qualitative and quantitative criteria. Condition index and biochemical composition were determined in order to provide information on energy storage and utilization. Seawater temperature is a primary environmental factor determining reproductive development and spawning of S. solida; reproductive activity occurred during low temperatures. The spawning period began in late winter as a consequent response to the increase in seawater temperature and extended through spring. During this period, the condition index and the gonadal index decreased. In June, most of the population was spent and big resting oocytes appear dispersed in the gonad. In summer, the specimens were found to be in the resting phase and condition index increased to its maximum value as a consequence of reserves storage. Gametogenic activity was initiated coincident with decreasing temperature in September, but a sudden increase of this environmental parameter in October disturbed the gametogenic process and a second spawning occurred. In this period, the synchronism between males and females of the population was lost. The striking consumption of glycogen reserves developed during the previous August and consequent biosynthesis of lipids during gamete formation occurred. In the following two months, reproductive synchronism was restored, and storage of reserves and gametogenesis took place concurrently. In December the entire population was in the ripe stage of gonadal development. Moreover than a consequence of gametogenesis during autumn/winter, lipid behaviour reflected the energy accumulation process and its conversion to somatic development in spring/summer. The reproductive strategy adopted by S. solida makes possible broodstock manipulation in terms of conditioning in aquaculture. The information obtained in this study is important for assessing sustainable management of wild stocks as well as for estimating its potential for aquaculture production. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought is a complex hazard caused by the breaking of water balance and it has always an impact on agricultural, ecological and socio-economic spheres. Although the drought indices deriving from remote sensing data have been used to monitor meteorological or agricultural drought, there are no indices that can suitably reflect the comprehensive information of drought from meteorological to agricultural aspects. In this paper, the synthesized drought index (SDI) is defined as a principal component of vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI) and precipitation condition index (PCI). SDI integrates multi-source remote sensing data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) and it synthesizes precipitation deficits, soil thermal stress and vegetation growth status in drought process. Therefore, this method is favorable to monitor the comprehensive drought. In our research, a heavy drought process was accurately explored using SDI in Shandong province, China from 2010 to 2011. Finally, a validation was implemented and its results show that SDI is not only strongly correlated with 3-month scales standardized precipitation index (SPI3), but also with variation of crop yield and drought-affected crop areas. It was proved that this index is a comprehensive drought monitoring indicator and it can contain not only the meteorological drought information but also it can reflect the drought influence on agriculture.

AB  - This study examined the validity of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) content in sediment as an environmental index in aquaculture farms and conducted an experiment for fixing its standard value.
   AVS in the sediment in summer reflects organic loads, and is closely relatied to communities of macrobenthos that are well known as an environmental index reflected the history of organic loads. An experiment showed that AVS is valid as an index for evaluating the environment of aquaculture farms.
   According to the results of analyzing the relationships between two parameters in the sediment (total organic carbon (TOC) and AVS) and biomass of macrobenthos, the environment of aquaculture farms can be classified into four types. AVS concentration below 0.22 mg g(-1) is considered to be 'the healthy area' in which the macrobenthos biomass increases with increase of TOC. 'The eutrophicating area' and 'the warning area' are AVS of 0.22-0.43, 0.43-0.71 mg g(-1), respectively. In former AVS concentrations, the decrease of biomass progresses with increase of TOC, while the latter AVS concentrations have poor macrobenthos communities. AVS concentration exceeding 0.71 mg g(-1) is the azoic condition called 'the critical area'.

AB  - Before evaluating the abundance and quality of nature in a city, one must define the concept of nature according to resident experience and climatological conditions. For Los Angeles (L.A.) County, home to a sociologically diverse and highly developed city in a Mediterranean climate that experienced drought conditions for the last decade, this represents a formidable theoretical and empirical challenge. In support of an Integrated Vulnerability Assessment, we developed an index of natural resources with the aid of local partnerships. This effort required local expert participation and resulted in the creation of a large database of available regional data. This index was created to investigate the spatial footprint of natural resources in relation to predicted high risk natural hazard areas. This paper demonstrates analytical applications of this index, which consists of six component indicators: greenness, biodiversity, habitat fragmentation, significant ecological areas, tree canopy cover, and wetland cover. Data for each component were compiled into a geodatabase, scaled, aggregated to Census block group areas, and combined to create the natural resources index (the Index). The Index can then be compared with natural hazard spatial data to determine relative vulnerability to these hazards, interactions with other types of vulnerabilities, and where adaptive capacity may be lacking. Results highlight areas of opportunity for multifaceted risk mitigation and adaptation efforts.

AB  - Three different citrus-producing regions of Turkey-Edremit Gulf, Coastal Aegean, and eastern Black Sea-were surveyed in 2005 and 2006. A total of 119 samples were collected from Satsuma Owari mandarin (Citrus unshiu) trees grafted on Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)-resistant Poncirus trifoliata rootstocks in commercial groves and home gardens. All samples were tested for the presence of CTV by direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA) and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) using young shoots. The samples that tested positive were indexed for biological properties. The results obtained from DTBIA tests showed that 20 of 119 (16.8%) tested trees were infected with CTV and 99 trees were virus free. All samples that tested positive in DTBIA were also positive in DAS-ELISA. After biological indexing, none of these 20 isolates showed any symptoms on sour orange, grapefruit, and sweet orange plants, but all isolates induced vein-clearing symptoms on Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifoli) in 9 months. Some isolates also caused leaf-cupping and chlorosis in Mexican lime. However, 15 months after initial grafting, all isolates induced mild to moderate stem-pitting on Mexican lime. In addition, young tissues, petioles, and leaf samples were collected periodically at monthly intervals for I year (2006) from a 25-year-old Satsuma Owari mandarin grafted on P. trifoliata in the Edremit Gulf. CTV was readily detected in tissue blots of young shoots and petioles from CTV-infected plants during the autumn, winter, and spring seasons. Similarly, the highest ELISA values were obtained in April; the lowest values were noted in September. This study showed that DTBIA is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable procedure for detecting CTV under field conditions.

AB  - Iran is a country in a dry part of the world and extensively suffers from drought. Drought is a natural and repeatable phenomenon definable at specified time and area. In addition, social and economic issues can be affected by drought. Information such as intensity, duration, and spatial coverage of drought can help decision makers to reduce the vulnerability of the drought-affected areas, therefore lessen the risks associated with drought episodes. Lack of long-term meteorological data for many parts of the country is one of the most important problems for drought monitoring in Iran. One of the useful ways for gathering information about soil and vegetation conditions is using satellite-based imagery. In this study, remotely sensed image data were applied in order to forecast and model the drought. To this end, SPI (standardized precipitation index) drought indicator was used to represent the drought and its intensity in different time spans (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). Some vegetation indices (VIs) including normalized difference vegetation index, temperature condition index, vegetation condition index, and normalized difference vegetation index deviation were extracted using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor imagery. These indices were plugged into the model to calculate the SPI. A unique Support Vector Machine classifier improved for all types of the SPI by applying various remotely sensed VIs. The best vegetation index for each kind of SPI was determined. In this framework, meteorological stations were clustered based on their land cover extracted from satellite-based indices before insertion to the model.

AB  - Body composition (the total amount of fat mass, lean mass, minerals and water that constitute the body) is an important measure for understanding an animal's physiology, ecology and behaviour. Traditional measures of body composition require the animal to either be placed under anaesthetic, which is invasive and can be high-risk, or be euthanised, preventing the ability to perform repeated measures on the same individual. We aimed to validate quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) as a non-invasive measure of body composition by comparing QMR scans with chemical carcass analysis (CCA) in Gould's wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii). In addition, we compared a commonly used microbat body condition index (residuals of mass by forearm length) to CCA. We found that QMR is an accurate method of estimating body condition in Gould's wattled bats after calibration with regression equations, and the condition index could accurately predict lean and water mass but was a poor predictor of fat mass. Using accurate, non-invasive, repeatable measures of body condition may have important implications for ecological research in the face of changing environments.

AB  - The ability of mussels to cope with environmental conditions depends on the species' capacity to acclimate or adapt within its morphometric and physiological parameters. In the present study, we investigated the effect of aquaculture site and translocation on different stocks of Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819. We used shell morphological ratios (width/length, height/length and height/width) and allometric relationships (volume-length and shell weight-length) in addition to condition index (wet meat weight/total weight) and mortality to compare cultivated and translocated mussels from the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia. Mussels were collected from five cultivation areas (Lim, Pomer, Rasa, Vabriga and Budava), and then moved for three months to experimental station at marine protected area in Lim Bay. Differences between cultivated mussels suggested morphological plasticity, although translocation weakly affected allometric relationships. Decrease in condition index was pronounced in translocated mussels, indicating adaptation to different local environmental conditions. High post translocation mortality was observed in mussels transferred to the experimental area. Our study shows plastic response of M. galloprovincialis, which can provide a useful information of mussel stocks selection in aquaculture.

AB  - Body condition (energy reserves) can have important fitness consequences. Measuring condition of live animals is typically done by regressing body mass on measures of body size and using the residuals as an index of condition. The validity of this condition index was evaluated by determining whether it reflected measured fat content of five species of small mammals (yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus Allen), bushy-tailed wood rats (Neotoma cinerea Ord), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus Ord), red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi Vigors), and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord)). We also determined whether body water could predict fat content, enabling the use of hydrogen-isotope dilution for estimating condition. For all five species, condition estimates weakly predicted fat content and more accurately predicted variation in lean dry mass and water content. The relationship between body water and fat content was inconsistent among the five species, discouraging against the general use of isotope dilution in these animals. Although ecologically important, these indices are best interpreted as explaining variation in all constituents of body composition.

AB  - Improvement in the quality of the environment and, as a result, in the quality of life, including environmental impact assessments and environmental management, play an important role in the practical implementation of environmental regulations.
   The goal of this paper is to develop a new type of quantitative environmental impact assessment method to describe changes in environmental elements as well as the environment in an objective and reliable manner for various projects, investments, plans and proposals. An easily adaptable method was sought which provides a clear and well-interpretable result on the condition of and foreseeable changes in the environment.
   The algorithm operates using the limit values of environmental elements set forth by national regulations. The evaluation is independent of the number of environmental parameters chosen as it was included in the informativity rates of the method. The process results in an aggregated index for qualifying the total environment but, nonetheless, the affected environmental elements and measured environmental parameters can be analysed independently. The Informative Environment Qualifying Index evaluates the environmental parameters in proportion to the strictness of the limit values. The final assessment of the total environment is performed by using varying intervals, therefore, the different cases can be compared to each other. Experts interpret the results as well as explain the changes in the state of the environment and, therefore, identify the cause-effect relationships.

AB  - The growth and health of intertidal mussel (Perna canaliculus) populations were investigated along an exposed coastline at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand. A marked and recaptured experiment of young mussels (15-35 mm in shell length) over a year at three sites resulted in significant differences in recovery rates, shell growth, condition indices, age, and degree of shell parasitism. A high recovery rate of fast growing mussels coincided with a high condition index and low shell parasitism. Conversely, a low recovery rate of slow growing populations was associated with a low condition index and a high level of shell parasitism. Anomalous shell conditions included bored shells, wear and sloughing of periostracum, shell erosion, and nacre pits and bulges. Aging of adult mussels (70-80 mm) indicates that in areas of fast population turnover rates, mussels reach adulthood in only 1.1 years compared to the 2.5-year-old mussels found in low turnover areas. These differences are attributed to variations in environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, sediment load) throughout the study area, and highlight the importance of site-specific variability for intertidal populations.

AB  - Physiological responses can be used as effective parameters to identify environmentally stressful conditions. In this study, physiology changes such as oxygen consumption, clearance rate, survival in air, condition index and energy reserves were measured on natural populations of cockles collected from different sites at Ria de Aveiro, Portugal. At those sites, sediment samples were collected for Hg concentration analysis. Cockles were used for the evaluation of both the Hg concentration and physiological response. Mercury was detected in the cockle tissue and in the sediment collected from the sampling points both nearby and distant from the main mercury contamination source. The energy content was negatively correlated with both Hg concentration in cockle tissues and survival in air. Nonetheless, the energy content was positively correlated with the condition index, and there was a positive correlation between the survival in air test and the tissue mercury concentration. A PCA-factor analysis explained 86.8% of the total variance. The principal factor (62.7%) consisted of the air survival, the Hg in soft tissues (positive) and the condition index (negative). The second factor (24.1%) consisted of a negative correlation between the oxygen consumption and the clearance rate. Due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions, the physiological responses of cockles can be used to assess the ecological status of aquatic environments. More effort should be invested in investigating the effects of environmental perturbations on cockle health once they are a good reporter organism. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) has been widely used for monitoring and characterising droughts. This index takes into account ecosystem features in terms of fluctuations between prescribed maxima and minima of NDVI (Vegetation Condition Index, VCI) and of Land Surface Temperature (LST; Thermal Condition Index, TCI), and is estimated as the weighted sum of these two contributions. Since there is no a priori knowledge about vegetation and temperature contributions, VHI is typically taken as the average of both contributions, i.e., a weight of 0.5 is assumed. In this work climatologies of NDVI and LST - spanning the period between 1982 and 2009 - are used to estimate VCI, TCI and VHI on a Mediterranean geographic window, which are then correlated with the multi scalar drought indicator SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) with the aim of assessing the effect of drought on each contribution. Results of the correlations between VCI-SPEI and TCI-SPEI show that the relative contributions of VCI and TCI to vegetation health depend on vegetation cover: the effect of drought is more evident in the case of VCI in semiarid climate classes (regions where the limiting factor to vegetation growth is water); while the effect of drought is more obvious in TCI for moistier climate classes (regions where the limiting factor is solar radiation). This leads to the conclusion that by maximising the correlations between VHI and SPEI, over a climatological period, it is possible to evaluate the relative roles of VCI and TCI to VHI for different climate regions.

AB  - The characteristics of the sedimentary environment are considered significant for increasing the aquaculture production of Manila clams, Venerupis philippinarum. Among these, the grain size and sorting of the sediment, which determine the amount of pore-water-dissolved oxygen and organic matter content, can affect the growth and survival of clams. To determine the optimal grain size and sediment sorting in relation to the conditions of Manila clams (e.g., survival, growth, burrowing behavior, and condition index), we conducted three experiments. First, juvenile clams were incubated in four different grain sizes (coarse sand, 0.335-710 mm; medium sand, 0.180-0.335 mm; fine sand, 0.090-0.180 mm; and very fine sediment, < 0.09 mm). Survival was significantly higher in medium sand than in very fine sediment. The condition index of the Manila clams was higher in the medium sand than in the coarse and very fine sediments. However, the sediment grain size did not influence the shell growth or clam emergence behavior. Second, juvenile clams were incubated in three different treatments of sediment sorting (well-sorted sediment: 0.58 mm; moderately-sorted sediment: 0.46 mm; and poorlysorted sediment: 0.37 mm). The shell growth rate was significantly higher in the poorly-sorted sediment than in any other treatment, while sediment sorting did not influence the survivorship, condition index, or emergence behavior. Third, juvenile Manila clams were incubated for 30 days in the sediment taken from two locations on the clam culturing mudflat, where a structure was installed to facilitate the settling of clam larvae (which was more poorly-sorted) or without a structure (the control). Although the survival and emergence behavior were not significantly different between the two treatments, the shell growth rate in the sediment under the structure was higher than that in the sediment with no structure. Moreover, the condition index of the Manila clams in the sediment under the structure was significantly higher than that under no structure. The results suggest that poorly-sorted sediment with an average grain size of medium sand is optimal for the survival and growth of Manila clams.

AB  - On December 22, 2008, a dike containing coal fly ash at the Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Fossil Plant (TN, USA) failed, and within months, dredging operations began to remove ash-contaminated sediments. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the bioaccumulation of metals in three mussel species during and after dredging operations. Mussels were caged for approximately 1 year during dredging and after, and then mussel condition index values and As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, Se, Hg, U, Fe, Mg, Al, Sb, Ba, Be, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ag, Sr, Tl, V, and Zn concentrations in soft tissue were determined via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometery. Overall, the differences observed in metal bioaccumulation and mussel health suggest that mussels in the immediate downstream area of the dredging site may have been impacted, as evidenced by a significant decrease in mussel condition index values, but that this impact did not result in increased tissue concentrations of metals.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural disaster affected by multiple climate factors and underlying surface. In recent years, drought monitoring indices of remote sensing have been widely applied to monitor drought in a certain region or global. However, some remote sensing drought monitoring indices do not consider the drought-causing factors enough to reflect the comprehensive drought situation of a region fully. In this paper, a new remote sensing drought monitoring index, called Remote Sensing Drought Evaluation Index (RSDEI), was constructed by combining Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) using the spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) method. The reasonableness of RSDEI was test and verified using Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and unit area crop yield. The RSDEI was also applied to the drought condition monitoring of the northwest arid and semi-arid region from 2001 to 2019.The result demonstrated that the results showed that the RSDEI had a high correlation coefficient with SPEI-12 (R=0.85, p<0.01). It is concluded that the correlation coefficient between RSDEI and NPP is 0.74 at 95% confidence level, which indicates that RSDEI and NPP have a strong correlation. Then, the correlation between RSDEI and crop yield per unit area is 0.89. The results of RSDEI showed that the drought in northwest China started in May and lasted in September from 2001 to 2019. The lowest value of RSDEI appeared in May, which inflected the significant difference of drought level in different month in northwest China. The result of CV (coefficient of variation) showed that the drought variation in the study area had a stable low fluctuation condition as a whole, in the northwest and northeast of study area, which indicated that the changes of drought were different in the past 19 years. The Hurst exponent analysis showed that the area with the positive evolution of Hurst index (0.5<H<1) is 1,845,046.669 km(2),which accounts for 75.9% of the total area, while the area with reverse evolution characteristics (H<0.5) accounts for 24.1% of the total area. The result obtained above reflected that the drought changes in most regions are better than that in the past 19 years. The trend gradually changes from drought to humid.

AB  - In Western Bhutan, a traditional mixed farming system is practised with integration of both livestock and crops. Irrigated highland rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown in terraced bunds by smallholder farmers for household consumption, with farmyard manure as the main source of nutrient input. The study objectives were to evaluate the rice productivity of the existing farming system, assess the potential of improved cultivars and nitrogen input, and their economic analyses. On-farm trials were carried out in 17 farmers' fields with one traditional and two improved cultivars of rice at 0 and 60 kg nitrogen ha-1 in two highland rice-growing districts. Across locations, environmental index varied from 2.9-6.3 Mg ha-1, exhibiting significantly wide differences in grain yield within and across village clusters. Soil properties were highly variable and soil organic matter was relatively high among the locations. Timely transplanting and small farm size had positive effects on grain yield. Significant effects of location, nitrogen, genotype, and environmental indexxnitrogen were recorded on grain yield and total dry matter. Nitrogen fertilizer increased grain yield by 790-840 kg ha-1 in improved cultivars compared with the traditional cultivar (530 kg ha-1). Significant cultivar effects on grain yield were recorded with improved cultivars yielding 670-980 kg ha-1 more than the traditional cultivar due to higher harvest index (13-22%) and agronomic efficiency in nitrogen use (59%). Environmental indexxnitrogen indicated significant difference in nitrogen response across the range of environmental indices. The highest yielding (Khangma Maap) cultivar was the most economical option due to high value/cost quotient (11.2) and marginal rate of return (Bhutan Ngultrum 16.77). Although yield levels were affected by both agronomic and socio-economic factors, Khangma Maap had higher grain and straw yield across the environments and, hence, the cultivar may be suggested for adoption.

AB  - To tackle urban heterogeneity and complexity, several indices have been proposed, commonly aiming to provide information for decision-makers. In this study, we propose a novel and customizable procedure for quantifying urban ecosystem integrity. Based on a citywide approach, we developed an easy-to-use index that contrasts physical and biological variables of urban ecosystems with a given reference system. The Urban Ecosystem Integrity Index (UEII) is the sum of the averages from the variables that make up its intensity of urbanization and biological components. We applied the UEII in a Mexican tropical city using land surface temperature, built cover, and the richness of native plants and birds. The overall ecosystem integrity of the city, having montane cloud, tropical dry, and temperate forests as reference systems, was low (-0.34 +/- SD 0.32), showing that, beyond its biodiverse greenspace network, the built-up structure highly differs from the ecosystems of reference. The UEII showed to be a flexible and easy-to-calculate tool to evaluate ecosystem integrity for cities, allowing for comparisons between or among cities, as well as the sectors/regions within cities. If used properly, the index could become a useful tool for decision making and resource allocation at a city level.

The comparison of effectiveness of the joint assessment of the state of aquatic ecosystems based on hydrobiological and hydrochemical indicators is carried out. In some cases, a discrepancy between the integral assessment characteristics was revealed. It is due to the fact that the comparison of data of the Roshydromet hydrochemical and hydrobiological monitoring is carried out at the same site not taking into account hydrological features of water bodies.

AB  - Although there is Substantial evidence that skeletal measures of body size are heritable in wild animal populations, it is frequently assumed that the nonskeletal component of body weight (or 'condition') is determined primarily by environmental factors, in particular nutritional state. We tested this assumption by quantifying the genetic arid environmental components of variance in, fledgling body condition index ( = relative body weight) in a natural population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and compared the strength of natural selection on individual breeding values with that on phenotypic values. A mixed model analysis of the components of variance, based on an 'animal model' and using 18 years of data on 17 717 nestlings, revealed a significant additive genetic component of variance in body condition, which corresponded to a narrow sense heritability (h(2)) of 0.30 (SE = 0.03). Nongenetic contributions to variation in body condition were large, but there was no evidence of dominance variance nor of contributions from early maternal or common environment effects (pre-manipulation environment) in condition at fledging. Comparison of pre- and post-selection samples revealed virtually identical h(2) of body condition index, despite the fact that there was a significant decrease (35%) in the levels of additive genetic variance from fledging to breeding, The similar h(2) in the two samples occurred because the environmental component of variance was also reduced by Selection, Suggesting that natural selection was acting on both genotypic and environmental variation. The effects of selection on genetic variance were confirmed by calculation of the selection differentials for both phenotypic values and best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) estimates of breeding values: there was positive directional selection on condition index both at the phenotypic arid the genotypic level. The significant h(2) of body condition index is consistent with data from human and rodent populations showing significant additive genetic variance in relative body mass and adiposity, but contrasts with the common assumption in ecology that body condition reflects an individual's nongenetic nutritional state. Furthermore, the substantial reduction in the additive genetic component of variance in body condition index Suggests that selection on environmental deviations cannot alone explain the maintenance of additive genetic variation in heritable traits, but that other mechanisms are needed to explain the moderate to high heritabilities of traits under consistent arid strong directional selection.

AB  - A Basin-wide Index of Benthic Integrity (B-IBI) was developed to uniformly assess aquatic ecosystem health of non-tidal, wadeable streams in the multi-jurisdictional Potomac River basin (US). Multiple datasets were merged and used to identify stream classes and discriminating biological metrics. The index (aggregated metric scores) accurately identified 95% of impaired sites. A jackknife cross-validation procedure confirmed the accuracy of the B-IBI. B-IBI assessments generally compare favorably to basin states' assessments derived from the same data. A habitat quality matrix which includes an indicator of anthropogenic alterations and disturbances is recommended. The Potomac B-IBI is more useful than existing state-specific indexes for stream health comparisons across jurisdictional boundaries and basin-wide. The Potomac B-IBI can improve understanding of water quality issues in the basin and enhance the abilities of water quality managers to make well-informed decisions concerning the basin's non-tidal waters.

AB  - In this paper, a simple surface dryness index (Vegetation Condition Albedo Drought Index, VCADI) based on the spectral patterns of surface moisture in two dimensional spectral space of vegetation index versus broadband albedo is suggested. VCADI derived from multi-sources remote sensing data including the Thematic Mapper (TM), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are significantly related to field measured soil moisture over different ecosystems. Spatio-temporal patterns of VCADI are further analyzed using time series of MODIS data over Ningxia Huizu Autonomous Region of China. Results indicate that VCADI variations are accordant with regional rainfall dynamics and the index has a potential in drought estimation as a simple satellite derived method completely independent of surface ancillary data.

AB  - The multimetric Phytoplankton Index of Biological Integrity (P-IBI) was applied throughout Rostov on Don city (Russia) on 8 Locations in Don River from April - October 2019. The P-IBI is composed from seven metrics: Species Richness Index (SRI), Density of Phytoplankton and total biomass of phytoplankton and Relative Abundance (RA) for blue-green Algae, Green Algae, Bacillariophyceae and Euglenaphyceae Algae. The average P-IBI values fell within the range of (45.09-52.4). Therefore, water throughout the entire study area was characterized by the equally "poor" quality. Negative points of anthropogenic impact detected at the stations are: Above the city of Rostov-on-Don (1 km, higher duct Aksai) was 38.57 in June, the lower inflow of the Temernik river which was 38.57-41.42 in summer and below the spillway was 38.57 -34.28 in August. At these stations, samples with P-IBI values more than 56, characterizing water quality as "Fair", were not found in any of the observations. The negative effect on the water at the stations may be due to the influence of the closely located Aksai city and the impact of the Temernik River. In Russia P-IBI have not been used yet, so this study can be considered as the first study that's conducted to assess the environmental status of the Don River by using the phytoplankton index of Biological Integrity and has developed scoring criteria of the Don River (P-IBI) and other watercourses of the south of Russia. The continuous monitoring relaying on the selection of the most suitable metrics score is recommended.

AB  - Integrating mussel and finfish aquaculture has been recognized as a way to increase profits and decrease environmental impacts of finfish aquaculture, but not enough is known about the effects of finfish aquaculture on mussel growth. Here we present a pilot study aimed at determining how distance from finfish aquaculture affects mussel growth. To this end, we measured growth and condition index of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) at three different distances (0, 60 and 700 m) from finfish aquaculture in the eastern Adriatic Sea. There was a statistically significant difference in growth of tagged mussels with respect to site. Average measured lengths of mussels at sites 1, 2 and 3 after the 10 months of the experiment were 57.60, 62.73 and 58.66 mm. Mussels grew fastest from March to May, and slowest from July to September, regardless of their position. Condition index showed spatial and temporal variations with higher values during fall and winter (similar to 23), and lower values during spring and summer (similar to 20). Our results show that production cycle in areas traditionally considered suboptimal for aquaculture can be equivalent to the cycle in areas traditionally considered optimal for mussel aquaculture if mussel aquaculture is integrated with finfish aquaculture.

AB  - Land use and land cover change has a marked affect on wetland condition, and different wetland types are affected differentially depending on many abiotic and biotic variables. To assess wetland condition, we have developed a Florida wetland condition index (FWCI) composed of indicators of community structure in the diatom, macrophyte, and macroinvertebrate assemblages for 216 wetlands (n = 74 depressional marsh, n = 118 depressional forested, n = 24 flowing water forested wetlands). Depressional wetlands located along a human disturbance gradient throughout Florida were sampled for each assemblage. Forested flowing water wetlands were sampled for macrophytes only. The landscape development intensity index (LDI) was used to quantify the human disturbance gradient. In general, human disturbance in adjacent areas had the greatest impact on depressional herbaceous wetlands, followed by depressional forested wetlands. Forested flowing water wetlands (i.e., forested strands and floodplain wetlands) were less affected by local conditions, with most of their changes in wetland condition correlated with alterations at the larger watershed scale. Strong correlations between the FWCIs and LDI index scores suggest that changes in community structure can be detected along a gradient of human land use activities adjacent to wetland ecosystems.

AB  - The effect of physico-chemical variables on the growth of the edible oyster, Saccostrea cucullata in the Sundarbans, India was investigated in a culture experiment. The results of the study indicate that the oysters grow better in high saline and pH conditions. High phytoplankton density is needed as feed for the oysters. The region of rich mangrove vegetation contributes substantial nutrients in the aquatic subsystem through litter and detritus and thereby enhancing the phytoplankton density and diversity. The aquatic subsystem of Ganges estuary is highly turbid due to the influx of river discharge and runoff into the system. Such a condition is not favourable for the growth and survival of the oysters. The condition index of oysters showed a unique seasonal variation with highest value during pre-monsoon and lowest during monsoon. There is an effect on the spawning process in which the gametes are released during the period of high salinity; pH and water temperature. This study demonstrated that the culture of S. cucullata can be accepted as an alternative sustainable livelihood in the Sundarbans as no external addition of chemical nutrients to enhance the growth of the oysters is required.

AB  - The reproductive cycle of the flat oyster, Ostrea edulis Linnaeus, 1758, in Homa Lagoon, Izmir Bay, Turkey was examined from August 2008 to July 2009. Gonad samples were analysed histologically in order to determine the sex ratio and gonad development stage. Overall, the sex ratio was recorded as 2.2% female, 42.6% male, 37% hermaphrodite and 17.9% inactive. Glycogen content showed considerable variations between August and February, but decreased gradually thereafter. However, glycogen did not directly affect the reproductive cycle. Total lipid content was positively correlated with temperature and inversely correlated with salinity. In addition, this parameter was influenced by the reproductive activity, which is correlated with the fluctuation of the condition index and gonad index (P<0.05). However, the relationship between the protein index and the gonad index was negative (P<0.05). The results of this study showed that protein was the major energy resource. The condition index varied between 2.69 +/- 0.91 (February) and 12.29 +/- 1.45 (April) during the year. With respect to meat yield, oyster quality changed from "fine" to "special", except in December and February.

AB  - The Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) is the most common bivalve species bred in the Slovenian sea. The mussels are bred on three locations, i.e., Seca Strunjan and Debeli rtic in natural fisheries-shellfish farms. From November 2007 to October 2008, 960 adult cultured Mediterranean mussels were randomly sampled and included in our study. Water temperature, oxygenation and salinity were measured at each sampling. The mussels were measured and weighted to calculate the condition index and microscopically examined for the presence of hydroids. No increased mortality occurred during the sampling. Hydroids of Eugymnanthea inquilina were detected with 60.6% prevalence, mostly during summer. They were either attached to the mantle epithelium or found inside the mantle cavity. No alterations were observed at the point of attachment. The differences in the prevalence of infection in different seasons were statistically significant. Oxygen content and salinity had a statistically significant impact on the presence of infection, while temperature did not. The average condition index of mussels inhabited by E. inquilina was significantly lower than in uninfected mussels, indicating a parasitic relationship between Mytilus galloprovincialis and Eugymnanthea inquilina.
   This is the first report on the occurrence of E. inquilina in Mediterranean mussels from the Slovenian sea.

AB  - Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) provides protection for freshwater life promoting healthy ecosystems and safeguarding human health. Biological Diatom Index (BDI) was developed to indicate the ecological status and water quality of freshwater systems. This paper evaluates the relations between the two different indices. During rising and falling, water samples were taken in the Curuai Floodplain, Brazil. CWQI was calculated using 14 physicochemical parameters and 1 microbiological parameter. The limits were established according to freshwater quality conditions and standards based on water use classes 1 and 2 determined in CONAMA 357 legislation and British Columbia. Canadian Water Quality Index categorization ranged from "marginal" to "excellent," most sampling units were "good" (71%), followed by "fair" (12%) and "excellent" (12%) water quality. Total phosphorus (38 times), chlorophyll a (20), dissolved oxygen (10), and total organic carbon (10) were the parameters that presented the most non-compliance values. Encyonema silesiacum (14%), Gomphonema parvulum (13%), and Navicula cryptotenella (12%) were the main taxa in the rising period, while G. lagenula, E. silesiacum, and Fragilaria capucina were the main taxa during the falling period. BDI ranges from I to V water quality classes. We observed "poor" to "very good" ecological status, with most sampling units "moderate" (52%) and "good" (29%). Water quality for class 2 was better than water quality for class 1, as the limits of the parameters evaluated were more restrictive in class 1 than in class 2 and the predominant uses of water require a higher degree of water purity. The biological index based on diatoms was the most restrictive index whose water classes and categorizations have shown an ecological status that could threaten the protection of aquatic communities on the Curuai floodplain. We suggest the combined use of both indices-physicochemical and biological for water quality assessment in this type of environment.

AB  - Background: Bats are generally highly gregarious, forming large colonies known to favour the transmission and reproduction of ectoparasites. Exposure to parasites is responsible for the natural selection of very diverse behavioural and immune system adaptations that enable the hosts to survive and reproduce. A classic interaction between host and parasite is usually predicted, i.e. selection for more resistant hosts, which in turn leads to selection for more infective parasites. However, among bats and their ectoparasites, there are few examples of the host and parasite driving each other's evolution in this way.
   Site of experiment: Kerend Cave, Kermanshah Province, western Iran.
   Organisms: The Mediterranean horseshoe hat, Rhinolophus euryale and a mite, Eyndhovenia euryalis.
   Question: Does the interaction of host and parasite (horseshoe bat and mite) result in a parasitism-induced cost manifested as reduced host body mass or reduced host body-condition index?
   Methods: Simultaneous measurement of the percent prevalence, parasite load, and intensity of E. euryalis, and the body mass and body-condition index of neonates of R. euryale during the postnatal period in Kerend Cave.
   Results: The parasite load of R. euryale neonates increases rapidly and peaks during the first three weeks of life, before decreasing steadily to its lowest value at the end of the post-natal period. We found no association between changes in parasite load and the body mass of R. eutyale. This indicates that the interaction between the bat and the mite is regulated so that the bat hosts, during their post-natal growth, resist parasites without paying a cost of parasitism in temis either of reduced body mass or body-condition index.

AB  - Ecological benefits provided by ecosystem assets play an important role in improving human wellbeing. However, there are few feasible methods to combine data on the quantity and quality of ecosystem assets to describe their state and trend. Here, we developed a new remote-sensing-based indicator by synthesizing ecosystem asset quantity and quality data for effective assessment at a regional or national scale. The new indicator includes a typological ecosystem asset index (TEAI) (e.g., forest ecosystem asset index) and an integrated ecosystem asset index (IEAI). The TEAI and IEAI can be used to assess the state and trend of a specific ecosystem or set of regional ecosystems, respectively. We applied the new indicator in the context of ecological protection policy in the Three-Rivers Source Region (TRSR), a region known as the 'Chinese water tower'. From 2000 to 2015, the IEAI increased by 4.02% due to an increase in the ecosystem asset area (0.2%) and the ecosystem asset quality (0.66% and 0.02% increases in excellent and good level ecosystem assets, respectively). The implementation of ecological protection and ecological restoration programs was the main direct driver of regional ecological asset improvement. Our results suggest the new indicator is feasible for quickly and accurately evaluating the state and trend of ecosystem assets and can be used to guide ecosystem management at a large regional scale.

AB  - This study was aimed to evaluate the physiological reproductive end points (sex ratio, gametogenic cycle) and biological indices (condition index, length-weight relationship) inD. trunculuscollected monthly over the year 2016, from two sites of the Gulf of Annaba (Northeast Algeria): El Battah (relatively unpolluted site) and Sidi Salem (polluted site). The results showed that gametogenesis takes place from December to August in both sites, with an autumnal resting phase. Also, the spawning occurred between March and August with two major spawning phases: April and August in El Battah vs May and August in Sidi Salem. The condition index showed a significant decrease in Sidi Salem site and positive correlation with gonad index. Moreover, the sites exert a significant effect on the allometric relationship and no significant effect on sex ratio. The observed reproductive events are discussed with the changes in the biological indices and the levels of pollution in the studied sites.

AB  - According to the contemporary ecosystem approach, the linkages of human actions with their environment have to be assessed in an integrative manner. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model is applied to identify and describe processes and interactions in human-environmental systems. An example application from a research project dealing with the development of sustainable management strategies for the agriculture in Jiangsu, China, illustrates the potentials and limitations of its sustainable development. The concept and indicators of ecological integrity are used to assess the indicators in the dimensions of DPSIR between 2003 and 2006. The main drivers included population growth which caused increasing demand for food, growing environmental demands, and rapidly decreasing of land and other natural resources. The main environmental problem was water pollution. The results show that in the dimension of driver, total grain output and agricultural land productivity both increased. Labor intensive agriculture has been promoted to increase agricultural land productivity. In the dimension of pressure, on the positive side, infrastructure got greatly improved, the input level such as total power of machinery, and level of fertilizer use increased, and level of pesticides use decreased, but on the negative side, cultivated land per capita and irrigation rate decreased, natural resources keep decreased. Environmental pollution indicators such as industrial wastewater discharge and acid rain rate increased in Jiangsu Province. In the aspect of state, ecosystem state was improved, plant coverage index increased, biological abundance index increased, fertilizer productivity increased, eco-environmental quality index increased, but land degradation index also increased. In the aspect of impact, output level increased, output efficiency enhanced, farmer's social economic benefit improved. In the aspect of response, social support was greatly improved, input for environmental governance increased. To assess the effects of environmental governance, Jiangsu government was successful to increase compliance rate of sulfur dioxide emissions, but not so efficient in compliance rate of industrial wastewater discharge.

AB  - Physiology can either be a product of or affect the behavior and ecology of individual animals. Blood plasma chemistry contains many components that are indicative of several aspects of a bird's physiological state at the time of sampling. Plasma chemistry is routinely used in clinical settings. However, despite its potential application in ecological studies, few birds have published reference values for these parameters from wild populations. Here, we analyzed the blood plasma chemistry for 17 parameters in Short-toed Snake Eagles (Circaetus gallicus) captured in southern Spain. Most values did not differ between age classes and sexes. However, we found differences between our captive and wild populations of fledgling eagles. These differences arose primarily in parameters associated with nutritional condition, as we expected due to captive individuals being fed ad libitum prior to blood draws. We also compared urea levels and a body condition index with hatching date and found a much stronger relationship with urea than the body condition index. Our results demonstrate the necessity to obtain blood chemistry reference values from wild populations and not just captive individuals, and also illustrate how these parameters can complement other traditional data collected when handling birds in the field.

AB  - Environmental conditions in the Mid-Atlantic region of United States are presently being documented in a series of reports that use,environmental report cards' to summarize the condition of individual natural resources (e.g. estuaries, streams, forests, and landscapes) over the entire region and within major subregions. An 'index of environmental integrity' (10) approach has been developed and is illustrated using the information content of these report cards to evaluate the overall condition throughout the region. The IEI approach is a four-step process: (1) select individual components for the index, (2) calculate subindex values for each of the individual components, (3) aggregate the subindex values into the overall index, and (4) interpretation of index values. The IEI approach was illustrated by applying to the Mid-Atlantic estuaries and wadable streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands. Because the IEI approach is new, application should not be made without considering issues such as evaluation of the selection of the indicators, weighting scheme, uncertainties, and appropriate way to interpret the values.

AB  - Gulf of Mexico oysters were sampled each winter for 8 y (1986 to 1993) as part of the National Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program. Each oyster was analyzed for the prevalence and infection intensity of the oyster pathogen Perkinsus marinus, condition index, length, sex, and reproductive stage. Interannual variation occurred in each of these biological variables. In some cases, interannual variation was produced by changes in local environmental conditions. In other cases, larger-scale climatic phenomena were implicated. Reproductive stage, length, P. marinus infection intensity, and condition index showed concordant yearly shifts (simultaneous shifts of equivalent direction) in populations from bays as far apart as 500 to greater than or equal to 1000 km. No concordant changes were observed for sex ratio and P. marinus prevalence. Prevalence and sex ratio are less affected by key climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall (salinity) than are the others and, so, are somewhat insulated from climate change. Interannual variations in oyster populations in some regions of the Gulf were chiefly produced by interannual variations in climate, whereas, in other areas, populations were more heavily influenced by variations in the local environment. Sex ratio and P. marinas prevalence showed concordant temporal trends in southern Texas and, for prevalence, southern Florida, but not in the northern Gulf. Length varied concordantly only in the northwestern Gulf region. P. marinus infection intensity, condition index, and reproductive stage were concordant in the northern Gulf from north Texas to northern Florida. Length, condition index, reproductive stage and P. marinus infection intensity were characterized by strong concordancy in interannual variations in the period 1986 to 1990, when a strong El Nino/La Nina shift occurred, and weak concordancy in the period 1990 to 1993, during a period characterized by weak climatic shifts, suggesting that regional concordancy in interannual variations of biological variables in Gulf of Mexico oyster populations may originate from the influence of strong El Nino/La Nina climatic shifts.

AB  - Condition index, reproduction and feeding of three non-obligatory riverine Mekong cyprinids namely Hampala dispar, Hampala macro/epidota and Osfeochilus vitfatus were examined. The samples were from the Nam Ngiep (NN) River and Bueng Khong Long (BKL) Swamp, which are the representative of the lotic- and lentic-environments, respectively. These two habitats lay in the same geographical area but on the opposite banks of the Mekong mainstream. The samplings were conducted between May 2017 and April 2018. There were 365 H. dispar, 259 H. macrolepidofa and 298 O. vittatus samples in this study. The condition index of all three species were beyond 90% implying they can live well in both lotic and lentic environments. Reproductions of all three species were taken place in both environments with two peaks at the onset and end of rainy season. The samples from BKL showed early maturation than NN samples in all three (3) species. Feeding plasticity, though dominant by insects, was observed in Hampala spp., while O. vittatus can utilise any available detritus in both environments. Results clearly show that all the three selected non-obligatory riverine fish species can live very well in either lotic or lentic environments and imply that they can adjust themselves to reservoir environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to generate an easy to use index to evaluate the ecological state of agricultural land from a sustainability perspective. We selected environmental indicators, such as the use of organic soil amendments (green manure) versus chemical fertilizers, plant biodiversity (including crop associations), variables which characterize soil conservation of conventional agricultural systems, pesticide use, method and frequency of tillage. We monitored the ecological state of 52 agricultural plots to test the performance of the index. The variables were hierarchically aggregated with simple mathematical algorithms, if-then rules, and rule-based fuzzy models, yielding the final multi-criteria index with values from 0 (worst) to 1 (best conditions). We validated the model through independent evaluation by experts, and we obtained a linear regression with an r(2) = 0.61 (p = 2.4e-06, d.f. = 49) between index output and the experts' evaluation.

AB  - Based on the data of long-term studies of phytoplankton, an assessment of the current ecological state and the direction of changes in the Saltaim-Tenis lake system (Omsk region) has been carried out. Species composition, structure, abundance, and dominant complexes of phytoplankton are described. The predominance of cyanobacteria in the formation of the population and the dominant phytoplankton complex is established. The trophic level of the lakes corresponds to the eutrophic and polytrophic water category. The saprobity index of water varies from the alpha-oligosaprobic to the beta-mesosaprobic zone. Compared to the mid-20th century, the ecological state of the lake system is stable.

AB  - This study applied and evaluated the temporal change of the Distance to Nature index (D2N) for land use and cover monitoring in the Iran National Forest and its buffer zone (Southern Brazil) between 1986 and 2016. This study addressed the following questions: (1) Which land use dynamics were observed between 1986 and 2016 in the Iran National Forest and its buffer zone? (2) Is the analysis of D2N evolution relevant to assess landscape dynamics in protected areas and their buffer zones? The degree of naturalness decreased after 1986. Statistical analyses showed a significant difference in the D2N values between 1997 and all other years. We observed an increase of D2N values in the 30-year period. The spatial D2N trajectory map between 1986 and 2016 shows where the D2N values changed, and enables us to infer where the differences observed could compromise the ecological condition of the protected area and its buffer zone. The results demonstrate that an analysis by means of D2N can be an effective tool to monitor and assess anthropogenic influences on biodiversity in buffer zones around protected areas.

AB  - The following paper presents the general model of a driving system: IC engine-hydrostatic transmission-load of a vehicle, in the form of area with specified spectrum of variables: torque and velocity. This model allows the analysis of efficiency of hydrostatic driving system and points of work of an IC engine in the field of load characteristics. Mathematical models of the components of the driving system, for the analysed case, are the results of the experimental examination. The concepts of global efficiency and ecological indexes originally introduced are suitable to compare the quality of driving systems working in statistically the same load conditions. It allows the evaluation of the value of those parameters in the whole functioning life of a machine.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to show some experiences of the Department of Biology of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in the development of limnological indices to assess the ecological status of aquatic systems in Colombia. Seven cases are presented ranging from the construction of a multimetric index for the urban wetlands of Bogota, to the development of a method for biomonitoring the water trophic status, based on microalgae encapsulated in alginate. The indices shown consider physical, chemical, and biotic variables in the limnological environments analyzed. Aquatic communities worked were phytoplankton, periphyton, aquatic plants, and aquatic invertebrates. The proposed indices (Limnological Conditions Index of Bogota wetlands-LICOI; Periphytic Diatoms Index of Bogota Wetlands-PDIBW; Biotic Integrity Index for Macroinvertebrate of Cesar swamps BIIM; Limnological State Index for the Canal del Dique swamps-LSI; Limnological River State Index for upper basin of River Chicamocha - LRSI; Habitat Integrity Index for licensed rivers-HII) permit to set ranges of quality and functionality of ecosystems studied. Encapsulated algae, meanwhile, reflected through their growth rates trophic status of water. Thus, technical and scientific methodologies are offered to the environmental authorities, so they can make decisions on the use, restoration and conservation of inland wetlands in the country.

AB  - An understanding of biological characteristics, such as growth patterns, condition, and energy reserves, is important for better understanding the environmental constraints exerted on fish populations. This is especially true for exploited fish stocks in the current context of climate change. Using biological data collected from 2006 to 2009 during bottom trawl research surveys by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) as well as data from 2000 to 2018 in the northwest Atlantic, we sought to improve our knowledge on the seasonal condition of Greenland Halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides juveniles and to better understand the divergence in some life history traits between juveniles captured in these two regions. We validated the use of the Le Cren condition index and evaluated its relationship with energetic status in juvenile (20-32-cm TL) Greenland Halibut. In the EGSL, juvenile condition was higher in winter and spring compared to summer and fall. Such variations may result from this species' pelagic predation activity and prey availability. Juveniles captured in the EGSL during 2016-2017 were larger but had a lower condition index than those captured in the northwest Atlantic, but we found no indication of earlier sexual maturation in the EGSL that could explain the sex ratio differences we observed in catches from these two areas.

AB  - Sea mussels, Mytilus edulis, collected from a relatively unpolluted area of the Eastern Scheldt, were transplanted along contaminated sites of the Western Scheldt for 2 1/2 and 5 months. Several established stress indices were determined such as accumulation of pollutants, adenylate energy charge (AEC), and condition index. Following field exposure, mussels were also subjected to an additional lethal or sublethal stress. The data show that environmental exposure alters the mussel's response to stress, viz., aerial exposure and increased temperature, at the organismal (anoxic survival time), biochemical (AEC), and molecular (heat shock protein synthesis) level. The "stress approach" to assessment of environmental contamination appears to be a promising method to disclose early changes in the organism at a stage when conventional parameters (condition index, AEC) remain still unchanged.

AB  - To elucidate the influences of food deprivation on the mortality of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii, the pearl oysters were held unfed at an environmental seawater temperature of 23-29 degrees C from early June to late September in 1985 (115 days). The mortality of unfed pearl oysters increased from day 70 of unfed cultivation. Cumulative mortalities reached 95% on day 115 from the start of unfed cultivation. During the unfed period, the glycogen content of adductor muscle decreased rapidly during the first week. Dry meat weight losses increased more than 70% and condition index decreased from 13.7 (initial) to 4.0 on day 70 of unfed cultivation. Crystalline style weight also decreased continuously as well as dry meat weight and condition index. On the other hand, wet meat moisture content increased from 81 to 91%.
   It is thought that unfed pearl oysters can not survive when they waste their nutritive reserves and there may be a critical survival limit of pearl oysters under the unfed condition. In this study, when the condition index dropped below 4 and dry meat loss increased more than 70%, the mortality of unfed pearl oysters remarkably increased. These values may be valid indicators for the critical survival limits of pearl oysters under the unfed condition.

AB  - Geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques are useful for the study of natural and man-made disasters. The current research implements remote sensing and a GIS-based approach for drought risk assessment. Traditionally, drought occurs in an area having scanty rainfall and a lesser level of groundwater. It is one of the most complicated and less understood among all natural hazards, as these adversely affects our economy along with the ecology. Droughts mostly lead to lower rainfall causing a falloff in agricultural productivity. It also affects human suffering with disastrous damage to our economy and environment along with life losses. The present work proposes to identify the drought risk zone from Landsat satellite data for the years 2014 and 2017 with the help of different indices through the analytical hierarchy process approach. The Landsat 8 satellites data is used for generating brightness value, land surface temperature, and vegetative condition. The vegetation and agricultural health conditions are used to deduce the drought conditions with the help of vegetation condition index, temperature condition index along brightness value. The correlation was performed among several indices along with land surface temperature (LST) for different land use and land cover classes. The final maps are prepared with satellite-based indices and are classified into four major zones high, moderate, low, no drought with the help of geographic information system (GIS) software. It is observed that the whole research area is distressed with moderate drought with a complex concentration.

AB  - Economic growth is a prerequisite for development while energy is the engine for growth process. In the era of globalization, production cost heavily dependent on energy intensity and efficiency with keeping environmental conditions intact. Therefore, the structuring of a significant environmental index is pre-requisition of the world with energy intensity, energy efficiency. For this objective, this study employs 18-years data set between 2000 and 2018 of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to form a universal aspect of economics, environmental index, and energy efficiency (EEE). The data envelopment analysis (DEA) and arithmetic mean aggregation in the formation of mathematical aggregation mechanisms are applied for empirical analysis. According to the results, Iceland maintained an overall high rank regarding energy efficiency, energy intensity, and environment followed by Greece, New Zeeland, and Norway. In this investigation, Ireland followed by the UK and the USA are the lowest performer regarding energy and environment. Thus, the study concludes that energy (efficiency & intensity) and environment hold complex relations and needs a special set of policies to address them collectively and it is expected that this study can be used as valuable information for the policy making process.

AB  - To investigate biomarkers representing the physiological and biochemical responses of the brackish-water clam Corbicula japonica, we conducted a full factorial-design experiment to test different water-temperature levels (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C), salinity levels (5 and 20 psu), and food-availability levels (0.5 and 2.0 mg suspended solids (SS). ind 1.d 1). Increase in water temperature significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and oxyradical-absorbance capacity (ORAC), leading to lipid peroxidation (i.e., oxidative damage). Salinity activated or inhibited these biochemical markers. Food availability supported a detoxification mechanism against oxidative stress. Principal-components and cluster analyses revealed that a total of eight experimental conditions fell into three groups related to water temperature and/or salinity. The shift from Group I (20 degrees C water temperature) to Group II (25 degrees C water temperature and 5-psu salinity) demonstrated that the condition index, SOD, CAT, and ORAC had significantly decreased. With the further shift to Group III (25 degrees C water temperature and 20-psu salinity), we found a prominent increase in ORAC, which led to oxidative damage but no mortality. We conclude that future habitat changes driven by global warming should be closely watched, particularly given that local anthropogenic disturbances further add to natural ones.

AB  - A lake bioassessment integrity index (LBII) derived from 12 macroinvertebrate metrics was used to evaluate the biological integrity of 19 lakes in five New England States (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Of the 19 lakes classified according to temperature and size (warm, small; warm, large; cold, small; cold, large), 15 lakes had anthropogenic disturbances (including residential, agricultural, silvercultural, and fish stocking), and one minimally disturbed reference lake was selected from each category. The bioassessment index successfully ranked the biological integrity for 17 of the 19 lakes. Index scores of anthropogenically disturbed lakes were significantly higher (P <0.05) than index scores of reference lakes with little disturbance in each temperature and size category, indicating that the index may be useful in separating impacted from non-impacted lakes in the New England States.

To evaluate the impacts of the industrial area and cargo terminal, three areas were considered: Zone 1, (maximum impact), Zone 2 (median risk) and Zone 3 (reference area). All the biological indices used were considered to be excellent indicators of the ecological integrity of the different sectors of the study area and were especially effective for the demonstration of the critical alterations of the fish community of Zone 1 and Zone 2. The simultaneous use of diferents indices family, with diferente assumptions, did strengthen the results enhancing the confidence in the diagnostic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims at assessing the impact of organic pollution on plankton communities of the Oueme River using a Plankton Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) as a tool for ecological heath assessment. Plankton and other environmental data were collected monthly from October 2014 to September 2015. An Organic Pollution Index (OPI) was calculated to classify the sampling sites, and 18 plankton candidate metrics were used to discriminate among the observed organic pollution levels. From this analysis, seven significant metrics were selected for setting up biotic integrity indices. An indicative value (IndVal) was calculated for each plankton species to identify indicator species characteristic of observed ecological statuses. The OPI shows significant organic pollution at sites, such as Kaboua, Vossa and Atchakpa-rejet, and less organic pollution at Kpassa. The plankton Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) value shows significant correlation (r> 0.75) with organic pollution. Three ecological states were identified: Kaboua and Vossa were in fair condition; Kpassa, Toue, Atcherigbe and Affon in very good condition; and all other sites in good condition. Three phytoplankton and four zooplankton species were significantly associated with good conditions, whereas 108 phytoplankton species and 40 zooplankton species were significantly associated with fair conditions within the River basin.

AB  - The long term monitoring of aquatic ecosystems based on chemical analysis is expensive resulting in a lack of time series data for management purposes thus necessitating the need for new cost effective methodologies. This study developed a fish-based index of biotic integrity (FIBI) for monitoring environmental conditions in riverine ecosystems within the Lake Victoria Basin, Kenya. The fish fauna in the basin is poorly studied, less diverse and ecologically specialized than the temperate fauna that provided the origins of the Index of Biotic Integrity. Fish samples were collected by electrofishing from 24 sites during baseflow periods in February, March and July 2004. Validation data were collected from 7 sites with varying levels of degradation. Fish samples were identified, counted and grouped into different trophic groups, relative tolerance to pollution, habitat guild and whether exotic or native to riverine environment. Thirty-three candidate metrics were evaluated for responsiveness to habitat quality and twelve were selected for inclusion in the final index. The index classified 6 of the 7 validation sites according to their levels of degradation. As a bioassessment tool, the index was useful in laying the basis for long-term monitoring of rivers in the Lake Victoria drainage basin. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - While biomarkers are undeniably key tools in aquatic ecotoxicology to measure adverse effects linked to contamination events, their application is often inhibited by monetary constraints negating the possibility of having access to dedicated equipment, special wares, and/or expensive reagents. To offset this bottleneck, we propose three simple physiological biomarkers, quantifiable in bivalves, that are free of cost considerations and that can provide basic knowledge on animal health and water quality. Indeed, condition index (CI), growth index (GI), and SOS response (air-time survival) comprise measurements straightforward enough to perform by any laboratory or science body on the planet. Long-term monitoring or screening studies can be carried out with these biomarkers and they are able to provide robust information notably after exposure of bivalves to either singular or multiple agents of contamination. By highlighting examples of data generated in aquatic studies conducted in Eastern Canada under both laboratory and field situations with different species of marine and freshwater mollusks, we establish the suitability of these biomarkers for assessing environmental contamination. Their relationships with other biomarkers are also shown which further corroborate their value as reliable indicators of ecosystem health.

AB  - The river ecosystem in fragile regions is especially vulnerable to environmental or anthropogenic stressors. The ecological quality and stability of rivers in fragile regions urgently need to be evaluated before the reasonable protection and restoration. In this study, a random-forest-modified bacterial index of biological integrity (RF-BaIBI) was developed for ecological assessment of fragile rivers in the sources of Yangtze River and Yellow River (abbreviated as SYY) in Tibet Plateau, China. Three key bacterial metrics including Enterobacteriale, Fluviicola, and Oxalobacteraceae, were selected for the development of RF-BaIBI using range, responsiveness, redundancy tests, as well as random forest. The weight coefficients of metrics were calculated based on their relative importance to RF-BaIBI: Enterobacteriale (0.41), Fluviicola (0.34) and Oxalobacteraceae (0.25). The feasibility of RFBaIBI was confirmed by its significant correlation with comprehensive environmental index (R-2 = 0.71). Among 45 river sections, those with high or good status accounted for 26%, with moderate 51% and poor 13%. Redundancy and path analysis revealed that livestock grazing density was the most dominant factor influencing ecological conditions of the SYY. Under the pressure of grazing, rivers in the source of Yangtze River displayed higher stability than that of Yellow River via the resistance and co-occurrence network analyses. Compared to that of Yellow River, bacterial communities from the source of Yangtze River exhibited stronger competitive interaction which is very beneficial to the stability of the ecosystem. This study highlighted the great effect of overgrazing on the degradation of river ecological health status in Tibet Plateau based on the quantitative assessment of biotic integrity index, which provides a theoretical basis for the management of grazing in fragile plateau regions.

AB  - This article presents and tests a new method for the retrospective assessment of ecological status assessment of the lakes in accordance with the Ecological State Macophyte Index (ESMI), which is formally used in biological monitoring in Poland. The proposed method is based on three metrics, the Z colonization index, the average maximum depth of lake vegetation C-max, and the Secchi disk depth. Mathematical functions of ecological class were developed on the basis of the mean values of these three indicators in summer for different ecological status classes in 88 stratified lakes in northern Poland and the Leczynsko-Wlodawskie Lake District and five lakes in the catchment area of the Wel River (published data). The new metrics were validated on the basis of literature data-ESMI, C-max, Z and SD values from 11 lakes near Olsztyn (Poland). The obtained results are similar to those calculated based on macrophyte field surveys and can be an alternative of the Ecological State Macophyte Index (ESMI), which is formally used in biological monitoring in Poland. The proposed method makes it possible to compare long-term changes in the ecological state of lakes, because it enables an analogous assessment on the basis of data calculated from historical bathymetric maps showing the distribution of hydro macrophytes (parameters Z and C-max) as well as contemporary data, collected, among others, during hydroacoustic research.

AB  - Using environmental indices (EIs) to rank applications for enrollment in conservation programs is becoming common practice. However, there is little guidance on how it should be done. The indices adopted by existing programs have often been linear, using weighted averages of environmental parameters without explicit consideration of whether they represent a reliable preference ordering on environmental states. Our article investigates society's weights for addressing multiple resource concerns and how functional forms of EIs can influence program outcomes. We propose a means by which preference weights are observed from policymaker actions. Weights for multiple resource concerns are determined and combined with biophysical crop simulation data to create an environmental index (EI) for crop rotations. This index is developed using alternative function forms to score conservation efforts on working cropland and to measure their effect on program outcomes.

AB  - There are many abandoned mines that have completed their economic life in the world and in our country. Because of limited capital power and manpower, it is very difficult to recover all abandoned mines to their pre-mining state. Therefore, environmental problems and their impacts related to abandoned mines are frequently observed. To investigate the impact of the abandoned mercury quarry representing the Ladik neighborhood and its surroundings, 21 samples were collected from the field to represent the creek beds, settlement, pasture, agricultural area and areas separated as abandoned quarries. The results of the chemical analyses obtained from the samples were evaluated using statistical methods. In the dendrograms prepared as soil and placer (cluster analysis), prominent groups were distinguished and interpreted together with the geological structure and anthropogenic factors of the region. The results of the Potential Ecological Risk Index were determined as Zn < M < Cr < Cu < Ni < Pb < As < Hg in the geoaccumulation index, contamination factor, potential ecological risk index and potential ecological risk factor. The concentration of mercury in stream beds in the study area is higher than that in soils. Although the primary factor of this accumulation is of geogenic origin, it has been determined that mining and human activities in the region have an effect.

AB  - The neritic environment is rich in resources and as such plays a crucial role as foraging habitat for multi-species marine assemblages, including sea turtles. However, this habitat also experiences a wide array of anthropogenic threats. To prioritize conservation funds, targeting areas that support multi-species assemblages is ideal. This is particularly important in the Gulf of Mexico where restoration actions are currently ongoing following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. To better understand these areas in the Gulf of Mexico, we characterized two multi-species aggregations of sea turtles captured in different neritic habitats. We described species composition and size classes of turtles, and calculated body condition index for 642 individuals of three species captured from 2011 to 2019: 13.6% loggerheads (Caretta caretta), 44.9% Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempii) and 41.4% green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Species composition differed between the two sites with more loggerheads captured in seagrass and a greater proportion of green turtles captured in sand bottom. Turtles in sand bottom were smaller and weighed less than those captured in seagrass. Although small and large turtles were captured at both sites, the proportions differed between sites. Body condition index of green turtles was lower in sand habitat than seagrass habitat; there was no difference for Kemp's ridleys or loggerheads. In general, smaller green turtles had a higher body condition index than larger green turtles. We have identified another habitat type used by juvenile sea turtle species in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we highlight the importance of habitat selection by immature turtles recruiting from the oceanic to the neritic environment, particularly for green turtles.

AB  - Food-chain changes in urban and industrial sites may limit breeding-time resources (e.g. food availability) for small insectivorous passerines. We used a long-term data set of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), collected from one of the most polluted sites in Finland during the past 23 years to study the effects of metal pollution on body condition of breeding females. Our results show that body mass started to decline already some days before hatching, indicating a preparation of females to forthcoming chick feeding period. We did not find long-term temporal trends in female body condition index (BCI) in spite of considerably reduced metal emissions during the study period. However, females had higher BCI in polluted than in unpolluted areas during the incubation period. For both incubation and nestling periods the body condition was lower for later breeders, though the condition index decreased slightly faster in relation to hatching date in polluted areas, which may be due to more drastic decrease in nutrition rich food abundance. Temperature and clutch size were positively associated with BCI during the incubation period, but not in the nestling period. Overall, our data suggest that environmental pollution modifies important life-history traits, potentially via indirect effects of higher environmental variability and changed phenology in polluted environment.

AB  - A theoretical model of structure and functioning was constructed for the Mediterranean undersea cave ecosystem. This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions.
   This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability.
   The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion cad be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality.
   This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.

AB  - Identification of drought is essential for many environmental and agricultural applications. To further understand drought, this study presented spatial and temporal variations of drought based on satellite derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) on annual (Jan-Dec), seasonal monsoon (Jun-Nov) and pre-monsoon (Mar-May) scales from 1982-2015 in Nepal. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) obtained from NOAA, AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and climate data from meteorological stations were used. VCI was used to grade the drought, and the Mann-Kendall test and linear trend analysis were conducted to examine drought trends and the Pearson correlation between VCI and climatic factors (i.e., temperature and precipitation) was also acquired. The results identified that severe drought was identified in 1982, 1984, 1985 and 2000 on all time scales. However, VCI has increased at the rate of 1.14 yr(-1) (p = 0.04), 1.31 yr(-1) (p = 0.03) and 0.77 yr(-1) (p = 0.77) on the annual, seasonal monsoon and pre-monsoon scales, respectively. These increased VCIs indicated decreases in drought. However, spatially, increased trends of drought were also found in some regions in Nepal. For instance, northern areas mainly in the Trans-Himalayan regions identified severe drought. The foothills and the lowlands of Terai (southern Nepal) experienced normal VCI, i.e., no drought. Similarly, the Anomaly Vegetation Condition Index (AVCI) was mostly negative before 2000 which indicated deficient soil moisture. The exceedance probability analysis results on the annual time scale showed that there was a 20% chance of occurring severe drought (VCI 35%) and a 35% chance of occurring normal drought (35% VCI 50%) in Nepal. Drought was also linked with climates in which temperature on the annual and seasonal monsoon scales was significant and positively correlated with VCI. Drought occurrence and trends in Nepal need to be further studied for comprehensive information and understanding.

AB  - This study employs histological procedure to elucidate the natural cycles of gonadal development in a population of E. radiata in the Cross River, Nigeria. The cycles of condition indices and shell-free dry mass follow a general pattern in which they increased with the sexual maturity of the species till a peak is reached in June when spawning begins. Then there is a gradual decline, as the spawning event progresses, till a minimum is obtained in October when the animal is spent. Thus, the species spawns once in a year during the peak of the rainy season (June to October). The timing of spawning is such that the young larvae stand to profit from the high plankton biomass during the ensuing dry season months.

AB  - Lentic organisms exposed to coal-fired power plant (CFPP) discharges can have elevated trace element concentrations in their tissues, but this relationship and its potential consequences are unclear for lotic organisms. To explore these patterns in a lotic environment, we transplanted Corbicula fluminea from a reference stream to a stream receiving CFPP discharge. We assessed trace element accumulation and glutathione concentration in clam tissue, shell growth, and condition index at five sites along a contamination gradient. Clams at the most upstream and contaminated site had the highest growth rate, condition index, glutathione concentrations, and concentrations of arsenic (7.85 +/- 0.25 mu g/g [dry mass]), selenium (17.75 +/- 0.80 mu g/g), and cadmium (7.28 +/- 0.34 mu g/g). Mercury concentrations declined from 4.33 +/- 0.83 to 0.81 +/- 0.11 mu g/g [dry mass] in clams transplanted into the selenium-rich environment nearest the power plant, but this effect was not as evident at less impacted, downstream sites. Even though dilution of trace elements within modest distances from the power plant reduced bioaccumulation potential in clams, long-term loading of trace elements to downstream depositional regions (e.g., slow moving, silty areas) is likely significant.

AB  - We report on the geographic and temporal variation in pup condition in 20 colonies of New :Zealand fur seals Arctocephalus forsteri around South Island, New Zealand during three consecutive breeding seasons, 1996-98 (n = 6856 pups) and provide hypotheses to explain the observed patterns. Three alternative data combinations are presented to calculate pup condition from body measurements and identify which combination seems to be best suited for analysing geographic patterns. A morphometric index of pup condition was best estimated by comparing all pups in all years using least-squares linear regression of the log(e)-transformed measurements of length vs mass. Condition varied significantly among years and colonies, but not between sexes. We also estimated seasonal changes in pup densities at colonies and investigated the relationship between pup density and condition. Mean pup densities among colonies ranged from 4.94 to 7.46 pups/100 m(2) (summer) and from 4.99 to 7.04 pups/100 m(2) (winter) from 1996-98, and differences between summer and winter densities varied with year. Pup density explained a significant proportion of the variation in pup condition in 1996 and 1998, suggesting that condition is partly density-dependent. After accounting for the effect of density, we found geographic differences in pup condition, and we offer alternative hypotheses to explain these differences. We also show that the 1998 El Nino coincided with a reduction in pup condition. A morphometric index of pup condition seems to be useful as an indicator of spatial and temporal variation in the marine environment.

AB  - We present the Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach that allows for the ranking of major river catchments based on pollution status in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, Africa. The study has a broader applicability to all of Lake Victoria, other African Great Lakes, and all lakes that have riverine discharge. The method presented utilizes water quality and environmental data, local knowledge, and pre-existing literature. The parameters considered were sampled from 2016 to 2018 during the dry season (July sampling) and the wet season (March sampling). Separation power of Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) qualified 11 discriminant metrics for both macroinvertebrate and fish samples into the scoring system of 1, 3 and 5 in the formulation of final Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach. Rivers in the northern section had lower Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach scores, as compared to southern counterparts. The Multi-metric Index of Biotic Integrity methodological approach ranking herein was validated by community perceptions on pollution levels. River Nzoia catchment emerged as the most polluted, followed by River Yala, River Kuja, and Sondu-Miriu. Siltation, domestic washing, litter and refuse emerged as the main agents of pollution. Management authorities ought to reinforce a balanced utilization of the vital water resources to minimize future impacts, and promote catchment wide practices that ensure ecological health sustainability of the lake ecosystem.

AB  - The Fish Assemblage Integrity Index (FAII) was used to determine the status of the fish assemblage in relation to human-induced factors in 3 segments of the Nyagui River, Zimbabwe. The 1(st) and upstream segment, with a relative score of 56.5%, was classified as largely modified. The presence of exotic predators, Micropterus salmoides, that constituted >10% of the fish population sample, was linked to this low score in this segment that had low habitat diversity. The 2(nd) and middle segment had a relative score of 91.6% and was classified as unmodified. Species that are intolerant to habitat modification, which included Opsaridium zambezense, Chiloglanis neumanni and Zaireichthys rotundiceps, were collected. Habitat diversity increased while the proportional abundance of M. salmoides decreased in this segment. The 3(rd) and downstream segment, with a score of 81.5%, was classified as largely natural. This score was mainly obscured by rare and migratory species that were expected at low altitude but were not collected. Nevertheless, intolerant species were collected from this segment. Habitat diversity was highest while the proportional abundance of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, was lowest. It is recommended that more studies be carried out to test the consistency of the FAII in determining the impact of introduced species on native species, and to test the impact of other human activities on fish communities in Zimbabwean rivers.

AB  - Seasonal changes in the abiotic factors and cyclical events - with the reproduction diagnosed by the gonadosomatic index and the energy status diagnosed by the condition index - were estimators of seasonal growth for juvenile and adult lebranche mullets, Mugil liza, during the rainy and dry seasons in a tropical estuarine system of the western south Atlantic. Fish were collected monthly by gillnets of different mesh sizes. Salinity, water temperature (degrees C) and dissolved oxygen (%) were measured using a multiparameter. Daily rainfall data (mm) were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology. Seasonal rings were identified and counted in the sagittae otoliths. Relative Marginal Increment (RMI) was calculated to determine the seasonal growth rate. Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and Condition Index (CI) were assessed separately for juveniles and adults by anova, with time (month) M.liza growth is controlled by annual cycles of biological and abiotic processes. Using general linear models, the seasonal growth rate of M.liza was well predicted by body condition and rainfall for juveniles, and by salinity for adults. Seasonal variation was observed in the Mundau Lagoon, with rainfall directly or indirectly being the main seasonal factor influencing the cyclical biological fish processes of M.liza.

T2  - ESTUARIES
LA  - English
AB  - Oyster Condition Index (CI) was partitioned, using a moving average filter, into seasonal cycles and long-term trends in the James, York, and Rappahannock rivers for the period 1970-1983. Seasonal cyclic fluctuations in CI could be explained partially by changes in salinity and number of days within various temperature regimes. Long-term trends in the James River show a steady increase in CI over the study period, while a concurrent decline was noted in the Rappahannock River. Superimposed on these trends is a 4 to 5 yr cycle that is in synchrony with river discharge (salinity). In the York River, CI peaked in 1975-1976 at all stations. Measured environmental parameters do not sufficiently explain the trends. We speculate that the differences in the Rappahannock and james rivers may be due to a decline in bottom oxygen as a result of gravitational circulation differences.

AB  - In recent years, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used in various industries due to their antibacterial properties, which lead to an increase in pollution of the environment and soil ecosystems. However, the ecological effects of soil pollution by AgNPs were poorly studied than that with AgNPs of other metal-based NPs. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of AgNPs on the biological properties of Haplic Chernozem. Silver was introduced into the soil in the form of AgNPs with a concentration of 0.5; 1; 5; 10; 50, and 100 mg/kg in laboratory conditions. The influence of AgNPs on the biological properties of Haplic Chernozem was assessed 30 days after contamination. The degree of reduction in biological properties depends on the AgNPs concentration in the soil. This study showed that the sensitivity to contamination by AgNPs in the total number of bacteria and enzymatic activity was more than that in the abundance of bacteria of the genus Azotobacter. The integrated index of biological state (IIBS) of Haplic Chernozem was decreased by contamination with AgNPs. Silver nanoparticles in the concentration of 10 mg/kg caused a decrease in the indicator by 13% relative to the control. It also decreased IIBS by doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg by 22 and 27% relative to the control. All used biological indicators could be used for biomonitoring, biodiagnosis, bioindication, and regulation of ecological condition of soil contamination by AgNPs.

AB  - Conservation planning is increasingly using "coarse filters" based on the idea of conserving "nature's stage". One such approach is based on ecosystems and the concept of ecological integrity, although myriad ways exist to measure ecological integrity.
   To describe our ecosystem-based index of ecological integrity (IEI) and its derivative index of ecological impact (ecoImpact), and illustrate their applications for conservation assessment and planning in the northeastern United States.
   We characterized the biophysical setting of the landscape at the 30 m cell resolution using a parsimonious suite of settings variables. Based on these settings variables and mapped ecosystems, we computed a suite of anthropogenic stressor metrics reflecting intactness (i.e., freedom from anthropogenic stressors) and resiliency metrics (i.e., connectivity to similar neighboring ecological settings), quantile-rescaled them by ecosystem and geographic extent, and combined them in a weighted linear model to create IEI. We used the change in IEI over time under a land use scenario to compute ecoImpact.
   We illustrated the calculation of IEI and ecoImpact to compare the ecological integrity consequences of a 70-year projection of urban growth to an alternative scenario involving securing a network of conservation core areas (reserves) from future development.
   IEI and ecoImpact offer an effective way to assess ecological integrity across the landscape and examine the potential ecological consequences of alternative land use and land cover scenarios to inform conservation decision making.

AB  - Bivalve reefs are vital ecosystem engineers but have declined or disappeared in many regions. In the Firth of Thames (FOT), north-east New Zealand, overfishing, sedimentation or both led to the virtual extinction of extensive reefs of green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus). The mussel reefs have not recovered since commercial fishing ceased in 1968, possibly because the muddy sediments that replaced the reefs are an unsuitable habitat for adult mussels. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted mussels into cages on the seafloor for 500 days at three sites along a turbidity gradient (average visibility 0.8-4.7 m) within the mussel reefs' former range for 500 days. Results showed that 68% of individuals survived the experiment and grew an average of 19 mm in length. Survivorship and growth did not differ between sites. However, at the completion of the experiment, mussels from the least turbid site were in better condition (condition index 15) than those from the most turbid site (condition index 10). Our results suggest that the current lack of recovery of mussel reefs in the FOT is attributable to low recruitment and survivorship of juvenile mussels. Restoration of mussel reefs and the ecosystem services that they provide may therefore be possible.

AB  - Floodplain integrity can be defined as the ability of a floodplain to support essential geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological functions that maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Humans alter floodplain functionality by changing the physical landscape of the floodplain or by altering river flow regimes and subsequent floodplain inundation dynamics. This research evaluates floodplain integrity by assessing the prevalence of anthropogenic modifications to hydrology and landscape. Specifically, the objectives of this research are to: 1) develop a methodology to assess floodplain integrity using geospatial datasets available for large spatial scales; and 2) use the methodology to evaluate spatial patterns of floodplain integrity in the state of Colorado. To accomplish these objectives, we evaluated the critical floodplain functions of attenuating floods, storing groundwater, regulating sediment, providing habitat, and regulating organics and solutes. At present, this work is the first to quantify the integrity of specific floodplain functions instead of measuring floodplain health solely by ecological integrity. We applied the index of floodplain integrity methodology in the state of Colorado to analyze the integrity of each of the five floodplain functions and the aggregated overall integrity. In Colorado, overall floodplain integrity decreased as stream order increased above third order streams. Floodplain integrity was also lower in floodplains that intersected urban areas than those that did not, which indicates the index of floodplain integrity captured the adverse relationship between development and floodplain health established in literature. By quantifying anthropogenic reductions to floodplain functionality at broad spatial scales, the index of floodplain integrity can help target restoration efforts towards the most affected functions and areas.

AB  - A complex method for assessing the ecological state of groundwater by using indicators and indexes of underground hydrosphere sustainable development, and of characterizing its quality, is given for an oil field. The concept of forming indicators and indexes of sustainable development has been elaborated for this purpose. When forming a structure of environment indicators, the developments of the European Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in this sphere were considered. New indicators are given and a structure of indexes quantitatively characterizing them is worked out. Indexes can be simple, complex, multidisciplinary and inter-multidisciplinary by their structure. By their essence indexes are subdivided into five classes: indexes of quality, damage, interaction, hydrogeochemical and dynamic ones. The ecological state of groundwater is assessed by the following categories of sustainability: sustainable, slightly unsustainable, medium unsustainable, unsustainable, highly unsustainable, catastrophically unsustainable.

AB  - The water quality, physico-chemical and the ecological state assessment of the water bodies of the trans-boundary Mesta River during the period 2009-2010 were discussed. The MDS analysis illustrated that similarities between species composition of the macrozoobenthos at the studied sites are based on the level of the anthropogenic impact rather than the differences between the main river and its tributaries. Comparison with the last published data (1999-2000) demonstrated processes of stabilization of the aquatic ecosystem as a result of improvement of the water quality and the ecological state of the studied river ecosystem. During the last 25 years, shifts in species composition, decreases in species richness and reorganization in the trophic structure of the benthic fauna were detected in the referent site Demyanitsa.

AB  - This study was done to determine the relative effects of five variables (sex, soft tissue dry weight, condition index, width:height ratio, chronological age) on the concentrations of 24 elements in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and to develop an improved protocol for collecting mussels for biological monitoring programs.  The five explanatory variables were treated as independent variables in a multiple regression equation with the individual element concentrations being included as the dependent variable.  A multivariate test was also performed.  An initial test showed that chronological age per se had no significant effect on the concentrations of any of the elements; therefore, it was dropped from the equation.  Condition index and soft tissue dry weight showed a high degree of negative association with element concentrations.  This was explained as being due to growth rate differences (dilution effect).  An improved condition index is suggested.  Sex was also a major factor in determining element concentrations with the greatest effects being noted for manganese, copper, arsenic, and selenium (females greater than males).  The width:height ratio showed a lesser but significant positive effect on element concentrations which was also considered to be due to growth rate differences (dilution effect).  It is recommended that mussels only be collected from sites with similar maximum shell lengths.  To ensure similar growth rates, all mussels from all sites should be of similar shell length and approximately 70-90% of the maximum potential length observed at the particular site where collected.  Preexamination of mussels at each site should be done to ensure that the average condition index and width:height ratio (shell shape) of the mussels to be collected are similar.  It is preferable to collect mussels subtidally, if available, during the late winter before significant spawning activity.  Separate composite samples of male versus female mussels should be analyzed.  When the above protocol is not feasible, an alternate statistical method is suggested which will enhance the interpretability of the results.

AB  - The common guillemots, Uria aalge, found stranded at the Belgian coast, display high levels of Cu in both liver and kidneys. The condition index of the animals.. defined as the ratio of liver to kidneys mass (Wenzel & Adelung, 1996, The suitability of oiled Guillemots (Uria aalge) as monitoring organisms for geographical comparisons of trace element contaminants. Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 31, 368-377), influences both the metal concentration and its binding to metallothioneins (MT): the lower the condition index, the more emaciated the animals, and the higher the total Cu concentration and the concentration of Cu bound to MT. In less robust individuals, our results suggest that Cu could displace Zn from MT, rendering the Zn ions available to induce a new MT synthesis. Sex-related effects also emerged as significantly higher hepatic MT as well as Cu- and Zn-MT concentrations were found in emaciated male guillemots compared to females. In both organs, Cd concentrations remained low and typically demonstrated an age-dependent renal accumulation, with no noticeable effect of the condition index. As a whole, these results suggest that, for guillemots found stranded at the Belgian coast, Cu binding to hepatic and renal MT could function as a protective mechanism, rendering the metal ions unavailable to exert any cytotoxic activity.

AB  - Wild brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) occur in large numbers in the grounds of Perth Zoo, Western Australia. These possums are a problem because they consume feed the zoo buys for its captive animals, damage seedlings and trees and many need to be treated for injuries sustained during fights with conspecifics. A contraceptive implant, which contains the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist deslorelin, could be a potential method of managing this population. We tested the efficacy of the implant and its impact on the body-condition index of treated possums with Kaplan-Meier analysis and a mixed model with residual maximum likelihood. We implanted 60 female possums with deslorelin and monitored reproductive success of treated and untreated possums for the following 18 months. At the conclusion of the study, 80% of 20 treated females recaptured had shown no evidence of breeding activity, giving an average minimum duration of effective contraception of 381 days. The implant did not have a negative impact on the body-condition index of treated possums during the course of the study. Our results suggest that deslorelin implants could be an effective management tool for brushtail possums at Perth Zoo and in other urban environments.

AB  - The need to determine the environmental impact caused by economic and human activities has induced a constant search for robust and effective tools that provide useful information for the design of public policies aiming to improve citizens' quality of life. This paper develops a Composite Index of Environmental Performance (CIEP) from the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) methodology proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The CIEP allows us to determine the negative impacts that the driving forces have on the environment and the supposed pressure effect on the natural state of the available resources, which cause harmful effects on human health. In addition, we observe that actions and socio-environmental policies reduce the environmental impact and the mortality rate, while increasing the life expectancy. In relation to the selected indicators, it is realized that richer countries tend to have a better environmental quality and the population growth and density are factors that increase the driving force, which reduces the environmental quality of the countries.

AB  - The definition of environmental indexes is one of the most widely used methods and methodologies for the study of exposure to polluting agents, and it is a highly helpful instrument for describing the quality of the environment in a simple and straightforward manner. In this study, index models were presented and described that can be used in evaluating the contamination, pollution and health risks of environmental micro (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) to ecosystems and humans. Index models such as plastic contamination factors (pCf) and pollution load index (pPLI), plastic-bioconcentration or accumulation factors (pBCf or pBAf), plastic-biota-sediment accumulation factor (pBSAf), biota accumulation load index (BALI), polymer risks indices (pRi), polymer ecological risks index (pERI) while plastic estimated daily intake (pEDI) and plastic carcinogenic risks (pCR) were described for oral, dermal and inhalation pathways. All index modeled were further described based on polymer types of MPs/NPs. The final value is represented by a quantity that measures a weighted combination of sub-indices and defined by an appropriate mathematical function. The central concept is to present an indicator that can describe, in a clear and concise manner, the level of MPs/NPs in the environment, thereby indicating where it would be necessary to intervene and where it would not in order to improve overall environmental conditions.

AB  - Seasonal variations in condition index and biochemical composition of the cockle Fulvia mutica (Reeve) were studied from March 2004 to February 2005 in eastern coast of China in relation to reproductive cycle. The condition index declined during gametogenesis and spawning, recovered when the gonad was in resting phase. Histological analysis and measurements of protein, glycogen and lipid levels and RNA:DNA ratio from gonad-visceral mass, mantle, adductor muscle, and foot of F. mutica were performed. Gametogenesis took place during winter and spring at the expense of reserves (glycogen in various organs, protein in the foot, lipid in the adductor muscle), which were accumulated previously during summer and autumn. Spawning occurred in May to June when water temperature was higher and food availability was abundant. The RNA:DNA ratio is a good indicator of sexual maturity in the gonad-visceral mass; the increasing RNA:DNA ratio in the gonad-visceral mass appears to show the rising synthetic activity of vitellin within the gonad. The results demonstrated that F. mutica may be considered a conservative species in gametogenic pattern. The useful information obtained in this study can be applied for management of populations and to initiate aquaculture activities in this species.

AB  - Large numbers of parasites are found in various organs of anuran amphibians, with parasite intensities thought to modulate the host's Darwinian fitness traits. Interaction between the anuran hosts and their multiple parasites should modulate the host's phenotypic characteristic, such as those associated with high energetic demand (such as calling effort and locomotor performance), energy balance (standard metabolic rate), and morphological plasticity (as indicated by organ masses). The present study investigated the impact of parasite intensities on the behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits of wild adult male Rhinella icterica (Anura: Bufonidae). We tested as to whether individuals with higher parasite intensities would present: 1) lower vocal calling effort in the field, as well as poorer locomotor performance and body-condition index; and 2) higher standard metabolic rates and internal organ masses. Measurements included: calling effort in the field; standard metabolic rate; locomotor performance; parasite intensity; internal organ masses (heart, liver, kidneys, intestines, stomach, lungs, hind limb muscle, and spleen); and the body-condition index. Results showed a negative association of parasite intensities with locomotor performance, and standard metabolic rate of R. icterica. A positive association between parasite intensities and relative organ masses (heart, intestines and kidneys) was also evident. Toads with higher pulmonary and intestinal parasites intensities also showed higher total parasite intensities. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of this work is to present several new lake management models for small, glacial lakes. The models are driven by simple, readily available ''map parameters'' describing the catchment area (like the percentage of mires, lakes, and forests) and the lake (area, volume, mean depth, etc.). The first step is to predict important limnological state variables (pH, total P, and colour); the second step involves predicting state indices describing the abundance of key functional groups (fish, phytoplankton and bottom fauna) and indices of special interest in lake management (Secchi depth and toxins in fish used for human consumption); and the last step concerns the definition of a lake ecosystem index based on the state indices. The ecosystem index characterizes the entire lake over extended periods (months to years) and not specific sites or sampling events. Lake indices can be obtained for a region or a country and the development can be illustrated with trend analyses. If these trends are linked to remedial measures, the effect of the remedies can be discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of cost-benefit analyses. Calculations like this use Geographical Information Systems together with regional models based on map parameters.

AB  - Biological parameters including allometry, condition index and secondary production were estimated for Barbatia decussata on rocky intertidal shores in the northern Persian Gulf (Iran) between August 2011 to September 2012. Relationship between shell dimensions (length, height, width, hinge) as well as relationship between shell length and weight (total wet weight, tissue wet weight, tissue dry weight, tissue ash free dry weight, shell dry weight, shell ash free dry weight) were estimated with b (equilibrium constant) values ranging from 3.023 to 3.347 (3.180 +/- 0.120). The b value between shell length and total wet weight was 3.181, indicating positive allometric growth pattern. Relationships between shell length-total wet weight (TLW), shell length-tissue wet weight (WW), shell length-tissue dry weight (DW), shell length-tissue ash free dry weight (AFDW), shell length-shell dry weight (sDW) and shell length-shell ash free dry weight (sAFDW) were 0.0001xSL(3181), 0.000015SL(3347), 0.000006SL(3169), 0.000004SL(3234), 0.000074SL(3150) and 0.000004SL(3.023), respectively. The condition index varied from 13.80 to 20.26 increasing from January 2012 to August 2012. Annual production, mean biomass and production to biomass ratio (P/) were 6.31 (g AFDWm(-2) year(-1)), 5.52 (g AFDWm(-2)) and 1.14year(-1) respectively.

AB  - Bottom sediments are resuspended into the water column during dredging operations. These resuspended sediments are an often cited concern used to justify restrictions applied to dredging schedules in many areas of the USA. One example of a temporal restriction, commonly referred to as an environmental window, involves dredging schedules in the James River, Virginia, because of potential impacts on the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin). Yet, effects' data are lacking to understand the effects of suspended sediments to C. virginica. To address this data gap, we performed a laboratory study mimicking sediment resuspension during annual dredging operations in the James River. Field-collected oysters were exposed for 7 days under flow-through conditions to 0, 100, 250, and 500-mg/L total suspended solids (TSS) in a unique exposure system where oyster movements could be electronically monitored. Endpoints analyzed were survival, percent of time open, total number of shell movements, weight change, and condition index. Data indicated no significant effects of suspended sediment on these endpoints after 7 days of exposure. Weight change in oysters attached vertically to monitor their movements was significantly less than in oysters not monitored in every treatment. No significant differences in condition index, an indicator of oyster growth sensitive to environmental pollutants, were observed among treatments measured 30 days postexposure. Correlations performed for each treatment among monitored oyster endpoints found significant negative associations between number of movements and percent open in the 100, 250, and 500-mg/L TSS treatments and in all treatments combined. These data will help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the effects of suspended sediments on C. virginica.

AB  - Some parameters of the biological activity (humus content; activity of hydrolytic enzymes invertase, phosphatase, urease; and the intensity of carbon dioxide emission) were studied in the chernozems of agrocenoses and native biogeocenoses in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains representing the Terskii variant of the altitudinal zonality. The statistically significant differences were revealed between the relevant characteristics of the soils of the agrocenoses and of the native biogeocenoses. The integral index of the ecological-biological state of the soils was used to estimate changes in the biological activity of the arable chernozems. The 40-60% decrease of this index in the cultivated chernozems testified to their degradation with a decrease in fertility and the disturbance of ecological functions as compared to these characteristics in the virgin chernozems.

AB  - The present study was conducted to link the heavy metal load in three species of mussels (Perna perna, Mytella falcata and Mytella guyanensis) from the estuaries and bays around Vitoria island, south-east of Brazil, with the salinity gradient and the heavy metal levels in the abiotic environment (including water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment). Primarily based on the salinity gradient, a total of 26 sites around Vitoria Island were selected for sampling of water, SPM, sediments and organisms. Besides tissue metal levels, the condition index and energy stores (glycogen, lipid and protein) were quantified as an indicator of fitness in response to metal pollution. Dissolved metals in water indicate that Cd and Mn content was higher along Espirito Santo Bay, while Al, Co, Cu, Cr and Fe were elevated in the sites with low salinity such as river mouths, estuarine and sewage canals. Likewise, suspended matter sampled from low salinity sites showed a higher heavy metal load compared to moderate and high salinity sites. Though mussels were sampled from different sites, the contamination for Cd, Cu, Fe and Mn was higher in mussels inhabiting low salinity sites (M. guyanensis and M. falcata) compared to P. perna, a high saline water inhabitant. However, a higher Zn body burden was observed for P. perna compared to Mytella species. Tissue Fe accumulation (but not Mn and Zn) correlated with heavy metal levels in suspended material for all three species, and for M. falcata this correlation also existed for Cd and Cu. Energy store and condition index in allmussels varied depending on the sampling sites and correlated with salinity gradient rather than tissue metal concentration. Overall, metal concentration in mussels did not exceed the safe levels as per the international standards for metals, and would be of no risk for human consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estuarine artificialization eliminates estuarine ecosystems' original natural attributes on which estuarine health and function are dependent, and induces various ecological and social problems. Preventing estuaries from being overly artificialized and implementing ecological restoration for damaged estuaries is an urgent management concern. This study intended to quantitatively identify the artificialized-degree of estuarine areas of interest at different stages to depict their state evolution trajectory by acquiring and analyzing the spatiotemporal maps of estuarine ecosystem naturalness. The Xiaoqinghe estuary, located in the southern coast of Laizhou Bay, was selected as a case study area. The ecosystem naturalness and regional naturalness in this estuary were evaluated through the developed naturalness index, which integrates the dynamic information of land cover and human interference intensity into an assessment framework of ecosystem naturalness spectrum created here. Results showed that the Xiaoqinghe estuary was.a relatively natural estuary with higher naturalness in the early 1980s, but was highly artificialized in 2010-2015, with its average naturalness reducing by 43% over the past three decades. Those areas occupied by salt marshes and shrub-grass lowlands in 1984 have greatly deviated from their original natural state due to the highest loss of regional naturalness. The current state characteristics suggest that the Xiaoqinghe estuary has considerably lost its ability to conserve biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, and the intensity and manner of human activities should be adjusted and limited spatially. The findings and methodology illustrated in this paper can also contribute to the sustainable management of artificialized estuaries elsewhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Triploid Crassostrea gigas were cultured during 13 months in Nestier-type oyster trays. The impact of environmental parameters on the physiological and immunological parameters was evaluated. Temperature, salinity and seston were recorded monthly. Seventeen oysters were sampled monthly for immunological and condition index (CI) analyses. Samples were obtained as a haemolymph lysate supernatant (HLS). Protein content was determined using the Bradford method. The activity of hydrolytic enzymes was determined using the API ZYM kit and the lysoplate assay. Seston showed different patterns throughout the cycle. Condition index showed a positive correlation with the protein content of HLS. Protein showed a negative correlation with temperature. Eleven hydrolytic enzymes were detected in samples and higher enzymatic activity corresponded to leucine arylamidase and esterase. Leucine arylamidase and lysozyme activity showed a positive correlation with temperature. Oyster mortality was 28% in our modules and 70% in the oyster farm. Oysters showed low values of CI and haemolymph protein content in summer-autumn when mortalities were observed in the culture system. This finding suggests that these stressed oysters may have insufficient energy to invest in their immune system. It appears that oyster mortality in the culture system resulted from a combination of animal overcrowding, high temperature and low salinity.

AB  - Climate change has proved to be a threat to food security the world over. Using temperature and precipitation data, this paper examines the differential effects climate change has on different land uses in the Luvuvhu river catchment in South Africa. The paper uses the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which were calculated from Landsat images, and the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) for a sample of years between 1980 and 2016 to assess how drought and flood frequency have affected the agricultural environment. The results indicate that the lowest SPI values were recorded in 1996/1997, 2001/2002 and 2014/2015, suggesting the occurrence of drought during these years, while the highest SPI values were recorded in 1997/1998, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. The relationship between three-month SPI (SPI_3) and VCI was strongest in grassland, and subsistence farming areas with the correlation coefficients of 0.8166 (p = 0.0022) and -0.6172 (p = 0.0431), respectively, indicating that rainfall variability had a high negative impact on vegetation health in those land uses with shallow-rooted plants. The findings of this study are relevant to disaster management planning in South Africa, as well as development of farming response strategies for coping with climate hazards in the country.

AB  - The provenance of observations from a Sensor Web enabled remote sensing application represents a great challenge. There are currently no representations or tracking methods. We propose a provenance method that represents and tracks remote sensing observations in the Sensor Web enabled environment. The representation can be divided into the description model, encoding method, and service implementation. The description model uses a tuple to define four objects (sensor, data, processing, and service) and their relationships at a time point or interval. The encoding method incorporates the description into the Observations & Measurements specification of the Sensor Web. The service implementation addresses the effects of the encoding method on the implementation of Sensor Web services. The tracking method abstracts a common provenance algorithm and four algorithms that track the four objects (sensor, data, processing, and service) in a remote sensing observation application based on the representation. We conducted an experiment on the representation and tracking of provenance information for vegetation condition products, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Our experiments used raw Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to produce daily NDVI, weekly NDVI, and weekly VCI for the 48 contiguous states of the United States, for May from 2000 to 2012. We also implemented inverse tracking. We evaluated the time and space requirements of the proposed method in this scenario. Our results show that this technique provides a solution for determining provenance information in remote sensing observations.

AB  - Landscapes constitute the manifestation of natural and anthropic elements and its structure is the result of physical, biological, political, economic and social interactions, fragmented or connected for different land uses. Drawing on this, our study aims to analyze the environmental landscape quality using ecological indices in the Tiete-Jacare Hydrographic Basin - SP, Brazil between 2007 and 2017. A set of Environmental Quality Indices was used to analyze the susceptibility of the ecological components to the effects of human activities. The Environmental Quality Index of Vegetation, the Environmental Quality Index of Water Resources and the Environmental Vulnerability Index were used to assess the condition of ecological sustainability of the landscape. It was identified a reduction in the areas with native vegetation with a loss of 2.72%, representing over 32,149 ha, an expansion of agricultural areas of 2.05% (24,507.53 ha) and consequently a reduction of the environmental quality in the landscape. These impacts compromise the ecosystem structure and ecosystem services, per example, through the impacts on soils that support vegetation cover as the major sources of energy for terrestrial life. The observed intensification of anthropogenic activities and the corresponding reduction of natural areas often lead to the loss of biodiversity and the benefits that its ecosystem services provided to people.

AB  - In order to quantitatively understand the ecological environment and social conditions in Yinchuan, this study established a regional environmental fragility assessment system based on topography, climate and socio-economic data. Based on the geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), Using spatial principal component analysis model, changes in environmental fragility were analyzed for Yinchuan, China, from 2002 to 2016. The results reveal fragile grade of Yinchuan District changed from level III to level II, but fragile grade of Lingwu City changed from II to III level. Over the past 10 years, the ecological fragility of Yongning County and Helan County has been at the level I. The environmental fragility index of the Yinchuan District and Lingwu City was significantly higher than environmental fragility index in Yongning County and Helan County. It reflects that the ecological stability in Yongning County and Helan County is better than that in Yinchuan District and Lingwu City, and the urbanization was one of the important factors in economically underdeveloped regions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of organic farming, in field (OF) and in glass-house (OFG), on selected soil biochemical properties compared with conventional farming (CF) in a horticultural area characterized by the same climate, soil type and topography. Results show that all soil enzyme activities were generally higher in OFG compared with OF and CF systems. Because of the different conditions of temperature, OFG presented a major loss of organic matter too. Catalase activity, metabolic potential (NIP) and biological index of fertility (BIF) are suggested as the most suitable soil biological indicators for differentiating between organic (OF and OFG) and conventional (CF) farming systems. Organic farming systems, because of application of organic amendments and less deep tillage, showed a greater capacity to improve soil quality as compared with conventional production practices.

AB  - Introduction: This review explores the potential correlation between conditions associated with chronic inflammation and measures of violence across five socioeconomic subgroups. The hypothesis being that since chronic inflammation is associated with increased aggression, an extreme version of which is violence, there should be a correlation between incidents of violence and diseases with one or more inflammatory factors, without an equivalent correlation with the contrast group. An extension of this reasoning would predict a higher correlation among lower socio-demographic index (SDI) populations as a result of fewer resources to prevent either inflammatory disease or violent crime.
   Methods: In order to examine this potential correlation, an analysis was made comparing rates of change in incidence between violence, inflammatory conditions, and a contrast group disease of noninflammatory nature, as determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: In the low socio-demographic index, inflammatory conditions demonstrated 80% correlation with interpersonal violence, middle-low socio-demographic index inflammatory conditions demonstrated 60% correlation with interpersonal violence, middle sociodemographic index inflammatory conditions demonstrated 0% correlation with interpersonal violence, middle-high socio-demographic index inflammatory conditions demonstrated 60% correlation with interpersonal violence, and high socio-demographic index inflammatory conditions demonstrated 40% correlation with interpersonal violence.
   Discussion: The majority of socio-demographic groups showed a significant correlation between rates of change in incidence of violence and inflammatory conditions. This correlation was not found with a similar frequency or strength in diseases not causally linked to inflammation. As predicted in the hypothesis, the highest correlations of inflammatory diseases with violence existed in the lower socio-demographic populations, supporting a link between inflammatory levels and incidences of violence.

The ecological status of Lake Dlugie was determined with traditional water quality evaluation methods, including the "anchor" or "diving and GIS" method. Obtained results show simple GIS techniques for registering submerged plant communities supplemented with terrain investigations involving scuba diving, producing more accurate data than those acquired with traditional methods.

AB  - Before the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation, supplementary treatment could be used for controlling pollution index. In order to evaluate the filtration and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) application on wastewater quality index, the SDI system based on wastewater reuse and three treatments (three replications) was applied. These treatments were controlled by; drip irrigation with drinking water (CH), surface drip irrigation with treated wastewater (DI) and subsurface drip irrigation with treated wastewater (SDI). There was also a SDI filtration to improve biological index of wastewater. The results showed that the values of BOD(5), TSS and nitrogen component adequately decrease during filtration, but ideally the microbiological factors did not improve. Under this condition, injection of treated wastewater below the soil surface (SDI system) could decrease the surface microbiological pollution significantly in comparison to CH. In overall, the SDI system which applies wastewater reuse can be introduced as a substitute system for supplementary treatment unit.

AB  - Background: Heat stress indexes integrate several variables of the thermal environment in a single figure and predict their impact on animal welfare and performance. The correct interpretation of these indexes is of help in the choice of more adequate measures to attenuate the stress caused by the heat. Therefore, the aim of this research is to examine some of the heat stress indexes mentioned in the literature and to decide which ones best reflect the potential impact of meteorological conditions on the thermal homeostasis of half-blood dairy heifers bred in Uberlandia, Triangulo Mineiro area, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Eight half-blood dairy heifers were exposed to direct sunlight from 9 h to 13 h in the months of November and December of 2016, and also January and February of 2017, 5 days per month on average, in Uberlandia, MG, Brazil. After this challenge, the respiratory rate and the rectal temperature were measured. Simultaneously to the collection of physiological variables, the temperatures of dry bulb and wet bulb, as well as that of black globe, were quantified, as was the wind speed. Afterwards, the solar radiation, the relative humidity, the mean radiant temperature and some heat stress indexes were calculated, the latter being Temperature-Humidity Index, Black Globe-Humidity Index, Equivalent Temperature Index, Environmental Stress Index, Respiratory Rate Index, Thermal Load Index, Environmental Specification Index, Thermal Comfort Index for Dairy Cattle, Comprehensive Climate Index and Cattle Heat Stress Index. These indexes were, then, correlated with the physiological variables. The averages of room temperature, black globe temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, radiant temperature and relative humidity were, respectively, 29.96 degrees C, 41.73 degrees C, 831.02 W/m(2), 0.11 m/s(-1), 318.14 K and 50.51%. Rectal temperature averaged 38.8 degrees C while respiratory rate averaged 41.97 breaths per minute(-1). Correlating the 10 heat stress indexes with these two physiological variables, it was verified that the highest values, with a confidence of 95%, were demonstrated by the Equivalent Temperature Index (0.200 and 0.317, respectively), followed by the Cattle Heat Stress Index (0.186 and 0.314, respectively).
   Discussion: Room temperature was within the thermoneutral zone for half-blood dairy cattle. Nevertheless, the mean radiant temperature and the black globe temperature were higher, due to intense solar radiation. Wind speed was not very expressive and relative humidity was close to what was required. The average values of rectal temperature and respiratory rate were normal, which indicated the heifers are adapted to the thermal environment. Regarding the heat stress indexes, the Equivalent Temperature Index was recommended, as it presented the highest amount of meaningful correlations with the physiological variables, followed by the Cattle Heat Stress Index and the Environmental Stress Index. The average value of the Equivalent Temperature Index remained in the "caution" category, according to the literature's two existing scales for interpretation of said index's results, indicating the occurrence of stress by heat, albeit not severe. In conclusion, the Equivalent Temperature Index is considered the most appropriate heat stress index for evaluating a heat stress situation in half-blood dairy heifers bred in Uberlandia, Triangulo Mineiro, followed by the Cattle Heat Stress Index and the Environmental Stress Index.

AB  - Variations in large-scale atmospheric forcing influence upwelling dynamics and ecosystem productivity in the California Current System (CCS). In this paper, we characterize interannual variability of the North Pacific High over 40 years and investigate how variation in its amplitude and position affect upwelling and biology. We develop a winter upwelling "pre-conditioning" index and demonstrate its utility to understanding biological processes. Variation in the winter NPH can be well described by its areal extent and maximum pressure, which in turn is predictive of winter upwelling. Our winter pre-conditioning index explained 64% of the variation in biological responses (fish and seabirds). Understanding characteristics of the NPH in winter is therefore critical to predicting biological responses in the CCS. Citation: Schroeder, I. D., B. A. Black, W. J. Sydeman, S. J. Bograd, E. L.

AB  - The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.

AB  - Mytilus galloprovincialis is one of recent bivalve species produced in Portugal offshore. The growth, condition index, and the fatty acid composition of the mussel produced at 2 and 13 m depth was compared in longline on the south coast of Portugal. For each depth, a monitoring of several water quality parameters such as temperature, turbidity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a was carried out. There were no significant differences between mussel growths at different depths. On the first sampling, shell length mean was 24 mm, reaching 50 mm 9 months after. High dispersion of mussel length was observed due to slow growers. The condition index shows a typical seasonal variation, with high values in autumn and late spring and minimum values in January. Analysis of fatty acids did not reveal differences at both depths and DHA levels (8.71 mg/g) were generally higher than EPA (5.90 mg/g). The water quality revealed few differences in the environmental conditions in the water column, which may explain the similarities between the quality of mussels produced at different depths. Based on these data, the mussel offshore production in that area can be done at this range of profundities 2 and 13 m, without affecting growth and fatty acid composition.

AB  - Eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica are dominant ecosystem engineers that construct complex reefs in estuarine systems. Reef persistence relies on reef growth, which must outpace reef degradation and sediment deposition. The quantitative impact of burial on oyster survival and sublethal effects of sediment deposition are undefined. In this mesocosm study, we quantified effects of partial and complete burial (0, 50, 70, 90, and 110% of oyster shell height) on survival, biodeposition, condition index and growth of oysters (shell height = 25-75 mm). Survival only declined significantly when 90% or more of an oyster was buried; the critical burial depth inducing 50% mortality was 108%. This finding will allow scaling of mortality rates of oysters as a function of sediment load and oyster size. Biodeposition and condition index were negatively related to burial depth, whereas shell growth increased with burial depth. Decreases in biodeposition and condition index were likely related to disruption of feeding by burial and reallocation of energy resources to shell growth. The increase in shell growth was analogous to vertical migration of infaunal species-buried oysters increased vertical shell growth to breach the sediment surface to feed and respire, at the expense of tissue growth. While oysters are tolerant of partial burial in terms of survival, burial adversely affects metabolic processes that influence demographic rates and reef persistence. Future management efforts should consider the effects of partial burial, which often occur more frequently than catastrophic burial events causing mass mortality.

AB  - The evolution of Russian concepts concerning the assessment of soil suitability for cultivation in relation to several campaigns on large-scale plowing of virgin steppe soils is examined. The major problems of agricultural land use in steppe areas-preservation of rainfed farming in the regions with increasing climatic risks, underestimation of the potential of arable lands in land cadaster assessments, and much lower factual yields in comparison with potential yields-are considered. It is suggested that the assessments of arable lands should be performed on the basis of the soil-ecological index (SEI) developed by I. Karmanov with further conversion of SEI values into nominal monetary values. Under conditions of land reforms and economic reforms, it is important to determine suitability of steppe chernozems for plowing and economic feasibility of their use for crop growing in dependence on macroeconomic parameters. This should support decisions on optimization of land use in the steppe zone on the basis of the principles suggested by V. Dokuchaev. The developed approach for assessing soil suitability for cultivation was tested in the subzone of herbaceous-fescue-feather grass steppes in the Cis-Ural part of Orenburg oblast and used for the assessment of soil suitability for cultivation in the southern and southeastern regions of Orenburg oblast.

AB  - Restoration is a complex endeavor requiring the understanding of the degrading environment before applying any improvement measure. Environmental and ecological data in Nan-Shih stream were investigated in this study to assess its stream condition. Based on the data collected, the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI index) which takes fish species as the major target, the Family-level Biotic Index (FBI) aquatic insects Hilsenhoff index and the Genus Index (GI) of algae were thus analyzed to quantify Nan-Shih stream's ecological system. The indices above were then applied on Index of Stream Condition (ISC index) to describe the overall river condition. Modified sub-indices, including the hydrology, physical form, streamside zone, water quality, and aquatic life, were made and used to provide baseline assessment information. ISC value is 33.89 evaluated as marginal level, in which hydrology sub-index score was the lowest indicating impact of artificial structures affecting flow significantly. The recommendations of the river corridor restoration and the habitat improvement were thus proposed as a reference for river management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glucose, glycogen and protein levels in freshwater mussels (Anodonta anatina) exposed to algae-and water-borne Cd for 35 days and allowed to depurate for posterior 120 days were monitored. In body fluids, glucose was increased while protein levels were decreased. Glycogen stores in the tissues generally declined during exposure and remained low until the end of depuration, associated with decreased dry weight and condition index. Tissue protein concentrations remained stable, but subcellular fractions exhibited some alterations. Negative correlations of glycogen to newly incorporated Cd and total Cd were observed in the mantle and digestive gland. Glucose concentrations in the body fluids and glycogen in the mantle and digestive gland were strongly correlated to Ca content.

AB  - Drought has a significant impact on agricultural, ecological and socio-economic spheres. Poor and delayed monsoon, high temperature and insufficient water resources lead to recurrent drought in the Luni River basin located in the rain-shadow zone of western India. In the present study, monsoon variation was studied in relation to spatio-temporal patterns of vegetative drought in the Luni Basin. The Vegetation Condition Index, the Temperature Condition Index and the Vegetation Health Index derived through multi-channel data of NOAA AVHRR satellite were used for drought monitoring, and seasonal variation in rainfall and vegetation response were analysed, compared and correlated. The study finds inconsistent and erratic rainfall patterns in the Luni Basin. The monsoon variation was found to control vegetation health during the monsoon season but sometimes in the non-monsoon period too, and vegetative drought intensity and duration vary widely depending upon moisture and thermal stresses. Inertia in vegetation health is reflected in the inter-seasonal persistence of vegetative drought conditions. The study finds that a good monsoon helps in maintaining vegetation health during following seasons. On the contrary, vegetation health is found to be more sensitive to moisture and thermal stresses in the immediate season after a drought.

AB  - Understanding the environmental responses of an invasive species is critical in predicting how ecosystem composition may be transformed in the future, especially under climate change. In this study, Crassostrea gigas, a species well adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment, was exposed to the chronic environmental challenges of temperature (19 and 24 degrees C) and pH (ambient seawater and a reduction of 0.4 pH units) in an extended 3-month laboratory-based study. Physiological parameters were measured (condition index, shell growth, respiration, excretion rates, O:N ratios, and ability to repair shell damage) alongside molecular analyses. Temperature was by far the most important stressor, as demonstrated by reduced condition indexes and shell growth at 24 degrees C, with relatively little effect detected for pH. Transcriptional profiling using candidate genes and SOLiD sequencing of mantle tissue revealed that classical stress genes, previously reported to be upregulated under acute temperature challenges, were not significantly expressed in any of the treatments, emphasizing the different response between acute and longer term chronic stress. The transcriptional profiling also elaborated on the cellular responses underpinning the physiological results, including the identification of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a potentially novel marker for chronic environmental challenge. This study represents a first attempt to understand the energetic consequences of cumulative thermal stress on the intertidal C.gigas which could significantly impact on coastal ecosystem biodiversity and function in the future.

AB  - In several Italian cities, it is possible to find historical pavements such as the Sampietrini pavements, which are mainly located in the center of the city of Rome. The Sampietrini pavement is a particular road surface paved in natural stone with irregular sharp elements that are assembled by hand with the evident not plan effect. Because of their peculiarities, they are not suitable for streets where high speed is allowed. In many cases, high vibration and noise levels due to road traffic traveling on Sampietrini pavements are caused by inadequate maintenance, which is also affected by the absence of specific evaluation criteria regarding surface conditions and performances of Sampietrini pavements. It is not possible, in fact, to adopt common approaches developed to be used for flexible and rigid pavements, because they present completely different features and distresses. In this paper, to overpass this problem, a new evaluation criterion based on Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method established for block pavements is proposed. Furthermore, to fully characterize this kind of pavements, other analyses, i.e., International Roughness Index (IRI) and comfort level evaluation based on ISO 2631 standard, were also carried out. The results showed a good correlation between PCI and IRI approaches (R-2 = 0.82), also highlighting that new or reconstructed Sampietrini pavements present not negligible roughness level. This aspect was also confirmed estimating the comfort level perceived by users traveling at several speeds (50 km/h). Finally, speed related threshold values to be adopted for PCI and IRI methods are proposed. The proposed method can be implemented by pavement managers in a PMS ad hoc for stone block paving and thus, it can be integrated with other equivalents methods of visual inspection based on PCI.

AB  - The relationship between the satellite-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and a number of frequently used meteorological drought indices was evaluated using data from all 254 Texas counties during 18 growing-seasons (March to August, 1982-1999). In particular, the response of the VCI was compared to that of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Moisture Anomaly Index (Z-index), Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), percent normal, and deciles. Overall the VCI is most strongly correlated with the 6-month SPI, 9-month SPI and PDSI. This indicates that, at least over Texas, the growing-season VCI responds to prolonged moisture stress and it appears to be less sensitive to short-term precipitation deficiencies. There was also significant spatial variability in the strength of the relationship between the VCI and the meteorological drought indices. Generally, counties in northwestern and southwestern Texas had much higher correlations (R-2 > 0.6) than counties in eastern Texas and along the Gulf Coast (R-2 < 0.1). Nearly 75% of these spatial variations can be explained using a series of environmental variables. It appears that the climate region is the most important determinant of the nature of the relationship between the VCI and PDSI. Other important variables include the land use/land cover in each county, the amount of irrigation, and soil properties. These results demonstrate that care must be taken when using the VCI for monitoring drought because it is not highly correlated with station-based meteorological drought indices and it is strongly influenced by spatially varying environmental factors.

AB  - Harvesting practices of the clam Chionista fluctifraga show a decline in commercial size and densities, but no strategies have been developed to maintain clam beds. Aquaculture represents an alternative for preserving this resource. Adult clams from commercial grounds were used as broodstock. Conditioning, induction of spawning, cultivation of larvae, settlement of eyed larvae and nursing of postlarvae were performed in the hatchery for producing spat. Larvae and postlarvae were used to measure increase in shell height and data were fitted to exponential growth models. Spat were placed in floating trays and maintained in off-bottom cultivation for 9months. Samples of clams and tissues were collected monthly to measure absolute growth, shell height increase and a condition index. Larvae, postlarvae and juveniles showed exponential growth patterns. Mean shell height increased about 0.030mmday(-1) during larval and post-larval stages and 0.049mmday(-1) during field cultivation. Pediveligers (height 215 +/- 83m) entered metamorphosis at days 9-13 after fertilization, and postlarvae reached 3011.7 +/- 325.5m (height) at day 60. After field cultivation, survival was about 95%; juvenile shell height was 20.6 +/- 2.2mm, and total weight was 5.3 +/- 0.7g. Growth rates were superior to natural conditions and the condition index was high throughout the study. Our results show that spat of C.fluctifraga can be produced in the hatchery, and that field production can be maintained in off-bottom trays until reaching commercial size. Aquaculture activities for this species need to be established and evaluated.

AB  - Ocean acidification, a decrease in the pH in marine waters associated with rising atmospheric CO2 levels, is a serious threat to marine ecosystems. In this paper, we determine the effects of long-term exposure to near-future levels of ocean acidification on the growth, condition, calcification, and survival of juvenile red king crabs, Paralithodes camtschaticus, and Tanner crabs, Chionoecetes bairdi. Juveniles were reared in individual containers for nearly 200 days in flowing control (pH 8.0), pH 7.8, and pH 7.5 seawater at ambient temperatures (range 4.4-11.9 degrees C). In both species, survival decreased with pH, with 100% mortality of red king crabs occurring after 95 days in pH 7.5 water. Though the morphology of neither species was affected by acidification, both species grew slower in acidified water. At the end of the experiment, calcium concentration was measured in each crab and the dry mass and condition index of each crab were determined. Ocean acidification did not affect the calcium content of red king crab but did decrease the condition index, while it had the opposite effect on Tanner crabs, decreasing calcium content but leaving the condition index unchanged. This suggests that red king crab may be able to maintain calcification rates, but at a high energetic cost. The decrease in survival and growth of each species is likely to have a serious negative effect on their populations in the absence of evolutionary adaptation or acclimatization over the coming decades.

AB  - As the global ecosystem has been severely disturbed by an increasing number of human activities at different scales, remote sensing technology, as an effective quantitative measure of environmental quality, has been widely used. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is one of the most popular and comprehensive ecological quality assessment indices based on the remote sensing data. However, the RSEI model exhibits that the ecological environment under natural conditions is not limited by the spatial scales. In addition, the model has major shortcomings in index selection and eigenvector, which greatly limit the application of RSEI. In this paper, the RSEI model is improved and a remote sensing ecological index optimized by the regional scale (RO-RSEI) is proposed. The result of the study, conducted in Shuangyang District, Changchun City, Jilin Province, shows that the RO-RSEI model has regional ecological significance after the introduction of the scale theory of landscape ecology; the index is preferred to solve problems like the RSEI model applied mechanization and baseless index selection. Meanwhile, due to the optimization of the eigenvector contribution of the optimal index, it solves the problems like non-unique model calculation result caused by principal component analysis or even antipodal calculation result. Compared with the RSEI model, the monitoring result of RO-RSEI model can better reflect the regional ecological changes. The improved model offers the possibility of monitoring ecological environment quality with remote sensing big data and provides a scientific basis for future scholars' batch computing.

AB  - The Galapagos Penguin Spheniscus mendiculus (GAPE), Flightless Cormorant Phalacrocorax harrisi (FLCO), and Waved Albatross Phoebastria irrorata (WAAL) are marine birds that are endemic to the Galapagos Islands. To provide health information for these three species, baseline data on several physiological parameters were collected non-invasively-from individuals and populations appearing to be healthy-during the course of physical examinations that were conducted from 2011-2019. Heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and body condition (weight vs. morphometric measurements) were analyzed as a function of age and sex. Mean heart rate differed significantly between juveniles and adults in all three species. Respiratory rate and body temperature varied with species, age, and sex; body condition index of GAPE, FLCO, and WAAL showed that males are heavier than females. We briefly speculate on the ecological context of these patterns.

AB  - Three categories of wetland assessment methods have been recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, including Level 1-Landscape-scale Assessment; Level 2-Rapid Field Methods; and Level 3-Intensive Biological and Physico-Chemical Measures. This study incorporates wetland assessment methods for each assessment level, including the Level 1 Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, Level 2 Wetland Rapid Assessment Procedure (WRAP), and Level 3 Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI). Using a neighborhood analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), an LDI index map was created using 1995 land use, creating a calculated LDI index value for each 30 m(2) area in Florida. Level 1-3 assessment procedures were employed at 193 palustrine emergent (n = 75) and forested (n = 118) wetlands. Significant correlations were found among the multiple Level 1-3 assessment procedures using the nonparametric Spearman's correlation coefficient for pair-wise comparisons of LDI and WRAP, LDI and diatom FWCI, WRAP and diatom FWCI, LDI and macrophyte FWCI, WRAP and macrophyte FWCI, LDI and macroinvertebrate FWCI, and WRAP and macroinvertebrate FWCI (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.50, P < 0.01). Defining the relationship between Level 1-3 assessment methods may be used to estimate the more intensive and species assemblage-specific Level 3 FWCI assessment scores for wetlands with Level 1 or Level 2 scores. Inferences can then be made as to wetland condition based on established correlations with intensive assessment methods.

AB  - Condition indices reflect the performance of an organism in their environment, as well as their somatic condition, nutritional value, commercial importance, the ecological role and fattening periods. In this study, different physiological indices were evaluated in order to know the Arca zebra population status, and to suggest operation and sustainability strategies for this resource use and consumption. A total of 240 samples (82 males and 158 females) were collected between July 2010 and July 2011, from the Chacopata bank site. Bivalve biometric measurements were made monthly and considered: total shell length, height and width; besides, soft tissues were dehydrated to obtain total dry mass. Different condition indices were analyzed based on the body mass, or on the combination of mass and shell length: gonadal index, muscle index, meat yield, the fresh mass of soft tissue in relation to the total length, and dry mass of soft tissue relative to the total length. We found the model with positive allometric growth between the length-total dry mass. The gonadal weight exerted a marked influence on the condition index, gonadosomatic index and meat yield. Increases in soft tissue mass were proportional to the dimensions of the shell. The index contrasts fresh mass of soft tissue in relation to the total length, as a tool that would allow fishers to estimate the population dynamics of A. zebra, and to practice a sustainable fishery over time, while keeping the extraction canons.

AB  - Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were collected monthly during a 1-y period from two study sites in Apalachicola Bay, FL, and several measurements were made of their physiologic condition. Continuous and intermittent temperature measurements at both sites shows highly coincident ambient temperature regimens. Salinity measurements, however, were erratic and varied dramatically between sites. Oyster gonad size and gametogenic condition were highly synchronous at both sites, supporting the concept of temperature-driven reproductive cycles. Other measurements, including condition index, wet:dry tissue weight ratio, digestive tubule condition, and vesicular connective tissue condition, showed significant variability as the result of sampling month. but also differed because of site and/or interaction between date and site, indicating that local effects influenced oyster physiology. Temperature control over condition index and wet:dry tissue weight seems apparent, bur it is not known whether the changes resulted directly from temperature or from temperature-driven reproductive and metabolic cycles. A significant difference between site means at specific dates was observed for digestive tubule condition and may relate to short-term salinity differences. Other physiologic variations could not be attributed to any of the physical conditions monitored (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen). The variability of oyster physiologic measurements inherent at different sires and seasons must be well understood to properly interpret them in the context of biologic indicators of environmental condition.

AB  - This study estimates the marginal contribution to environmental performance made by six separate macroinvertebrate metrics included in an additive index developed to measure wadeable stream condition We model the metrics as outputs in a quadratic directional output distance function, which serves as an alternate measure of environmental performance, and then derive the marginal performance for each metric We use the resulting estimates of marginal performance to develop a metric weighting scheme that incorporates each metric's marginal contribution to performance, at each site, and then construct a weighted version of the original index. The performance-weighted index provides a similar measure of overall performance in this application. while also adding new information on the relative importance of each of the index metrics. This represents a new application of existing methods to measure productivity, and is closely related to the environmental shadow price literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B V. All rights reserved

AB  - The activity of Po-210 and Pb-210 was determined in mussels of the same size (3.5-4.0 cm shell length) sampled monthly over a 17-month period at the Atlantic coast of Portugal. Average radionuclide concentration values in mussels were 759 +/- 277 Bq kg(-1) for Po-210 (range 460-1470 Bq kg(-1) dry weight), and 45 +/- 19 Bq kg(-1) for Pb-210 (range 23-96 Bq kg(-1) dry weight). Environmental parameters and mussel biometric parameters were monitored during the same period. Although there was no seasonal variation of radionuclide concentrations in sea water during the study period, the concentration of radionuclide activity in mussels varied seasonally displaying peaks of high concentrations in winter and low concentrations in summer. Analysis of radionuclide data in relation to the physiological Condition Index of mussels revealed that Po-210 and Pb-210 activities in the mussel (average activity per individual) remained nearly constant during the investigation period, while mussel body weight fluctuated due to fat storage/expenditure in the soft tissues. Similar variation of radionuclide concentrations was observed in mussels transplanted from the sea coast into the Tejo Estuary. However, under estuarine environmental conditions and with higher food availability throughout the year, transplanted mussel Condition Index was higher than in coastal mussels and average radionuclide concentrations were 210 +/- 75 Bq kg(-1) (dry weight) for Po-210 and 10 +/- 4 Bq kg(-1) (dry weight) for Pb-210, therefore lower than in coastal mussels with similar shell length. It is concluded that the apparent seasonal fluctuation and inter-site difference of radionuclide concentrations were mostly caused by mussel body weight fluctuation and not by radionuclide body burden fluctuation. This interpretation can be extended to the apparent seasonal fluctuation in concentrations of lipophilic and lipophobic contaminants in mussels, and provides an explanation for occasional high concentrations of Po-210 and man-made contaminants measured in mussels far from pollution sources.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures are causing substantial degradation to the freshwater ecosystems globally and Malaysia has not escaped such a bleak scenario. Prompted by the predicament, this study's objective was to pioneer a river assessment system that can be readily adopted to monitor, manage and drive improvement in a wholesome manner. Three sets of a priori metrics were selected to form the Ichthyofaunal Quality Index (IQI: biological), Water Quality Index (WQI: chemical) and River Physical Quality Index (RPQI: physical). These indices were further integrated on equal weighting to construct a novel Malaysian River Integrity Index (MyRII). To test its robustness, the MyRII protocol was field tested in four eco-hydrological zones located in the Kampar River water basin for 18 months to reveal its strengths, weaknesses, and establish the "excellent", "good", "average", "poor" and "impaired" thresholds based on the "best performer" reference site in an empirical manner. The resultant MyRII showed a clear trend that corresponded with different levels of river impairment. Test site zone A which was a reference site with minimal disturbance achieved the highest MyRII (88.95 +/- 4.29), followed by partially disturbed zone B (61.95 +/- 5.90) and heavily disturbed zone C (50.00 +/- 4.29). However, the MyRII in zone D (59.9 +/- 6.39), which was a heavily disturbed wetland that was disjointed from the river, did not conform to such trend. Also unveiled and recognized, however, are some unexpected nuances, limitations and challenges that emerged from this study. These are critically discussed as precautions when interpreting and implementing the MyRII protocol. This study adds to the mounting body of evidence that water resource stakeholders and policymakers must look at the big picture and adopt the "balanced ecosystem" mind-set when assessing, restoring and managing the rivers as a freshwater resource.

AB  - As a result of human activities causing changes to their environments, many species are facing an increased risk of extinction. In order to determine such changes and their effects on species assemblages, rapid stream assessment techniques of environmental analysis and monitoring can be used. We determined the Habitat Integrity Index (HII) and its correlation with the composition and assemblage of adult odonates at different taxonomic levels in the region of the Selva Lacandona, Chiapas in southeastern Mexico. Both suborders Zygoptera and Anisoptera, the family Coenagrionidae, and the assemblage of 20 species of the genera Argia, Cora, Hetaerina, and Heteragrion (ACHH) were related with the HII. All taxonomic levels were included in the analyses as predictors of habitat integrity. However, we hypothesized that the abundance, species richness, and diversity of stenotopic species (ACHH) could be a better predictor of the HII than the other taxonomic levels. We found a positive and statistically significant relationship between the HII and the ACHH species, richness, and diversity. In contrast, we found a negative and significant relationship between HII and Anisoptera species, abundance, richness and diversity. Implications for insect conservation This study has implications for insect conservation: in this case, the protected area hosts more specialist species than the surrounding zone. For example, Ejido El Tumbo, which presents a severe level of disturbance and is outside of protected natural areas, has the lowest species diversity of all sites. We recommend further research to determine the link between disturbance and the prevalence of stenotopic species.

AB  - To evaluate the potential impact of an urban wastewater-treatment plant on Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, a sentinel species, the clam Ruditapes decussatus, was exposed along a gradient of the effluent's dispersal for 1 mo. Three exposure sites were selected to study the responses of 3 biomarkers: electron transport system, acetylcholinesterase, and lipid peroxidation. As complementary data, morphometric measurements, condition index, and lipid and protein content were considered together with in situ physicochemical characterization of the sites (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen). Electron transport system activity levels were between 35.7 and 50.5 nmol O-2/min g protein, acetylcholinesterase activity levels ranged from 2.6 to 3.8 nmol/min g protein, and lipid peroxidation ranged from 174.7 to 246.4 nmol malondialdehyde/g protein. The exposure sites shaped the response not only of biomarkers but also of "health" parameters (protein, lipids, and condition index). Lipid peroxidation was the most responsive biomarker also associated with electron transport system, especially at the closest site to the urban wastewater-treatment plant. Because of the presence of complex mixtures of contaminants in urban effluents, biomarker responses can provide valuable information in environmental assessment. However, it is vital to identify all biological and ecological factors induced by the natural life cycle of clams. Abiotic factors can mask or overlap the response of biomarkers and should be considered in a multibiomarker approach. (C) 2020 SETAC

AB  - The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has proposed the Soil Conditioning Index (SCI) to predict the consequences of management actions on the state of soil organic carbon (SOC), a soil quality indicator. The index was developed based on research in humid, temperate, loainy soils but has not been tested for many other conditions. In this project, we determined the effects of management on SCI, SOC, and other soil properties in semiarid, hot, sandy soils located in the Southern High Plains of western Texas. Agroecosystems studied included native rangeland, conservation grassland, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations, and high-residue forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). The sites included irrigated and dryland conditions under conventionally tilled and no-tillage practices. Mean SCI values varied from -1.49 for conventionally tilled dryland cotton to 2.15 for the conservation grassland. All native rangelands and conservation grasslands and no-tillage fields (dryland and irrigated) had positive SCI values, which indicates increasing organic matter levels. In contrast, all of the conventionally-tilled cotton fields had negative SCI values, indicating decreasing organic matter levels. The SCI was most strongly correlated with the residue equivalent value (r = 0.68) as estimated in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation but based on measured values and particulate organic matter carbon, POM-C (r = 0.57). The SCI showed which fields had the highest levels of POM-C and which fields used no-tillage or limited tillage from fields that had been aggressively tilled. Additional research is needed to adjust the SCI subfactors to better relate the index with SOC.

AB  - Yunnan Province in southwest China is characterized by a vast area, diverse climate types, rich ecosystem types, and unique biodiversity resources. With consideration of global climate change, there is an urgent need to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought in Yunnan. This study utilized the MOD13A3, MOD17A2, and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 remote sensing products. The TRMM 3B43 downscaled monthly precipitation data were used to calculate the tropical rainfall condition index (TRCI) for Yunnan. The TRCI was used as a drought index, and the temporal and spatial changes in TRCI, gross primary productivity (GPP), and vegetation condition index (VCI) from 2009 to 2018 were explored. The response of vegetation to drought was evaluated under different time scales and varying land-use types. The results showed that during 2009-2018, (1) at an annual scale, the drought in Yunnan showed a weakening trend, and at a spatial scale, the drought showed a weakening trend from northwest to southeast. This weakening trend was more noticeable for cultivated land than for forest, grassland, and other land-use types. (2) GPP and VCI showed overall increasing trends at an annual scale, indicating gradual improvements in the GPP of vegetation and vegetation status, whereas the summer vegetation index showed a decreasing trend. (3) Although both the GPP and the growth state of vegetation were affected by drought, the responses of GPP and VCI to drought differed under different temporal scales and different land-use types. The responses of GPP and VCI to drought during spring were greater than those over other seasons, and the response of VCI to drought was more sensitive than that of GPP. Drought had a high impact on the GPP and vegetation growth of cultivated land and grassland with shallow root systems, whereas the impact of drought on forest was relatively stable.

AB  - Droughts during the growing season are projected to increase in frequency and severity in Central Europe in the future. Thus, area-wide monitoring of agricultural drought in this region is becoming more and more important. In this context, it is essential to know where and when vegetation growth is primarily water-limited and whether remote sensing-based drought indices can detect agricultural drought in these areas. To answer these questions, we conducted a correlation analysis between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) within the growing season from 2001 to 2020 in Bavaria (Germany) and investigated the relationship with land cover and altitude. In the second step, we applied the drought indices Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) to primarily water-limited areas and evaluated them with soil moisture and agricultural yield anomalies. We found that, especially in the summer months (July and August), on agricultural land and grassland and below 800 m, NDVI and LST are negatively correlated and thus, water is the primary limiting factor for vegetation growth here. Within these areas and periods, the TCI and VHI correlate strongly with soil moisture and agricultural yield anomalies, suggesting that both indices have the potential to detect agricultural drought in Bavaria.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is considered as one of the marine areas most exposed to human impacts. A variety of chemical contaminants pose a threat to the habitants. Female flounder (Platichthys flesus) collected from three locations in the southern Baltic Sea in February 2010 were examined for biomarkers of exposure to genotoxic agents (DNA damage), AhR-active contaminants (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, EROD activity), and somatic condition indexes. Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were also measured in individual flounder to evaluate the biological responses in the context of contaminant burden. The genotoxicity, mildly exceeding a background level, revealed a significant relationship with mono-ortho substituted PCB (m-oPCB). Hepatic EROD activity was highly induced, yet showed no association with any of the contaminants measured other than biliary 1-OH pyrene normalized to pigment absorbance. Significant negative relationships were observed for lipid-based OCs and the gonado-somatic index (GSI) as well as for m-oPCB concentrations and the condition factor (CF). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed an overall connection between somatic condition indexes, biomarkers, and chemical variables. Of the three locations, flounder inhabiting the Gulf of Gdansk had the greatest contaminant burden and appeared to be the most affected. Of great concern is the reduced GSI in this location which can be attributed to the effects of contaminants and warrants further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paphies donacina (Spengler, 1793) populations were surveyed at 11 low tide sites on surf beaches along Pegasus Bay, Canterbury, New Zealand, during summer 1998. Random sampling was not feasible. At the non-random sites chosen the average number of tuatua per 5 m of shoreline ranged between 0.1 and 62. Total wet weight biomass m(-2) was highest at the southern sites in the Bay. There were site-related differences in length frequency distributions of tuatua populations. Northern populations included a wide length range and southern populations were dominated by larger bivalves. Average shell length increased significantly with distance south, being close to 40 mm at Waikuku and 80 mm at Taylors Mistake. The shell length : width and weight relationships were similar for tuatua collected over the whole geographic range. Average dry weight condition index varied significantly between sites (ANOVA F = 23.3, d.f = 10, 329) depending on the length distribution of the contributing population. Where populations included a wide length range the condition index was positively correlated with shell length but in populations dominated by larger bivalves there was either no relationship or a negative relationship with shell length. Juvenile tuatua were found at average densities between 81 and 1200 m(-2) at all sites except Taylors Mistake. The mean length of recruits ranged from 2.2 to 3.1 mm and shell length was independent of both juvenile and adult density. These results are discussed in relation to the environmental and other factors thought to influence population structure and recruitment of tuatua in Pegasus Bay.

AB  - The mussel Mytilus unguiculatus (coruscus) (Valenciennes, 1858) occurs at high density on the shallow subtidal hard bottom of Ulleungdo Island off the east coast of Korea, where it plays a crucial role as a primary consumer in the shallow, coastal, benthic ecosystem. In this study, we monitored seasonal variation in the condition index, gonad growth, and subsequent spawning of this species at Ulleungdo to obtain substantial information on its reproductive traits. From May to July 2013, the condition index (CI) dropped dramatically, indicating that M. unguiculatus (coruscus) spawned during this period. The CI also dropped from March to April in 2014 and then increased in May. Histology revealed that the onset of gonial mitosis in males and females occurred in September and October, and individuals in the spawning stage were observed in April 2014 and May 2013, when the surface seawater temperature (SST) ranged from 14 to 15 degrees C. The monthly mean oocyte diameter measured from the digitized images of the gonad also indicated that most females spawned completely in July. In summary, the annual reproductive cycle of M. unguiculatus (coruscus) at Ulleungdo could be categorized into (1) onset of gonial mitosis in late summer to early fall, (2) active growth of gonad cells ready for spawning during winter and spring, and (3) spawning and reabsorption of the residual gametes during late spring and summer. Seasonal changes in the gonads are closely linked to temporal changes in the SST.

AB  - LabHorta is a facility composed of laboratories and retrievable deep-sea cages created to support and expand the capabilities of research cruises. It also enhances the ability to conduct experimental studies with organisms from deep-sea hydrothermal vents and other deep-sea environments, while keeping them under controlled conditions of pressure and water chemistry. This paper presents a case study with the vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus (which harbours a dual symbiosis) collected at the Menez Gwen hydrothermal vent field at 840-m depth, transported to experimental aquaria at atmospheric pressure and maintained under four different controlled experimental conditions to study their comparative condition index (CI). Environmental parameters were monitored daily and efforts were made to keep these constant. During the first few months, there were differences between the CI scores of mussels kept under the various conditions. After 6 months, the differences are not so clear but mussels still had sulphur-oxidizing bacteria when fed with sulphide. The methane oxidizer bacteria disappear even in the presence of methane. A range of CI scores appeared as a function of the culture type. The LabHorta facility is a good tool for performing long-term physiological studies of deep-sea organisms, simulating possible changes in the natural environmental where they normally thrive.

AB  - Countries still lack adequate metrics to monitor environmental sustainability across a range of relevant envi-ronmental and resource issues. The Strong Environmental Sustainability Index (SESI), which is based on the Environmental Sustainability Gap (ESGAP) framework, is intended to fill this gap. SESI is the result of aggre-gating 21 indicators across different dimensions. Each of the underlying indicators is related to the functions of natural capital and normalised using science-based targets. SESI uses the geometric mean to aggregate in order to reflect the limited substitutability between the functions of natural capital. The results of the index, which is computed for 28 European countries, show that several functions of natural capital are impaired in Europe. Countries tend to perform worse in indicators related to pollution and ecosystem health, compared to indicators that describe the provision of natural resources, and human health and welfare. Because the results are sensitive to assumptions in the normalisation, weighting and aggregation processes, the relevant choices have been aligned with the theoretical underpinnings of the ESGAP framework. SESI responds to the demands of the 'Beyond GDP' community on the need for a single environmental sustainability metric that can complement GDP in its (mis-)use as a headline indicator for development.

AB  - Organotin concentrations (TBT and DBT) were determined in mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected from five sites around the island of Fyn, Denmark. The relative stress protein levels were measured in gill tissue and four condition indices (CIs) were calculated for each individual mussel. The stress-70 levels did not vary significantly between sites, whereas the chaperonin levels (stress-60) were significantly elevated in mussels from Odense Fjord Go < 0.001). The stress protein levers did not reflect the degree of TBT or Sigma TBT+DBT contamination of mussel tissues. The TBT and DBT concentrations (expressed as tin) in mussels from the five sites were in the ranges 0.15-2.17 and 0.1-4.2 mu g Sn per g dry weight, respectively. The combined TBT + DBT values were in the range 0.32-4.92 mu g Sn per g dry weight. None of the CIs measured differed significantly with respect to the sampling site, nor were they correlated with the relative stress protein levels. The four CIs were highly consistent within individual animals. The soft tissue dry weight/total weight - shell weight condition index proved to be the easiest to measure. This preliminary study indicates that interpretation of stress protein biomarker responses requires further detailed elucidation before they can be usefully incorporated in routine environmental monitoring programmes.

AB  - In support of aquaculture development and sustainable fisheries, survival, condition index, and stable isotope composition of the commercially important bivalve species Arca noae were investigated on individuals suspended in the water column at 2 distances from fish cages and those collected from natural populations. Significant differences were recorded in temperature and chlorophyll a with respect to season, and temperature and salinity values differed significantly with respect to sampling site. Mortality was greatest at the beginning of the experiment, probably as a result of the stress associated with collection of A. noae and the shell-marking process. The relatively small numbers of individuals that survived the experiment did not allow for a detailed statistical analysis of growth rates at the 3 study sites. Condition index showed a pronounced seasonal variation, with greater values recorded between April to July (CI,similar to 24) and lesser values noted during November and December (CI,similar to 20). Statistically significant intersite differences were detected. Samples collected from the control site in the Pas. man Channel had lower condition index values than samples at other sites in 4 of 6 sampling months for which differences between sites were detected. Differences in stable carbon (delta C-13(VPDB)) and nitrogen (delta N-15(air)) isotope compositions were recorded with respect to tissue type and season, but no differences with respect to sampling site were noted. Results indicate that A. noae is highly sensitive to manipulation.

AB  - The Matanuska-Susitna Borough is the fastest growing region in the State of Alaska and is impacted by a number of human activities. We conducted a multiscale assessment of the stressors facing the borough by developing and mapping the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (the latter considers stressors in areas surrounding individual stream segments exclusive of upstream areas). The assessment coincided with the borough's stormwater management planning. We adapted the list of anthropogenic stressors used in the original conterminous United States IWI application to reflect the borough's geography, human activity, and data availability. This analysis also represents an early application of the NHDPlus High Resolution geospatial framework and the first use of the framework in an IWI study. We also explored how remediation of one important stressor, culverts, could impact watershed integrity at the catchment and watershed scales. Overall, we found that the integrity scores for the Matanuska-Susitna basin were high compared to the conterminous United States. Low integrity scores did occur in the rapidly developing Wasilla-Palmer core area. We also found that culvert remediation had a larger proportional impact in catchments with fewer stressors.

AB  - The paper discusses the determination of engine torque to be used to calculate work performed by a non-road vehicle when determining specific exhaust emissions. During investigations related to the environmental indexes under actual operating conditions, the value of torque is pulled from the vehicle OBD system. It is estimated based on the pressure and duration of the fuel injection. The work of an engine calculated in this way is overrated. It allows for the engine internal losses such as aerodynamic resistance and internal friction losses. The paper presents tests on a farm tractor, in which a portable chassis dynamometer and a portable exhaust emissions measurement and data recording systems were applied. In the performed tests, the engine operated at steady work points: defined engine speeds and loads. Based on the Willans method, the data from the vehicle onboard diagnostic system and the calculated values of the fuel consumption a correction curve was determined. It should be used when correcting the engine torque during measurements under actual operating conditions. Based on the recorded concentrations of the emission components, specific emission was calculated allowing for the corrective calculation. This was used to perform a comparative analysis with the emission limits specified by the Stage IIIB standard that the test object was compliant with. The presented research methodology may be successfully applied in testing other non-road machinery whose environmental indexes are defined based on specific emissions. In research of machines in actual condition, necessary is to determine the engine internal resistance and take it into account when determining the engine torque in the field tests. This will allow a determination of the real environmental indexes.

AB  - Quantitative and qualitative measures of fish health and welfare are essential for management of both wild capture and aquaculture species. These measures include morphometric body condition indices, energetic condition and aquaculture operational welfare indicators (OWIs). Measures vary in ease of measurement (and may require destructive sampling), and it is critical to know how well they correlate with fish health and welfare so appropriate management decisions can be based on them. Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) is a new farming species that needs nondestructive OWIs to be developed and validated. In this study, we developed a C. lumpus fin damage score. Four different body condition indexes based on individual weight relative to either length-weight relationships or relative to other fish in its local environment were tested (using model selection) as predictors of individual fin damage. Results showed severity of fin damage was predicted by small size relative to the other individuals in the tank or cage. Body condition based on length-weight relationship was not found to predict fin damage, indicating that using established indices from fisheries or from other species would not predict welfare risks from fin damage. Implications are that especially in hatchery conditions grading will improve the condition index, and is expected to mitigate fin damage, but that low weight at length was not of use in predicting fin damage. Model selection to choose between a suite of possible indices proved powerful and should be considered in other applications where an easily measured index is needed to correlate with other health measures.

AB  - A field monitoring of hemocyte parameters of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum was conducted from July 2004 to September 2005 in Gulf of Morbihan (France), in order to assess (1) the factors controlling the hemocyte parameters of the Manila clam and (2) their relative contribution to the overall variability of these parameters. Monthly, sixty clams were sampled and total hemocyte count (THC), granulocyte and hyalinocyte counts, phagocytosis, phenoloxidase specific activity, length, flesh dry weight and condition index were measured individually. Perkinsus sp. infection and Brown Ring Disease symptoms were also monitored. Temperature and trophic resource were also monitored.
   Results indicate that temperature controls granulocyte counts and subsequently THC. Other environmental factors had no direct influence on the measured hemocyte parameters. Almost all measured parameters were significantly affected by size/age and condition index. There were poor relationships between both pathologies and hemocyte parameters presumably because of low infection intensities. Nevertheless, high Perkinsus sp. infection intensity significantly increased total and granulocyte counts and decreased phagocytosis.
   An interesting result of this study is that the measured biotic and abiotic factors poorly contribute to the explanation of the total variability of hemocyte parameters. Granulocyte concentration was the best explained parameter. However, only 16.4% of its variance was explained by cumulating temperature, length, condition index and Perkinsus sp. infection effects. This study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of hemocyte functions and the factors modulating these functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The unionid Anodontites trapesilais (Lamarck, 1819) like most freshwater mussels is a parasite of fish. So it is trivial to assume that the availability of hosts is an important factor for the maintenance of unionoid populations. What seems obvious is not always so easy to demonstrate. This study proposes to investigate the effects of abiotic and biotic variables related to the incubation of larvae in A. trapesialis. For this, we estimate different biological indexes and try to capture the dimensionality of the fish, along with the temporal variation of environmental variables. From the application of a CCA, it was demonstrated that there was a synchronicity among the factors and variables proposed here, and we infer that the flood pulse acts as a synergistic factor in this process.

AB  - Traditional approaches for managing aquatic resources have often failed to account for effects of anthropogenic disturbances on biota that are not directly reflected by chemical and physical proxies of environmental condition. The index of biotic integrity (IBI) is a potentially effective assessment method to integrate ecological, functional, and structural aspects of aquatic systems. A macrophyte-based IBI was developed for Minnesota lakes to assess the ability of aquatic plant communities to indicate environmental condition. The index was developed using quantitative point intercept vegetation surveys for 97 lakes that represent a range of limnological and watershed characteristics. We followed an approach similar to that used in Wisconsin to develop the aquatic macrophyte community index (AMCI). Regional adaptation of the AMCI required the identification of species representative of macrophyte communities in Minnesota. Metrics and scaling methods were also substantially modified to produce a more empirically robust index. Regression analyses indicated that IBI scores reflected statewide differences in lake trophic state (R-2 = 0.57, F = 130.3, df = 1, 95, p < 0.005), agricultural (R-2 = 0.51, F = 83.0, df = 1, 79, p < 0.005), urban (R-2 = 0.22, F = 23.0, df = 1, 79, p < 0.005), and forested land uses (R-2 = 0.51, F = 84.7, df = 1.79. p < 0.005), and county population density (R-2 = 0.14, F = 16.6, df = 1.95, p < 0.005). Variance partitioning analyses using multiple regression models indicated a unique response of the IBI to human-induced stress separate from a response to natural lake characteristics. The IBI was minimally affected by differences in sample point density as indicated by Monte Carlo analyses of reduced sampling effort. Our analysis indicates that a macrophyte IBI calibrated for Minnesota lakes could be useful for identifying differences in environmental condition attributed to human-induced stress gradients.

AB  - Pedochemical characteristics such as acid-base properties, state of organic matter, and composition of the soil adsorption complex (SAC) in the forests surrounding large industrial enterprises in the Baikal region have been studied. The contaminated soils have been found to exhibit considerably increased alkalinity [pH (H2O) 7.6-8.5], reduced rate of mineralization of organic matter to humic compounds (2.5-fold increased C/N ratio and 2-6-fold increased CO2 emission), and disturbed ratio of exchanging Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ ions. A grading scale of soils in the Baikal region with respect to their ecological state has been developed on the basis of pedochemical characteristics.

AB  - The development of an ecosystem health index to assess health status in freshwater lakes is urgently needed in China, especially in polluted lakes. This study developed a specific Ecosystem Health Index (LP-EHI) for Lake Poyang in China. LP-EHI quantified lake health from the perspectives of physical, chemical, biological integrity and social service. Physical integrity indices included hydrological conditions (water level and runoff), basic morphometric characteristics (lake area and shoreline), and tributary connectivity. Chemical integrity indices used water quality, nutrition, and toxicity to quantify chemical impairment. Biological integrity indicators covered six major components of the aquatic food chain, namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, wetland plants, fish, and wintering birds. Social service indices included drinking water, pathogenic potential, flood storage capacity, sand mining, and dish-shaped sub-lake areas under management to measure whether the lake fulfilled the needs of human society. Reference and impaired conditions for each metric were defined by "historical" conditions, "least disturbed" conditions, national standards and expert opinions. The value of LP-EHI ranging from 0 to 1 was divided into five health conditions: excellent (>= 0.8), good (0.6-0.8), fair (0.4-0.6), poor (0.2-0.4) and bad (<0.2). The metrics' reliability was further validated using a box-and-whisker plot test. The developed index (LP-EHI) is so far the most comprehensive index to evaluate ecosystem health for Lake Poyang, and is well reflected in the unique characteristics of Lake Poyang. It can enhance our understanding of lake health conditions and thus guide lake management to achieve better health conditions.

The paths of subsurface flows of infiltration recharge are identified and traced, and the zones of deep-water inflow are identified and delimited. The total pollution index of groundwater from Neogene-Quaternary aquifer system was found to far in excess of the acceptable level because of an elevated concentrations of iron, manganese, and phosphorus of anthropogenic and deep-seated origin.

AB  - Torpor minimizes energy expenditure and water loss during periods of inclement weather, low prey availability, or both, and appears especially important in harsh environments such as deserts. We investigaed use of topor by free-ranging adult male pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) at the northern limit of their range in teh semiarid Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada. We predicted that males would use torpor frequently during the active season and that ambient temperature (T-a) as well as nutritional condition (body condition index [BCI]) would affect torpor use. We expected roost microclimate to be conducive to daily heterothermy given that roosts had cool morning temperature that increased in the afternoon. We used temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to measure skin temperature (Tskin) of 8 bats from June to August 2003. Seven individuals used torpor each day (n = 54 tracking days) but not at night. Torpor duration increased as mean daytime T-a decreased albeit the relationship between minimum T-skin during torpor and T-a. BCI was signigicantly and inversely correlated with torpor bout duration. Mean daytime termperatures in rock crevice roosts approached 30 degrees C and fluctuated less than T-a.

AB  - Remotely sensed maps of global forest extent are widely used for conservation assessment and planning. Yet, there is increasing recognition that these efforts must now include elements of forest quality for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such data are not yet available globally. Here we introduce two data products, the Forest Structural Condition Index (SCI) and the Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII), to meet this need for the humid tropics. The SCI integrates canopy height, tree cover, and time since disturbance to distinguish short, open-canopy, or recently deforested stands from tall, closed-canopy, older stands typical of primary forest. The SCI was validated against estimates of foliage height diversity derived from airborne lidar. The FSII overlays a global index of human pressure on SCI to identify structurally complex forests with low human pressure, likely the most valuable for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. These products represent an important step in maturation from conservation focus on forest extent to forest stands that should be considered "best of the last" in international policy settings.

AB  - The elastic force of a red blood cell (RBC) membrane during its tank-treading motion was estimated using a three-dimensional spring network model. An RBC membrane was modelled by an assembly of triangular elements in which stretch/compression and bending springs were placed to express planar shear and out-of-plane bending deformations, respectively. An areal incompressibility of the membrane and a volumetric constraint on the entire RBC were taken into account. Different natural states of an RBC membrane were considered by adjusting reference lengths and angles of the stretch/compression and bending springs, respectively. An elastic motion simulation was conducted using the spring network model to reproduce a tank-treading motion of the membrane for a constant biconcave discoid RBC under a fluid shear force. Given the simulated tank-treading motion, an additional membrane elastic force due to the motion was determined from the elastic energy changes during the motion. It was confirmed that the natural state of the RBC membrane should be nonuniform to generate the additional elastic force. Greater spring constants and greater natural state nonuniformity induced a greater additional elastic force, and the elastic force was regarded as a resistance against the tank-treading motion. Additional elastic forces due to the membrane tank-treading motion for different sets of spring constants and natural state nonuniformity values were determined, and they were compared with fluid shear forces at shear rates within the range of which a transition between tank-treading and tumbling motions of an RBC occurs in experiments. The results suggested that for the experimentally measured elastic moduli, natural state nonuniformity in a physiological state is moderate between that for a spherical or flat shape and that for the biconcave shape. Moderate nonuniformity was also confirmed by a simulated RBC shape in a minimum state of elastic energy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an increasing need for aggregated biodiversity indicators to inform policy decisions at all levels from local to global. Despite their similar policy goals, low-level (e. g. local, regional) and high-level (e. g. continental, global) indicator development is generally performed independently, and the resulting indicators are often incompatible both in their structure and data requirements. In this paper we focus on a particularly flexible aggregation framework originally developed for global assessments, the Natural Capital Index. We show that with the use of appropriate fine-scale data, the NCI framework can be applied in low-level policy contexts as well. To support this statement, we show that several established low-level indicators are essentially conforming to the NCI framework, and can be seen as existing low-level NCI implementations. The concept is illustrated with an implementation for Hungary, and the potential advantages and shortcomings of low level NCI implementations are discussed. NCI-based low level indicators can be implemented in any region, where a local indicator of ecological quality is systematically surveyed. Given the recent surge in monitoring activities worldwide, fuelled by global change and reporting obligations, fine-scale NCI implementations can become important additions to existing ecological state indicators useful in a wide range of local and regional policy contexts.

AB  - Water environment warning system is an effective way to reduce water environment degradation. It protects lives and property in a timely and preventive manner from a pollution accident-prone area. Two water environment early warning index systems, gradual changing warning index system under drought conditions and sudden water pollution acute events index system, were established in Tongzhou District, Jiangsu, China. The methods and procedures for the two index systems were investigated. Indicators were chosen and justified based on recent research. Gradual changing warning indices included precipitation anomaly percentage, continuous non-precipitation days, and river levels, while socioeconomic effect indicators and natural environment effect indicators were included in sudden water pollution indices. Analytic hierarchy process was adopted to build the systems. Comprehensive evaluation method was used to evaluate the warning level. Both one- and two-dimensional unsteady-state water quality models were applied to calculate pollutant concentration variation for acute events. Preliminary results indicated that both water environment warning index systems could be established and used practically in Tongzhou District. Different warning levels could be determined according to specific assessment supported by empirical data and theoretical evaluation. Use of the warning systems could provide economic and environmental benefits for this area.

AB  - The macroinvertebrates of two northern Lake Huron wetlands were compared to assess water quality and test potential metrics for an Index of Ecological Integrity (IEI) for Great Lake coastal wetlands. Macroinvertebrates were collected using sediment coring and dip-net sampling monthly from June through September 1996. One wetland was imparted by domestic wastewater from a lagoon, urban storm-water runoff, and local marina traffic. A nearby wetland with a similar size drainage basin, no wastewater or urban storm-water input or marina traffic served as a reference. Greatest differences in chemistry between sires occurred during lagoon discharge in September. Compared to the reference, the impacted wetland had higher Cl, NH(4)-N, NO(3)-N, soluble reactive P, conductivity and lower dissolved oxygen levels. There were fewer insects, especially Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera in the impacted wetland than in the reference wetland. A greater proportion of macroinvertebrates in the impacted wetland were Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Naididae. Observed differences in macroinvertebrate communities were used to test 38 metrics, used in indices of biological integrity for streams, to determine their potential as metrics for an index of ecological integrity for Great Lake wetlands. Invertebrate attributes sensitive to water quality changes were identified as candidate metrics if they exhibited low within-sire variability and detected differences between wetlands for each sampling period. Candidate metrics included relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Isopoda, Trichoptera, predators, collector-filterers, and herbivore/detritivore ratio.

AB  - Size-adjusted mass is a common body condition index (BC!) used to indicate nonstructural energy reserves (fat and protein). BCIs are calculated from ratios of mass divided by a morphometric (s) or residuals of a regression between mass and a morphometric(s). The morphometrics used in BCIs must accurately represent structural size to reliably index energy reserves and, ideally, BCIs should be validated with comparisons to true fat and protein reserves. Many studies of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) have included BCIs in ecological analyses; unfortunately, few studies have reported how well morphometrics represented structural size or provided validation of BCIs relative to independent measures of energy reserves. We evaluated relationships between several morphometrics and mass to better understand which morphometrics may best represent structural size for two kestrel populations: captive birds at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and free-living kestrels in southwestern Idaho, U.S.A. We also compared BCIs based on different morphometrics with subjective (visual) fat scores. Our data showed few strong (r > 0.5) correlations between morphometrics and few strong correlations between each morphometric and mass. Moreover, correlations between morphometrics and mass depended on sex and location. Similarly, not all BCIs had statistically significant, positive correlations with subjective fat scores and correlations varied between sexes, suggesting that the reliability of each BCI differed between males and females. The morphometrics that best represent structural size most likely differ between males and females, and information from both sexes should not be combined to create one size measure for kestrels. Unless BCIs for specific American Kestrel subpopulations are validated, mass and additional qualitative information, such as fat scores, may be the most appropriate indicators of fat and protein stores.

AB  - Various measures of plants, soils, and invertebrates were described for a reference set of tidal coastal wetlands in Southern New England in order to provide a framework for assessing the condition of other similar wetlands in the region. The condition of the ten coastal wetlands with similar hydrology and geomorphology were ranked from least altered to highly altered using a combination of statistical methods and best professional judgment. Variables of plants, soils, and invertebrates were examined separately using principal component analysis to reduce the multidimensional variables to principal component scores. The first principal component scores of each set of variables (i.e., plants, soil, invertebrates) significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with both residential land use and watershed nitrogen (N) loads. Using cumulative frequency diagrams, the first principal component scores of each plant, soil, and invertebrate data set were plotted, and natural breaks and best professional judgment were used to rank the first principal component scores among the sites. We weighted all three ranked components equally and calculated an overall salt marsh condition index by summing the three ranks and then transforming the index to a 0-1 scale. The overall salt marsh condition index for the reference coastal wetland set significantly correlated with the residential land use (R = -aEuro parts per thousand 0.87, p = 0.001) and watershed N loads (R = -aEuro parts per thousand 0.86, p = 0.001). Overall, condition deteriorated in salt marshes and their associated discharge streams when subjected to increasing watershed residential land use and N loads.

AB  - Several ecological indexes in taxocenoses of fish (constancy, diversity, richness, evenness, and integrated quality index - IQ) are used as indicators of environmental degradation through the analysis of standardized and seasonal fish samples taken along two years in eleven localities of the Lake Gualba drainage. Localities that showed regular diversity indexes along two years are coincident with those with better environmental quality indicated by other factors (frequency of abnormalities in fishes, DBO5, temperature, total coliforms, dissolved oxygen). The integrated quality index, however, was mostly influenced by abundance and richness, being the localities indicated as the best quality by this index coincident with those indicated as bad quality by other factors. The accomplished analysis demonstrated that when the measure of water quality gets better, the Margalef Index decreases. This demonstrates that even having an improvement in water quality, there is no improvement of structure of the fish community of this place.

AB  - Growth performance, allometry, condition index, and biochemistry of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk.) cultured in a submerged longline system were investigated from June 2013 to August 2014. Mussels grew faster from spring to autumn. Chlorophyll-a concentration along with sea current speed will represent major factors controlling mussel seasonal growth and survival success in the case-study region. The lowest condition indices and highest ash contents were respectively found within winter; so the most favorable conditions for mussel harvesting and commercialization operations would tentatively occur within autumn, spring and summer. The positive mussel growth and low chlorophyll-a concentrations found during summer may also indicate utilization of non-phytoplankton food sources. No clear evidence of local depth associated physiological effects on the mussel individuals was detected. This contribution represents the first available information on open ocean mussel aquaculture from the southeastern Bay of Biscay.

AB  - Bivalve filter feeders, such as oysters, filter large volumes of water and are particularly exposed to microplastics (MP). Consequently, these animals digest and assimilate high levels of MP in their bodies that may likely impact their physiology, and potentially affect shellfish stocks, benthic habitats and, indirectly, the health status of the marine ecosystem and human consumers. In this study we exposed juvenile oysters, Crassostrea gigas, to 3 different MP concentrations (10(4), 10(5) and 10(6) particles L-1), represented by 6 mu m Polystyrene (PS) microbeads, compared to a control treatment receiving no MP. The study ran for a period of 80 days to test for the impacts of MP on growth, Condition Index and Lysosomal Stability. From histological analysis, microbeads were detected in the intestines of exposed oysters and in the digestive tubules, but no cellular inflammatory features were observed over time. Weight and shell length remained comparable between the different treatments and control. We found that Condition Index in the highest concentration increased initially but significantly reduced over time. The oysters in the highest MP exposure also showed the lowest mean Lysosomal Stability score throughout the experiment. Lysosomes play a vital role in the cells defense mechanisms and breakdown of constituents, crucial for the oysters' wellbeing. Most importantly, we detected an increased mortality in those oysters who were chronically exposed to the highest loads of MP.

AB  - The biodiversity of many Brazilian rivers is seriously threatened by industrial and municipal pollution, and Rio Paraiba do Sul, located between two major industrial centers is one example of this situation. A survey of the fish assemblage was conducted from October 1998 to September 1999 and the data were used to develop an index of biotic integrity (IBI). We sampled three zones in bracketing a large urban-industrial complex to evaluate water quality changes and the usefulness of the IBI as a monitoring tool. Water quality was classified as poor upstream of the effluent discharges, very poor near the discharges, and poor-fair downstream of the discharges, with this latter situation revealing the current biological capacity of the river. Physical and chemical habitat characteristics were also measured at each site to construct an independent environmental index to validate the IBI. The habitat and IBI indices were highly correlated, suggesting this IBI would be applicable to other large rivers in southeast Brazil.

AB  - We investigated the distribution of seven forms of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn) in Handan and Xingtai soils and calculated the geoaccumulation index and the potential ecological risk index, with the aim to assess the potential risk induced by heavy metals in the soil. The average heavy metal concentrations were all below the values stated for Level I of the State Soil Environmental Quality Standards, except for Cd, whose average concentration (0.22 g/kg) exceeded the threshold level. Heavy metals were mainly present in the residual form, with small proportions as available forms. The forms were considerably affected by soil pH, organic matter, and total heavy metal concentrations. Overall, the potential ecological risk index was 79.17, which is below the RI limit of 150. However, the potential risk of Cd was at a medium level. Based on our results, the soils of the study region are not contaminated with the evaluated heavy metals.

AB  - Multimetric indices based on fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are commonly used to assess the biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. However, their response to specific stressors is rarely known. We quantified the response of a fish-based index (Mid-Atlantic Highlands Index of Biotic Integrity, MAH-IBI) and a benthic invertebrate-based index (West Virginia Stream Condition Index, WV-SCI) to acid mine drainage (AMD)-related stressors in 46 stream sites within the Cheat River watershed, West Virginia. We also identified specific stressor concentrations at which biological impairment was always or never observed. Water chemistry was extremely variable among tributaries of the Cheat River, and the WV-SCI was highly responsive across a range of AMD stressor levels. Furthermore, impairment to macroinvertebrate communities was observed at relatively low stressor concentrations, especially when compared to state water quality standards. In contrast to the WV-SCI, we found that the MAH-IBI was significantly less responsive to local water quality conditions. Low fish diversity was observed in several streams that possessed relatively good water quality. This pattern was especially pronounced in highly degraded subwatersheds, suggesting that regional conditions may have a strong influence on fish assemblages in this system. Our results indicate that biomonitoring programs in mined watersheds should include both benthic invertebrates, which are consistent indicators of local conditions, and fishes, which may be indicators of regional conditions. In addition, remediation programs must address the full suite of chemical constituents in AMD and focus on improving linkages among streams within drainage networks to ensure recovery of invertebrate and fish assemblages. Future research should identify the precise chemical conditions necessary to maintain biological integrity in mined Appalachian watersheds.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitats may function as a refuge for some species, including freshwater mussels (Bivalvia, Unionida). In this study we assessed possible differences in density, size and condition index of the Moroccan freshwater pearl mussel Pseudunio marocanus (Pallary, 1918), formerly Margaritifera marocana, colonizing anthropogenic (saqya = irrigation canal) and natural (Bouhlou River) habitats in Morocco. Results showed that the individuals colonizing the irrigation canal located on the left bank have a significantly higher density and condition index when compared to natural conditions, but no differences were found regarding size. Since this species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, being also considered among the 100 most endangered organisms in the planet, the presence of P. marocanus in anthropogenic habitats has high conservation importance. In fact, and despite no Moroccan freshwater pearl mussels were found on the irrigation canal located in the right bank, the one located on the left bank present stable conditions for the settlement of juveniles and, if managed carefully, for the future survival of the species. However, local authorities reported frequent dredging and cleaning activities by local farmers on this saqya without any special attention devoted to Moroccan freshwater pearl mussels (or any other species) conservation. Therefore, the results reported here can be used by scientists, managers, politicians and local people to promote future management actions that enhance the Moroccan freshwater pearl mussel protection and guarantee their future survival, including on anthropogenic habitats.

AB  - High-intensity infection with the protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni is lethal to the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, especially to juvenile clams; however, how this parasite impacts its host remains unclear. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of P. olseni on the growth, condition index, burrowing behavior, and filtration activity of the Manila clam to elucidate mechanisms by which the infection causes death of the clams. Juvenile Manila clams (5-9 mm in shell length) were challenged with parasitic zoospores and were then reared in seawater for 52 days. Growth and condition index were frequently, but not always, significantly lower in the challenged group compared with the unchallenged group during the challenge experiment. Fewer individuals from the challenged groups compared with the unchallenged groups exhibited lower burrowing activity, when they were placed on sand in wells of 24-well plates. Furthermore, to compare filtration activity, clams from both groups were maintained in separate suspensions of diatoms. Diatom density remained higher in the challenged clams compared with the unchallenged clams, indicating that challenged clams exhibited lower levels of filtration activity. Decreased burrowing activity may cause higher predation rates and make the clams vulnerable to turbulent water and periodic tidal air exposure, resulting in death of Manila clams under natural conditions. In addition, suppression of filtration activity by infection may cause decrease in food and oxygen intake, leading to mortality induced by nutrient loss and hypoxia.

AB  - This study reports the reproductive cycle, condition index, size at first maturity, growth and the morphometric relationships of the common cockle Cerastoderma edule in Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal), fundamental knowledge in fisheries management planning and ecosystem conservation. The reproductive cycle was monitored for a period of two years, from January 2013 to December 2014. Spawning extended from June to October, with a peak in the summer months (July to September). The condition index showed a seasonal pattern which appear related to food availability and gametogenic cycle. Sexual maturity was attained at a shell length of 18.6 mm during the first year of life, which stands below the minimum landing size currently in force (25 mm). The von Bertalanffy growth equation was based on size-at-age data obtained from the microscopic analysis of growth rings in sectioned shells: Lt = 40.7[1-e -0.74(t-0.30)]. The morphometric relationships between shell dimensions (length, height and width) were studied in order to understand the effects of ontogenetic changes in cockles` shell morphology, an information that is useful to improve the selectivity of the fishing gears and the size-sorting devices. Some management strategies for the Ria de Aveiro cockle fishery were proposed.

AB  - Background: The local population uses water bodies in the Ustya River basin (a small river in the Prypiat River basin, a left-bank tributary of the Goryn River) for amateur and sport fishing. Objects of fishing are common and numerous representatives of the ichthyofauna: Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch) and common roach (Rutilus rutilus L.). The caught fish is not always thermally processed, which is dangerous for some reasons. In particular, there is the danger of infecting humans and domestic animals by parasitic organisms; besides, the low quality of surface waters affects fish meat quality.
   Aim: To study the relationship between indicators of the ecological state of surface waters and indicators of parasite crustaceans population on widespread fish species.
   Material and methods: Hydrochemical and ichthyoparasitological studies were carried out in 2013-2019. Water quality was evaluated according to the method of ecological assessment by integral ecological index (Ie), which includes three block indices - salt indicators (I1), trophic-saprobic indicators (I2), specific indicators (I3). Three parasitological indices were used: prevalence (P), the intensity of infection (II), and mean abundance (M). To clarify the relationship between indices, a correlation analysis was carried out.
   New findings: Parasitological studies showed that the prevalence of argulosis invasion of Carassius gibelio is higher than that of Rutilus rutilus - 8.04 vs. 7.88%. On the contrary, the intensity of infection and mean abundance are higher in R. rutilus - 1.63 vs. 1.24 and 0.16 vs. 0.13, respectively. Analysis established the negative correlations for all parasitological indices: strong with the trophic-saprobic block index (I2), and weak or absent with the salt block index (I1) and specific indicators block index (I3). The increase in water bodies' trophic state is associated with the decrease in fish morbidity with argulosis.

AB  - Ecological revetments make an important role in river restauration. However, evaluating the ecological efficiency of revetments as a major determinant of revetments selecting is lack of quantitative methods. Here, we developed an Index of Ecological Integrity (IEI) to assess the ecological efficiency of seven model restauration revetments quantitatively based on four times regular ecological investigation in a representative river plain. Thirteen metrics of the IEI were identified from the candidate pool made up of 46 indicators. These indicators corresponded to the metrics of 5 existing synthetic indexes respectively, Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) of fish, IBI of benthic macro-invertebrate, IBI of zooplankton, Habitat Index, and Water Quality Index. Signal-noise ratio and one-way analysis of variance indicated that the IEI was more effective to distinguish the differences of ecological efficiency among revetments. Furthermore, IEI suggested that 7 types of restauration revetment could improve the ecological quality of plain rivers to different degree. Rock, eco-bag, and eco-concrete tetrad-ball as ecological revetments were more suitable for river plains like Hang-jia-hu Plain (Zhejiang Province, China) because of highly positive ecological efficiency in two years after restoration engineering completing.

AB  - An eco-city is an eco-sustainable, balanced and intensive human settlement, and the method selected to evaluate an eco-city is an important determinant of the accuracy of the evaluation. We present a new eco-city evaluation method comprising an ecological vulnerability evaluation index system and an economic, social and environmental evaluation index system based on land use, economic development, social progress and environmental protection using spatial analysis technology (remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS)). We constructed an ecological vulnerability evaluation index system using a pressure-state-response (PSR) model and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on an ecological suitability index, landscape pattern index and land resource utilization degree index and comprehensively evaluated the ecological vulnerability condition using principal component analysis (PCA) and an expert scoring method. We established an economic, social and environmental evaluation index system using factor analysis. These index systems are associated with the GIS and the AHP, and Jiangsu Province was used as an example to verify the applicability and efficiency of the evaluation method. The results show the following. (1) The ecological vulnerability of Jiangsu is relatively low but unevenly distributed. The regions with slight, light and medium vulnerabilities comprised 79.49% of the total area. (2) Thirteen cities were divided into economic advantages type (Suzhou), environmental advantages type (Nanjing, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and Taizhou), social security advantages type (Changzhou, Xuzhou and Nantong) and general type (Lianyungang, Huaian, Yancheng and Suclian). (3) The overall condition of the eco-cities was classified as middle or upper and was unevenly distributed. The eco-cities were divided into four categories and there was a gradually decreasing trend from southeast to northwest, resulting in a gradient from southern Jiangsu to middle Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu. Every city should be constructed on the basis of its weak points to achieve healthy and optimum development. The results indicated that the method is an efficient and practical process, which differs from existing methods, and makes extensive use of spatial information technology and can be widely applied to evaluate eco-cities.

AB  - Composition of free amino acids (FAA) in juveniles of Mytilus galloprovincialis was analysed along a large geographical coastline area in Galicia (NW Spain). Individuals were sampled in February 2003, three months after the Prestige oil spill. Pollution values at sampling time were reported as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations in soft tissues of individuals and varied between the highest amount observed in Carrumeiro mussels (502 ng/g dw) and the lowest in Pindo mussels (196 ng/g dw), both locations being close to each other in the centre of the geographical area under study. Pollution values in the other populations varied within the range of 241-347 ng/g dw. Total free amino acids (TFAA) were highest in Aguino-Pindo-Carrumeiro juveniles at the centre of the Coastline area studied (420-462 mu mol/g dw) as compared to the other populations at North and South of Galicia (312-347 mu mol/g dw). TFAA results were based on the variability observed in protein free amino acids (PFAA mu mol/g dw) among populations (214-249 mu mol/g dw for Aguino-Pindo-Carrumeiro mussels and 98-149 mu mol/g dw for the other populations) whereas non-protein free amino acids (NPFAA) taurine and ornithine did not show any significant spatial pattern of variation. Glycine and alanine represented the most abundant PFAA (16-29% and 2.7-11.9% of TPFAA, respectively) and significant correlations between PFAA and both the protein content of soft tissues (r=-0.82) and the condition index of juveniles (r=0.86) were observed. No significant relationships were detected, however, between pollution values in soft tissues as PAHs and FAA profiles with the exception of alanine concentrations as percentage of TFAA (r=0.88; P < 0.01). The latter seemed to be an "all or nothing" effect likely due to the influence of other abiotic factors at one of the sampling sites. Such relationship was found not significant when the outlier represented by Carrumeiro mussels was removed from the analysis. The most abundant free amino acid taurine (43.2-68.5%TFAA) followed an inverse variability of that of glycine and by extension of the group PFAA most likely as a compensatory decrease in mussel populations with low protein content (and high condition index). Accordingly, taurine:glycine (t:g) ratio varied between I and 2 in most mussel populations but increased up to 3.2-4.2 in Miranda and Bueu mussels at both ends of the geographical interval studied with a corresponding PAHs concentrations of 261 and 304 ng/g dw, respectively. These mussel populations with the highest t:g ratios were characterised by the lowest PFAA contents (below 40%) and condition index values (below 10%). Results of the present study established a significant link between energetic status of growing juveniles and FAA concentrations in environments with different pollution degrees. Variability of the free amino acids profiles in soft tissues were related to endogenous factors of juveniles (protein content, condition index) whereas no relationship with contamination values could be observed. The utility of t:g ratio as general condition factor for M galloprovincialis is also corroborated for in situ growing juveniles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt marsh vegetation is one important biological element for establishing the ecological quality status (EQS) while evaluating transitional waters (TW). This intertidal plant community is sensitive to the most important pressures present in estuaries. In this study, an ecological index based multi-metric was established taking into account the species composition and ecological relations in Portuguese salt marsh habitats. During the AQuA-Index elaboration it was found that the parameters that respond better to the variability of ecological conditions present nowadays are the Shannon Diversity Index, the Shannon Maximum Diversity Index, the number of halophytic species, the Margalef Diversity Index and the Pielou Equitability Index. The application of the AQuA-Index index to eight TW systems varying in morphology and pressures, demonstrated that the metric responds to the ecological quality of each system. Also, it showed some advantages in comparison with other approaches, in zones with a relevant proportion of middle and upper marsh and where historical data were not available. This way the AQuA-Index proved to be an efficient Index for ecological quality assessment, using salt marsh vegetation as indicator. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The population parameters of blood cockles, Tegillarca granosa in the intertidal zone of Marudu Bay, Sabah, Malaysia were investigated based on monthly length-weight frequency data (July 2017 to June 2018). A total of 279 cockle individuals with shell length and weight ranging from 27.7 mm to 82.2 mm and 13.11 g to 192.7 g were subjected to analysis. T. granosa in Marudu Bay showed a consistent moderately high condition index 4.98 +/- 0.86 throughout the year. The exponent b of the length-weight relationship was 2.6 demonstrating negative allometric growth. The estimated asymptotic length (L-infinity), growth coefficient (K) and growth performance (phi) of the T. granosa population in Marudu Bay were estimated at 86.68 mm, 0.98 a(-1) and 3.87, respectively. The observed maximum shell length was 82.55 mm and the predicted maximum shell length was 84.44 mm with estimated maximum life span (t(max)) of 3.06 years. The estimated mean lengths at the end of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months of age were 21.31 mm, 31.16 mm, 39.53 mm, 46.63 mm, 52.67 mm and 57.79 mm. Total, natural, and fishing mortalities were estimated at 2.39 a(-1), 1.32 a(-1) and 1.07 a(-1). The exploitation level (E) was 0.45. Results of the current study also demonstrated that T. granosa in the Marudu Bay has two major recruitment peaks; one in March and another in October. The exploitation level revealed that natural stock of T. granosa in the Marudu Bay was approaching the maximum exploitation level. If such trend continues or demand for T. granosa is increasing, coupled with no effective fisheries management in place, possibility of the T. granosa population in the Marudu Bay to collapse is likely to elevate.

AB  - This paper presents results of a laboratory study designed to assess the impact of pollution in Espirito Santo Estuary, Mozambique, by the use of scope for growth (SFG) and condition indices in the clam Meretrix meretrix. Low energy balances were observed at all sites from the estuary (0.91-2.89 J h(-1) g(-1)) as well as from the comparison site (2.57 J h(-1) g(-1)). Lowest condition index was observed in clams from the comparison site. Results from the present study indicate symptoms of stress and impact of pollution, and whether M. meretrix is a suitable candidate species for further studies of environmental contamination in coastal regions. This study is to our knowledge the first to investigate the energy available for growth in M. meretrix in its southern area of distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to understand the status of soil heavy metal pollution and its impact on human health, the degree of soil heavy metal pollution in the Changchun New Area and the associated ecological risk and health risk were evaluated using the geo-accumulation index method, potential ecological risk index method, and health risk assessment model. The results showed that the average contents of eight heavy metals in the soil were higher than their background values in Changchun City, with different degrees of accumulation. The soil of Changchun New Area showed Hg and Cd pollution, with ecological risks. The average geo-accumulation index of Hg was 0.43. reflecting light to medium pollution, and the risk index ranged from 42 to 806, reflecting moderate to strong ecological risk. The level of Cd pollution was found to be light. In contrast, the soil was free of Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, and Cu pollution, with no apparent risk. However, they all exceeded the reference value of soil treatment proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (10(-6)). Therefore, prevention measures for heavy metal pollution should be further strengthened.

AB  - The assessment of ecological status of marine fish communities required by the marine strategy framework directive (MSFD) emphasises the need for fish-based ecological indices in marine waters. In this study we adapt five estuarine multimetric indices to the marine environment and apply them in three types of substrates, analysing the metrics responsible for the obtained patterns of ecological status. The results show inefficiency of the community degradation index (CDI) and the biological health index (BHI) in ecological status assessment and disagreement between the estuarine biotic integrity index (EBI), the estuarine fish community index (EFCI) and the transitional fish classification index (TFCI). Analysis of individual metrics suggests lack of representativeness and consideration for the particularities of each substrate's typical fish communities. None of the tested indices were efficient on the marine environment, urging the need for new marine indices that account for differences between types of substrate and depth. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oysters, Ostrea edulis, collected from three locations in the Damariscotta River area, Maine, were examined for the presence of Bonamia ostreae four times between June 1994 and April 1995. Overall prevalence was 5% (13 of 291), with no significant differences between sampling sites or dates. All but one of the infections were classified as ''low'' intensity. Results obtained with histological preparations and stained blood smears were similar. Results obtained with the immunofluorescence technique were unclear. No fluorescent B. ostreae cells were observed with monoclonal antibody (MAB) 20B2. Even though MAB 15C2 was in 75% agreement with results obtained by standard histological preparations, the fluorescence was faint. Condition index was not significantly different between infected and uninfected oysters. Although B. ostreae is present in the Damariscotta River area, the development of disease and mortality may be precluded by the low density of oysters in natural beds and the relatively cold winters.

AB  - The maturity index, an ecological measure of the state of succession, is based on the composition of the nematode fauna. Nematodes that feed on higher plants were originally excluded; a separate plant parasite index was proposed for nematodes feeding on higher plants.
   In the present study it is shown that, under certain conditions, the maturity index and plant parasite index are inversely related. Therefore it is concluded that the inclusion of plant feeders into the maturity index, as recently suggested, leads to an index which is less sensitive to changes in the environment than the original maturity index. The divergence of maturity index and plant parasite index is confirmed by literature data and is assumed to be a nutrient enrichment effect. The ratio between maturity index and plant parasite index is proposed as a sensitive parameter for monitoring agro-ecosystems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The Grassland Biome is currently one of the most threatened biomes in South Africa and is in dire need of a biomonitoring protocol. The components of ecological integrity in these ecosystems are, however, too diverse and time-consuming to measure scrupulously. It is therefore necessary to develop a set of grassland indicators that are efficient and rapid in their assessment of grassland ecosystem integrity. The South African Grassland Scoring System (SAGraSS), based on the grassland insect community, is such a suggested indicator. The present study is the first to investigate the applicability and rapidity of this proposed method. Although SAGraSS scores correlated significantly with Ecological Index values (the most commonly used index by which veld condition is evaluated in central South Africa), the method proved to be tedious and the identification of insects taxing. We offer a number of changes to make the SAGraSS method a more rapid method of assessment.

AB  - To detect and locate the structural damage from direct measurements can be done only when the sensors are very closely located to the damage initiating point, which is generally impossible to predict, particularly for the reinforced concrete structures. With the availability of high-resolution distributed sensing, using optical tracker on light targets, the damage location as well as the level of damage can be identified. The objective of this article is to conduct structural system identification of a reinforced concrete frame by using the proposed structural integrity index (identify the element curvature and null-space damage index) and the estimation of finite element strain. Finally, a discussion on the identified time-varying system natural frequency and stiffness/strength degradation of the reinforced concrete structure from global measurement in relation to the calculated structural integrity index using optical sensing array data and element strain on the identification of damage location and damage severity are presented.

AB  - Biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors are considered in isolation for prioritisation of watersheds. Instead, it requires a multidisciplinary geoecolocical approach. The geoecology based prioritisation provides opportunities to assess the region by evaluating these multiple factors in combination. Thus, Geoecological Integrity Index (GII) was developed for prioritisation of Baner River watersheds of Indian northwestern Himalayan region by integrating biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors as the region is facing geological and ecological instability. Forest cover density and net primary productivity were used as biotic factors and drainage morphometry, soil erosion, and patches were used as abiotic factors. Population density of the watershed was considered as an anthropogenic factor. Weighed overlay analysis was carried out to understand the influence of each of these factors on watershed prioritisation. These factors were integrated to arrive at cumulative weights (GII) for micro-watersheds. With the help of GII, out of 110 micro-watersheds, 11 were prioritised as very high actionable, 32 as high actionable, 52 as moderately actionable and 15 as of minimal action, requiring suitable actions in a prioritised manner to conserve and manage. The study presents an approach for geoecological assessment of watersheds that can be replicated in watersheds of other Himalayan regions or areas having similar geoecological conditions.Research highlightsGeoecological Integrity Index (GII) was developed for prioritisation of watersheds in Indian north-western Himalaya.GII was developed considering biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors, which are generally treated in isolation.Geoecological factors were integrated to arrive at cumulative weights (GII) for micro-watersheds.Out of 110 micro-watersheds, 11 were prioritised as very high actionable, 32 as high actionable, 52 as moderately actionable and 15 as of minimal action, requiring suitable actions for its conservation and management.Study provided an approach for geoecological assessment of watersheds that can be replicated in any other watersheds having similar conditions.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are priority pollutants in surface waters according to Directive 2013/39/EC. They are toxic, persistent and tend to accumulate in high concentrations in aquatic organisms. In the present study, zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was confirmed as a bio-indicator for contaminated freshwater ecosystems. We aimed to study the effects of short-term (96 h) and long-term (31 days) exposure to Cd and PAHs on the Condition index (CI) and Soft Tissue Wet Ratio (STWR) in zebra mussel. Overall, we found alterations in both CI and STWR (as compared to the control group) at all tested concentrations, including the one below the allowable concentration according to the EU legislation. These results demonstrated the toxicity of both contaminants. Furthermore, we confirmed that the studied condition indices could be successfully applied as biomarkers as they are fast and low-cost in future monitoring and risk assessment of polluted freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the bioconcentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn in the soft tissue of transplanted oysters in two sites in the Potengi estuary for six months. Native oysters collected before and after the transplantation experiment provided the background for statistical analyses. Cd, Cr, and Ni showed a strong inverse correlation with oyster weight in both sites. Transplantation upstream of the estuary presented increasing concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Pb and condition index (CI) and decreasing trends for Cd and Ni, whereas Cr oscillated significantly. In the downstream transplantation, Cu, Pb, and Zn and the CI tended to decrease, whereas for Ni, Cd, and Cr, the concentrations increased. Spatiotemporal principal component analysis correlated these results mainly with proximity to the polluting source, seasonality, and previous exposure to heavy metals. These results helped interpret the responses provided by these biomonitors to environmental changes, whether they are natural or anthropogenic.

AB  - The eco-environment provides various spaces, conditions, and resources for human development, and their quality is a significant factor affecting sustainable development in a region. Most drylands face environmental fragility due to problems such as infertile land, scarce suitable living space, and a lack of resources. Therefore, investigating the temporal and spatial changes in the eco-environment of drylands is vital to developing them sustainably. This paper takes Hetian, which is located in the Tarim Basin of Western China and has typical features of an arid (or a hyper-arid) region, as the research area. The ecological index (EI) was used to construct a comprehensive ecological evaluation system, and five sub-indices (the biological richness index, vegetation coverage index, water network denseness index, land stress index, and pollution load index) were calculated to identify the quality and changes in the eco-environment of Hetian in 1995, 2009, and 2018. The results show that, from 1995 to 2018, the EI in Hetian showed a continuous downward trend (from 24.76 to 16.32), representing a change (Delta EI) of -8.44; this indicates significant deterioration in the quality of the local eco-environment. Large fluctuations in the EI also suggests that the environment in Hetian is very sensitive. In addition, the results revealed a degradation of Hetian, which includes a hyper-arid region.

AB  - Dynamics of clupeiform fish populations such as anchovy are frequently impacted by environmental variations which can affect the success of the species recruitment. Herein, we have analyzed recent otolith growth rate, RNA/DNA nutritional condition index (sRD), and mortality rate of argentine anchovy larvae Engraulis anchoita from three different nursery areas in the Southwest Atlantic. We have evaluated the relationship between the environmental variables (abundance of copepod nauplii, temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, and abundance of E. anchoita larvae) and larval endogenous variables (size, weight, age, and otolith radius) to sRD and recent growth rate. Fast larval growth rates were observed toward the northern sector of the studied area, characterized by higher temperature. High values of sRD were associated with higher nauplii abundance in the proximity of coastal fronts. The larvae with the lowest growths and lowest minimum values of nutritional condition coincided with the area where there was less abundance of nauplii and higher larval mortality. Larval size and nauplii abundance were positive explanatory factors for both recent growth rate and sRD index. Temperature had a positive effect on recent growth rate and a negative effect on sRD index. This condition index was poorly explained in terms of model fit in comparison with the growth model. The results herein provided could be significant to better understand the recruitment of the species, as to determining favorable areas for the growth and survival of anchovy larvae.

AB  - As a consequence of accelerated global warming, estuarine and marine bay temperature and salinity regimes will change, influencing the survival, reproduction and development of marine organisms, especially bivalve species. In order to understand their response to temperature and salinity variations the bivalve mollusc Anadara trapezia, was exposed for 56 days to twelve combinations of temperature and salinity (10 degrees C-20 degrees C-30 degrees C/15 ppt-20 ppt-25 ppt-30 ppt) in laboratory controlled conditions. Mortality was assessed daily over the course of the exposure. After 56 days, a suite of responses were measured in surviving organisms, including biomarkers at the molecular and cellular level; total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilisation and at the whole organism level as condition index. Greater mortality occurred at temperature extremes (10 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and the lowest salinity treatment (15 ppt). Total antioxidant capacity was not significantly different but lower TOAC occurred at temperature extremes. Lipid peroxidation was also significantly higher at temperature extremes while salinity had no effect. Lysosomal membrane destabilisation was influenced by temperature and salinity with lysosomal membrane destabilisation increasing at temperature extremes and as salinity decreased. As TOAC decreased, the trends were for lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilisation to increase and condition index and survival to decrease. The results demonstrate that A. trapezia can tolerate changes in either salinity or temperature but deleterious biochemical changes, high mortality and reduced condition occur when these vary in unison at temperature extremes and low salinity.

AB  - Health assessment of free-ranging populations requires an integrated approach, often incorporating a method to measure mass as a representation of the animals' ability to utilize environmental resources. In chelonians, direct measurements of mass have historically served as a corollary for body condition. However, this method may not accurately represent the true fat volume (FV) and may be skewed by the presence of eggs, shell size, or muscle mass. The objective of this study was to use computed tomography (CT) to develop a model for determining body condition index (BCI) in free-ranging Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii). Mass, shell measurements, and FV were measured by CT in 65 free-ranging Blanding's turtles from Lake and DuPage counties in Illinois. Twenty-one different models were built for BCI using both FV and fat percentage (FP) as dependent variables. The best fit model for FP included the relationship between mass and carapace length with nearly 60% model support. The model for FV demonstrated a similar relationship but had only 18% support. Linear models with BCI as the dependent variable showed that juveniles had a higher FP than adults and females with more eggs had a lower FP. FP can be calculated in the field with nearly 60% accuracy compared to CT-assessed FP as a component of a physical exam and population health survey to assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts for the endangered Blanding's turtle.

AB  - Understanding relationships between the size of individuals and their subsequent survival can not only provide insights into mechanisms of mortality, but can also identify traits to measure for monitoring at-risk populations. We analyzed a data set of more than 54000 juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from 15 populations over five years. The juveniles were tagged during the summer in their freshwater rearing habitats and then recaptured at downstream sites the following spring after an extended rearing and overwintering period. We measured the length and weight of fish at tagging and computed a "condition index" that determined how fat or thin a fish was relative to others. Among populations, mean length and mean condition index were poor predictors of survival, but we did detect year and site effects. Within populations, survival was strongly related to the relative length of individuals but not to relative condition index. Our results are consistent with length-related mechanisms of mortality mediated by hierarchical behavior, and thus merely measuring changes in mean values of morphological traits in populations of juveniles may provide little insight into expected changes in population viability. Expanding upon these results, we predicted a nearly 60% increase in selection for juvenile fish length when we extended our observation period through adulthood. Thus, monitoring populations through only a portion of their life history may present an incomplete picture of their survival variability.

AB  - The role of the environment is an important issue in policy making and the accurate assessment of the environmental conditions is vital. In this paper, using nonparametric techniques, an environmental efficiency index is developed for each of the OECD countries. These indexes allow one both to do cross section comparisons on the state of each country's production process in its treatment of undesirable outputs and also to trace each country's modification of their production processes overtime. Furthermore in this study we investigate the factors underlying societies' environmental concerns that eventually lead to changes in the environmental efficiency. The results provide further empirical evidence for the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis.

AB  - Introduction: Ecosystem services are the benefits delivering from the natural environment to human society. Ecosystem services are regarded as important tools for decision-makers to understand the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) change. Outcomes: The dynamic of four primary ecosystem service indicators were assessed over 1984-2014 based on InVEST model and their responses to LULC changes have been analyzed by the ecosystem service change index (ESCI) and ecosystem service state index (ESSI). Our results confirmed the significant increment in land reclamation in Zhoushan City and over half of the reclamation area was used for human-induced urbanization and over a quarter for the fishery. For the whole territory, the most significant LULC conversions were observed between agricultural land and urban. The study period witnessed the degradation of habitat quality and soil sediment, an increment of the water yield and no significant change of carbon storage. Discussion and Conclusion: Most changes in LULC are significantly related to the dynamics of ecosystem services, which were more impacted in the reclamation area than the rest of the city. Our study highlights the importance of ecosystem service assessments for sustainable land planning and securing economic development.

AB  - This paper examines the extent of variation in regulatory stringency below the state level, using establishment-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey to estimate a county-level index of environmental compliance costs. County-level variation is found to explain 11 to 18 times more of the variation in environmental compliance costs than state-level variation alone, and the range of environmental compliance costs within a state is often large. At least 34% of U.S. counties have environmental compliance costs that are statistically different from their states'. Results suggest that unportant spatial variation is lost in state-level studies of environmental regulation. (JEL Q52, R52)

AB  - Coherence between ecological status assessment by phytoplankton and attached diatoms was analyzed in the littoral zone of Lake Balaton. Sampling of periphytic diatoms, phytoplankton, and water were carried out at ten different littoral sites in the northern and southern shores of the lake for a year. Phytoplankton species were sorted into functional groups and ecological status was assessed by means of the phytoplankton assemblage Q index. The index TDIL was calculated using quantitative attached diatom data. Significant differences were found between the ecological assessments based on phytoplankton and phytobenthos metrics, both seasonally and spatially. The Q index indicated ecological states varying from bad to good, while the average of diatom indices varied from moderate to high conditions. The Q index provided more realistic ecological status of Lake Balaton, compared with trophic status based on TP values, especially in the summer period. Differences in the response-time indication of phytoplankton and attached diatoms suggest that lack of coherence should also be expected between the responses of other BQEs.

AB  - In many Protected Areas of Eastern Europe and Siberia, the European spruce (Picea abies) or Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) plays a significant role in plant communities. Difficulties in determining the specific and intraspecific diversity of spruce in Protected Areas occur in the zone of natural (introgressive) hybridisation of spruce. Since the time of Ledebour's studies, the main diagnostic feature of these spruce species is the shape of the upper part of seed (cone) scales. The European spruce has an angularly acuminate and noticeably elongated cone scale, while the cone scale of the Siberian spruce has a close to rounded form and it is less elongated. In East-European spruce populations, formed under introgression influence, this trait has an intermediate character. The shape of the upper part of spruce seed scales remains constant throughout the whole tree life. And it is characterised by a high variability within populations and between different populations. Nowadays, the study of the phenotypic diversity of the spruce populations is performed using visual descriptive assessment. i.e. subjectively. Consequently, disparate results are often obtained even for the same study areas. The applying of metric assessment of a trait and the consequent distinguishing of the phenotypes of individuals allow to perform mathematical processing of the results and to obtain objective data about the population structure. We aimed to study the phenotypic diversity of spruce in Protected Areas in Eastern Europe and Siberia on the basis of metric assessment primarily of the shape of seed scales. The determination of the coefficient of narrowing (C-n) and coefficient of projection (C-p) of the upper part of seed scale can be considered as the most objective method to study this diagnostic trait. The difference between these coefficients (C-n-C-p) is a more informative indicator to characterise properties of individuals, populations and their groups.
   In Eastern Europe and Siberia, we distinguished nine areas of distribution of different population groups (or phenotypes): P.e., P.ecm., P.em., P.emm., P.m., P.mms., P.ms., P.mss., P.s. They are characterised by an average value of the C-n-C-p indicator: -50%, -40%, -30%, -20%, -10%, 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively. On the basis of this gradation in populations, we adopted a similar gradation of individuals' phenotypes: e, eem, em, emm, m, mms, ms, mss, s. On the basis of study of the spruce population diversity in Protected Areas in Eastern Europe and Siberia, considering phenotypes identified by the metric traits of seed scales, we found that all of them significantly differed in terms of all analysed traits. In the National Park "Belovezhskaya Pushcha", Carpathian Biosphere Reserve, Central Forest State Natural Biosphere Reserve, and Oksky State Natural Biosphere Reserve (European range of spruce), we found the highest cone length, highest phenotype frequency of European spruce individuals (60-100%). In these Protected Areas, there are no or very few intermediate phenotypes, and no Siberian spruce phenotypes. The Lapland State Natural Biosphere Reserve, Visimskiy State Natural Biosphere Reserve, Yuganskiy State Nature Reserve, Sokhondinskiy State Natural Biosphere Reserve, and Vitimskiy State Nature Reserve formed the opposite group according to all indicators studied. These Protected Areas are located within the range of the Siberian spruce. They are c tensed by predomination (63-100%) of phenotypes of Siberian spruce individuals, while there are no European spruce phenotypes. We established the predominance of intermediate spruce phenotypes in the State Nature Reserve "Kologrivskiy Leso", National Park "Chavash Varmane", Volzhsko-Kamskiy State Nature Biosphere Reserve, and Pinega State Nature Reserve. Of them, the first two Protected Areas are a bit closer to European spruce phenotypes, while the second two Protected Areas are characterised by similarity to the Siberian spruce phenotypes. The objective, sufficiently tested method to study the spruce population phenotypic diversity can also be used mother Protected Areas.

AB  - Quantitative evaluation of the aquatic ecosystem health is crucial to formulate policies about environmental water management and ecological restoration. However, it is often difficult to quantitatively compare or estimate the health of aquatic ecosystems for different watersheds. In this study, we developed a Freshwater Ecosystem Health Index (FEHI) based on a modified Zooplankton-based Index of Biotic Integrity (ZIBI) to address this difficulty. The ZIBI was developed based on the top six principal components (cumulative % = 88.6%) of 32 zooplankton community indicators. Then the ZIBI was transformed into the FEHI by using the arc-tangent function (to make FEHI fall into (0,1)). FEHI rating scales that were defined as (0,0.2), [0.2,0.4), [0.4,0.6), [0.6,0.8), [0.8,1) fall within bad, poor, fair, good, and excellent freshwater ecosystem health condition, respectively. Moreover, we established six estimation models of FEHI, respectively, directing at six situations that the available indicators are limited. The FEHI calculation and estimation models were then applied to evaluate three lakes and four river basins in eastern China. The results showed that the aquatic ecosystem health was good in areas that included rivers in Tongxiang plain, Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake, rural area of Qinhuai River basin, Shahu Lake during Summer/Autumn. However, the aquatic ecosystem health was bad or fair in Xuanwu Lake (an urban shallow lake), the urban area of Qinhuai River basin, Huaihe basin, Yinghe basin, and Shahu Lake in winter. The FEHI will be a new and effective approach for quantitative evaluation/estimation of freshwater aquatic ecosystem health in eastern China.

AB  - In this study, spatial clustering techniques were used in combination with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to characterize the relationships between in-stream health indicators and socioeconomic measures of communities. The study area is the Saginaw River Watershed in Michigan. Four measures of stream health were considered: the Index of Biological Integrity, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, Family Index of Biological Integrity, and number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa. The stream health indicators were predicted using nine socioeconomic variables that capture vulnerability in population. The results of spatial clustering showed that incorporating clustering configuration improves the model prediction. A total of 510 Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFAs) and 85 multivariate regression models were developed for each spatial cluster within the watershed and compared with the model performance without spatial clustering (at the watershed level). In general, watershed level CFAs outperformed cluster level CFAs, while the reverse was true for the regression models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salamandra atra atra is the most widespread subspecies of the Alpine Salamander, both in Italy and in the other parts of the species distribution range. However, in particular for Italian populations, its ecology and demographic parameters are poorly known. We studied biometry (length, mass, body condition index) and demography (population density, sex ratio, proportion of gravid females) of this fully terrestrial salamander in the "Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino" Natural Park in the Dolomites. We used removal methods to estimate abundance on a surface of about 1000 m(2). Density estimate of adults was 472 salamanders/ha, which falls within the density estimates that are available for this taxon. Sexes did not differ significantly in size and body mass. Body sizes of adults included the maximum sized salamander recorded in Italy. There was a high rate of gravid females (50%), which were comparable in size with non-gravid females. Males and non-gravid females did not show significant differences in their body condition index.

AB  - In this paper, the ecological integrity hierarchy framework (EIHF) and the natural capital index framework (NCI) are integrated as decision-making tools for evaluating the natural capital of Mexico. Two hierarchy-levels of ecological integrity indicators are used to estimate the quality and quantity of the natural capital, the amount of ecological degradation and ecological sustainability. After human transformation, the extent still considered as "natural" in the country is similar to 67%; while the amount of human transformed areas is similar to 33%, which gives a total estimate of NCI=0.334; i.e., only similar to 33.4% of the national capital remains available, while similar to 33% is ecologically degraded. Furthermore, the critical natural capital; i.e., the legacy for future generations that remains in the country is only similar to 12%. The total estimated value of the current natural capital in Mexico is similar to$ 457.1 billion/yr, which is similar to 435 times greater than the national GDP ($ 1.051 billion in 2010). The cost of maintaining the degradation of the natural capital is similar to$ 144.6 billion/yr (similar to 138 times greater than national GDP in 2010). The potential value of the natural capital after restoration would be similar to$ 602 billion/yr. Valuing the natural capital can be helpful for strategic environmental evaluations and useful for spatial decision support systems that evaluate natural capital as a decision-making tool.

AB  - The distribution of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, which is often dominant in intertidal zones, is influenced by both environmental and biological conditions. However, there have been few comprehensive studies on the interactive effects of these two groups of factors. The present study examined the environmental and biological parameters determining the population dynamics of the clams that is a dominant component of the intertidal communities of Euhangri and Padori on the west coast of Korean peninsula. We collected R. philippinarum and other members of the macrobenthos (> 1 mm long) monthly from 0.25 m(2) quadrats deployed in the intertidal zones at Euhangri, Taean, and Padori during the period from August 2013 to January 2015. Physicochemical parameters of the water and sediment were measured at the same time. Water temperature and salinity is high and low in the summer to winter, respectively. While mean grain size of the sediment was higher at Euhangri than at Padori, total mean density of R. philippinarum was higher at Euhangri (325 ind./ 0.25 m(2) at Padori vs. 194 ind./ 0.25 m(2) at Euhangri). Settled spat (< 10 mm in length) density was much higher at Euhangri than at Padori (132 vs. 12 individuals/0.25m(2), respectively). R. philippinarum spats settled down on the sediment at Euhangri in October and grew continually until the following May, when they reached adult size. Spats that settled down at Padori between March and April were not able to reach the adult stage. As the density of the adult population increased, the condition index of individual clams decreased, but as the population density of the spat increased the body condition index increased. The chlorophyll a content of the sediments at Padori exceeded that at Euhangri and decreased as the population of R. philippinarum increased. The shapes of R. philippinarum shells at Euhangri were more prolate than those at Padori, and the condition index at Euhangri exceeded that at Padori, indicating better growth conditions at Euhangri. The condition index and density of R. philippinarum were affected by the amount of chlorophyll a in the water column and in the sediment. The recruitment success of spats was negatively influenced by spat density. We suggest that regulation of habitat conditions for R. philippinarum, including the food supply, will optimize production of these commercial clams.

AB  - In recent years, China has experienced rapid economic development and thousands of people escaped from poverty. However, this high-speed development has also led to increased pressure on the environment. Although the Chinese government has focused on solving environmental problems for the past few decades, it appears to have had little effect. Environmental performance evaluation (EPE) is a quantifiable environmental management tool that can evaluate environmental protection effects and provide guidance to improve government efficiency. We use EPE to evaluate China's environmental performance at the provincial level between 2006 and 2011. In this study, the theme framework and driver force pressure -state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework models are used to build the composite index (CI) for environmental performance. This index includes 39 indicators in four categories that were selected based on data that can be acquired from China's Statistical Bureau. The results indicate that the environmental performance index (EPI) of 30 provincial administrative regions (PARS) from 2006 to 2011 ranges from 44.12 (Shanxi, 2006) to 80.87 (Beijing, 2010), from poor to good, respectively. To help develop more effective policies to improve China's regional environmental performance, cluster analysis (CLA) is applied to divide the 30 PARS into 3 sub-regions. Recommendations for improving the environmental performance of different sub-regions are made to help guide the Chinese government to adjust environmental governance approaches to local conditions.

AB  - Because the traditional method does not consider the accurate evaluation of the environmental conditions of the garden space, the restoration method of the garden space environment has the problems of low evaluation accuracy and high restoration cost. Therefore, a garden space environment restoration method based on P-IBI factor analysis is proposed. The P-IBI index is calculated to determine the environmental restoration index, and the factor scoring result is obtained by combining common factors, and common factors according to the evaluation index standard, so as to realise the P-IBI factor load analysis. Based on this, the garden space environment restoration plan is determined. The experimental results show that the evaluation accuracy of this method is always above 94%, the average evaluation time is 0.74 s, and the maximum restoration cost of the garden space environment is 549,000 yuan. It can be seen that this method has a certain practical application effect.

AB  - The reproductive cycle and physiological status of five populations of Patella vulgata have been studied along the Galician coast from July 2010 to June 2011. The use of generalized linear model has allowed to obtain parameters such as Days and Day(95), which helped compare reproductive cycles among populations and allowed to determine the significance of the effect of size and degree of exposure on the start and duration of the cycle. On the other hand, a standardized condition index has been established, which enables the comparison of samples collected in different sites or seasons and composed by individuals of different size. Moreover, the use of a generalized nonlinear least squares model has allowed assessing the temporal variability of the physiological status of the populations and the effect of size and degree of exposure on its different components. This has contributed some useful information for planning a sustainable exploitation of this resource: sheltered areas turned out to be more productive, in terms of biomass. The reproductive cycle starts earlier and its duration is longer in sheltered areas. In addition, organisms showed minimum condition indexes during spawning periods, which makes these periods less suitable for the exploitation, both from a biological and from a commercial point of view. Larger organisms showed longer spawning periods. This highlights the importance of taking size composition into account, seeking to maintain a size structure which enables a reproductive period which is long enough to ensure future recruitment success.

AB  - As part of NOAA's Status and Trends Program, oysters were sampled from 43 sites throughout the Gulf of Mexico from Brownsville, Texas, to the Florida Everglades from 1986 to 1989. Oysters were analysed for body burden of a suite of metals and petroleum aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the prevalence and intensity of the oyster pathogen, Perkinsus marinus, and condition index. The contaminants fell into two groups based on the spatial distribution of body burden throughout the Gulf. Arsenic, selenium, mercury and cadmium were characterized by clinal reduction in similarity with distance reminiscent of that followed by mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Zinc, copper, PAHs and silver showed no consistent geographic trend. Within local regions, industrial and agricultural land use and P. marinus prevalence and infection intensity frequently correlated with body burden. Contaminants and biological attributes followed one of three temporal trends. Zinc, copper and PAHs showed concordant shifts over 4 years throughout the eastern and southern Gulf. Mercury and cadmium showed concordant shifts in the northwestern Gulf. Selenium, arsenic, length, condition index and P. marinus prevalence and infection intensity showed concordant shifts throughout most of the entire Gulf. Concordant shifts suggest that climatic factors, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation being one example, exert a strong influence on biological attributes and contaminant body burdens in the Gulf. Correlative factors are those that probably affect or indicate the rate of tissue turnover and the frequency of reproduction; namely, temperature, disease intensity, condition index and length.

AB  - An assessment of the current ecological state of Sivash Bay (southern part of the Eastern Sivash) under the conditions of changes in its water regime is given in this study. Judging from the concentrations of the main pollutant classes, the prevailing type of anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem state of the studied area is the reduction of freshwater runoff, which caused the growth of salinity. Quantitative indicators of the microbial community of the bay bottom sediments characterize their pollution with organic substances. The increase in salinity of the reservoir caused a restructuring of the main components of the bottom community, such as meio and macrozoobenthos, expressed in a lowering of the biodiversity indicators and a change in the biocenosis taxonomic structure.

AB  - Austropotamobius torrentium (Schrank, 1803), the smallest species of freshwater crayfish from the family Astacidae, is considered a vulnerable species, protected by international laws. Since it has never been economically important, it has not been frequently studied. Therefore, the results presented in this paper are a contribution to the knowledge on stone crayfish's population size structure, size at maturity, growth, and condition index throughout the year, as a possible tool for evaluating protection and restocking measures of this threatened species. The research included three stone crayfish populations with 1492 specimens in the "Medvednica" Nature Park, north-west Croatia, during a period of 18 months. In all the populations studied, crayfish of a total length between 5 and 8 cm prevailed. Activity of different size classes had a seasonal pattern that could be connected to different crayfish activities throughout the year. Appearance of sexual maturity within the populations coincides with the crayfish total length between 5 and 6 cm, after which allometric growth of males' claws was recorded. On average males gain 0.42-0.72 cm and 2.65-4.30 g per moult, while females gain 0.44-0.70 cm and 2.04-3.83 g. Crayfish condition varied throughout the year with, in general, both juvenile and adult males having higher condition indices than juvenile and adult females in all three populations. In addition, adult crayfish were in significantly better condition in the autumn, whereas juveniles had higher condition indices in the summer.

AB  - Seasonal variations of environmental factors, such as temperature and salinity, require metabolic acclimatization in sedentary benthic fauna distributed over a wide geographical range. The soft-shell clam Mya arenaria inhabits the coastal waters of the North Atlantic including North America and Europe. In Europe, M. arenaria populations are distributed from Iceland to the Mediterranean Sea, including the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Seasonal changes in physiological parameters (gonad index, condition index, biochemical composition and respiration rate) of M. arenaria from the Baltic Sea (the Gulf of GdaA"sk, Poland), and the North Sea (Versee Meer, the Netherlands) were studied. The sex ratio of both populations did not differ from 1:1 and the seasonal gonad index was higher in the Baltic population. The average condition index changed seasonally at both studied sites, and was also higher in the Baltic population (except the autumn) compared to the North Sea. In both studied populations, the content of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates in the soft tissue followed the seasonal variations, and it was higher in the Baltic population. The respiration rate was lower in the Baltic population, and seasonal changes in the respiration rate seem to be correlated with changes in the water temperature. Based on the results obtained in the present study, we suggest that Mya arenaria is characterized by a large phenotypic plasticity and differences in the observed physiological traits are due to acclimatization to ambient environmental conditions.

AB  - The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793) is the most cultivated bivalve in the world. Nonetheless, the massive production of microalgae as feed represents a substantial cost during laboratory production stages. The use of single cell detritus (SCD) from seaweed Ulva lactuca, cultivated in fish farm effluents, has been proposed as an alternative to microalgae Chaetoceros calcitrans in oyster culture, with the aim of reducing microalgae production costs. Seaweed meal was subjected to an acid and enzymatic digestion process to obtain SCD particles smaller than 20 mu m to feed the oysters. Five levels of SCD (w:w) replacing microalgae were evaluated: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% in a feeding assay of 5 weeks. At the end of the experiment, growth parameters, condition index, enzymatic activity in the digestive gland (amylase, protease, lipase, and aminopeptidase) were analysed. In addition, during the course of the experiment, the stable isotope ratio of nitrogen (815N) was analysed at natural abundance levels in both feed sources and in the mantle tissue of oysters reared on different feeding regimes. Contribution to growth was estimated using an isotope mixing model. Better growth (74 to 94% dry weight gain) and condition indexes (81-75) were observed in oysters fed on experimental regimes having from 0 to 50% substitution of microalgae with SCD, showing no significant differences among them. Oysters under the latter treatments also showed similar enzymatic activity for amylase, alkaline-protease, and lipase. At higher substitution levels of microalgae (75-100%), oysters presented lower growth (13 to 34% dry weight gain) and poor condition indexes (<60); 100% of SCD also elicited higher amylase, alkaline-protease, and lipase activities, whereas (Leu) aminopeptidase N activity was lower. The digestive capacity of lipase was improved in oysters fed with 50 and 75% levels of SCD. Isotopic equilibrium for nitrogen (815N) was reached by day 14 in the 50% substitution treatment. Metabolic turnover rates of nitrogen decreased (0.15 to 0.08 day-1) whereas elemental half times in tissue increased (4.1 to 8.2 days) with higher microalgae substitution. Oysters under treatment with 50% microalgae substituted by SCD incorporated similar amounts of dietary nitrogen and dry matter from the microalgal biomass as from SCD to meet the nitrogen requirement for oyster growth. In conclusion, results suggest that SCD from U. lactuca can substitute up to 50% of microalgae C. calcitrans without modifying C. gigas productivity.

AB  - Ecobiological study of medicinal plants includes the analysis of particular soil features and the ecological indexes of plant species as site indicators. Two experimental serpentine areas in northwest and central Serbia were selected to identify the potential limiting factors for medicinal plant harvesting. Soil analysis is done according to ICP methodology ICP Forest Manual, Part III, Soil Sampling and Analysis (1998). Floristic and phytocoenological investigations were carried out by Wasthoff-van der Maarel (1973). The assessment of soil quality is based on the calculation of indicator values of available nitrogen (N), heavy metals, and the sensitivity to acidification. According to our results, N (12.1-17.5), acidification (7-12), and indicator values for some heavy metals (0.3-46.5) show a low biological availability. Medicinal plant species at the investigated areas have low values of ecological indexes: N (2.41-2.82), moisture (2.45-2.70) and soil acidity (3.35-3.70). Hydrothermic conditions indicate the predominant presence of sub-xerophytes, semi-sciophytes and mesothermic species. These types of plant species are recommended for exploitation.

AB  - Field caging experiments were conducted on 0-group juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)and turbot (Scophtalmus maximus) in a polluted area. The fish were caged for 38 days in a northern French harbour (Boulogne sur Mer) at three locations with varying levels of contamination. Sediment from each location was analysed for PAHs, PCBs and metal contents, and their respective bioavailability. In the most heavily contaminated station, all the fish died during the two first weeks. At the two other stations, fish recovery was at least 75%. Growth and several health indices were individually measured on the tagged fish and metal bioaccumulation was measured in the fish gills. juvenile sea bass physiological performance showed significantly higher growth rates, RNA:DNA ratio and Fulton's K condition index in the least contaminated station. The growth in weight and the condition index of the turbot caged in the less contaminated station were also higher. Similarly, for both species, lipid storage index based on the ratio of the quantity of triacylglycerols to sterols (TAG:ST), was significantly higher in the less contaminated station. This general decrease of growth and condition indices, associated with a metal accumulation in gills, reflected the adverse effects of contaminated sediment on the health of the fish. Species-specific responses to chemical contamination were recorded since a stronger relationship between physiological biomarkers and chemical contamination was observed in the sea bass. Therefore, this study supports the use of sea bass as model species and recommends measurements of physiological biomarkers for monitoring complex exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Condition index (CI) is a widely used parameter in ecological and physiological studies. For molluscan bivalves, no universal consensus exists for CI calculation. A literature review revealed that a total of 19 methods have been used for CI calculation in molluscan bivalves. To evaluate the CI calculation in northern quahogsMercenaria mercenaria(also called hard clams), market-sized clams at 12-14 months old (n = 300 from three populations) were collected for gravimetrical and volumetric measurements. Significant correlations were identified among body sizes (body length, height and width), body weights (total weight, wet meat weight, dry meat weight, wet shell weight, dry shell weight) and body volume (p < .0001,Rvalues >= .800). Referencing previously used CI equations for molluscan bivalves, a total of 18 equations were evaluated the suitability, considering non-lethal measurements, for northern quahogs through correlation analysis of the CIs from different equations. With equations constructed as the percentages of dry or wet meat weight out of total weight, dry shell weight, dry shell plus meat weight, body volume, body length*height*width, shell length or cubic of shell length, CIs were significantly correlated, meaning that these equations were exchangeable. Specifically, three equations with non-lethal measurements (percentages of total body weight out of total body volume, body length*height*width or cubic of body length) were evaluated effective. Overall, this publication provided a review for CI calculations in molluscan bivalves and evaluated the CI equations for northern quahogs.

AB  - We present a remote sensing based approach for assessing ecosystem state or intactness to inform land use management and conservation planning. Using segmented multispectral medium resolution satellite imagery, parameters related to the image objects' spectral brightness and heterogeneity, and compactness are used to derive a scoring system of 0 to 10 for the ecosystem intactness, with 0 being completely degraded and 10 being pristine. Linked to the remote sensing approach we suggest a field validation approach that focuses on 10 ecosystem-relevant visually assessed parameters which, when combined, produce a score out of 10 as well. The approach was tested in the South African Sandveld region using a SPOT 5 image from 2009 and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from 2011. Field assessments took place in 2011. Both image data sets returned consistent results suggesting an inter-sensor transferability of the approach. Inconsistencies between satellite and field scores occurred mainly on sites where crops were currently being grown and on fields where various stages of succession were underway, following abandonment. Masking out of those sites which are of little interest from an ecosystem state perspective would improve overall accuracies. For regions with vegetation types that differ significantly in cover and structure, a stratified approach is suggested to optimise the results per vegetation type. Outputs suggest that the approach with its standardised and robust results and its repeatability provides a suitable tool for long term monitoring of large regions with a degree of detail sufficiently high to allow for fine scale planning.

AB  - Understanding the contributions from the environment to society is seen as increasingly important globally. In Scotland this is currently a high priority, as policymakers begin to shift attention away from traditional wellbeing indicators such as GDP. Although alternative natural capital accounting techniques exist, and are useful for creating commeasurable market values, they are unable to account for the full suite of benefits derived from the environment. Scotland's Natural Capital Asset Index (NCAI) is an attempt to create an account of Scotland's natural capital stock and how it's potential to contribute to wellbeing changes on an annual basis. This paper describes the inputs, calculation process and results of the NCAI. It also reports on sensitivity testing of the model, which found the model to be robust, credible to policy makers and meaningful, thus achieving the overall aims of the indicator.

AB  - How does the state see nature? Has the emergence of "environmental states" with significant environmental laws and policy changed the state's vision towards nonhumans, particularly endangered wildlife? These are key questions in a paradoxical context where over the past half century, endangered wildlife have largely continued to decline amid expanding state environmental legislation. Towards answers, we analyze how endangered ma-rine animals in Canada are considered in federal environmental assessments (EAs) that inform state decisions about whether to authorize major development projects. We conducted an inductive content analysis of all federal EAs for projects with potential adverse effects for one or more of the 14 endangered marine vertebrates in Canada. Of 32 projects, 31 were approved, 30 of which were predicted to have no or insignificant impacts on endangered marine species, despite a litany of potential impacts. This analysis reveals four main justifications for predicting insignificant impacts: unproven mitigation measures; species are presumed to have a low likelihood of occurrence in project areas; species behaviour is believed to reduce the likelihood of impacts; and project impacts are characterized as minor compared to existing activity. A consistent vision of nature underpins these justifi-cations: the state sees marine species and ocean ecologies in a simplified manner, while these species also remain strategically illegible. Simplification and strategic illegibility both devalue endangered marine animals, sug-gesting EA is failing endangered marine species by facilitating the state's ability to prioritize development over species recovery.

AB  - This brief research compares the bioconcentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn) in the soft tissues of native oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae (Guilding, 1828) from two areas in the Potengi estuary, northeastern coast of Brazil. The purpose was to test the hypotheses of relevant differences in bioaccumulation while the environmental conditions change upstream. The downstream station showed higher concentrations for cadmium and nickel, and the upstream one revealed increased values for body weight, condition index, chromium, lead, and zinc (p < 0.05). The copper variation between sites was negligible, but as for zinc and chromium, the metal content observed was above guidance levels. Results revealed two aspects that were mainly influencing the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of metals in oysters. First, the predominance of marine or riverine characteristics of each site, and second, the relative proximity to the point of introduction of the pollutant even though stations were not quite far apart. C. rhizophorae accumulated heavy metals in significant concentrations, endorsing its efficiency as a biomonitor.

AB  - Initial relative mass (W-R, low v. high) and energetic trajectory in time (starved v. fed) were experimentally manipulated in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. Fed fish starting at low W-R grew more and gained more W-R than fed fish starting at high W-R. Similarly, starved fish starting at high W-R lost more mass and W-R than did starved fish starting at low W-R. Temporal changes in other variables did not consistently match that of W-R, but, by the end of the experiment, proximate composition showed a high correlation to W-R. Regression slopes of W-R on proximate composition increased with time in the laboratory. Differences between wild and laboratory fish appeared to result from relaxation of environmental stress. When excess resources are available such that L. macrochirus grow, condition indices will increase, but individual response will depend on initial values and thus past environmental experience.

AB  - Mammalian body condition is an important individual fitness metric as it affects both survival and reproductive success. The ability to accurately measure condition has key implications for predicting individual and population health, and therefore monitoring the population-level effects of changing environments. No consensus currently exists on the best measure to quantitatively estimate body condition in many species, including cetaceans. Here, two measures of body condition were investigated in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). First, the most informative morphometric body condition index was identified. The mass/length(2) ratio was the most appropriate morphometric index of 10 indices tested, explaining 50% of the variation in condition in stranded, male porpoises with different causes of death and across age classes (n = 291). Mass/length(2) was then used to evaluate a second measure, blubber cortisol concentration, as a metabolic condition marker. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone involved in the regulation of lipolysis and overall energy balance in mammals, and concentrations could provide information on physiological state. Blubber cortisol concentrations did not significantly vary around the girth (n = 20), but there was significant vertical stratification through the blubber depth with highest concentrations in the innermost layer. Concentrations in the dorsal, outermost layer were representative of concentrations through the full blubber depth, showed variation by sex and age class, and were negatively correlated with mass/length(2). Using this species as a model for live cetaceans from which standard morphometric measurements cannot be taken, but from which blubber biopsy samples are routinely collected, cortisol concentrations in the dorsal, outermost blubber layer could potentially be used as a biomarker of condition in free-ranging animals.

AB  - To determine if natural populations of the eastern oyster possess resistance to Perkinsus marinus, progeny representing several oyster stocks from the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico were deployed at two sites within the Chesapeake Bay. Mortality, P. marinas infection (prevalence and intensity), shell height, condition index, and energy reserves (glycogen, protein, and lipid) were compared between these stocks. Oyster stocks from the Chesapeake Bay had higher intensities of Dermo infection than Louisiana stocks, with differences among individual stocks. Throughout the 2-y study, a natural Dermo-resistant stock from Tangier Sound (CTS), was identified. Despite infection intensities approaching those of a susceptible Rappahannock River stock (CRB) and higher than a Gulf of Mexico stock (LOB), CTS consistently had lower mortality for the 2-y grow out, and was comparable to a hatchery disease-resistant strain (XB). At a site (Port Kinsale) where the significant parasite was P. marinus, the LOB stock grew to the largest shell heights and bad significantly lower intensities of infection. However, the performance of the LOB stock was comparatively poorer at the other deployment site (Regent Point) where MSX was present. Shell heights were highest overall in the CRB stock at Regent Point, despite high susceptibility to disease. Condition index varied between stocks, although not necessarily along trends of disease resistance since condition was highest in the CRB and XB stocks. Variations in energy reserves were strongly influenced by season, but not disease, or stock origin. The present study shows that differences between stocks contain an underlying genetic component. Differences seen between deployed stocks in mortality, growth, and condition have strong implications for development of selective criteria for an aquaculture-based industry.

AB  - Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) mapping of Atlas Cove, Lagos, Nigeria was carried out with the objective of producing an Environmental Analysis Index map of the shorelines. The study integrated methodologies developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Nigerian Oil Producing Trade Sector (OPTS) for the study. The result of the assessment was validated by comparison with the ESI standads in Nigeria. 9 ESI types were found in the area namely; ESI types 1b, 2a, 2b 3a, 4a, 6b, 9b, 9c, and 10a. Animal biodiversities such as shorebirds (Tringaly poleucos and Charadrinning marginatus), sea turtles (Dermocellys spp) and white crabs (Occipoda africana) were more prominent on the western shores. Spearman's Correlation coefficient (r) value of -0.6 was obtained for the association between number of socioeconomic features and biological species along the shores. This shows that a cause and effect exists between biological productivity and anthropogenic activities along the shorelines. The study ranked Mangrove swamps, creeks and fresh water swamp highest with ESI values of 10a. Margalef's index also shows that the same areas are the most sensitive with respect to species richness. The database developed from the study provides baseline information on the biophysical and socio-cultural condition of the environment and can serve as good decision support system for coastal managers.

AB  - In the mobile sedimentary environment of San Antonio Bay (northern Patagonia), where hard substrate is scarce, the mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii dominates the intertidal zone, there being covered by the introduced epibiotic barnacle Balanus glandula. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution and the recruitment of B. glandula on different non-living substrates (cobbles, biogenic debris) and on live-mussel shells and to assess the effect of the epibiotic interaction on the condition index and the attachment strength of B. rodriguezii. Field samplings revealed that adult barnacles mainly fouled live mussels, with the main differences in biomass being between the high and mid-intertidal. These differences in barnacle biomass between heights and substrates were greater in spring and autumn than in winter and summer. To assess the recruitment of barnacles, we performed a field experiment manipulating living and non-living substrates. We found no differences in the density of barnacles recruitment; thus, the barnacle distribution on different substrates throughout the intertidal would vary solely according to the settling substrates available. The relationship between epibiosis and the condition index exhibited no pattern. Furthermore, the experimental manipulation of epibiosis (i.e., removing epibionts or adding epibionts mimics) did not affect the condition of the mussels. Finally, the attachment strength of mussels with epibionts was up to fivefold greater than that of clean mussels. In a system with high tidal hydrodynamic energy, epibiosis is thus seen to stimulate a greater byssal production in mussels for the prevention of detachment.

AB  - Environmental history (regimes of water quality to which an organism has been exposed in the past) may influence how the physiology of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica responds to future environmental conditions caused by climate change. Previous research has examined environmental history in a 1-dimensional framework, failing to capture environmental history complexity through space and time. In this study, we examined environmental history as a multi-faceted parameter, incorporating abiotic water quality components, such as temperature, pH, and salinity, that differ among locations. We also assessed how different lengths of environmental histories, defined as proximal and distal, affected oyster physiology and stress response. Finally, we compared the relative influence of abiotic components of environmental history on oyster physiology. We found that physiology and stress response are differentially affected by proximal and distal environmental history, demonstrating the importance of examining environmental history as a multi-faceted and dynamic parameter. Specifically, distal environmental history primarily influenced condition index and total antioxidant potential, while proximal environmental history primarily influenced glycogen content. Salinity of distal environmental history significantly shaped condition index, establishing salinity as a principal factor when considering acclimatization to variable environments. No water quality components were significant influences on glycogen and total antioxidant potential, providing opportunities for research on other components of environmental history. Identifying the temporal portion of oysters' environmental history that influences physiology supports future efforts to predict population tolerance to climate change. Additionally, examining multiple abiotic and biotic components of environmental history can elucidate means of acclimatization to future environmental change.

AB  - Between April 1992 and March 1993, intersexual plasticity in aspects of the biology of the mudskipper, Periophthalmus barbarus was studied. Sex was differentiated on the basis of the genital papillae, it was broader in females than males. Sexually active females were slightly heavier than similarly-sized males. Sex ratio was strongly female-biased. Length-weight relationship of the sexes was isometric. There was no significant difference in the feeding intensity of both sexes; uniformity was also apparent in diet breadth. There was no named sex-based difference in hepatosometic index but condition index was higher in males than females. The uniformity in intersexual plasticity of P. barbarus is consequent upon homogeneity of the mangrove ecosystem, which can only be altered anthropogenically.

AB  - A spatial cumulative distribution function (SCDF) is a random function that provides a statistical summary of a random process over a spatial domain of interest. In this paper, we consider a spatio-temporal process and establish statistical methodology to analyze changes in the SCDF over time. We develop hypothesis testing to detect a difference in the spatial random processes at two time points, and we construct a prediction interval to quantify such discrepancy in the corresponding SCDFs. Using a spatial subsampling method, we show that our inferences are valid asymptotically. As an illustration, we apply these inference procedures to test and predict changes in the SCDF of an ecological index for foliage condition of red maple trees in the state of Maine in the early 1990s.

AB  - According to an ecological survey in 10 Shanghai districts, sampling 24 rivers on a quarterly basis between 2011 and 2013, a phytoplankton integrity index (P-IBI) was developed to establish a Shanghai Rivers Status. According to the investigation of phytoplankton in 24 rivers during 2011-2013, 6 relatively clean sites and 18 contamited sites were defined using THE Shannon index of phytoplankton and physicochemical water quality data (TN, TP, CODMn). Judgement ability and the Pearson correlation were performed on 19 candidate metrics with SPSS 18.0 and origin 8. The results show that 4 biological metrics, the Shannon index of phytoplankton, percentage of the number of diatom taxa, abundance of algal, percentage of movable diatom density, are more suited to health assessment on rivers of Shanghai. Using a unified dimensionless ratio method, the quartering division of Shanghai river health standards led to the following categories: > 2.53 for healthy, 1.90 to 2.53 for sub-healthy, from 1.27 to 1.90 for general health, between 0.63 to 1.27 for poor health, and from 0 to 0.63 for poorest health. Ultimately, assess with those criteria, the results show that among 24 sites in Shanghai, 4 sites were healthy, 12 sites were sub-healthy, 7 sites were general health, and 1 site was poor health.

AB  - The reproductive strategy of an unexploited population of Arca noae from the salt-water Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia, western Mediterranean), including its tissue plasticity, was studied. In total 309 individuals, collected monthly from October 2013 to September 2014, were examined; 142 were females, 42 were males and five were hermaphrodites. They were used in histological and immunohistochemical (stem marker: Pou5f1; proliferation marker: proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)) analyses of gonads and adjacent tissues (N = 189) as well as to compute the monthly condition index (N = 120). Water salinity, temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were recorded. Ripe ovaries were observed in two discrete periods, October-November and April-August. Both gonad ripenings were followed by spawning periods, November-April and July-September. The mature oocyte density showed that the first spawning period was less vigorous than the second one. These data also indicated that A. noae is a multiple spawner. Five cases of protandric hermaphroditism occurred from December to April. Gonad tissue was strictly associated and intermingled with the digestive gland and mantle muscle fibres. Seasonal variations were observed in the relative proportions of digestive gland and gonads: the former predominated when the latter regressed (March) and vice versa (peak in June). Seasonal transitions from germinal to somatic tissue and vice versa were hypothesised to occur through transdifferentiation mechanisms based on the activity of stem and proliferating cells. The condition index roughly increased along with gonad ripening and decreased during the spawning periods, although it did not run parallel to gonad evolution, because it also depended on chlorophyll a concentration, a proxy for phytoplankton density. The condition index was significantly correlated, by multiple regression, to both mature oocyte density and chlorophyll a concentration. Arca noae appears to have evolved a flexible reproductive strategy that makes it capable of exploiting diverse environmental conditions, which also involves tissue transdifferentiation.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a non-invasive technique, was used to study the soft tissue of live Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata). The oysters were farmed in Port Stephens, Australia and the research was carried out during 2008-2011. MRI was performed on a Varian UNITY plus 300 MHz spectrometer with a wide bore Oxford magnet system (7.05 Tesla) equipped with a Varian Millipede microimaging probe. Relaxation parameters (T-1 and T-2) were found to be dependent on the type of tissue and also reflected seasonal changes in reproductive status of the gonad. The variation in T-1 values of different types of soft tissue was used judiciously to optimise contrast in MR images. The MR images of live oysters revealed anatomical details of the gills and the labial palps that are consistent with the feeding mechanism of bivalves. An empirical equation (y = 4.2x + 14.9) was derived by traditional methods which describes the relationship between the condition index (y) of oysters and the percentage volume of soft tissue (x). A significant correlation (R-2=0.871, P<0.01, n = 5) was obtained between measurements of percentage volume of soft tissue by MRI and the traditional method. Hence, it was concluded that MRI is useful in determining the condition index of live oysters. An interesting observation from MR images was the development of gas bubbles within emersed oysters. Analysis of this gas revealed an elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (2760 ppm after 3 days of emersion and 6300 ppm after 8 days). It was concluded that oysters produce gas bubbles by a physiological process for removing CO2 from soft tissue. The research findings presented here suggest that MRI, due to its non-invasive nature, could prove to be a unique tool for oyster research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to the recent focus by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on bioassessment of lakes, a multimetric index was developed for New Jersey lakes and reservoirs using benthic macroinvertebrates. Benthic samples were collected from reference and impaired lakes with muck and intermediate sediments in central and northern New Jersey during summer 1997. We used a stepwise process to evaluate properties of candidate metrics and selected five for the Lake Macroinvertebrate Integrity Index (LMII): Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), percent chironomid individuals, percent collector-gatherer taxa, percent oligochaetes/leeches, and number of Diptera taxa. We scored metrics as the fraction of the best expected value (based on all sites) achieved at a site and summed them into the LMII. Evaluation of the LMII showed that it discriminated well between reference and impaired lakes and was strongly related to several potential stressors. Chemical and physical gradients distinguished between reference and impaired lakes, and the LMII summarized these gradients well. The LMII corresponded strongly with land use, but some lakes with more urban land use still achieved high scores. Based on a power analysis, the ability of the LMII to detect differences in condition was sensitive to the number of samples from each lake.

AB  - Due to infrequent rainfall, high temperatures, and degraded land, the Sahel region often suffers from droughts. The Sahel region is considered as one of the world's driest and extreme environmental conditions. In order to assess spatiotemporal vulnerability of potential drought impacts, we used remote sensing and ground station data to evaluate drought conditions in the Sahel region from 1985 to 2015. The standard precipitation index (SPI), standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), vegetation condition index (VCI) anomaly, along with socioeconomic indicators were performed. In addition, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was computed between drought indices and three main crops (sorghum, millet, and maize) in the region to estimate the effects. The analysis showed that temperature increased by 0.78 degrees C from 1985 to 2015, which had a significant impact on crop yield for sorghum, maize, and millet with a statistical significance value ofP> 0.05. In the decade spanning 1994 to 2005 alone, the temperature increased by 0.57 degrees C, which resulted in extreme drought in Algeria, Sudan, Chad, Nigeria, and Mauritania. For the effect of drought on crop production, high significance was noted on the SPI and SPEI-3 timescale: sorghum with SPI-3 (r= 0.71) and SPEI-3 (r= 0.65), millet with SPI-3 (r= 0.61) and SPEI-3 (r= 0.72), and maize with SPI-3 (r= 0.81) and SPEI-3 (r= 0.65) during the study period. In the growing season, VCI anomaly had strong correlations with sorghum and millet (r= 0.67 and 0.75, respectively). A significant agreement was also noticed between the combined drought index (CDI) and vulnerability index (VI) in Burkina Faso (r= -0.676;P< 0.00), Mali (r= -0.768;P< 0.00), Mauritania (r= 0.843;P< 0.001), Niger (r= -0.625;P< 0.001), and Nigeria (r= -0.75;P< 0.005). The results show that the above indices are effective in assessing agricultural drought and its impact on crop production in the Sahel, and in identifying areas most affected by drought.

AB  - Multimetric indices are considered a low-cost and rapid means of assessing ecological integrity in streams. This study aimed to develop a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (N3S-IBI) in an agricultural region within the domains of the Atlantic rainforest in Brazil. We sampled 23 first-order streams and used large-scale land use and a local physical condition index to choose reference sites and to classify sites according to the disturbance level. N3S-IBI resulted in six metrics (Simpson's dominance; the numbers of Characiformes and non-native individuals (Poecilia reticulata); and the percentages of Characidae species, intolerant insectivorous individuals, and tolerant species), contemplating tolerance, composition, abundance, richness, trophic habits, and origin. The low number of metrics contributes to a quick and easy biomonitoring process. N3S-IBI showed an excellent performance to separate least and most disturbed sites in our study area and can provide additional knowledge about anthropogenic effects within this impacted region. In fact, this tool could be utilized by managers to direct restoration actions for the most disturbed sites and to strengthen the preservation of the least disturbed sites.

AB  - Efforts at the restoration of river ecosystems are needed not only in local habitats but are also important in terrestrial regions. Large-scale assessment of human activities can be useful in integrated watershed management. In this study, we modified the Ecological Risk Index (ERI) by considering the spatial distribution of human activities in China's Haihe River Basin (HRB). The stressor factors of human activities included population, impervious surface, cattle, agricultural land use, industry, fertilizers, pesticides, water conservation facilities, and roads. A total of 423 assessment units in the HRB were created by combining watershed and administrative boundaries to analyze the spatial distribution of human activities. Two index options, the ERI (including all stressors) and the ERI-D (excluding reservoirs and sluices), were examined for different management objectives. All the stressors and both ecological risk indices (ERI and ERI-D) were ranked in four levels: low, moderate, high, and very high. Our study demonstrated that the ERI and ERI-D can provide an overview of the spatial pattern of human stressors related to river ecosystems across a large geographic region. The approach developed in this study is useful for prioritizing management actions in targeted areas.

AB  - Numerous efforts have been made to develop various indices using remote sensing data such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) for mapping and monitoring of drought and assessment of vegetation health and productivity. NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall are valuable sources of information for the estimation and prediction of crop conditions. In the present paper, we have considered NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall data of Iowa state, US, for 19 years for crop yield assessment and prediction using piecewise linear regression method with breakpoint. Crop production environment consists of inherent sources of heterogeneity and their non-linear behavior. A non-linear Quasi-Newton multi-variate optimization method is utilized, which reasonably minimizes inconsistency and errors in yield prediction.
   Minimization of least square loss function has been carried out through iterative convergence using pre-defined empirical equation that provided acceptable lower residual values with predicted values very close to observed ones (R-2 = 0.78) for Corn and Soybean crop (R-2 = 0.86) for Iowa state. The crop yield prediction model discussed in the present paper will further improve in future with the use of long period dataset.

AB  - The triacylglycerol/sterol condition index was applied to larval lobster populations in the vicinity of Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine. This index is related to larval size by an increasing power function which explains around 40 % of the variation. The poor fit can be explained by the uneven increase in triacylglycerol levels during development within each moult stage. Increased pigmentation is not related to larval condition, as measured by lipid storage, and masks the increased yellowish hue of lipids as development proceeds. The larval triacylglycerol/sterol index appears to undergo a diurnal cycle in Stage III and IV lobsters, with lowest values at midday and highest values after dark. This pattern cannot be explained by nocturnal feeding, which leaves the possibilities that satiated larvae descend below the surface metre during daylight and are therefore underrepresented in our collections by being more vertically diffuse, and/or that healthy well-fed larvae would be more likely to detect the trawl and escape during daylight. Few Stage I and II lobster larvae were found in the vicinity of Georges Bank with a condition index less than 0.1, which is the level laboratory studies indicate approaches the 'point-of-no-return'. The condition of all developmental stages was found to be better in individuals located off Georges Bank. This is not ecologically significant in the case of the first 2 stages because such a small proportion of the population was actually located off the bank. It is not resolved how the third and fourth stages arrive off Georges Bank, since shoal water hatching is the norm, but their lipid reserves are significantly greater than identical developmental stages located on the bank. Finally, the density of Stage IV larvae in the adjacent surface waters over the Gulf of Maine is twice that found over Georges Bank. This suggests that the lobster has evolved a life cycle in offshore waters in which larvae are hatched in shoal waters over the banks but the last 2 planktonic/pelagic stages either seek or are transported to, and by Stage IV thrive in, the warmer stratified layer over the deeper waters of the Gulf of Maine.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) requires assessing the ecological quality status of water bodies, and gives great importance to the biological components of the ecosystem. Within this framework, a multimetric, fuzzy-based index for the evaluation of environmental quality (FINE: fuzzy index of ecosystem integrity) has been developed using data from several Italian coastal lagoons, gathered with seasonal frequency at diverse sites in each lagoon. The rationale of FINE is that certain attributes, selected on the basis of established principles of benthic ecology, are fundamental for lagoon ecosystem function. FINE is composed of seven ecosystem attributes (variables) each of which have ecological relevance for lagoon ecosystems. Individually, all these attributes are themselves useful indices of environmental conditions. However, the combination of these attributes into a single fuzzy index, provides a more robust, overall index of the response of the natural communities to environmental perturbations and avoids misleading or ambiguous results. Each variable is not represented by a single numerical value, but by several categories that describe its properties: in the present model we considered a total of seven variables: two with four modalities (low-medium-high-very high), one with three (low-medium-high) and three with two (low-high), plus a qualitative variable (yes-no), that altogether generate 768 rules. FINE is a low-cost, flexible and robust routine index of lagoon ecosystem impairment and could be of particular benefit to environmental managers and policymakers who require tools capable of expressing the degree of degradation or environmental quality of different lagoon habitats. For its relative simplicity in the application, FINE could be a good candidate to assess the environmental quality of Mediterranean transitional ecosystems.

AB  - Wetlands face an intensifying level of degradation, and management to protect their extent and character is paramount. To support wetland management in south-east Australia, we developed a wetland condition assessment tool for palustrine and lacustrine wetlands. Through extensive consultation with end users during its development, the tool, the Index of Wetland Condition (IWC), considers user needs and skills, as well as attempts to assess the complex nature of wetland systems and their inherent variability, both spatially and temporally. The IWC is structured as a hierarchical index with 13 indicators nested under six characteristics (subindices) that influence wetland function: wetland catchment, physical form, wetland soils, water properties, hydrology and biota. The contribution of each to the overall index (scored along a condition gradient) was estimated from quantitative biological and physicochemical data from 24 wetlands using a fuzzy cognitive map approach. The IWC development framework will be particularly useful in jurisdictions globally where reference condition information is limited or lacking for indicators, or where there are substantial practical constraints that limit the selection of indicators, such as management staff capability or capacity. Uptake of the IWC with wetland practitioners in south-east Australia has been substantial.

AB  - The Beautiful China Initiative (BCI) is a plan for the sustainable development of the Chinese nation as well as for China to fulfill the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Chinese government's "five-in-one" approach provides strategic arrangements for developing the BCI, and President Xi Jinping proposed a timetable and "road map" for the BCI at the National Conference on Ecological and Environmental Protection. Nevertheless, the theoretical basis, evaluation index system, evaluation criteria and effectiveness of the BCI are currently unclear. This paper begins by exploring the basic content of the BCI from narrow and broad perspectives. It regards the theory of human-nature harmonious coexistence and the five-in-one beauty theory as the core theoretical bases of the BCI and constructs a five-element BCI evaluation index system (ecological environment, green development, social harmony, system perfection and cultural heritage) and utilizes the assessment method of the United Nations' Human Development Index to assess scientifically the effectiveness of the BCI in 341 prefecture-level cities. The results show the average BCI index (the Chinese Academy of Sciences Beauty Index) score to be 0.28, which is quite low, while the average scores for the individual element indexes of the ecological environment index, green development index, social harmony index, system perfection index and cultural heritage index are 0.6, 0.22, 0.29, 0.22 and 0.07, respectively. All of these are relatively low values, with relatively large discrepancies in regional development, indicating that progress in the BCI is generally slow and unbalanced. To realize the BCI's timetable and roadmap to a high quality and high standard, it is suggested that a common system for evaluating the progress of the BCI is developed and promulgated so that dynamic monitoring and phased evaluations can take place; BCI technical assessment standards are compiled and published; BCI comprehensive zoning is undertaken; pilot projects adapted to local conditions are launched in BCI sample areas; and BCI results are incorporated into performance indicators at all levels of government.

AB  - Quantitative biological assessment indices overcome many of the challenges faced when trying to convey the status or trends of complex biological communities with large natural variability, particularly when attempting to evaluate the impacts from human influences. In this paper, we developed a biological condition index for shallow (<30m) rocky reefs of the Southern California Bight, evaluated its ability to distinguish healthy from stressed sites, and then applied the index by examining relative correlations with fishing and water quality as ecosystem stressors. We utilized a multivariate, predictive index based on the ratio of observed-to-expected taxa (O/E). O/E indices are relatively common in freshwater environments, but rarely utilized in marine systems and never before applied to rocky reefs. Based on expectations drawn from region-wide reference reefs with the least fishing or water quality stress, the O/E index predicts expected taxa at a new site based on environmental factors such as sea surface temperature, reef area, and slope, among others. The observed taxa at that site are then compared to the predicted taxa to generate index scores; values near unity indicate intact, reference-like communities. Overall, the accuracy of the index was high, with minimal bias, and precision exceeded the performance of an index based on null models (i.e., indices that did not account for natural gradients). The mean index score was significantly higher among reference sites than stressed sites; however, sensitivity was low, as 84% of stressed sites had scores within the range of reference sites. Ultimately, fishing pressure was more correlated with changes in index scores from the non-reference data set than was water quality pressure. This study demonstrates that a multivariate predictive index is feasible in rocky reef assessment and illuminates additional investigative work to continue to advance index development.

AB  - We identified 126 species of algae and cyanoprokaryotes from seven divisions in 21 samples of plankton and periphyton collected at 8 stations over the Hadera River in 2003 - 2005. The chlorophytes strongly prevail. Of these, 110 species are indicators of environmental conditions. The indicators of saprobity (Watanabe's scale) show a medium level of organic pollution. The saprobity index S (Sladecek's scale) varies from 1.73 to 2.80, corresponding to II-IV classes of water quality. The environmental pollution index (EPI) varies from 2 to 5 indicating a range of slightly to strongly polluted water of classes III and IV. The Water Ecosystem State Index, WESI = 0.6, testifies to a toxic impact on the algae in the middle reaches. The River Pollution Index for saprobity (RPIs = 2.35 - 2.42), temperature (RPIt = 17.1 in winter), conductivity (RPI epsilon = 3.31 - 4.5), nitric nitrogen (RPIN = 15.3), and pH (RPIpH = 7.6 - 8.3) indicate alkaline, moderately mineralized waters with an occasional input of nitrates all year round, corresponding to classes III-IV of water quality, and the beta- to alfa-mesosaprobic self-purification zone. According to our results, the self-purification capacity of the Hadera River ecosystem is rather high. This study shows the potential of the algal bioindication method for aquatic ecosystems of Israel.

AB  - Twenty two open-pollinated Hevea progenies from different parental clones of the Asian origin were tested at five sites in the Northwestern Sao Paulo State Brazil to investigate the progeny girth growth, rubber yield, bark thickness and plant height. Except for the rubber yield, the analysis of variance indicated highly significant (p<0.01) genotype x environment interaction and heterogeneity of regressions among the progenies. However, the regression stability analysis identified only a few interacting progenies which had regression coefficients significantly different from the expected value of one. The linear regressions of the progeny mean performance at each test on an environmental index (mean of all the progenies in each test) showed the general stability and adaptability of most selected Hevea progenies over the test environments. The few progenies which were responsive and high yielding on different test sites could be used to maximize the rubber cultivars productivity and to obtain the best use of the genetically improved stock under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Marine macrophytes (macroalgae and angiosperms) were defined as one of the biological quality elements to assess the ecological quality status of transitional and coastal waters by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC). In the present study, the Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI-c) was tested to assess the anthropogenic impact by using marine benthic macrophytes (macroalgae and angiosperms) and pressures by using MA-LUSI in the Turkish marine waters. Macrophyte samples were collected from 56 stations on the coasts of Turkey (at 17 Black Sea, 15 Marmara Sea, 13 Aegean Sea and 11 Mediterranean coastal water bodies) in the summer period between 2014 and 2016. In total, 209 marine macrophytes (macroalgae and angiosperms) taxa were found in all stations. The study revealed high ecological status class for 15 sites, good for 21 sites, moderate for 6 sites, poor for 10 sites, and bad for 4 sites. The MA-LUSI index was tested from the Corine land cover map which affects 1.5 km buffer zone around the sampling sites. The relationship between the pressure index MA-LUSI and EEI-ceqr (eqr: ecological quality ratio) was also tested, and a negative linear relationship was found between MA-LUSI and EEI-ceqr in the Turkish sites. The present study supports the use of the EEI-c index for ecological quality state classification in a wide area of Turkish coastal waters.

AB  - Proper classification of sites is critical for the use of biological indices that can distinguish between natural and human-induced variation in biological response. The macrophyte-based index of biotic integrity was developed to assess the condition of Minnesota lakes in relation to anthropogenic stressors, but macrophyte community composition varies naturally across the state. The goal of the study was to identify environmental characteristics that naturally influence macrophyte index response and establish a preliminary lake classification scheme for biological assessment (bioassessment). Using a comprehensive set of environmental variables, we identified similar groups of lakes by clustering using flexible beta classification. Variance partitioning analysis of IBI response indicated that evaluating similar lake clusters could improve the ability of the macrophyte index to identify community change to anthropogenic stressors, although lake groups did not fully account for the natural variation in macrophyte composition. Diagnostic capabilities of the index could be improved when evaluating lakes with similar environmental characteristics, suggesting the index has potential for accurate bioassessment provided comparable groups of lakes are evaluated.

AB  - The correlation coefficient can calculate paired correlations among different ecological indicators as a whole, but it cannot calculate the specific interval association and the correlation among multiple indicators. This paper proposed an interval association (IA) method of the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), based on the concept lattice and frequent closed itemset. In the IA method, the ecosystem was viewed as a complex system with a hierarchical structure, and the association among multiple indicators was calculated using the information granulation of RSEI. The interval association support degree (IASD) could measure the association clustering strength of these IA concepts. Calculation of MODIS data compiled by Google Earth Engine (GEE) showed that the IA concepts of RSEI in China were primarily composed of selected middle indicator intervals in 2017. The overall eco-environmental condition in China was general when assessed through IA. The spatial distribution of the remote sensing eco-environment in China displayed strong spatial association clustering. Furthermore, the IA of RSEI focused on the first few concepts with high IASD values.

AB  - The pattern of shell shape variation in populations of the mussel, Mytilus chilensis (Hupe 1854) from Southern Chile was analyzed as a function of sample origin (cultivated vs. wild) and latitude, using standard tools of geometric morphometrics for landmark data. Additionally, posterior adductor muscle index (PAMI), Freeman condition index and shell thickness were measured in each sample. Highly significant differences in shell shape components were found among mussel populations. These differences are related to the origin of samples (expansion of the posterior adductor muscle scar, elongation of the lateral ligament and of the ventral umbo position in non-cultivated samples) and to latitude (more elongated shells and more extended posterior adductor muscle scar in most southern samples when compared with the northernmost ones). PAMI and shell thickness were statistically higher in wild population, and Freeman condition index was higher in cultivated shells. It is suggested that in wild populations of M. chilensis, the mussels may face higher predator pressures and other environmental stress factors. Consequently, individuals may be using higher energy fraction to reinforce shells and to promote adductor muscle growth at the expense of somatic growth. In contrast, individuals found in calm aquaculture environments are relatively protected from predators and use most of their assimilated energy in somatic growth. In turn, this growth depends on changes that covariate with shell morphology.

AB  - The relationship between fluvial fish assemblages and environmental variables including water quality was studied by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and generalised regression neural network (GRNN). Fish assemblages in the studied boreal rivers in Central Finland showed a higher response to water quality than to other environmental variables such as altitude and river width. Of the water quality parameters, total phosphorus, oxygen saturation in winter and solids had the highest influence on fish assemblages. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) responded to water quality strongly by favouring pristine waters. Among other fish species, the responses were lighter, and the relative contribution of environmental variables varied. Percentage of fishless sites, i.e. no catch in electrofishing, was 4.4% when pH a parts per thousand yen 6, and 38.2% when pH < 6. However, the most effective way to influence the fish assemblage composition, and to raise the fish-based FIFI integrity index value, would be to reduce loading of solids and phosphorus, rather than depressing acidification.

AB  - Histological and energetic parameters were evaluated seasonally between bivalves from two tidal levels. Results suggest different reproductive patterns between individuals from two contrasting intertidal zones, having also different spawning timing. Females of the lower level spawned in Spring and Autumn while females of the upper level did in Summer with a lower number of oocytes, possibly due to differential food availability between the two intertidal zones. The lipids content in the oocytes did not vary between seasons but varied in the digestive gland, being higher in Autumn - Winter, and suggesting that the digestive gland is a lipid reservoir. The energy density of females was similar throughout the seasons and levels, while in males it varied seasonally. Additionally, energy condition index is proposed as a proxy of stressful conditions, as air exposure time (therefore, to the food availability), mussels from the lower level reached a greater energy condition index than those from the upper level.

AB  - Regulation of metabolism is a common strategy used by individuals to respond to a changing environment. The mechanisms underlying the variability of metabolic rates in macroinvertebrates are of primary importance in studying benthic-pelagic energy transfer in transitional water ecosystems.
   Lekanesphaera monodi is an isopod endemic to transitional water ecosystems that can modify its metabolic rate in response to environmental changes. Therefore it is a useful model in studying the influence of environmental factors on metabolism.
   This study focused on the interpopulation variability of standard metabolic rates (SMR) in L monodi populations sampled in three transitional water ecosystems differing in their trophic status. The standard metabolic rates of L monodi individuals across the same range of body size spectra were inferred from oxygen consumption measurements in a flow-through respirometer in the three populations and a body condition index was assessed for each population. Habitat trophic status was evaluated by monthly measurement of the basic physical-chemical parameters of the water column in the ecosystems for one year.
   Standard metabolic rates showed high variability, ranging from 0.27 to 10.14J d(-1). Body size accounted for more than 38% of total variability. In terms of trophic status, individuals from the eutrophic ecosystem had significantly higher standard metabolic rates than individuals from the other ecosystems (SMR = 2.3 J d(-1) in Spunderati Sud vs. 1.36 J d(-1) in Alimini and 0.69 J d(-1) in Acquatina). The body conditions index was also higher in the population from the eutrophic ecosystem.
   Results show that standard metabolic rates and growth rates are directly related to habitat productivity in accordance with the expectations of the food habits hypothesis. A possible extension of this hypothesis to benthic invertebrates is proposed. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Studies focusing on the natural history of species are essential for developing effective conservation measures and evaluating ecological hypotheses. To this end, we describe natural history data of the Cotinga River toadhead turtle, Phrynops tuberosus, in the Banabuiu River in Ceara, Brazil, and evaluated sexual dimorphism, epibionts, and mutilation effects. We hand-captured 134 individuals by snorkeling, over a period of one year, resulting in the capture of 94 males, 24 females, and 16 juveniles. Females had larger head width and body mass than males, while males had longer tail length. One quarter of the turtles captured had some sort of injury or deformation, most common injuries being missing claws, mutilations, and shell deformations. We found no difference in body condition index between mutilated and non-mutilated animals. Mollusks, insects, and leeches were found as epibionts on P. tuberosus and most of the captured turtles had extensive algal cover. Future studies should focus on understanding the effect of mutilations on animal fitness and reproductive success.

AB  - The Japanese oyster Crassostrea gigas forms the mainstay of the South African oyster farming industry. Despite having been cultured along the South African coast for 30 years, this is the first record of naturalized populations of this well known global invader from the region. DNA sequence data confirmed the presence of C. gigas in the Breede and Goukou estuaries. Populations of 184,206 +/- 21 058.9 (SE), 876 +/- 604.2 (SE) and 1 228 +/- 841.8 (S.E.) individuals were recorded in the Breede, Goukou and Knysna estuaries respectively. No C. gigas were recorded from the open coast. The condition index of oysters in the Goukou and Knysna estuaries differed significantly from those in the Breede Estuary (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA H = 48.249, P < 0.01) but no difference was found between the Goukou and Knysna estuaries (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA H = 48.249, P > 0.05). The lower condition index recorded in the Breede Estuary is believed to reflect decreased food supply as a result of the large C. gigas population present in the estuary.

AB  - This paper attempts to focus on the application of the ecological carrying capacity theory and the three-dimensional state-space model to th eco-efficiency evaluation of petrochemical enterprises. This research differs from the existing literature, which focuses on business' eco-efficiency from behavioral motivation and strategic perspective. This paper proposes a three-dimensional state-space model of ecological efficiency of petrochemical enterprises by adopting a combination of ecological carrying index and state space. This model in a three-dimensional geometric space takes petrochemical enterprises as a pressurer for natural resources and natural environment. The three axes of space represent the economic status of petrochemical enterprises, the use of resources, and the impact of enterprises on the environment, respectively. It attempts to quantitatively describe economic activities of petrochemical enterprises and the interaction with resources and environment. It focuses on applying the model to calculate the ecological carrying capacity of petrochemical enterprises, verifying the feasibility and applicability of the model in calculating the ecological efficiency of enterprises, and providing theoretical tools for enterprises to make ecological efficiency judgments. The results show that this method can help to find out the problems with resources, economy, and environment during the development of petrochemical enterprises and provide the basis for managers to make strategic decisions of sustainable development.

AB  - The practice of environmental planning and protection frequently necessitates the quantification of ecological diversity. Traditional 'ecological diversity indices' are based on the abundances of species present. However, such indices are insensitive to taxonomic or similar differences. With equal species abundances they measure the species richness (species number) only. Conversely, so-called 'biodiversity indices' are based on species differences, but are insensitive to the abundance conditions. The quadratic entropy index is the only ecological diversity index, the value of which reflects both the differences 'and' abundances of the species. When a species list is given without abundance data, then, using the quadratic entropy index and postulating equal abundances, one gets the only biodiversity index derived from a traditional ecological index of diversity. Its extensive form is identical with the sum of differences or distances between the species present. This index trivially satisfies set monotonicity, an important property for biodiversity indices.

AB  - A zooplankton index of biotic integrity was developed for the polyhaline waters of the Chesapeake Bay using data from a long-term environmental assessment program in which both zooplankton and water quality were regularly monitored. Summer (July to September) sampling events were classified as either coming from impaired or reference (least-impaired) conditions based on water quality conditions. Seventeen zooplankton community metrics were evaluated under these criteria and nine were chosen for a composite index. These were the Simpson diversity index, and abundance of barnacle larvae, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, total mesozooplankton, and predators. The composite index of biotic integrity correctly classified about 94% of the impaired samples and about 82% of the reference samples. Average classification efficiency was 88%. This index appears to be an effective measure of eutrophication for the summer polyhaline waters of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Historical diatom records provide a means of retrospectively determining water quality and inferring ecological condition in rivers and streams. In this study we re-sampled sites originally sampled 48 years previously. We then determined the scores for the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) and the South African Diatom Index (SADI) for each dataset. The results revealed that the present day conditions in this relatively undisturbed locality were almost identical to those reflected by the samples collected half a century before. This illustrates the value of historical diatom data for the purposes of determining antecedent water quality.

AB  - Natural variation in the physiological variables of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica from a tropical climate have until now been poorly documented. This study was, conducted to the influence of hydrological variables (salinity, temperature, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, Soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]. and soluble reactive silica [SRSi]) Oil Oyster physiological variables (total hemocyte cells (THC), reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), agglutination, lysozyme, and protein concentration). Oysters were collected during 3 different months (April, August, and December) from seven sites in Terminos Lagoon SW-Mexico. The association of physiological variables with oyster condition index (0) was also Studied. The physiological variability explained by environmental variables was high (30.7%) when compared with the variability explained by the condition index (8.9%). The independent effect of salinity), explained 69.7% of the total variability in the physiological variables (F-ratio = 31.4: P = 0.002, Monte Carlo test with 499 permutations). protein concentration was significantly correlated with Spatial salinity variation (r(2) = 0.89: H = 27.01, P < 0.0001). Site effects were salinity-protein discriminated (F-ratio = 3.406; P = 0.002). Temperature was not a significant variable in the oyster physiological variability. The oysters from marine freshwater transition zones were less affected in their Cl and physiological parameters than oysters from permanent high (>28 psu) or low salinity conditions (<10 psu). This, study represents the first step toward integrating specific C. virginica physiological information From tropical areas.

AB  - The increasing degradation of freshwater ecosystems has demanded the development of methods that allow us to evaluate the ecosystem alterations. The Indexes of Biological Integrity (IBI) are a methodological approach to assess the condition of aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to estimate the biological integrity and to validate the Index of Biological Integrity based on macroinvertebrate assemblages (IIBAMA) in 33 study sites rivers in the Lerma-Chapala and Panuco river basins, in central Mexico. The Family-Level Biotic Index (FBI) was used to estimate the water quality and the Visual-Based Habitat Assessment (VBHA) was used to estimate the habitat quality. Spearman correlation analysis among IIBAMA, FBI, VBHA and water characteristics were made for validation of the IIBAMA. Besides, all variables were evaluated together by multivariate analyses. The rivers were classified in three of four biotic integrity categories, poor, regular and good, being poor the most common (88% of the study sites). We did not find study sites with excellent biotic integrity. The rivers of the Lerma-Chapala River Basin showed a worse ecological condition compare with the Panuco Rivers Basin. We validated and recommended the using of the IIBAMA to assess the biological integrity of these two basins and rivers in central Mexico. This research represents the first efforts to validate an IBI based on aquatic invertebrate communities in a broad scale in Mexico and provide a general framework for their widespread use and to approach the validation and implementation of IBIs in other regions with similar conditions.

AB  - Conversion of natural landscapes into agricultural land-uses represents a major threat to global biodiversity. In lotic ecosystems, aquatic insects are among some of the most vulnerable organisms to such alterations, and thus it is important to study and evaluate how habitat integrity is affected by human activities. In this work we review the Habitat Integrity Index (HII): a measure of environmental integrity of streams. Our objective was to evaluate if this index is a reliable tool for environmental monitoring in tropical streams. We synthesize the relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities in 647 streams in Brazil. Our analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and aquatic insect communities, explaining 29% of variation in community composition and structure. Thus, the HII reflects local environmental quality, as well as wider landscape conditions, making it a good predictor for aquatic and semiaquatic organisms. Our results indicate that HII is a good alternative for aquatic biomonitoring in the Brazilian stream and in other countries that have an Amazon rainforest.

AB  - Poplar plantations host a number of organisms which can live and reproduce in this habitat. Among these, ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) show strict relations with the environmental conditions and are therefore potential bioindicators of the ecosystem stability or stress. For this reason ground beetle assemblages have been studied for about 10 years (1989-1999) in poplar stands of different ages in the Po Valley (Italy) as well as in reference habitats, i.e. natural woods and agricultural crops, in order to assess their potential as indicators of anthropogenic impact. Sampling was carried out by homogeneous pitfall trapping. The number of species in each assemblage varied between 10 and 46, without any recognisable correlation with factors such as habitat type or age of the poplar stand; even the Shannon-Wiener index was extremely variable and in no way correlated with the factors above. Evenness values were generally quite low in all poplar plantations, due to the simplified dominance structures of these carabid assemblages, which are characterised by only a few dominant and sub-dominant species; on the contrary, in natural woods the quantitative distribution of species within the community was fairly well balanced. The forest affinity index (FAI) is a newly proposed ecological index which expresses an evaluation of the relative quality of a habitat compared to another reference habitat; in the case of poplar plantations, which are basically a woody agricultural crop, the FAI index is devised to measure their similarity with (or distance from) natural woodlands. This index displayed a high variability; nevertheless in a linear regression model it appeared to be significantly dependent on the age of the poplar stands. FAI values ranged between -0.35 and -0.45 in agricultural crops and in young poplar stands, and was positive only in a few 7-year-old (and older) poplar plantations (top value = 0.25); on the contrary the FAI index was highly positive in natural woods (top value = 0.92 in a beech wood). Increasing FAI values in poplar stands throughout the cultural cycle are due to the immigration of more specialised forest carabid species, even if they never reach the values typical of forest habitats. In conclusion, the FAI index proved to be the only parameter potentially useful to assess the ecological complexity of poplar stands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Annulus formation on the scales of the Central Amazonian anastomid fish Schizodon fasciatus was studied with respect to periodic variations in growth rates caused by seasonal inundation or associated biological processes. Monthly samples from fish markets were analysed with regard to marginal scale increment, feeding index, condition factor, gonadosomatic index, and body cavity fat content. There was a significant variation in all indices which was related to seasonal change in water level. Fat storage was related to energy requirements especially during gonad maturation. Fastest growth was observed during the period of falling water level. The formation of scale growth marks corresponded to the period of gonad maturation between January and February. The results indicate the formation of only one single growth mark on scales per year. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - Research relevance: Various types of anthropogenic geosystems as a specific category of natural formations have recently been in the focus of modern landscape science. The goal of the study: This article aims to assess the ecological state of landscapes in the Republic of Tatarstan. Research methodology: the main research method used in this study was the analysis of the relationship between anthropogenic pressure and the current state of landscapes and their components. Research outcome: Drawing on the indicators of anthropogenic change calculated within this study we conducted their differentiation in accordance with their levels of ecological states. Following the areographic analysis we present the bioecological assessment of ornithologic fauna (avifauna) within the selected territorial areas. Then we attempt to identify any relationship (either direct or negative) between the indicators of ornithologic fauna population and ecological state of the selected territory. Practical implications: the findings of the study can be used for the development of relevant measures aimed at improving the current ecological state of the Republic of Tatarstan.

AB  - In order to determine the mode of inheritance, genes action, general and specific combining abilities and effect of drought stress on genetic parameters of harvest index and biological yield traits in bread wheat, diallel mating design with eight parents was used. Parents alongwith F-1 progenies were sown in a randomized complete block design with three replications under stress situations in Khorasgan (Isfahan) Agricultural Research Center. The data were analyzed according to methed of Hallauer and Miranda as well as fixed model of Griffing's method II. Jinks-Hayman model was used to estimate broad and narrow-sense heritabilities and mean degree of dominance. There were significant differences between genotypes for mentioned traits in both the environments. Studying mean of squares of general combining ability (gca), specific combining ability (sca), the ratio of gca to sca mean of squares and portion of additive and dominance variances showed importance of both additive and non-additive gene effects for harvest index, but in biological yield heredity, additive effect was more important. Estimating broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities showed low efficiency of harvest index and high efficiency of biological yield for selection programmes in stress environments.

AB  - Rodents form a vital component of Free State ecosystems and monitoring them may be a relatively quick and inexpensive method of indicating healthy or unhealthy ecosystem functioning. Using removal trapping, we have studied rodent seasonal abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness of rodents in four habitats in the Tussen-die-Riviere Nature Reserve, inspected the most successful sampling method for these habitats, and report on their community structure and how it is related to an Ecological Index (approximate to EI value of grassland). Both species richness and Shannon diversity increased significantly with EI value. The indicator species Mastomys coucha occurred at all plots, but contributed the largest proportion of the total captures (ca. 80%) at the plot with lowest EI value. Other results important for small mammal monitoring and collecting are that trap success and species richness was highest in autumn. This study also confirms that four days and nights continuous trapping is essential for the effective sampling of rodent communities in Free State grasslands. Our results partially support expectations that the number of specialist species increases with succession, M. coucha dominance acts as an indicator of habitat disturbance, rodent species richness conforms to Tilman's hump-shaped curve model, and adds to a baseline of diversity indices in a variety of grassland habitats.

AB  - Drought is a natural disaster which causes global damages and affects people. In this work, a comparative study of different drought indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Deviation NDVI (DevNDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) from HJ-1A/1B multispectral data is discussed. These indices have shown potential to detect the drought severity. The objective of this study is to monitor drought in the Potohar region using HJ-1A/1B satellite data, from late November to April during 2009-2014. Additionally, results obtained from satellite data have been verified using ground-based rainfall and crop yield data. The results concluded that the Potohar region faced drought condition in 2010, which is further verified by ground data. Furthermore, NDVI and VCI in this region are found more effective than other drought indices. On the basis of validation of individual drought index with crop yield data, each index is assigned weight accordingly. Moreover, the combination of indices has the ability to detect time periods where drought is affecting the yield production. Regular monitoring and mapping of satellite-based drought indices would play an important role in predicting drought conditions.

AB  - Estuaries and coastal lagoons are characterized by a strong spatial and temporal variability of physicochemical characteristics and productivity patterns. In these environments, the magnitude and direction of the ecological responses to inorganic nutrient increase (i.e. eutrophication) are difficult to predict. In the framework of the project, New Indicators of Trophic state and environmental quality of marine coastal ecosystems and transitional environments (NITIDA), we analysed benthic indicators of trophic state, ecosystem efficiency, and environmental quality in four different transitional environments. The trophic state of the sediments was assessed in terms of quantity and bioavailability of sediment organic C pools; ecosystem efficiency was determined in terms of the prokaryote efficiency in exploiting enzymatycally degraded organic C; environmental quality was determined in terms of meiofaunal diversity. Here, we provide a synopsis of the results obtained and a meta-analysis of the scores assessments obtained using the different ecological indicators of environmental quality and demonstrate that trophic state, ecosystem efficiency, and biodiversity in transitional ecosystems are closely linked. We conclude that the assessment of the environmental quality of transitional ecosystems should be based upon a battery of trophic state indicators and 'sensors' of ecosystem functioning, efficiency, and quality.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that the European Union countries determine the biological state of their waters with respect to sites of high quality. Despite bioindicators have been widely applied in running waters and deep lakes throughout all Europe, little is known about their applicability in shallow lakes. In this context, the objective of this work is to check the effectiveness of epiphytic diatoms as indicators of the trophic state in six shallow lakes of Leon Province (NW Spain). Epiphyton was sampled from helophyte stems in six shallow lakes covering different ecological conditions. A significant correlation was found between the total nitrogen concentration and the diatom indices SPI (Specific Polluosensitivity Index) and BDI (Biological Diatom Index), this correlation being lower with respect to the total phosphorus concentration. The classification of the lakes according to the trophic and saprobic levels based on diatoms corresponds to that obtained from the analysis of the limnological and chemical parameters of the studied systems. Despite the use of these indices has been traditionally limited to rivers and channels, our results show the effectiveness of epiphytic diatoms as biological indicators of the quality of water in Mediterranean shallow lakes and the applicability of common diatom indices for biomonitoring purposes in these aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Information concerning the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetative drought is essential for decision-making and for many environmental and agricultural applications. This study presents a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of vegetative drought conditions that used the vegetation condition index (VCI) data product obtained from NOAA/AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) to reveal the vegetative drought patterns across China from 1981 to 2015. Considering the characteristics of VCI as drought indicators, multiple methods were designed for these analyses, including drought frequency analysis, trend analysis, anomaly index analysis, and Mann-Kendall testing. The results show that China is a country with high vegetative drought frequency, but that most areas experienced only slight or moderate periods of drought. In addition, drought has obvious seasonal and geographical differences and occurs with greater frequencies in regions that are highly affected by monsoons such as the northern and southern regions-particularly in the spring and autumn. In contrast, vegetative drought frequencies in regions less affected by monsoons such as the Tibetan Plateau and the northwestern regions were much lower except in northern Sinkiang, eastern Inner Mongolia, and southern Tibet. During 1981-2015, the VCI had an increasing trend in most areas of China (except in the southern region, where it decreased), indicating a reduced frequency of vegetative drought throughout the country. Moreover, the trend was wavelike rather than a one-way change and could be divided into four phases: (1) a slowly increasing phase from 1981 to 1990, (2) an intensively fluctuating phase from 1991 to 2000, (3) a steadily increasing phase from 2001 to 2010, and (4) a slowly decreasing phase after 2010. Mann-Kendall analysis further suggested that upward trends of the VCI were more evident in spring and autumn than in summer and that both trends mutated in 1997. Specifically, the trend reached the 0.05 level of significance in the spring.

AB  - This paper aims to present the construction of a household environmental health index focused on rural areas (ISA/DR) as a tool for diagnosis and assessment of the rural health-environment conditions, as well as its application for Amazon rural communities. The ISA/DR construction was conducted based on three benchmarks: the theory of environmental health index for spontaneous urban areas occupations; the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the relation between water supply, sanitation and health; and the information from sanitation and socioeconomic surveys in Amazon rural communities. To quantify the different levels of environmental health situation of rural household, we applied the ISA/DR to households in eight communities located in two protected areas for sustainable use in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Although the communities present relatively homogeneous social, economic, cultural and environmental characteristics, the use of ISA/DR as a tool for representing the phenomena of the experienced reality (household environmental health) was sensitive enough to capture the variation in the environmental health status among households of the studied communities. Therefore, we conclude that ISA/ DR could be used as a tool that could direct investment priorities and public policies actions that aim at reversing the reality of environmental health of Brazilian rural households.

AB  - Drought is the most complex but least understood of all natural hazards that impacts around 55 million people globally every year. A hydrological drought (drought here after) is when the lack of rainfall goes on long enough to empty rivers and lower water tables and causes severe water shortage. In recent years, Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) have played a crucial role in studying different hazards either natural or man-made. This study stresses upon the use of RS technique for drought risk assessment in Rajasthan state of India for the year 2002 and 2019. In this study, an effort has been made to analyze the extent of drought using two drought indices, namely vegetation-based vegetation condition index (VCI) and meteorology-based standardized precipitation index (SPI). For VCI calculation, which indicates impact of soil moisture on vegetation, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from year 2000 to 2019. Monthly SPI was calculated using rainfall data obtained from the Rajasthan water resource department. SPI values were interpolated to get the spatial pattern of meteorological drought. Whole area categorised into five drought classes including extreme drought, severe drought, moderate drought, mild drought and no drought, following the recommended value breaks. The results revealed that about 83.87% area was under drought in the year 2002 thus considered as drought year. It has also been calculated that only 15.62% area was showing drought condition in year 2019 especially in the western part of Rajasthan. Correlation analysis performed between VCI and SPI resulted in a coefficient of correlation of 0.92 and 0.79 in year 2002 and 2019, respectively. The high correlation endorses the reliability of RS data for drought-related analysis.

AB  - Remote sensing is used for monitoring the impacts of meteorological drought on ecosystems, but few large-scale comparisons of the response timescale to drought of different vegetation remote sensing products are available. We correlated vegetation health products derived from polar-orbiting radiometer observations with a meteorological drought indicator available at different aggregation timescales, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), to evaluate responses averaged globally and over latitude and biome. The remote sensing products are Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which uses normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to identify plant stress, Temperature Condition Index (TCI), based on thermal emission as a measure of surface temperature, and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), the average of VCI and TCI. Globally, TCI correlated best with 2-month timescale SPEI, VCI correlated best with longer timescale droughts (peak mean correlation at 13 months), and VHI correlated best at an intermediate timescale of 4 months. Our results suggest that thermal emission (TCI) may better detect incipient drought than vegetation color (VCI). VHI had the highest correlations with SPEI at aggregation times greater than 3 months and hence may be the most suitable product for monitoring the effects of long droughts.

AB  - This work aimed to assess the effect of certain physical-chemical variables and the Habitat Integrity Index (HII) have on an aquatic and semi-aquatic heteropteran community. We collected in five streams (from 1(st) to 4(th) order) that differed in habitat integrity, in order to test 1) whether heteropteran richness decreases with the Habitat Integrity Index; and 2) whether richness responds to alterations in water physical-chemical variables, since these influence community structure. In each stream, linear transects of 100 m were demarcated. A total of 1425 specimens from 10 families, 30 genera and 67 morphospecies were collected. Species richness was correlated with the Habitat Integrity Index (HII), showing a positive relationship only for Gerromorpha. This may be due to the fact that streams with greater integrity offer nearby marginal vegetation where prey and shelter can be easily found, representing optimal places for oviposition and hunting. Species adapted to such conditions are more sensitive to alterations in the physical structure of rivers. Significant differences in the composition of Heteroptera and studied infra-orders were also observed, which suggests that the anthropic disturbances over these sites have changed these insect communities. Our results indicate that the alteration in riparian areas can lead to significant changes in Heteroptera composition, even though species richness was not affected. The physical-chemical variables showed no influence on the distribution of species. This result suggests that the environment presented insufficient variation that could cause changes in the investigated community, which implies that factors other than those analyzed here may explain such variation. Three species Rhagovelia trailli (White, 1879), Rhagovelia sp. 4 and Tenagobia incerta (Lundblad, 1928) were considered to be indicators of pristine sites. The results indicate that aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteroptera and more specifically the sub-order Gerromorpha can be an important tool to assess environmental habitat integrity and enhance conservation actions of riparian forests.

AB  - The Lower Jordan River is one of the most polluted in Israel. We used algal bio-indicators to monitor pollution levels in the dry and rainy seasons in order to assess a self-purification capacity of the aquatic ecosystem. We used 135 species of algae and cyanobacteria as indicators of pH, salinity, and organic pollution. The indices of saprobity (S and EPI), river pollution, RPI, and toxicity, BI testify to a greater anthropogenic impact in the lower section, partly owing to influx of pollutants with rain water during the wet season. The aquatic ecosystem state index (WESI) indicates low self-purification activity of biotic communities in this part of the river flow. Multiple Regression Analysis highlighted salinity and trophic elements as the major impact factors for algal diversity. A combination of bio-indication metod, including new integral indices and statistic analysis, and bioassey were found most efficient for monitoring of river ecosystems in Israel.

AB  - Incorporating information on landscape condition (or integrity) across multiple spatial scales and over large spatial extents in biological assessments may allow for a more integrated measure of stream biological condition and better management of streams. However, these systems are often assessed and managed at an individual scale (e.g., a single watershed) without a larger regional multiscale context. In this paper, our goals were: (1) To develop a conceptual framework that could combine stream biological condition to abiotic landscape integrity (or, conversely, stressor) data at three spatial scales: watershed, catchment and stream-reach scale, to enable more targeted management actions. Measures of landscape integrity and stressors are negatively related, i.e., integrity on a 0-1 scale is equal or equivalent to stressors on a 1-0 scale. (2) To develop the framework in such a way that allows operational flexibility, whereby different indicators can be used to represent biological condition, and landscape integrity (or stressors) at various scales. (3) To provide different examples of the framework's use to demonstrate the flexibility of its application and relevance to management. Examples include stream biological assessments from different regions and states across the U.S. for fish, macroinvertebrates and diatoms using a variety of assessment tools (e.g., the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG), and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)). Landscape integrity indicators comprise US. EPA's nationally available Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI), and state and regional derived watershed and stream-reach scale integrity indicators. Scatterplots and a landscape integrity map were used to relate samples of stream condition classes (e.g., good, fair, poor) to watershed, catchment and stream-reach scale integrity. This framework and approach could provide a powerful tool for prioritizing, targeting, and communicating management actions to protect and restore stream habitats, and for informing the spatial extent at which management is applied.

AB  - Since 1988, yearly measurements of several physiological and biochemical variables have been performed using feral female perch (Perca fluviatilis) from an assumed reference area in the Baltic proper, Kvadofjarden. The area is divided into two stations, Meta and Haxvassen, approximately 20 km apart. Standardized sampling and measurements have shown that a number of variables such as somatic body weight, total length, gonadosomatic index, liversomatic index, condition factor, hematocrit, lactate in blood and chloride ions in the blood plasma are generally stable from station to station and from year to year. The percentage of different leucocytes showed a comparatively large variation from one year to the next. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase has shown an increase in activity over recent yeats indicating an increased exposure to pollutants. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination disrupts ecological and agricultural soil functions. For their restoration, bioremediation agents of various natures are used (nonorganic or organic fertilizers, bacterial preparations, adsorbing agents) featuring different remediation mechanisms (adsorption or biostimulation of petroleum hydrocarbon decomposition). The objective of this research is the assessment of the ecological condition of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated Haplic Chernozem Calcic after the application of bioremediation agents of various natures. The influence of glauconite, nitroammophos, sodium humate, the bacterial preparation "Baikal EM-1", and biochar on the intensity of petroleum hydrocarbon decomposition and the ecological condition of Haplic Chernozem Calcic was analyzed. The ecological condition of Haplic Chernozem Calcic was assessed based on the residual content of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and the following biological parameters: changes in the number of soil bacteria, activity of catalase and dehydrogenases, soil respiration (CO2 emission), germinating ability, lengths of roots and shoots, and integrated index of the biological state. The minimum concentrations of residual petroleum hydrocarbons in soil were observed after the use of biochar (44% from initial content) and glauconite (49%). The biological properties of soils were affected in different ways. Soil respiration was stimulated by 3-6-fold after adding nitroammophos. Indices for the intensity of the early growth and germination of radish in soil with glauconite, sodium humate, and biochar were increased by 37-125% (p < 0.01) compared with the reference value. After the application of biochar, sodium humate, and "Baikal EM-1", the number of soil bacteria was 66-289% higher (p < 0.01) than the reference value. At the same time, the activities of catalase and dehydrogenases were inhibited by up to 35% in variants with bioremediation agents and petroleum hydrocarbons relative to the reference values. The maximum stimulation of the biological activity (as the integrated index of the biological state (IISB)) of Haplic Chernozem Calcic was observed after applying sodium humate and biochar, with 70 and 66% (p < 0.01) increases from the reference value, respectively. Considering the net cost of bioremediation agents, the maximum cost efficiency is achieved with "Baikal EM-1", sodium humate, and biochar: 110, 527, and 847 USD center dot 10(3)/ha, respectively. After using Baikal EM-1", sodium humate, and biochar, the ecological state of Haplic Chernozem Calcic was restored.

AB  - The definition and measurement of body condition are central to many ecological and evolutionary studies, yet the fundamental issue of whether variation in condition is inherited genetically remains unresolved. Furthermore, confusion has been caused through diverse uses of the word 'condition' itself In this paper, we introduce the terms 'broad-sense condition' and 'narrow-sense condition' in an attempt to reduce this confusion. Because of the difficulty of measuring condition, field biologists use the mass relative to body size as a convenient index of condition. Such indices have also been used to estimate the heritability of condition. Using data from a wild great tit Pants major population, we demonstrate that a condition index may still contain residual variance that is due to body size. Hence, using a condition index to study the heritability of condition can give misleading results because that residual variance may itself be heritable. To avoid this problem, direct measures of condition, such as reserve tissues, should be used. We provide the first heritability estimates of direct measures of condition of full-grown birds in a wild population by the regression of mean offspring (both in winter, and when breeding) on mean parent (when breeding) values of two reserve tissues, fat and pectoral muscle, which are independent of body-size. A great tit's fat and muscle reserves in winter were significantly correlated with their respective values when the birds bred. However there was no evidence that the level of fat reserves in winter resembled those of the parents (when breeding), more than expected by chance. Slight resemblances between parents and offspring were detected for muscle in winter and for fat reserves when breeding. Muscle size in the breeding season provided stronger evidence for the inheritance of condition. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - This paper investigates the temporal responses of 2-year old Crassostrea gigas to environmental changes in Stansbury. South Australia from September 2005 to October 2006. A total of 360 oysters were grown in one-line baskets on the farm using six replicates that were sampled monthly. A range of environmental parameters were assessed and correlated against biological indicators for oyster condition, metabolism and antimicrobial activity. Food availability by chlorophyll a, was low throughout the study period (0.5-1.5 mu g L-1) and was significantly correlated to phosphorus concentrations. The condition index and shell weight of oysters significantly increased over the year, with the condition index dropping after spawning but then recovering within one month. Significant temporal variation in energy storage and utilization were observed in different tissues over the year. Glycogen in the mantle tissue was influenced by reproduction and correlated to chlorophyll a levels, but not in the gill or adductor muscle. The mantle glycogen and gill protein reached the lowest level in February when spawning occurred and presented evidence for seasonal variation in oyster metabolic activity. However, mantle and adductor muscle proteins did not drop after spawning indicating that these proteins contribute little to gametogenesis. Hemolymph protein was negatively correlated to water temperature and chlorophyll a, reaching the lowest level during summer. Hemolymph antibacterial activity significantly decreased after spawning, implying that the period of post-spawning is critical for oyster health. This study revealed trade-offs in the energy budget between immune resistance, growth, and reproduction. The results indicate that in a lean water environment, spawning events significantly regulate metabolic and immune capacities of oysters and a second year of rearing increased meat and shell weight but not the shell length. These findings are applicable to the management and development of oyster aquaculture within temperate southern hemisphere. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scorpionflies have been a major object for the investigation of in sect mating systems. Especially Panorpa vulgaris has become a model insect for resting theories of sexual selection. This contribution summarizes that which has been learned in recent pears and presents new data that clearly show that the mating system of P. vulgaris is not simply a resource-defense polygyny, as has previously been thought. In P. vulgaris neither the pattern in food exploitation nor the ratio of variance in the lifetime reproductive success of the two sexes is in accordance with that expected in resource defense polygynous mating systems. Lifetime mating duration is the most important proximate determinant of male fitness. Males employing alternative mating tactics obtain copulations of varying duration in relation to the Following sequence: saliva secretion > food offering > no gift. The number of salivary masses which males provide to females during their lifetime is significantly correlated with the lifetime condition index. The condition index depends on the fighting prowess of males and their ability to find food items. Thus saliva secretion of Panorpa is considered a Zahavian handicap, which can serve as an honest quality indicator used by mating females. Our results confirm four main predictions of the indicator model of the theory of sexual selection: (a) the indicator signals high ecological duality of its bearer. (b) the indicator value increases with phenotypic quality, (c) the indicator value is positively correlated with the genetic quality affecting offspring fitness in a natural selection context. and (d) the quality indicator is more costly for low-than for high-quality individuals. The evolutionary consequences of the mating pattern and the sperm competition mechanism in P. vulgaris are discussed in the context the way in which sexual selection creates and maintains sperm mixing and the evolution of a promiscuous mating system.

AB  - Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is the process of systematically assessing a proposed action's cumulative environmental effects in the context of past, present, and future actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions. Previous studies have examined CIA efforts at the federal level but little is known about how states assess the cumulative impacts of nonfederal projects. By examining state environmental review statutes, administrative rules, agency-prepared materials, and a national survey of the administrators of state environmental review programs, this study identifies the legal and administrative frameworks for CIA. It examines current CIA practice, discusses the relationship between CIA policy and its implementation, and explores the opportunities for improvement. The results of the study show that twenty-nine state environmental review programs across twenty-six states required the assessment of cumulative environmental impacts. More than half of these programs have adopted specific procedures for implementing their policies. Some programs assessed cumulative impacts using a standard review document, and others have created their own documentations incorporated into applications for state permits or funding. The majority of programs have adopted various scales, baselines, significance criteria, and coordination practices in their CIA processes. Mixed methods were generally used for data collection and analysis; qualitative methods were more prevalent than quantitative methods. The results also suggest that a program with comprehensive and consistent environmental review policies and procedures does not always imply extensive CIA requirements and practices. Finally, this study discusses the potential for improving existing CIA processes and promoting CIA efforts in states without established environmental review programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study documents the presence of Cyprinus carpio in 119 natural environments and 49 artificial habitats in Argentina, showing an exponential increment of invaded locations over time since it was introduced in the nineteenth century. Geographic expansion patterns revealed that since its initial introduction, species records demonstrate an increment in the central portion of the country only after 1970 and subsequent expansion after 1990 to the north, west and south. Using an environmental similarity index it was determined that more than half the country offers good conditions for C. carpio establishment. Environmental factors and anthropogenic impacts are relevant drivers that can account for the current and future distribution of C. carpio in Argentina.

AB  - The Bird Integrity Index (BII) presented here uses bird assemblage information to assess human impacts to 28 stream reaches in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. Eighty-one candidate metrics were extracted from bird survey data for testing. The metrics represented aspects of bird taxonomic richness, tolerance or intolerance to human disturbance, dietary preferences, foraging techniques, and nesting strategies that were expected to be positively or negatively affected by human activities in the region. To evaluate the responsiveness of each metric, it was plotted against an index of reach and watershed disturbance that included attributes of land use/land cover, road density, riparian cover, mining impacts, and percent area in clearcut and partial-cut logging. Nine of the 81 candidate bird metrics remained after eliminating unresponsive and highly correlated metrics. Individual metric scores ranged from 0 to 10, and BII scores varied between 0 and 100. Ell scores varied from 78.6 for a minimally disturbed, reference stream reach to 30.4 for the most highly disturbed stream reach. The BII responded clearly to varying riparian conditions and to the cumulative effects of disturbances, such as logging, grazing, and mining, which are common in the mountains of eastern Oregon. This BII for eastern Oregon was compared to an earlier BII developed for the agricultural and urban disturbance regime of the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. The BII presented here was sensitive enough to distinguish differences in condition among stream riparian zones with disturbances that were not as obvious or irreversible as those in the agricultural/urban conditions of western Oregon.

AB  - Research that explores the biological response to urbanization on a site-specific scale is necessary for management of urban basins. Recent studies have proposed a method to characterize the biological response of benthic macroinvertebrates along an urban gradient for several climatic regions in the USA. Our study demonstrates how this general framework can be refined and applied on a smaller scale to an urbanized basin, the Santa Clara Basin (surrounding San Jose, California, USA). Eighty-four sampling sites on 14 streams in the Santa Clara Basin were used for assessing local stream conditions. First, an urban index composed of human population density, road density, and % urban land cover was used to determine the extent of urbanization upstream from each sampling site. Second, a multimetric biological index was developed to characterize the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages along the urban gradient. The resulting biological index included metrics from 3 ecological categories: taxonomic composition (% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), functional feeding group (shredder richness), and habit (% clingers). The 90(th)-quantile regression line was used to define the best available biological conditions along the urban gradient, which we define as the predicted biological potential. This descriptor was then used to determine the relative condition of sites throughout the basin. Hierarchical partitioning of variance revealed that several site-specific variables (dissolved O-2 and temperature) were significantly related to a site's deviation from its predicted biological potential. Spatial analysis of each site's deviation from its biological potential indicated geographic heterogeneity in the distribution of impaired sites. The presence and operation of local dams optimize water use, but modify natural flow regimes, which in turn influence stream habitat, dissolved O-2, and temperature. Current dissolved O-2 and temperature regimes deviate from natural conditions and appear to affect benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. The assessment methods presented in our study provide finer-scale assessment tools for managers in urban basins.

AB  - High-energy wavelengths in the ultraviolet-B (UVB, 280-315 nm) and the UVA (315-400-nm) portion of the spectrum are harmful to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Interestingly, UVA is also involved in the repair of UV induced damage. Organisms living in shallow coral reef environments possess UV absorbing compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids, to protect them from UV radiation. While it has been demonstrated that exposure to UV (280-400 nm) affects the UV absorbance of fish mucus, whether the effects of UV exposure vary between UVB and UVA wavelengths is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether the UVB, UVA, or photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) portions of the spectrum affected the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus and Fulton's body condition index of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. We also compared field-measured UV absorbance with laboratory based high-performance liquid chromatography measurements of mycosporine-like amino acid concentrations. After 1 week, we found that the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus was higher in the UVB+UVA+PAR treatment compared with the UVA+PAR and PAR only treatments; after 2 and 3 weeks, however, differences between treatments were not detected. After 3 weeks, Fulton's body condition index was lower for fish in the UVB+UVA+PAR compared with PAR and UVA+PAR treatments; furthermore, all experimentally treated fish had a lower Fulton's body condition index than did freshly caught fish. Finally, we found a decrease with depth in the UV absorbance of mucus of wild-caught fish. This study suggests that the increase in UV absorbance of fish mucus in response to increased overall UV levels is a function of the UVB portion of the spectrum. This has important implications for the ability of cleaner fish and other fishes to adjust their mucus UV protection in response to variations in environmental UV exposure.

AB  - Corsica is a French island in the western Mediterranean with numerous distinct geomorphological, land-scape, and biological characteristics. These specific attributes, mostly related to insularity, are hardly taken into account by the biological indices currently recommended in the framework of the European Union Water Framework Directive "WFD" for assessing the ecological status of watercourses. Thus, this work has focused on developing an innovative biological index adapted to the specific context of territories such as Corsica, based on the Odonata group. In this context, imago sampling of Odonata was performed at 40 representative stations to assess the 33 major permanent rivers of the island. In parallel, various biological, hydrological, and physicochemical parameters affecting the ecological status of these organisms were recorded. The data collected on nearly 30 species of Odonata allowed for the accurate description of the typical populations of Corsican watercourses, highlighting this group's potential as a biological indicator. An indicator value was assigned to the 12 species identified as the most representative of these environments. The results were used to develop 5 biological indices based on simple statistical descriptors. The index that was found to be the best for assessing the ecological status of the watercourses, as indicated by correlation tests, was named "Odonata Community Index - Corsica" (OCIC), and was finally confronted with the 5 biological indices recommended by the WFD and currently used in Corsica. The results of this study confirm the significant potential of the OCIC index compared to other "official" indicators, that are limited in they do not accurately assess all territories. The results of our tests indicate that this new index using Odonata group appears to be a credible method that could potentially improve the evaluation system currently used for monitoring the ecological quality of watercourses in Corsica.

AB  - African tropical rainforests, and especially their freshwater biodiversity, are seriously threatened by ongoing industrial deforestation. Sound ecological management is needed to ensure the sustainability of these resources. For this purpose, an index of biotic integrity (IBI), based on fish assemblage characteristics, is developed in this paper. It is used to quantify the impact of industrial deforestation on freshwater biodiversity. Data from 30 non-impacted sites were used to develop a series of compositional, structural and functional metrics that reflect sites with a high biotic integrity, i.e. what a stream-fish community should look like in the absence of human perturbation. These data were compared to data collected from sites subjected to substantial forest watershed loss, in order to identify those IBI metrics that best distinguish streams with high and low biotic integrity. The overall IBI scores reflected the quality of the watershed conditions. In addition, there was a close agreement between an index of environmental quality, based on water and habitat quality and the IBI scores, suggesting that the different biological responses of the fish assemblages (observed differences in the IBI scores) were indicative of differences in physico-chemical quality of the streams. The ability of the proposed IBI to index water resource degradation, due to deforestation, suggests that it can be used as a tool for biological monitoring. However, more consistent and comprehensive data are needed to further refine the IBI, especially the assignment of integrity classes and metric threshold values.

AB  - Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence on the ongoing degradation of the environment, there is a clear gap between the urgency of the environmental crisis and the policy measures put in place to tackle it. Because of the role of metrics in environmental governance, the way environmental information is translated into metrics is of utmost relevance. In this context, we propose criteria to assesses the suitability of environmental metrics to monitor environmental sustainability at the national level. After assessing well-known environmental metrics such as the Sustainable Development Goals indicators and the Environmental Performance Index, we conclude that countries still lack robust and resonant metrics to monitor environmental sustainability. In order to bridge this metric gap, we present the Environmental Sustainability Gap (ESGAP) framework, which builds on the concepts of strong sustainability, critical natural capital, environmental functions and science-based targets. Different composite indicators are proposed as part of the ESGAP framework. Through these metrics, the framework has the potential to embed strong sustainability thinking and science-based targets in nations in which these concepts are not currently sufficiently reflected in policies.

AB  - The impacts of differences in watershed land uses, and differences in seasonality on benthic macroinvertebrate communities, were evaluated in 12 stream sites within the Xitiaoxi River watershed, China, from April 2009 to January 2010. The composition of macroinvertebrate community differed significantly among three land use types. Forested sites were characterized by high taxa richness, diversity and the benthic-index of biotic integrity (B-IBI), while farmland and urban disturbed stream sites presented contrary patterns. The percentage of urban land use, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus were the major drivers for the variations. The land use related water quality stress gradients of the four sampling seasons were determined by means of four independent Principal Component Analyses. The responses of macroinvertebrate community metrics, to anthropogenic stressors, were explored using Spearman Rank Correlation analyses. All the selected metrics, including total numbers of taxa, numbers of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, percentage of non-insect abundance, percentage of scrapers abundance, Pielous evenness index, Simpson diversity index, and the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity were correlated significantly with environmental gradients (PC1) in autumn. In other seasons such correlations were less pronounced. Our results imply that autumn is the optimal time to sample macroinvertebrate communities, and to conduct water quality biomonitoring in this subtropical watershed.

AB  - Global warming and ocean acidification influence marine calcifying organisms, particularly those with external shells. Among these, mussels may compensate for environmental changes by phenotypic plasticity, but this may entail trade-offs between shell deposition, growth and reproduction. We assessed main and interactive effects of pH and temperature on four mussel species on the west coast of South Africa (33 degrees 48 ' S, 18 degrees 27 ' E) in October 2012 by comparing shell dissolution, shell growth, shell breaking force and condition index of two native species, the ribbed mussel Aulacomya atra and the black mussel Choromytilus meridionalis, and two aliens, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the bisexual mussel Semimytilus algosus. Live mussels and dead shells were exposed for 42 days to seawater of pH 7.5 or 8.0, at 14 degrees C or 20 degrees C. Low pH, high temperature and their combination increased shell dissolution of the two aliens but their growth rates and condition indices remained unchanged. Aulacomya atra also experienced greater shell dissolution at a low pH and high temperature, but grew faster in low-pH treatments. For C. meridionalis, shell dissolution was unaffected by pH or temperature; it also grew faster in low-pH treatments, but had a lower condition index in the higher temperature treatment. Shell strength was not determined by thickness alone. In most respects, all four species proved to be robust to short-term reduction of pH and elevation of temperature, but the native species compensated for greater shell dissolution at low pH by increasing growth rate, whereas the aliens did not, so their invasive success cannot be ascribed to benefits accruing from climate change.

AB  - Offshore and open sea suspension-culture of mussels is largely in development but, in this particular environment, sleeved mussels are submitted to high-energy oceanographic conditions which could increase fall-offs. In this study, we compared the performance of open sea mussel culture to that of culture in a lagoon environment. Byssus attachment strength, condition index, mechanical properties of individual byssal threads, metal content of the filaments for mussels from both the open sea and the semi-closed lagoon sites were monitored as well as the environmental characteristics of these sites. The spawning event occurred approximately one month earlier for mussels in the open sea than in the lagoon, probably due to a difference in temperature and food availability. The attachment strength of the mussels was weaker in the open sea, even if individual threads were bigger and stronger than in the lagoon. This lower attachment strength seems related to a lower production of byssal threads. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The condition index (CI) is a tool that has been used to estimate the effect that different environmental factors have on oyster meat quality. The CI of oysters in five beds in Sapelo Island and the Doboy Sound (Georgia, United States) were calculated using three different methodologies. Values from each site were used to: (1) compare two sites located in relatively large systems (river/sound) and three sites in a small creek to test for differences due to system size and related nutrient availability; (2) determine the effect of a parasite, the pea crab (Pinnotheres spp.), on oyster Cl; and (3) determine the effect of differential position of oysters on a bed, with respect to CI (oysters were collected from areas of the bed that are permanently submerged and areas with the longest dry periods between tidal cycles). With respect to the three analyses mentioned earlier, it was found that oyster CIs for sites in larger systems (river and sound sites) were significantly higher than those in sites with lower flux and width (creek sites) and that the presence of pea crabs as parasites can reduce Cl by similar to 50%. In addition, no difference in CI was found between oysters collected from different positions in the oyster bed, indicating that the Cl was not altered within a site from effects of exposure. This relatively unusual finding is discussed but suggests the robustness of Cl as an intersite analysis tool. Not all differences found in the comparisons were significant for all CIs used, but qualitative results among them were consistent. These variations in significance and the adequacy of each method for analysis are briefly discussed.

AB  - Drought is one of the most adverse and powerful weather-related disasters that occur every year across a portion of the United States. The consequences of droughts quite often can be devastating. To mitigate these consequences, droughts require careful monitoring. Recently, NOAA's National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service developed a new Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based vegetation condition index (VCl) that showed good results when it was used for drought detection and tracking. The VCl is a vegetation index with reduced noise and is adjusted for land climate, ecology, and weather conditions. This index provides a quantitative estimate of weather impact on vegetation and also measures vegetation conditions. Several large-area experiments showed that the VCl had excellent ability to detect drought and to measure the time of its onset and its intensity, duration, and impact on vegetation. The VCl provides accurate drought information not only for the cases with well-defined, prolonged, widespread, and very strong droughts, but also for very localized, short-term, and ill-defined droughts. The advantages of this index compared to conventional ground data are in providing more comprehensive, timely, and accurate drought information. This paper describes the methodology and technical principles used to derive the vegetation condition index, explores data processing, and gives many examples of VCl application for drought monitoring in the United States during 1985-90. The spatial and temporal patterns of VCl-derived drought were in a very good agreement with the identical patterns identified from precipitation and yield anomalies.

AB  - Ecological environment quality is a long-term continuous concept that is affected by various environmental factors. Its assessment has important implications for implementing the planning and protection of dynamic regional ecosystems. Therefore, this study attempted to obtain these indicators (green, dry, wet, heat) through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and then coupled the ecological environment quality index in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) between 2000 and 2019, based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The major results show that: (1) changes in the four indicators in summer were more obvious than those in winter, and the changes were concentrated in the central and northern regions of the MYRB; (2) both the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized differential build-up and bare soil index (NDBI) in summer and winter have higher weighting ratios, implying that water body changes and human activities had a greater impact on the ecological environment; and (3) ecological environment quality in the MYRB between 2000 and 2019 was relatively flat. The ecological conditions began to deteriorate in 2008, and substantial ecological degradation was noted in some areas between 2008 and 2019 (18.7% in the central region, 16.0% in the eastern region). The MYRB has an important position in the Yangtze River economic belt and is an important part of the Yangtze River protection. This research could provide a theoretical basis and decision support for the development and protection of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) green economy.

AB  - A close correlation between the degree of aridity and biological properties of soils in the south of Russia is detected. The number of microarthropods and microorganisms, humus content, enzyme activity, and the integral index of biological state (IIBS) of the soils decreases with the increase in aridity in the following sequence: black earth -> chestnut soils -> light chestnut soils -> brown desert-steppe soil. The IIBS variation range for superficial horizons is 41%. The difference among the soils increases when the biological activity of the entire soil profile is taken into account. In this case, the difference in IIBS among the soils increases to 75%.

LA  - Polish
AB  - The research was carried out done using benthic organisms in accordance to Frame Water Directive 2000/60/WE of European Parliament and Council from October 23rd 2000. One of its assumptions is to take into consideration abiotic and biotic factors during estimation of ecological state of waters, since only these give the full image of an examined environment.
   Radacki Channel is located Zachodniopomorskie Province on the area of Protected Landscape of Drawa Lake District. This channel is the one of main tributaries to Trzesiecko Lake which is a tourist attractions in Szczecinek town.
   The research was carried out from March to September 2006. Four research sites were appointed along the channel. In each of them samples were taken using the benthic net. There were four quantitative samples and one qualitative sample. Obtained organisms were preserved on the site and then determined in the lab in order to classify in accordance with given taxonomic units.
   In order to estimate Radacki Channel water quality indexes like TBI (Trent Biotic Index), BNWP-PL (Biological Monitoring Working Party, for Poland), were used along with Saprobe Index S and EPT (Ephermeropteraephemerid, Plecoptera, Trichoptera). In addition number, density and biomass of ascertain taxons were analyzed.
   Most of examined sides, on the basis of biotic indexes values, were found as ones in good ecological state. The best results were obtained in the third site, where the biggest biological diversity was found. The worst quality of water was found on site 2, where values of biotic indexes classified the quality of water as moderate.
   Radacki Channel as a watercourse flowing into Trzesiecko Lake has a big influence on its waters. Determined species along with clean water on sites brings some optimism. But still not the whole watercourse had the good results. An evident decrease of water quality was found near arable fields and meadows. Configuration of the terrain in the area could cause decrease of water quality by runoff of biogenic substances from the surrounding reception basin which possibly affected the ecological state of both the Radacki watercourse and the Trzesiecko Lake.
   It should be noted that these were the first studies using benthic organisms on Radacki Channel. They do not show changes in the ecosystem. In order to be able to identify those changes long-term studies are necessary.

AB  - The focus of recent site productivity research in British Columbia has been to develop height-breast height age, growth intercept, and ecosystem-site index models. These models, together with a years-to-breast-height model, form a system for estimating site index and height. This system is described for western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) in the interior of British Columbia. Forty-four western hemlock stem analysis plots were used in the construction of this system. As there are three models for estimating site index, the appropriate model for a given stand depends largely on the stand condition and the precision of the models. A graph of model precision against breast height age gives some assistance in deciding which model should be used to estimate site index.

AB  - Urbanisation is considered as one of the most critical and widespread threats to coastal marine ecosystems. The aim of this study was to compare the density, percentage cover, thickness of clumps, condition index and size-frequency distribution of Mytilus galloprovincialis between urban and non-urban shores, at nested spatial scales, in the Northern Portuguese coast. M. galloprovincialis was selected as model because it is economically and ecologically relevant. Moreover, the relationship between mussel size and the other variables (i.e. density, percentage cover, thickness and condition index) were investigated. Mussels on urban shores showed a smaller density and a greater frequency of larger individuals. A significant negative correlation between mussel length with density and with thickness of clumps was also found. Our results seem to indicate that recruitment has declined on urban shores and, as a result, intraspecific competition is also smaller, leading to more resources being available for a fewer individuals which can reach larger sizes. As mussel beds support a great biodiversity of invertebrates and provide many ecosystem services, urbanisation may have indirect effects on communities associated with mussels. Understanding the vulnerability of mussel beds to urbanisation could inform management.

AB  - Adaptive management of river systems assumes uncertainty and makes provision for system variability. Inherent within this management approach is that perceived limits of 'acceptable' system variability are regarded not only as testable hypotheses, but also as playing a central role in maintaining biodiversity. While the Kruger National Park currently functions as a flagship conservation area in South Africa, projected increases in air temperatures as a consequence of global climate change present challenges in conserving this biodiversity inside the established land boundaries. Within the rivers of the Kruger National Park, a management goal of maintaining biodiversity requires a clearer understanding of system variability. One component of this is water temperature, an important water quality parameter defining the distribution patterns of aquatic organisms. In this study, Chiloglanis anoterus Crass (1960) (Pisces: Mochokidae) was selected as a biological indicator of changes in annual water temperatures within the Sabie River in the southern Kruger National Park. Relative abundances of C. anoterus were determined using standard electro-fishing surveys. The presence or absence of C. anoterus was linked to cumulative annual heat units using a logistic regression model, and a critical annual cumulative water temperature threshold estimated. A correlative relationship between this temperature threshold and a biological index using a C. anoterus condition factor provides river ecologists with a tool to assess ecologically significant warming trends in Sabie River water temperatures. A similar approach could be applied with relative ease to other Southern African river systems. Further testing of this hypothesis is suggested, as part of the adaptive management cycle.

AB  - Biomonitoring of the Rega River and its affluent - "Gryfice A" Canal, which are passing through Gryfice, was conducted in 2009. For this purpose six sites were chosen. Two of them were situated on the affluent of the river, and the others on the main stream of the river. All of the measurement sites were within the administrative boundary of Gryfice city.
   Thirty samples were taken overall. Five from each site. The analysis concerned of taxonomic affiliation, quantity and biomass of identified organisms. Based on the research results, the ecological condition of the investigated watercourses was established. In this study indices were used: TBI (Trent Biotic Index), the BMWP-PL index (Biological Monitiring Working Party which has been adapted to the Polish conditions), the EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plectoptera, Trichoptera).
   The ecological condition of the watercourses oscillated between very good to satisfactory, depending on the site and indicator which were used. The best water quality, according to the indexes used, appeared on the first and second sites, where the determined state was very good. The worst results appeared at the sixth site. The dominating conditions of water on this site were moderate and poor. The lowest value of EPT index was reached on the sixth site and the highest one on the fourth site.
   Conducting the constant biomonitoring of the waters is necessary for describing the level of anthropopression. Also, it gives the bases for the water reclamation. It is also very important, because all countries of the European Union are obliged to reach at least good ecological state of surface water by 2015.

AB  - A biological integrity index that uses attributes of fish assemblages was developed and applied to a part of the Crocodile River (Incomati System, Mpumalanga Province). Fundamentally, the fish assemblage integrity index (FAII) is based on the fish species expected to be present in biological (fish habitat) segments which are sections of river with relatively homogeneous fish habitat. Within this framework fish are categorised according to an intolerance index which lakes into account trophic preferences and specialisation, habitat preferences and specialisation, requirement for flowing water during different life-stages and association with habitat with unmodified water quality. This intolerance index. the expected frequency of occurrence and expected health of fish species in a particular fish habitat segment was used to formulate an index for the situation expected under minimally impaired conditions which was used as the comparative basis for the observed (sampled) situation. The observed situation was expressed as a fraction of the expected situation to arrive at a relative FAII index value which was grouped into one of six descriptive fish assemblage integrity index classes. It was found that the index reflected several aspects of the modifications that have occurred in the Crocodile River, i.e. water quality modifications; flow modifications and introduction of alien fish. However, now releases from Kwena Dam hampered fish sampling while the floods that occurred in the summer prior to the survey, extensively modified physical habitat conditions that existed for some years. It was concluded that the index provides a broad, synoptic estimation of the biological integrity of the river. It is highly likely that the index in its current form provides an underestimation of the biological integrity due to the species expected to be present, being based on all species listed fora segment, and not on the fish species expected to be present in the habitats actually sampled. It is suggested that refinement of the index should include development of improved methodology;to determine not only the fish species expected per segment, but also species expected per habitat type. In its current form, the index to the potential to provide qualitative, descriptive criteria for the desired ecological condition or integrity of rivers for management purposes in terms of the new South African Water Law. The development of numerical criteria will, however, require development in terms of the statistical properties (i.e. statistical power) of the index.

AB  - Macrobenthic community indices were examined for their ability to characterize the influence of shoreline alteration and watershed land use in nearshore estuarine environments of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. Twenty-three watersheds were surveyed in 2002 and 2003 for nearshore macrobenthic assemblages, environmental parameters (i.e., dissolved oxygen, pH, total suspended solids, salinity, and sediment composition), shoreline condition, and land use. Two indices of macrobenthic biological integrity, benthic index of biological integrity in the nearshore (B-IBIN) and abundance biomass comparison (W-value), were evaluated for associations with environmental and shoreline condition, and riparian and watershed land use. Comparisons between nearshore measures of the B-IBI with offshore values (> 2 m; Chesapeake Bay benthic index of biological integrity [B-IBICB]) were conducted to assess the ability of the index to reflect land use patterns at near and far proximities to shore. Nearshore macrobenthic communities were represented by a total of 94 species (mean number of species = 9.2 +/- 0.4 sample(-1)), and were dominated by the phyla Arthropoda, Annelida, and Mollusca. Temporal variability in environmental conditions and macrobenthic abundance and biomass may be attributable to the notable increase in precipitation in 2003 that led to nutrient influxes and algal blooms. For the biotic indices applied in the nearshore, the highest scores were associated with forested watersheds (W-value, B-IBIN). Ecological thresholds were identified with nonparametric change-point analysis, which indicated a significant reduction in B-IBIN and W-value scores when the amount of developed shoreline exceeded 10% and developed watershed exceeded 12%, respectively.

AB  - A fish-based index of biotic integrity was applied to the assessment of aquatic resource of Mae Ngad Reservoir, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Surveys of the fish assemblage were conducted in 2002, 2004 and 2019. Eighteen metrics were designed and applied, viz. species richness, diversity index, dominant index, hybrid species, native species, alien species, omnivores, insectivores, carnivores, pelagic species, water-column species, bottom species, rocky-and-stone species, sandy-and-gravel species, silty-to-muddy species, intolerant species, tolerant species and anomalies. Scores for each of the 18 metrics were summarised to provide an index value for each fish community sample, which can be used to determine the relative health of the site. In 2019 it was found that the fish data consisted of 10 families and 20 species. The overall fish-based index for Mae Ngad Somboonchon Reservoir in 2019 was 38, indicating fair biotic integrity.

AB  - The condition of New Zealand's remnant wetlands has been documented by landscape-scale assessments such as the Index of Ecological Integrity and Wetland Condition Index. We explored the potential for microscopic aquatic biota (epiphytic diatoms) to provide complementary information about wetland condition using data from 77 lowland sites (mainly palustrine swamps) with circumneutral pH. In the South Island, correspondence between diatoms and wetland indices or water quality was weak. In the North Island, conductivity and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) together explained 49% of the variance in assemblage composition and several diatom genera were indicative of high or low conductivity, dissolved phosphorus and TDN. Changes in these water quality variables may trigger changes in wetland condition, which are eventually reflected by the landscape-scale indices. Diatoms respond rapidly to water quality changes suggesting potential for diatom indicator taxa to provide early warning of wetland degradation or to track restoration.

AB  - Assessment of genetic control, mode of inheritance, general and specific combining abilities and effect of drought stress on genetic parameters of harvest index and biological yield traits in bread wheat were achieved by using Diallel mating design. Parents (eight cultivars) along with F-1 progenies (28 crosses) were sown in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications under stress condition in Karadj Agricultural Research Center. The data were analyzed according to methed of Hallauer and Miranda as well as fixed model of Griffing's method II. Jinks-Hayman model was used to estimate broad and narrow-sense heritabilities and mean degree of dominance. There were significant differences between genotypes for mentioned traits in both environments. Studying mean of squares of general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), the ratio of GCA to SCA mean of squares and portion of additive and dominance variances showed importance of both additive and non additive gene effects for harvest index, but in biological yield heredity, additive effect was more important. Estimating broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities showed low efficiency of harvest index and high efficiency of biological yield for selection programs in stress environments.

AB  - The Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb concentrations in the sediments of Lake Mariout were measured and estimated by statistical approaches using the contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), Nemerow index (I-in), ecological hazard index, and potential ecological hazard index (RI). The aim of the present work was to assess the current situation of Lake Mariout compared with other Egyptian lakes regarding heavy metal pollution in the sediment and to identify the putative sources. The measured concentration levels of heavy metals in Lake Mariout sediments were higher than the geochemical background reference condition by a factor of two to three, except for sediment sampled near the Umoum drain, where metal concentrations were close to the geochemical background reference condition. The PLI ranged from moderately to heavily polluted classes. The I-geo ranged from uncontaminated to moderately contaminated classes, where the RI indicates a low hazard. The comparison of Lake Mariout with other lakes indicates that all heavy metal concentrations except for Cd in Lake Mariout were higher than the average concentrations in Edku Lake. However, the average concentrations of Cd and Ni in Burullus Lake were higher than those found in the current study. For Manzala Lake, the Cd, Cu, and Pb concentrations were higher than the measured concentrations in Lake Mariout. The environmental hazard assessments of heavy metal concentrations in the Lake Mariout sediment determined the prevalence of possible anthropogenic pollution sources near the East and West Wastewater Treatment Plants and the El-Max pumping station.

AB  - Drought is a complex hazard that has more adverse effects on agricultural production and economic development. Studying drought monitoring techniques and assessment methods can improve our ability to respond to natural disasters. Numerous drought indices deriving from meteorological or remote sensing data are focused mainly on monitoring single drought response factors such as soil or vegetation, and the ability to reflect comprehensive information on drought was poor. This study constructed a comprehensive drought-monitoring model considering the drought factors including precipitation, vegetation growth status, and soil moisture balance during the drought process for the Jing-Jin-Ji region, China. The comprehensive drought index of remote sensing (CDIR), a drought indicator deduced by the model, was composed of the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the precipitation condition index (PCI). The PCI was obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The VCI and TCI were obtained from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this study, a heavy drought process was accurately explored using the CDIR in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in 2016. Finally, a three-month scales standardized precipitation index (SPI-3), drought affected crop area, and standardized unit yield of wheat were used as validation to evaluate the accuracy of this model. The results showed that the CDIR is closely related to the SPI-3, as well as variations in the drought-affected crop area and standardized unit yield of crop. The correlation coefficient of the CDIR with SPI-3 was between 0.45 and 0.85. The correlation coefficient between the CDIR and drought affected crop was between -0.81 and -0.86. Moreover, the CDIR was positively correlated with the standardized unit yield of crop. It showed that the CDIR index is a decent indicator that can be used for integrated drought monitoring and that it can synthetically reflect meteorological and agricultural drought information.

AB  - Effects of microplastics on marine taxa have become a focal point in marine experimental biology. Almost all studies so far, however, assessed the influence of microplastics on animals only in relation to a zero-particle group. Documented microplastic impacts may thus be overestimated, since many marine species also experience natural suspended solids as a stressor. Here, we compared the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and red clay (mean for both particles: similar to 12-14 mu m) on the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis across three particle concentrations (1.5, 15, 150 mg l(-1)). Exposure to PVC for 35 days lowered mussel body condition index by 14% in relation to clay, but no difference in byssus production, respiration and survival rates emerged between the two particle types. This suggests that the effects of synthetic particles on filter feeders may emulate those of natural suspended solids, and highlights the importance of including natural particles in microplastic exposure studies.

AB  - The protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus has been responsible for high mortality of eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, along the Atlantic and Gulf Coast of the United States. It also causes sublethal effects, although an impact on reproduction has heretofore been difficult to demonstrate. We examined the effect of P. marinus infection on growth, reproduction (as measured by relative gonadal size, and the proportional representation of gametogenic tissue and gametes in the gonad), and condition index of eastern oysters. Oysters of known age and genetic history were exposed to P. marinus infection and sampled at 2-4 week intervals over an 11-month period during the 1990-1991 epizootic in Delaware Bay. During this time, 50 to 100% of the oysters had detectable infections and nearly 55% died. Shell growth rates were inhibited as infections intensified during initial exposure in autumn 1990, but resumed in the spring and remained high, even after infection became heavy. The effect on reproduction varied with the stage of the gametogenic cycle. The relative gonadal size and the proportion of gametogenic tissue in the gonad. as well as the condition index, were most strongly depressed during the spring gametogenic period; however. there was no significant effect of parasite burden when the oysters were reproductively mature and ready to spawn. Data suggested that infected oysters, recovered, produced gametes, and spawned in early summer. Other studies have found inconsistent evidence of sublethal deleterious effects of P. marinus on reproduction. By sampling throughout the year and employing oysters of known genetic background, of the same age, reared in a common environment. and for which the timing of initial infection was known, we were able to show that P. marinus does have significant negative effects on oyster reproduction, measurable primarily during gametogenesis. rather than at spawning.

AB  - Marine benthic macrophytes (seaweed and seagrasses) are key structural and functional components of some of the most productive ecosystems of the world. They absorb nutrients through their surface directly from the marine environment and thus they are very important biological elements for the estimation of ecological status, representing reliable indicators of coastal waters. The aim of this study was to assess the ecological status and trophic level of Hormozgan rocky bottoms according to Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI). Sampling was done bi-monthly at seven stations at the intertidal rocky shores, west of Hormozgan Province. In this study a total of 63 species were identified, of which 15 species from seven genera belonged to green algae; 16 species from five genera belonged to brown algae; and 32 species from nine genera belonged to red algae. Coverage data of macroalgae and EEI indicate a high level of eutrophication for Saieh khosh, and Bostaneh, They are classified as zones with bad and poor ecological status, respectively. Also it has been proved that concentrations of biogenic elements and phytoplankton blooming are higher in these zones. The best values of the estimated metrics at Tahooneh and Michaeil could be explained with the good ecological conditions in those zones and the absence of pollution sources close to those transects. The values of abundance of macroalgae and EEI indicate moderate ecological conditions for Koohin, Lengeh and Chirooieh.

AB  - The pavement is a complex structure that is influenced by various environmental and loading conditions. The regular assessment of pavement performance is essential for road network maintenance. International roughness index (IRI) and pavement condition index (PCI) are well-known indices used for smoothness and surface condition assessment, respectively. Machine learning techniques have recently made significant advancements in pavement engineering. This paper presents a novel roughness-distress study using random forest (RF). After determining the PCI and IRI values for the sample units, the PCI prediction process is advanced using RF and random forest trained with a genetic algorithm (RF-GA). The models are validated using correlation coefficient (CC), scatter index (SI), and Willmott's index of agreement (WI) criteria. For the RF method, the values of the three parameters mentioned were -0.177, 0.296, and 0.281, respectively, whereas in the RF-GA method, -0.031, 0.238, and 0.297 values were obtained for these parameters. This paper aims to fulfill the literature's identified gaps and help pavement engineers overcome the challenges with the conventional pavement maintenance systems.

KW  - DISEASES
AB  - 1280 adult Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), 960 from shellfish farms and 320 from natural beds, were monthly collected over a one-year period in the Slovene Sea, measured and weighted to calculate the condition index and microscopically examined for the presence of the intracellular ciliates of mussels. Water temperature, oxygenation and salinity were measured at each sampling. The prevalence of infection with intracellular ciliates of mussels was 22.9%: 24.4% in cultured and 18.4% in wild mussels. The highest prevalence of infection was detected in spring when the average sea temperature was 15.2 degrees C, the average oxygenation 9.3mg/l and the average salinity 29.6 parts per thousand and the lowest prevalence was found in summer with the average sea temperature 24.1 degrees C, average oxygenation 7.6mg/l and average salinity 38.1 parts per thousand. We determined that only salinity had an impact on infection with intracellular ciliates - the higher the salinity, the lower the infection. The average condition index of infected mussels seemed to be slightly higher than of the healthy ones, but the differences between infected and healthy mussels were not statistically significant.

Two sets of central Minnesota lakes independent from the original set of lakes used to develop the IBI model were used to validate it. One set of lakes (n = 15) had physical features similar to those used to develop the IBI, while the other set (it = 22) averaged 9 in shallower with 28% more littoral area. We used general linear models to test whether the relationships between IBI or individual metric score and indicators of lake quality (trophic state, floristic quality, or surrounding land use) were the same or differed for the original IBI data set and each new data set. Responses were similar among all data sets, lake IBI scores and individual metrics reflecting differences in land use, trophic state, and aquatic habitat. Sensitivity of individual metrics to different measures of stress varied, supporting the need for a multimetric approach when assessing the biotic integrity of lakes. Index of biotic integrity scores were most highly correlated with trophic state (rho = -0.80). Our results support the validity of the original fish-based IBI as a standardized method for quantitatively measuring the condition of fish assemblages and implied overall biotic integrity of small central Minnesota lakes. As with any model, however, continued evaluation is recommended, especially when applying this IBI to lakes with different physical, chemical, or biological characteristics.

AB  - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images generated from NOAA AVHRR GVI data were recently used to monitor large scale drought patterns and their climatic impact on vegetation. The purpose of this study is to use the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) to further separate regional NDVI variation from geographical contributions in order to assess regional drought impacts. Weekly NDVI data for the period of July 1985 to June 1992 were used to produce NDVI and VCI images for the South American continent. NDVI data were smoothed with a median filtering technique for each year. Drought areas were delineated with certain threshold values of the NDVI and VCI. Drought patterns delineated by the NDVI and VCI agreed quite well with rainfall anomalies observed from rainfall maps of Brazil. NDVI values reflected the different geographical conditions quite well. Seasonal and interannual comparisons of drought areas delineated by the VCI provided a useful tool to analyse temporal and spatial evolution of regional drought as well as to estimate crop production qualitatively. It is suggested that VCI data besides NDVI may be used to construct a large scale crop yield prediction model.

TI  - Development of the Nature Capital Index for the dunal region
T2  - GORTERIA
LA  - Dutch
AB  - Biodiversity is in rapid decline worldwide. It is a complex concept, hence there is a need for an easy and transparent indicator to characterize and communicate this decline to policy makers. For the Netherlands, the Nature Capital Index (NCI) has been developed by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP). The NO combines information about quantity (area) and quality (ecosystem specific species), which are standardized to a natural reference situation in 1950. In this paper, the calculation of the NO is being described for the vascular plants in the dunal region and special attention is paid to the construction of the adapted reference situation of 1850 for this region. The characteristic flora of the dunes showed a strong decline in the 20(th) century, in particular wet grassland species. However, by the end of the 20(th) century these species showed a remarkable recovery.

AB  - This study assessed the influence of temperature on gonadal tissue maturation in the mangrove oyster Crassostrea gasar in the laboratory. The oysters were held at three water temperatures (18 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 26 degrees C), and the control oysters were maintained under cultivation in the environment. Every 10 days, 10 oysters from each treatment were examined for condition index and 10 for histological analysis. In the 22 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and field treatments, gonadal tissue maturation was observed, with no significant difference among treatments. The 18 degrees C treatment was significantly different compared with the groups maintained at other temperatures, but did not demonstrate an improvement in gonadal tissue maturation. The results suggest that at 18 degrees C, an accumulation of energy reserves occurs, and at temperatures greater than 22 degrees C, gamete maturation occurs. In this study, the animals maintained in the field environment exhibited the same maturation conditions as those maintained in the laboratory, suggesting that this species can be stimulated in the laboratory, apart from the period of natural maturation.

AB  - The health status of cultured and wild Mediterranean mussels in the Slovene Sea has so far been unexplored. Initially, 1280 adult Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), 960 from a shellfish farm and 320 from natural beds, were collected over a one-year period. Water temperature, oxygenation and salinity were measured at each sampling. Mussels were measured and weighted to calculate the condition index and microscopically examined for the presence of haemocytic neoplasia. Haemocytic neoplasia was detected in 14 mussels (1.1%) with a higher prevalence in cultured mussels. Neoplastic cells singularly infiltrated the connective tissue, in small foci or diffusely. Necrosis and multifocal atrophy of digestive tubules were noticed in mussels with diffuse neoplasia, whereas severe haemocytic infiltration of connective tissue was seen in mussels with single neoplastic cells. Haemocytic neoplasia was more frequently observed in spring and autumn. The average condition index of mussels with haemocytic neoplasia was slightly higher than in healthy ones. This is the first report of haemocytic neoplasia in Mediterranean mussels in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The disease occurs only sporadically and to date no significant impact on the mussel population has been noted.

AB  - Successful stream rehabilitation requires a shift from narrow analysis and management to integrated understanding of the links between human actions and changing river health. At study sites in the Puget Sound lowlands of western Washing-ton State, landscape, hydrological, and biological conditions were evaluated for streams flowing through watersheds with varying levels of urban development. At all spatial scales, stream biological condition measured by the benthic index of biological integrity (B-IBI) declined as impervious area increased. Impervious area alone, however, is a flawed surrogate of river health. Hydrologic metrics that reflect chronic altered streamflows, for example, provide a direct mechanistic link between the changes associated with urban development and declines in stream biological condition. These measures provide a more sensitive understanding of stream basin response to urban development than do treatment of each increment of impervious area equally. Land use in residential backyards adjacent to streams also heavily influences stream condition. Successful stream rehabilitation thus requires coordinated diagnosis of the causes of degradation and integrative management to treat the range of ecological stressors within each urban area, and it depends on remedies appropriate at scales from backyards to regional storm water systems.

AB  - Nine sites on streams in the Platte River Basin in central Nebraska were sampled as part of the US Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program during 1993-1994. A combination of canonical correspondence analysis and an index of biotic integrity determined from fish community data produced complementary evaluations of water-quality conditions. Results of the canonical correspondence analysis were useful in showing which environmental variables were significant in differentiating fish communities at the nine sites. Five environmental variables were statistically significant in the analysis. Median specific conductance of water samples collected at a site accounted for the largest amount of variability in the species data. Although the percentage of the basin as cropland was not the first variable chosen ina forward selection process, it was the most strongly correlated with the first ordination axis. A rangeland-dominated site was distinguished from all others along that axis. Median orthophosphate concentration of samples collected in the year up to the time of fish sampling was most strongly correlated with the second ordination axis. The index of biotic integrity produced results that could be interpreted in terms of the relative water quality between sites. Sites draining nearly 100% cropland had the lowest scores for two individual metrics of the index of biotic integrity that were related to species tolerance. Effective monitoring of water quality could be achieved by coupling methods that address both the ecological components of fish communities and their statistical relationships to environmental factors.

AB  - In vertebrates, the main tissue devoted to energy storage is the adipose tissue. In salamanders, energy reserves can also be stored in the adipose tissues of the tail. Therefore, we evaluated if energy storage in salamanders' tails is related to individual body condition, life cycle and environmental constraints. We calculated a scaled measure of tail width for 345 salamanders belonging to six Mediterranean taxa exhibiting wide phylogenetic, behavioural and ecological variation. We related this measure to the Scaled Mass Index (SMI), a body condition index which reliably predicts body fat. We found significant relationships between the SMI and scaled tail width in the terrestrial Spectacled salamander and Alpine salamanders, independently of sex. At the same time, we found that energy storage in the tail is maximum in Alpine Salamanders, which experience reduced activity periods and restricted access to resources. Conversely, we found a significant effect of sex in Imperial cave salamanders, where females store reserves in the tail to counterbalance resource investment in parental care, and in Corsican Brook Newts, where the reproductive function of males' tails may imply a greater tail width. Finally, in the biphasic Great Crested Newt, tail width was not related to SMI in both sexes.

AB  - By applying discriminant analysis to benthic macroinvertebrate data, we have developed an indicator of benthic condition for northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries. The data used were collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) in the Louisianian Province from 1991 to 1994. This benthic index represents a linear combination oa the following weighted parameters: the proportion of expected species diversity, the mean abundance of tubificid oligochaetes, the percent of total abundance represented by capitellid polychaetes, the percent of total abundance represented by bivalve mollusks, and the percent of total abundance represented by amphipods. We successfully validated and retrospectively applied the benthic index to all of the benthic data collected by EMAP in the Louisianian Province. This benthic index was also calculated for independent data collected from Pensacola Bay, Florida, in order to demonstrate its flexibility and applicability to different estuarine systems within the same biogeographic region. The benthic index is a useful and valid indicator of estuarine condition that is intended to provide environmental managers with a simple tool for assessing the health of benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

AB  - The main objective of an ecosystem sustainable management is to preserve its capacity to respond and adapt to current disturbances and/or future changes, and maintain the provision of environmental goods and services. Two very important properties linked to this objective are the ecosystem resilience and resistance to disturbance factors. The Structural-Functional State and Transition Model (SFSTM) is a conceptual framework that allows evaluating the ecosystem resilience and resistance based on structural and functional attributes. On the other hand, the Landscape Functional Analysis (LFA) presents a method to assess the rangeland "health" based on structural vegetation and soil indicators, creating indexes to evaluate the ecosystem functional integrity. The aim of this study is to integrate LFA and SFSTM as an approach to help validate indicators and indexes associated with the resistance, resilience, and stability of a temperate rangeland ecosystem. States and transitions model for a shrubby-grasses steppe of the Western Patagonian District was used as a reference system. Changes in vegetation structure, soil surface, and loss of soil due to erosion were determined in sites with different grazing histories. Based on the SFSTM, we assessed the relationships between ecosystem structural changes with the recruitment process of the plant community and ecosystem integrity indexes (sensu LFA). Our results indicate that the decrease in the recruitment process, related to different grazing histories, was associated with a loss of ecosystem functional integrity. This was associated to a decrease in the ability to retain, store, and use rain water, and also in nutrient cycling. This suggests that the integration of the LFA methodology to the SFSTM can be used for indexes validation, which in turn allows the identification of critical thresholds associated with ecosystem resilience loss. Finally, throughout the integration of indicators of LFA into SFSTM, we established relationships between ecosystem resistance, resilience, and stability in response to a disturbance factor (e.g. overgrazing). Thus, we used this information to define states in stable, unstable, mixed-unstable, and indifferent-stable dynamic equilibriums. Our proposed approach provides a tool for ecosystem assessment regarding the identification of states that can be restored and those that might be more susceptible to degradation. Such information might help in the prevention of crossing a critical threshold and be used for sustainable management programs in rangelands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes an innovative approach for investigating the accumulated meteorological effects on cotton during the growing season. The quantification of the weather effects is based on the application of the Bhalme and Mooley drought index (BMDI) methodology on the vegetation condition index (VCI) extracted by NOAA/AVHRR data. The resulted Bhalme and Mooley vegetation condition index (BMVCI) is in the same scale as the Z-index, as proposed in the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) for drought monitoring. The study area comprises the region of Thessaly, which is the most cotton productive area in Greece. Eighteen years of NOAA/AVHRR data are examined and processed with the BMVCI to examine the unfavorable conditions for cotton production. For the validation of BMVCI an empirical relationship between the cotton production of Thessaly and the BMVCI values is derived for the period 1982-1997. The methodology is validated for the two following years (1998 and 1999). The estimated cotton production approximates 5% and 2%, respectively, the real values for the validated years. The results confirm the usefulness of this integrated methodological approach as an effective tool to assess cotton production in Thessaly. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using a probabilistic survey design, we assessed the ecological condition of the Florida (U.S.A.) portion of the Escambia River watershed using selected environmental and benthic macroinvertebrate data. Macroinvertebrates were sampled at 28 sites during July-August 1996, and 3414 individuals were identified. Taxonomic data were distilled into the 8 m of the Stream Condition Index ( SCI), developed specifically for Florida waterways, and sites were classified on an ordinal scale as very good, good, poor, and very poor. The weighted cumulative distribution function of the SCI showed that 8% ( +/- 7) of the stream and river miles in this landscape were in very good condition, while 25% (+/- 7), 51% (+/- 16), and 16% (+/- 15) were in good, poor, and very poor condition, respectively. The only environmental parameter significantly correlated with SCI was dissolved oxygen (DO), and two sites classified as very poor had oxygen levels around or below 2 mg L-1. However, other sites exhibited similarly low SCI values without the attendant low DO, implying that factors determining site condition were complex and multivariate. The results of this survey corroborate Federal and state assessments demonstrating that many locations within this watershed exhibit significant degradation.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitats may serve as a refuge for aquatic species, including freshwater mussels (Bivalvia, Unionida). Evaluating the role of anthropogenic habitats is a fundamental, but still ignored, conservation issue given the pace that humans have been converting natural ecosystems. In this study, possible differences in abundance, size and condition index of the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera colonizing anthropogenic (water mill canals) and natural (Tuela River) habitats were assessed. No differences were found in the abundance of freshwater pearl mussels colonizing both habitats, but individuals present in the water mill canals have a significantly higher condition index and size. Water mill canals seem to provide stable conditions for the settlement, growth and survival of freshwater pearl mussels. However, the occurrence of an exceptional drought during the late summer of 2017 was responsible for an almost 100% mortality in one of the two water mill canals surveyed in this study. Therefore, and during extreme climatic events, these anthropogenic structures may function as an ecological trap for freshwater pearl mussels. This study can be used by managers to promote future actions that enhance freshwater pearl mussel protection and guarantee their survival, including on anthropogenic habitats.

AB  - In today's world, improving the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being is a necessary condition for humanity as a whole to achieve higher levels of well-being within ecological limits. In this paper, the Index of Ecological Well-being Performance (IEWP) is defined and constructed to measure the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being and to determine which countries are more ecologically efficient in improving human well-being. As an efficiency measure, the main mission of the IEWP is to urge and stimulate countries to improve human well-being in an ecologically efficient way. The Human Development Index (measuring human well-being) and the Ecological Footprint (measuring ecological consumption) are employed to construct the IEWP. An empirical IEWP analysis of 82 countries with a population larger than 10 million in 2012 demonstrates that the developed countries (except Romania) and the G20 countries (except India and Indonesia) are generally less ecologically efficient in improving human well-being. To make national well-being improvement not only ecologically efficient but also equitable, several suggestions are proposed regarding respective responsibilities for global ecological sustainability in the process of improving IEWP performance for countries with different ecological conditions and development stages.

AB  - Studies of the benthos in nearshore water areas within Protected Areas along the Black Sea are an important ecological task. In this connection, protected habitats can be recognised as intact natural areas, where the entire natural complex is preserved with its typical taxonomic structure and biodiversity features. This study is based on the obtained quantitative data on the biodiversity of benthic assemblages in coastal Protected Areas. It aims to study the structure of polychaete communities as inhabitants of fouling areas at sublittoral (depth 0-3 m) rocky/boulder substrates in four Protected Areas along the Black Sea (Cape Martyan State Nature Reserve, Karadag State Nature Reserve, Opukskiy State Nature Reserve, and Utrish State Nature Reserve). The studied sites differ in their geographic location, orographic shape of the coastal strip, features of underwater substrates, the pattern of spatial coverage and species composition of macroalgae foulings and other environmental parameters. The purpose of this study was also to make a prognostic estimation of the expected species richness (S-exp) and comparative analysis of the structural organisation of polychaete complexes on rocky substrates in the selected coastal Protected Areas. The prognostic modelling of polychaete species richness was based on the known extrapolation algorithms (estimators Chao-2, Jackknife-2, and bootstrap). The results show that the expected level of species richness (S-exp) exceeds the actually detected (S-obs) number of species in each of the four Protected Areas by 20-95%, depending on the estimator and total number of collected samples. In all sublittoral water areas, it was found that with an increase in the number of samples the accumulation curves do not reach a horizontal asymptote. This indicates an underestimated species richness of polychaetes. At the rocky sublittoral zone of the Cape Martyan State Nature Reserve, the fastest increase in S-exp values was revealed with an increase in the number of samples taken. This relationship can be determined by heterogeneity of microhabitats in this area, where the increased number of polychaete species is also formed. Considering the other Protected Areas, the extrapolative curves of species richness have a flatter mode and a smaller expected number of species (S-exp), despite the larger number of samples analysed. According to the results of the clustering and ordination analyses, based on the species composition and abundance of polychaetes, almost all samples taken were grouped into separate clusters corresponding to each of the four studied Protected Areas. The reliability of structural differences between polychaete complexes was statistically confirmed by pairwise comparison of three areas (Utrish, Karadag, and Martyan). The comparison of sites conditionally named Utrish and Opukskiy demonstrated that structural differences between polychaete complexes were statistically insignificant probably due to the affinity of the geomorphologic pattern of hard-bottoms and composition of fouling vegetation in sublittoral zones of both Protected Areas. The specific polychaete complexes have been formed on rocky/boulder substrates within each of the investigated Protected Areas, being different in their taxonomic structure and quantitative characteristics of the certain species.
   For each polychaete complex, the most significant species were identified, which determine both the intracomplex taxonomic structure (indicating species) and structural differences between the complexes (discriminating species). In the polychaete complex of the rocky sublittoral in the Karadag State Nature Reserve such indicating species were Nereis zonata, Platynereis dumerilii, and Syllis gracilis. In the Cape Martyan State Nature Reserve and Utrish State Nature Reserve, the indicating taxa were Polyophthalmus pictus, Nereis sp., and Pholoe inornata. Finally, in the Opukskiy State Nature Reserve, Notomastus latericeus and Pholoe inornata were recognised as indicating species. Most of these species may also be considered as discriminating species. Parameters of their quantitative development reflect the structural features of polychaete complexes formed under the influence of specific environmental factors in the sublittoral zone of each of the four studied coastal Protected Areas. The obtained results of the structural-faunistic analysis of polychaete complexes can be applied for comparative assessment of the biodiversity features of benthic communities during the comprehensive ecological monitoring of the coastal Protected Areas.

AB  - Drought is one of the most complex and least-understood environmental disasters that can trigger environmental, societal, and economic problems. To accurately assess the drought conditions in the Yellow River Basin, this study reconstructed the Land Surface Temperature (LST) using the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), which are four typical remote sensing drought indices, were calculated. Then, the air temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture data were used to evaluate the applicability of each drought index to different land types. Finally, this study characterized the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in the Yellow River Basin from 2003 to 2019. The results show that: (1) Using the LST reconstructed by the ATC model to calculate the drought index can effectively improve the accuracy of drought monitoring. In most areas, the reconstructed TCI, VHI, and TVDI are more reliable for monitoring drought conditions than the unreconstructed VCI. (2) The four drought indices (TCI, VCI, VH, TVDI) represent the same temporal and spatial patterns throughout the study area. However, in some small areas, the temporal and spatial patterns represented by different drought indices are different. (3) In the Yellow River Basin, the drought level is highest in the northwest and lowest in the southwest and southeast. The dry conditions in the Yellow River Basin were stable from 2003 to 2019. The results in this paper provide a basis for better understanding and evaluating the drought conditions in the Yellow River Basin and can guide water resources management, agricultural production, and ecological protection of this area.

AB  - Maturity Index, which categorizes nematode taxa into five groups, represents different life strategies and ecological requirements, ranging from colonizers (r-strategists) to persisters (k-strategists). Maturity Index of nematode assemblages has been widely used as bioindicators in environmental assessments. This study was conducted to understand how the Maturity Index provides sensitive adaption with environmental disturbances (emphasis on effects of organic enrichment) in tropical mangrove ecosystems. Sampling was carried out in the rainy season of 2015, nematode communities were sampled and environmental variables were measured at the eight integrated mangrove-shrimp ponds in the Ca Mau mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to explore the relationship between the Maturity Index and environmental variables. The Maturity Index of nematode communities differently responded depending on the environmental conditions. Maturity Index was positively correlated with salinity and, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with organic enrichment (total nitrogen and total organic carbon). These findings suggest potential application of the Maturity Index in biomonitoring studies of tropical mangrove ecosystems.

AB  - Corbicula fluminea is a known aquatic invasive species responsible for several ecological and economic impacts. In Portugal, it is found in all major watersheds, although to varying degrees of invasion (regarding density, biomass and spatial distribution). The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatio-temporal differences in condition indices (CIs) and biochemical composition (proteins, lipids and energy) of individuals collected in Lima (low invasion) and Minho (high invasion) Rivers, as well as the effects of intra-specific competition (densities: 150, 500, 1000 individuals/m(2)) on the CIs of C. fluminea. CIs and biochemical composition varied between rivers and over time, with populations in Lima and Minho showing different patterns. Corbicula fluminea in Lima River had higher CIs and lower densities with more individuals of larger size, while individuals in Minho River had lower CIs and high densities with a more uniform size distribution. The intra-specific competition experiment showed that the optimum of C. fluminea was reached at 500 individuals/m(2) density, possibly related to the species ability of enrich sediments with organic matter, leading to a positive feedback on phytoplankton and/or microbial communities. This study improves the understanding of the ecophysiological conditions of C. fluminea populations, a topic neglected in previous studies.

AB  - We investigated the annual gametogenic phenology of the freshwater pearl mussel, Lamellidens marginalis (Lamarck, 1819), collected from a lentic habitat at Mymensingh, Bangladesh, using biometry and histology through monthly sampling from August 2015 to July 2016. After biometric measurements, thin slices of dorso-ventral sections were cut from the middle of the mussels for histology to determine sex and level of gonadal maturation. The condition index (CI) ranged from 0.64 (March) to 0.99 (January) over the study period. The CI peaked three times (January, April and July) indicating that the mussels were ripe during these months and subsequent decreases in CI indicated spawning, which was consistent with histology. Both males and females exhibited similar patterns in terms of gonadal development, maturation and spawning activity. It was confirmed that natural populations of L. marginalis spawn throughout the year with remarkable temporal variations, except during December when the surface water temperature reaches annual minima (16.5 degrees C). Highest spawning activity of L. marginalis was noted during February-March, May and July-November. The data obtained in the present study could be useful for the conservation managers of this commercial species by allowing harvesting of better quality mussels to be timed without interrupting major spawning activity.

AB  - Body condition in small mammals is often investigated by examining the residuals of a regression of mass on a linear measure of body size. Such indices include a number of assumptions, which, in most cases, are not tested. This study presents a residual condition index, that uses the regression of body mass on the Axis I factor scores from a Principal Components Analysis, to estimate body condition in free-living ship rats, Rattus rattus Linneaus 1758, caught in mixed forest in New Zealand. The results from this index and a simpler ratio index were compared to determine how well they met the assumptions of the technique, and how well they identified biological differences in the population. Of the indices tested, the residual index based on an Ordinary Least Squared regression proved to be the most statistically robust method. The condition indices calculated were probably correlated with significant differences between individuals, but were not compared with true condition as estimated by fat reserves. Further applications and the need for the validation of the residual index are discussed.

AB  - Multimetric approaches typically consider only one level of biological organization to assess the effects of environmental stressors on the health of aquatic ecosystems. The present study applied integrative star-plot analysis to evaluate effects of stressors over several levels of biological organization ranging from the sub-organism to the community level at study sites subjected to different levels of contaminant stress. An aquatic ecosystem health index (AEHI), based on the sum of all the star-plot areas over these levels of biological organization, was developed to reflect an integrative and holistic assessment of stressors on ecosystem health. Star-plot areas ranged from 1.96 at a reference site to 0.79-1.08 at sites located at increasing distances downstream from a pulp mill discharge. The values of the AEHI were positively correlated with the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores (Pearson's r = 0.824). The AEHI can be used to evaluate the overall health status of aquatic systems, to identify those levels of biological organization that have the greatest response to environmental stressors, and to help identify possible causes of observed effects. Results from this study suggest that the AEHI approach can avoid false-negative responses that can occur from assessing effects at only one level of biological organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have become a ubiquitous emerging pollutant in the global marine environment. The potential toxic effects of MPs and interactions of MP pollution with other stressors such as food limitation on marine organisms' health are not yet well understood. This study investigated the effects of three-week exposure to different MPs and food shortage on the physical defense mechanisms (byssus production and properties) of Mytilus coruscus. Starvation significantly reduced the number of byssus threads, and combined exposure to MPs and food shortage suppressed the adhesion ability and condition index of mussels. The length of the byssus threads was not affected by all experimental exposures. Transcript levels of genes encoding key proteins involved in byssus formation (the mussel foot proteins mfp-1, -2, -3, -4, -5 and -6, and prepolymerized collagen proteins preCOL-D, -P and -NG) were altered by interactions between the MPs and food shortage. These findings show that insufficient food supply can exacerbate the adverse effects of MPs on mussel defense which might have implications for survival and fitness of mussels under food limited conditions (e.g. in winter) in polluted coastal habitats.

AB  - The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei, Mollusca: Bivalvia) is an invasive species that has been causing considerable environmental and economic problems in South America. In the present study, filtration rates of L. fortunei were determined in the laboratory under different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 28, and 30 C) and two types of food (Algamac-2000 (R) and the chlorophycean alga Scenedesmus sp.). There was a statistically significant relationship between time and filtration rates in the experiment using Scenedesmus sp., regardless of temperature. However, this pattern was absent in the experiment using Algamac, suggesting that the relationship between filtration rates and temperature might depend on the size of the filtered particles. In addition, there was no correlation between filtration rates and either shell size or condition index (the relationship between the weight and the length of a mussel). The filtration rate measured in the present study (724.94 ml/h) was one of the highest rates recorded among invasive bivalves to date. Given that the colonies of the golden mussel could reach hundreds of thousands of individuals per square meter, such filtration levels could severely impact the freshwater environments in its introduced range.

AB  - We studied the relation between the presence of Perkinsus sp. with growth performance (shell height - SH, body weight - BW), condition index, and biochemical composition (triglycerids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) of the oyster Crassostrea gigas cultivated in two farms from Sinaloa, Mexico. Perkinsus sp. was detected in both farms throughout (June 2013 to June 2014). The oysters had diverse degrees of prevalence fluctuating from 26.7 to 83.3 To. According to the Mackin's scale, the intensity of infection was light to very light (0.1 to 1.2). There were not significant correlations between the prevalence with all studied parameters. Oyster survival at both farms was not affected by the presence of the protozoan. Intensity of Perkinsus infection was positively correlated with the biochemical composition of oyster. The influence of environmental parameters on the incidence the parasite in C. gigas is discussed. The overall results suggest that the presence of Perkinsus sp. in C. gigas from the two farms did not affect the health of the cultivated oysters, however, periodic monitoring of this pathogen in the farms should be continued.

AB  - Aims To assess the compatibility of alternative phytosanitary products (APPs) with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuillemin.
   Methods and Results The APPs used were Baicao, Orobor((R)), Topneem, Rotenat and Compostonat at concentrations recommended by the manufacturers (CR), and then half (1/2CR) and double (2CR). To evaluate the compatibility, the following parameters were analysed: germination, colony forming units (CFUs), vegetative growth and conidia production. Compatibility was assessed using rates of toxicity and biological index. The association of APPs and B. bassiana was also evaluated for pathogenicity against larvae of third instar Anagasta kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (1 center dot 0 x 10(8) conidia per ml). The germination of conidia of B. bassiana was reduced only by the product Orobor((R)). The CFUs were not affected by any products. The colony diameter was reduced when in contact with the products Baicao and Orobor((R)). For conidia production per colony, all products reduced this parameter. None of the products affected the pathogenicity of the fungus on A. kuehniella.
   Conclusions All APPs tested are compatible with B. bassiana.
   Significance and Impact of the Study The natural products tested and used in the field are considered compatible with B. bassiana under laboratory conditions, making possible new studies and the use of these in insect control.

AB  - Identification of priority areas is a fundamental goal in conservation biology. Because of a lack of detailed information about species distributions, conservation targets in the Zhoushan Archipelago (China) were established on the basis of a species-area-habitat relationship (choros model) combined with an environmental cluster analysis (ECA). An environmental-distinctness index was introduced to rank areas in the dendrogram obtained with the ECA. To reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation, the ECA was performed considering spatial constraints. To test the validity of the proposed index, a principal component analysis-based environmental diversity approach was also performed. The priority set of islands obtained from the spatially constrained cluster analysis coupled with the environmental-distinctness index had high congruence with that from the traditional environmental-diversity approach. Nevertheless, the environmental-distinctness index offered the advantage of giving hotspot rankings that could be readily integrated with those obtained from the choros model. Although the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test showed no significant difference among the rankings from constrained and unconstrained clustering process, as indicated by cophenetic correlation, spatially constrained cluster analysis performed better than the unconstrained cluster analysis, which suggests the importance of incorporating spatial autocorrelation into ECA. Overall, the integration of the choros model and the ECA showed that the islands Liuheng, Mayi, Zhoushan, Fodu, and Huaniao may be good candidates on which to focus future efforts to conserve regional biodiversity. The 4 types of priority areas, generated from the combination of the 2 approaches, were explained in descending order on the basis of their conservation importance: hotspots with distinct environmental conditions, hotspots with general environmental conditions, areas that are not hotspots with distinct environmental conditions, and areas that are not hotspots with general environmental conditions.

AB  - The paper is focused on the integrated modelling of environmental quality. It shows how we can use multi-criteria decision analysis to study some aspects about the environmental quality status in a region and its evolution during a certain period of time. The global analysis is created by taking into account the concurrent contributions of different factors such as air quality, drinking-water quality and noise pollution, on the quality of the environment people live in. We propose an indicator, named environmental quality index, which can reflect the global quality of the environment. It can be considered a tool which can be used by decision-makers involved in environmental management issues for deciding if the current actions and strategies are going in right directions. The study is carried out through a multi-criteria decision model in case of certainty, namely the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method, because it is based on real and basic defined indicators which have certain values. We have applied this tool for a case study. We chose as our case study a city from south west Romania and a period of 7 years, namely 2012-2018. Based on this environmental quality index we have ranked the 7 years showing in which of them the level of the quality of the environment was the best.

AB  - The Index of Biotic Integrity (Minns et al., 1994) was used to evaluate ecosystem health in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario. Despite being classified an Area of Concern (AOC) in 1985, Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) values at Bay of Quinte fell within the range or exceeded values from reference locations elsewhere in Lakes Ontario and Erie. Fish survey data collected from 1988-2009 in the Bay of Quinte and elsewhere indicated that (1) the Bay of Quinte has relatively healthy fish habitat despite the AOC designation, (2) Bay of Quinte IBI scores increased significantly between 1990 and 1999 due to changes in relative species richness and (3) differences in fish communities were correlated with physical habitat attributes at survey locations. Data from both nearshore electrofishing and trap net surveys confirmed that the Bay of Quinte supports a highly productive and diverse fish community.

AB  - The present study was conducted to assess the monthly variations of total lipids content and some biological parameters of rock oyster in the Northern coasts of the Gulf of Oman (Iranian coast) from October 2017 until March 2018 in relation to environmental conditions. According to the results, the maximum and minimum lengths were recorded in December and February, respectively. The highest amounts of weight, dry and wet weight, and condition index were recorded in autumn. There was also a significant difference between the months and the regions for these parameters (p < 0.05). The highest amount of total lipids was observed in March (3.1 +/- 1.84) with a significant difference relative to October and November and the lowest amount one was observed in October (2.15 +/- 1.6). Also, there was a significant relationship between the total lipids and the temperature. Moreover, there were higher amounts of total lipids in Saccostrea cucullata in winter compared to those in autumn. In general, one of the reasons for the differences in length, weight and total lipids at different stations over different months can mainly be explained by the reproduction season, nutritional conditions, and environmental factors such as temperature and salinity.

AB  - The European WFD (2000/60/EC) requires the assessment of the ecological quality status of water bodies, and gives great importance to the biological components of the ecosystem. A multimetric, fuzzy-based index for the evaluation of environmental quality (FINE: Fuzzy INdex of Ecosystem integrity) has been developed. The FINE index was calculated at 7 sites in the Sacca di Goro and the Valli di Comacchio (Adriatic Sea), where water and sedimentary chemical data were available for the years 2004 and 2005. A significant positive correlation was found between FINE values and dissolved oxygen, while significant negative correlations were observed between FINE values and transparency, nitrogen and phosphorous in the water column, and heavy metals and PCB in the sediments.

AB  - Using various communities as indicators of the biotic integrity of waters has been developed. However, compared to other organisms, such as fish or macroinvertebrates, there are few studies in lakes/reservoirs using phytoplankton as an indicator. Taking a Chinese reservoir as an example, an evaluation method with reference to phytoplankton index of biotic integrity was developed to assess the ecological status of the reservoir. In the method, a factor analysis was used to reduce the metric sets regarding phytoplankton and to identify a potentially lower number of unobserved/imaginary variables to represent the characteristics of the community. The kind of phytoplankton index was calculated by determining the corresponding factor scores for each site. The results showed that four factors can be indicative of ecological integrity and provide a monitoring tool. The relations between the factors and water quality parameters also indicated that the factors could reflect the water quality status. The scores can truly reflect the changes in water quality, and each factor representing the different characteristics of a phytoplankton community revealed changes in water quality from different views. This study was an important trial for the development of a biological index based on phytoplankton in a lake/reservoir without reference sites and presented a simple and practical approach for assessing the status of waters. The methods based on factor analysis for creating a phytoplankton index of biotic integrity can be recommended for determining the ecosystem health of waters.

AB  - Platinum (Pt) is a technology critical element (TCE) for which biogeochemical cycles are still poorly understood. This lack of knowledge includes Pt effects on marine organisms, which proved to be able to bioconcentrate this trace element. Oysters Crassostrea gigas were exposed to stable Pt isotope spiked daily in seawater for 35 days. Seawater was renewed daily and spiked (with Pt(IV)) to three nominal Pt concentrations (50, 100, and 10,000 ng L-1) for two replicate series. Organotropism study revealed that gills, and to a lesser extent mantle, are the key organs regarding Pt accumulation, although a time- and concentration-dependent linear increase in Pt levels occurred in all the organs investigated (i.e., digestive gland, gonads, gills, mantle, and muscle). In oysters exposed to Pt concentrations of 10,000 ng L-1, significant biomarker impairments occurred, especially at cellular levels. They reflect altered lipofuscin and neutral lipid contents, as well as intralysosomal metal accumulation. These observations were attributed to activation of excretion/detoxification mechanisms, including Pt elimination through feces and clearly support the importance of the digestive gland in the response to direct Pt exposure. Despite relatively constant condition index, the integrative biological response (IBR) index suggests a generally decreasing health status of oysters.

AB  - This study aimed to verify the reproductive seasonality in Saanen goats from distinct parity orders (nulliparous, primiparous, and pluriparous) throughout an entire year in the Southeast Region of Brazil. In addition, it was also verified the influence of environmental indexes, metabolic profile, body weight, and social interactions on the reproductive seasonality of these animals. Forty Saanen goats kept under intensive system at latitude 22 degrees 52 30 s and tropical photoperiod (11-13h of light per day) were used. Every 15days, blood from 24 animals (8 animals per group) was collected for assessment of serum progesterone levels. Monthly, environmental data (rainfall index, maximum and minimum temperature, and time of natural daylight) and blood were collected to evaluate the metabolic profile. Weighting and body condition score measurement were also carried out every 2months. There was no difference in body weight and body condition score in primiparous and pluriparous goats. Nulliparous goats showed natural breeding season in the winter season while the primiparous and pluriparous goats remained cyclical in autumn and winter season. Regardless of the parity order, all goats showed a seasonal anestrus in the spring season. From December, social interactions were able to reestablish, in distinct degrees, the cyclical state in the goats. Likewise, environmental and weight indexes had low and moderate influence, respectively, on the reproductive seasonality in the Saanen goats kept under tropical conditions.

AB  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems is a powerful tool for classifying threatened ecosystems, informing ecosystem management, and assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse (that is, the endpoint of ecosystem degradation). These risk assessments require explicit definitions of ecosystem collapse, which are currently challenging to implement. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we systematically review evidence for ecosystem collapses reported in two contrasting biomes - marine pelagic ecosystems and terrestrial forests. Most studies define states of ecosystem collapse quantitatively, but few studies adequately describe initial ecosystem states or ecological transitions leading to collapse. On the basis of our review, we offer four recommendations for defining ecosystem collapse in risk assessments: (1) qualitatively defining initial and collapsed states, (2) describing collapse and recovery transitions, (3) identifying and selecting indicators of collapse, and (4) setting quantitative collapse thresholds.

AB  - Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), macroinvertebrate North Carolina Biotic Integrity Index (NCBI) data, and Tennessee Macroinvertebrate Index (TMI) data were collected in 2009 and 2010 along with the hydrology to determine if a golf course water withdrawal was degrading the stream's aquatic life. Campostoma anomalum dominated the stream, and there were low numbers of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Richland Creek is a 28-square-mile watershed located in a highly urbanized area. The golf course withdraws a daily average of 400000(1514 cubic metre) gallons of water over a 60 to 155day period. McCabe Golf Course withdraws >10% of the flow in the low-flow months of June through October. Fish IBI scores were poor throughout Richland Creek with the upstream IBI being higher than downstream of the withdrawal. TMI scores were moderately impaired upstream and downstream of the golf course withdrawal, with the TMI being marginally better upstream of the withdrawal than downstream. The natural flow regime (Annear et al., 2004) is not maintained in Richland Creek because of the urban nature of the stream and the increased stormwater runoff into the stream. Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency's instream flow policy statement states that flow should not be <20% above the September median flow, which is 12cfs (0 center dot 39 cms). The hydrology of the stream is altered by one major water withdrawal with its associated low-head dam as well as urbanization, which affects the fish and macroinvertebrate diversity.

AB  - Remediation of soils contaminated with metal must ensure high efficiency of metals removal, reduce bioavailability of residual metals and decrease ecological risk. Thus, for comprehensive environmental soil quality assessment, different indices must be used. In this study, suitability of 8 indices was used for soil highly contaminated with Cu (7874.5 mg kg(-1)), moderately with Pb (1414.3 mg kg(-1)) and low with Zn (566.1 mg kg(-1)), washed in batch and dynamic conditions with both conventional and next-generation washing agents. The following indices were used: modified contamination factor (mC(f)), modified contamination factor degree (mC(deg)), mobility factor (MF), reduced partition index (IR), potential ecological risk factor (E-r,E-Z), modified potential ecological risk factor (E-r,E-m), potential ecological risk index (RIZ) and modified ecological risk index (RIm). For mC(f,)mC(deg) and IR own classification scale was proposed. It was proven that most useful indices for assessment of soil pollution with metals were mC(f) and mC(deg). The mC(f )together with the IR allow to simultaneous assessment of soil pollution and stability for individual metals. These indices were appropriate for soil contaminated with different concentrations of metals, washed under both hydrodynamic conditions using various washing agents and different effectiveness of metals removal. Thus, they may be considered as most useful for evaluation of remediation method, feasibility of washing agent and assessing soil quality after washing.

AB  - Understanding the growth response of fish to varying environmental and biological conditions is important for the management and conservation of populations and communities. However, obtaining growth data at time scales shorter than those provided by annual size-at-age relationships is costly and labor intensive and can be logistically impractical. We assessed the ability of a body condition index to serve as a proxy for individual instantaneous growth rates in two species of mostly subadult stream-dwelling salmonids in southwestern Alaska. We found that relative body condition, as measured by the residuals around a length-mass regression, was strongly correlated with direct measures of individual instantaneous growth (day(-1)) from mark-recapture data. Further, body condition was significantly correlated with growth accumulated over a period of roughly 2-10 weeks in both Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus, while the relationship was typically weaker for time periods of less than 2 weeks and greater than 1 year. Despite the limitations of using body condition indices to infer the physiological status of individuals, our results demonstrate that, when applied judiciously, body condition can be used as a surrogate for recent individual instantaneous growth rate.

AB  - Vascular plants are quickly emerging as one of the best indicators of human-mediated disturbances in the environment. We developed a plant-based index of biological integrity (IBI) to evaluate headwater wetland condition in response to anthropogenic disturbances in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of central Pennsylvania. To construct the 1131, we evaluated 50 attributes of the plant community, including species richness, diversity, and evenness. Disturbance was quantified for each site using information on surrounding land use, buffer characteristics, and an assessment of potential site stressors. Ecological dose-response curves were then plotted to evaluate the relationship between each attribute and the disturbance score. Eight attributes showed a consistent and strong response to disturbance and were selected as metrics: adjusted FQAl, % cover of tolerant plant species, % annual species, % non-native species, % invasive species, % trees, % vascular cryptogams, and % cover of Phalaris arundinacea. All metrics were highly and significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with disturbance as were IBI scores. To test the IBI, we used data from 47 sites collected as part of the Juniata Wetland Monitoring Project. The metrics and 1131 scores for this data set were also significantly correlated with disturbance. Although, to date, very few plant-based IBIs are in use, studies from Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Ohio, as well as our study in Pennsylvania demonstrate the efficacy of plant community measures in assessing the overall condition of wetlands.

AB  - Status observations of roofing material degradation are constantly evolving due to urban feature heterogeneities. Although advanced classification techniques have been introduced to improve within-class impervious surface classifications, these techniques involve complex processing and high computation times. This study integrates field spectroscopy and satellite multispectral remote sensing data to generate degradation status maps of concrete and metal roofing materials. Field spectroscopy data were used as bases for selecting suitable bands for spectral index development because of the limited number of multispectral bands. Mapping methods for roof degradation status were established for metal and concrete roofing materials by developing the normalized difference concrete condition index (NDCCI) and the normalized difference metal condition index (NDMCI). Results indicate that the accuracies achieved using the spectral indices are higher than those obtained using supervised pixel-based classification. The NDCCI generated an accuracy of 84.44%, whereas the support vector machine (SVM) approach yielded an accuracy of 73.06%. The NDMCI obtained an accuracy of 94.17% compared with 62.5% for the SVM approach. These findings support the suitability of the developed spectral index methods for determining roof degradation statuses from satellite observations in heterogeneous urban environments.

AB  - 1. The variation of structural (multi-dimensional scaling plot of Bray-Curtis similarity, species number, Shannon-Weaver index, percentage coverage) and functional (Ecological State Group (ESG) I percentage coverage. ESG 11 percentage coverage, Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI)) metrics in benthic macrophyte communities was studied in two different habitats: (a) mud with submerged angiosperms (MA), and (b) mud With macroalgae (MM), in three eastern Mediterranean coastal lagoons. One lagoon was in northern Greece (Agiasma, Nestos Delta. Eastern Macedonia region) and two in south-eastern Italy (Cesine and Margherita of Savoia, Apulian region).
   2. The aim was to differentiate metric variation caused by human or natural processes and thereby to (1) select reliable metrics and (2) develop user-friendly protocols for cost-effective monitoring programmes for coastal lagoon water quality.
   3. Eight different sites dominated by macrophyte communities characterized by two angiosperms (Ruppia cirrhosa and R. maritima), two opportunistic macroalgae (Ulva sp. and Choetomorpha linum) and Cyanobacteria colonies were quantitatively and destructively sampled twice.
   4. Structural metrics showed highest heterogeneity at a local site-specific scale, while functional metrics showed highest heterogeneity at the scale of habitat. As a result the structural metrics appeared inappropriate as indicators of lagoon water quality changes. By contrast shifts of habitat dominated by angiosperms to opportunistic macroalgae owing to nutrient excess, especially nitrogen, can be identified by functional metrics., especially with EEI.

AB  - Biodiversity is rapidly declining globally and targeted efforts are needed to mitigate the loss of species. Conventional conservation efforts have focused on establishing protected areas and restoring degraded lands in order to maintain current conditions or restore ecosystems to a pre-damaged state. However, as the climate changes, the current bioclimatic zones will be re-distributed globally. Historical distribution patterns may no longer serve as an effective guide for supporting biodiversity under climate change. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a spatially explicit strategy for biodiversity conservation that takes climate change into account using bioclimatic classification. The bioclimatic classification maps of Northeast Asia (NEA) were constructed for three historical time periods (the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s) and two future time periods (the 2050s and 2070s) using five general circulation models (GCMs) in representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenarios. It was predicted that, in general, zones are shifting north, and some zones are expanding or shrinking rapidly. Based on an analysis of latitudinal and areal change for each zone, the bioclimate vulnerability index (BVI) and naturality index (NI) were developed to quantify the impact of environmental change. As a result of the BVI analysis, the distribution ofvulnerable zones is expected to shift northward and expand. As is evident with the increased vulnerability of the subarctic region caused by the expansion of the temperate climate, the extent ofvulnerable zones will increase. Also, the southern regions of NEA are becoming vulnerable due to the transformation of the temperate zone to a more subtropical zone. Quadrant graphs based on the BVI and NI were created to present appropriate strategies for each zone. Our proposed framework shows that conservation strategies should be modified based on the changes in the relative position of each zone over time.

AB  - We developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity for subtropical reservoirs to assess their ecosystem health. For this purpose, we analyzed the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and determined reservoir trophic status in the Paranapanema River system (Southeast Brazil). Eleven dams were constructed in the main course of this river to supply hydropower plants. Three of the reservoirs are accumulation systems (i.e. with high water retention times), whereas the others are run-of-the-river systems. For the study the three larger reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and Capivara) were selected. Physical, chemical, and biological (phytoplankton and zooplankton) data were obtained in two sampling campaigns carried out in March (wet season) and October (dry season) of 2011. For each reservoir we sampled six stations, arranged on a gradient established between the lotic (Paranapanema River entrance) and lentic (dam) areas. According to the Trophic State Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs, the sampling stations were categorized between ultraoligotrophic and mesotrophic. Four metrics achieved significant discrimination (out of a set of 20 candidate metrics). The individual metric scores were summed to provide a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity score, which ranged as Mesotrophic (4-9), Oligotrophic (10-14) and Ultraoligotrophic (15-20), corresponding to the classification of fair, good and excellent, respectively. Following the longitudinal sequence, Jurumirim was classified as Oligotophic (Good) and both Chavantes and Capivara as Ultraoligotrophic (Excellent). This study demonstrated that the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity is a potential tool for monitoring large subtropical reservoirs, as planktonic organisms are sensitive to environmental changes and this index integrates distinct temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Eutrophication is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, thus fostering an increase in primary productivity; it is frequently related to proliferation of harmful algae blooms and hypoxia/anoxia conditions. Eutrophication and increased anthropogenic pressure have become a phenomenon of global proportions; consequently, efforts are currently underway for their detection and control. This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variation of the Chantuto-Panzacola estuarine system, based on records of more than two decades (1990-2009) and its current physicochemical condition (2015-2016). Trophic and ecological indexes were applied and developed to tropical conditions, as well as their variation over the period of analysis. Quantification and analysis of physicochemical variables and ecological index determined that there have been changes in the annual pattern of nutrients and trophic index since 2008, mainly determined for nitrates and nitrites. However, during the last year a greater predominance of ammonium was observed. Comparing a little over 25 years, higher concentrations were obtained during the last periods in all nutrients, whose annual average concentrations increased more than 90%. Trophic index corroborated an active process of eutrophication since 2008, with an emphasis on the Chantuto, Cerritos and Panzacola lagoons, due to the constant contribution of nutrients from adjacent rivers that contribute to the increase of nitrogen and phosphorus.

AB  - The study attempts to assess the impact of the educational level of the country's population, the level of science and technology development on the general environmental environment. The aim of this article is to assess the impact of educational level and level of science development on individual elements that reflect the state of the environment. To receive the obtained results is being used the package of statistical programs STATISTICA. The intense connection between educational level and aggregated evaluation of Environment Performance Index has been established. The significant correlation was found between the education index and the ecological conditions in countries with very high, medium and low level of Human Development Index. The significant correlation between the processes of implementation of educational and science public policy and a set of environment's criteria was found. The obtained models have been proved that for underdeveloped countries investment in education and science has a more significant impact on the ecological situation than in highly developed countries. Finally, this study concluded that public policy in the area of science and education, aimed at improving the ecological situation in the country, should be differentiated depending on the level of country development.

AB  - Several studies have confirmed that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has a direct effect on tuna across a range of biological aspects, such as abundance, catchability, recruitment, and physical condition (LC), especially during winter season (NAOw). However, its effect on reproductive biology has been barely investigated. Thus, the main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the NAO on the physical condition index and gonadosomatic index (GSI) of the three most commercially exploited small species of migrating tuna (i.e. little tunny, bullet tuna, and Atlantic bonito) in the Mediterranean Sea. A positive direct correlation was found between little tunny and Atlantic bonito and the gonadosomatic and the physical condition indexes. In addition, a strong correlation was found between the NAOw and the gonadosomatic and LC indexes, which could lead to higher reproductive investment in gonad growth before the spawning season. In contrast, bullet tuna had a low LC index during peak gonad growth and were less affected by NAOw oscillations. In the case of bullet tuna, these results could be explained by a longer reproductive period that would lead to faster fat consumption before the reproductive period than in the other species considered and greater dependence on the surrounding environmental conditions for reproductive success.

AB  - This study was carried out to develop and apply a fish-based biotic integrity index to assess lowland streams in a highly deforested region of the Upper Parana River basin. Fifty-six first-order segments were randomly selected for environmental and fish evaluation. Because previous analysis had identified the main type of effect on the streams of the region as physical habitat degradation, 22 qualitatively biological attributes were selected and tested over a physical condition gradient between reference and degraded sites. Sensitivity and redundancy of each attribute revealed that five metrics were adequate for discriminating higher quality from degraded sites. Of the fifty-six streams assessed, one (2%) was classified as good, four (7%) as fair, ten (18%) as poor, and forty-one (73%) as very poor, indicating that, on a regional scale, many aspects of biological integrity are altered, indicative of serious degradation. Considering that first-order segments amount to 11,000 km in total, it is noticeable that 10,000 km of the stream segments have no more than half of the expected conditions, indicative of poor or very poor biotic integrity conditions. Possible strategies of mitigating this scenario are discussed.

AB  - Blue mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, are a widespread and ecologically important species in New Zealand coastal ecosystems, yet, there is limited information on the seasonality and variability in reproduction among populations. The reproductive cycle of M. galloprovincialis was studied monthly over 1-year in two southern New Zealand populations (Aramoana (45.7787 degrees S, 170.7037 degrees E) and Timaru (44.3905 degrees S, 171.2498 degrees E)). Tissue indices were determined, and gonads examined histologically. At both sites, males and females displayed synchronous changes in condition indices and gonad indices, with both indices generally greater in the Timaru population than in the Aramoana population. Both sampling sites presented with comparable seasonality of reproduction with spawning over spring and summer months (September to February). Gametogenic development occurred over the autumn and early-winter period (March to August). Spatial differences in reproduction coincided with differences in phytoplankton food abundance (greater in Timaru), while there were only small differences in sea temperatures between sites. This study indicates the likelihood of spatial variation in reproductive biology between M. galloprovincialis populations, even across small spatial scales (<200 km).

AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon as it often occurs in the area of Yasothon province, northeastern of Thailand. It causes effects on vegetation condition in the area. Drought information might be useful for local government to prepare for prevention and mitigation plan in the future. For this reason, the primary objective of the research was to conduct the examination of this province to find severe drought years. Firstly, the researcher needed to find Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) by analyzing monthly Landsat data acquired at different periods of time from January to December 2014, 2015, and 2016, covering 4,096 km(2). Then, the researcher needed to find relationship between VCI and monthly rainfall represented in term of space and time. As results, VCI and its relationship with monthly rainfall were congruent. VCI showed that the drought area was 33.87% or 1,387.32 km(2) of studied area in 2014, 16.24% or 665.19 km(2) of studied area in 2015 and 27.95% or 1,144.83 km(2) of studied area in 2016. Therefore, the most and the least severe drought years were 2014, 2016, and 2015 respectively.

AB  - The use of data from multiple sensors is often required to ensure data coverage and continuity, but differences in the spectral characteristics of sensors result in spectral index values being different. This study investigates spectral response function effects on 48 spectral indices for cultivated grasslands using simulated data of 10 very high spatial resolution sensors, convolved from field reflectance spectra of a grass covered dike (with varying vegetation condition). Index values for 48 indices were calculated for original narrow-band spectra and convolved data sets, and then compared. The indices Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI(2)) and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), which include the difference between the near-infrared and red bands, have values most similar to those of the original spectra across all 10 sensors (1:1 line mean R-1:1(2) > 0.960 and linear trend mean ccR(2) > 0.997). Additionally, relationships between the indices' values and two quality indicators for grass covered dikes were compared to those of the original spectra. For the soil moisture indicator, indices that ratio bands performed better across sensors than those that difference bands, while for the dike cover quality indicator, both the choice of bands and their formulation are important.

AB  - Drought is a natural hazard indicated by the decreasing of rainfall and water storage and impacting agricultural sector. Agricultural drought assessment has been used to monitor agricultural sustainability, particularly in East Java as national agricultural production center. Identification of drought characteristics - correlated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and agricultural impact on paddy fields and rice production using VHI (Vegetation Health Index) were conducted. VHI is produced by TCI (Temperature Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) derived from MODIS satellite data, LST (Land Surface Temperature) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), respectively. The results showed agricultural drought usually started in June, maximum in October and ended in November. Onset and end time drought tends to follow monsoonal rainfall pattern. El Nino 2015 showed long duration of agricultural drought (i.e. +/- 5 months), high severity (i.e. mild-extreme drought; VHI 0-40) and areal extent of drought approx. 197,343 km(2), while during La Nina 2010 the areal extent was approx. 28,685 km(2) with mild-severe drought (VHI 10-40). Impact of agricultural drought on paddy fields showed wider (smaller) areal extent in sub-round 3 (sub-round 1) from September-December (January-April). Areal extent of drought was negatively correlated with rice production (r=-0.79) which significant in 99 % confidence level.

AB  - In this study, classification trees were combined with the Water Framework Directive (WFD)-Explorer, a modular toolbox that supports integrated water management in a river basin to evaluate the impact of different restoration measures on river ecology. First, the WFD-Explorer toolbox analysed the effect of different restoration options on the abiotic river characteristics based on the water and substance balance embedded in the simulation environment. Based on these abiotic characteristics, the biological index Biological Monitoring Working Party for Vietnam was then predicted by classification trees that were trained on biological and abiotic data collected in the Du river basin in northern Vietnam. The ecological status of streams in the basin ranged from nearly pristine headwaters to severely impacted river stretches. Elimination of point sources from ore extraction and decentralised domestic wastewater treatment proved to be the most effective measures to improve the ecological condition of the Du river basin. The combination of the WFD-Explorer results with data-driven models enabled model application in a situation where expert knowledge was lacking. Consequently, this approach appeared promising for decision support in the context of river restoration and conservation management.

AB  - Regular monitoring of lakes is important to determine their ecological state and development and of key significance when deciding whether action should be taken to improve their quality, for instance by reducing the,external loading of nutrients. Imprecise or inadequate knowledge of the ecological state increases the risk of misclassification and of wrong management decisions. Based on Danish lake data, we aimed to determine temporal variations, in particular natural year-to-year differences, and to describe the uncertainty in assessing the ecological state of lakes. We analysed environmental data from ca. 350 Danish lakes (1100 lake years), including three case studies, with long-term data series (up to 24 years), with no significant changes in external nutrient loading. We used summer means of selected water chemical variables, phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes as indicators of ecological state and found considerable variations in all indicators, which could not be ascribed alone to meteorological variation. In shallow lakes, chlorophyll a concentrations exhibited large year-to-year variations, especially at TP ranging between 0.05 and 0.15 mg L-1 where the lakes may shift between a macrophyte- and a phytoplankton-dominated state. For example, chlorophyll a varied by a factor 5-10 between years and was particularly low when submerged macrophyte coverage exceeded 20% compared with lakes without macrophytes. Use of a multimetric index including four phytoplankton indicators reduced the coefficient of variation. Generally, the 95% confidence interval of ecological classification was approximately 50% lower when the assessment of ecological state was based on 4-5 years' measurements than if based on only one year's measurements. Knowledge and awareness of the uncertainty of indicators used in ecological classification are highly relevant for lake managers and policy makers when defining efficient monitoring and restoration strategies.

LA  - English
AB  - The agro-pastoral ecotone, an ecological transition zone connecting adjacent areas of agricultural planting area and grassland animal husbandry, has three features: a complex natural condition, relatively pronounced population pressure, and a fragile ecological environment. In this study, we conducted an ecosystem risk assessment in the western part of Jilin Province, China, based on multiscale and multitemporal remote sensing images and land-use data. Furthermore, we focused on land-use change from 1995 to 2015 by applying the dynamic change information survey method and carrying out a transfer track analysis. The results revealed three main findings. (1) The ecological risk index at the scale of 3 km x 3 km harbors significant spatial correlation. (2) The ecological risk index of unutilized land, forest land, and grassland is relatively high for each, and their anti-interference ability is weak, while the ecological risk index of construction land and water area is the lowest. (3) Human interference, e.g., construction activities and cultivated land occupation, is the leading factor driving the exacerbation of ecological risk and frequent land-use type conversions. At the study period's end, a trend of slight contraction in the high-risk areas was found, indicating that land-use regulation and land protection policies have had significantly positive impact upon the lands' ecological value. The overall study identified a reasonable research scale for eco-environmental risk assessment and discerned relationships between regional land-use changes through geospatial analysis. Moreover, our findings can help provide practical case study information applicable to similar regions with agro-pastoral ecotones.

AB  - Climatic changes induced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) commonly influence biological systems; however, climatic variability and multitrophic interactions within tropical latitudes remain poorly understood. We examined relationships between migrant condition and ENSO during spring migration in Costa Rica. Our study is based on correlating an ENSO index with body-condition metrics of six Nearctic-Neotropic migrant bird species during stopover in Costa Rica over a 10-year period. This study is the first to report correlations between El Nino and changes in condition of multiple migrant species. The condition of one insectivore improved, whereas two frugivores experienced reduced condition during El Nino. Our detected correlations suggest that the ENSO cycle may influence changes in migrant mass; such interactions may ultimately affect demographics of certain frugivorous and insectivorous migrant species. Potential future management considerations are discussed in light of global climate change and our findings. Received 27 January 2008, accepted 28 April 2009.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) are widely used for assessing ecosystem condition and they have been developed for a variety of biological assemblages. However, when multiple assemblages are assessed at sites, the assessment results may differ because of differing physiological sensitivities to particular stressor gradients, different organism size and guilds, and the effects of different scales of disturbances on the assemblages. Those differences create problems for managers seeking to avoid type-1 and type-2 statistical errors. To alleviate those problems, we used an anthropogenic disturbance index for selecting and weighting metrics, modeled metrics against natural variability to reduce the natural variability in metrics, and developed an MMI based on both fish and aquatic insect metrics. We evaluated eight different ways of calibrating and combining candidate metrics and found that MMIs with unweighted and modeled aquatic insect and fish metrics were the preferred MMI options.

AB  - Structural characteristics of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in mountain watercourses of different sizes have been studied in the Upper Ob basin. It has been found that species richness, diversity of zoobenthos, and most biotic indices in the background areas increase in the series from the smallest watercourses to large rivers. On the contrary, the values of the above parameters in areas polluted with mercury has proved to decrease, thereby indicating a significant transformation of the benthic communities. Approaches are proposed to select reference indices for assessing the ecological state of watercourses in the basin with regard to the size of the river, the structure of benthic communities, and variability of biotic indices along the background cross sections.

AB  - Understanding biological processes, such as growth, is crucial to development management and sustainability plans for bivalve populations. Von Bertalanffy and Gompertz models have been commonly used to fit bivalve growth. These models assume that individual growth is only determined by size, overlooking the effects of environmental and intrinsic conditions on growth patterns. The comparison between classical models and nonparametric GAM (generalized additive models) fits conducted in this work shows that the latter provide a more realistic approach of mussel growth measured in terms of shell length, and dry weight of hard and soft tissues. GAM fits detected a reduction in growth during the cold season, under unfavourable nutritional conditions. These fits also captured the decoupling between hard and soft tissue growth, widely addressed in the literature but not incorporated in growth models. In addition a GAM fit of condition index allowed us to explain annual changes in resources allocation, identifying the asymptotic growth of shell and the effects of the reproductive cycle on soft tissue fluctuations.

AB  - Indicator species (IS) are used to monitor environmental changes, assess the efficacy of management, and provide warning signals for impending ecological shifts. Though widely adopted in recent years by ecologists, conservation biologists, and environmental practitioners, the use of IS has been criticized for several reasons, notably the lack of justification behind the choice of any given indicator. In this review, we assess how ecologists have selected, used, and evaluated the performance of the indicator species. We reviewed all articles published in Ecological Indicators (El) between January 2001 and December 2014, focusing on the number of indicators used (one or more); common taxa employed; terminology, application, and rationale behind selection criteria; and performance assessment methods. Over the last 14 years, 1914 scientific papers were published in El, describing studies conducted in 53 countries on six continents; of these, 817 (43%) used biological organisms as indicators. Terms used to describe organisms in IS research included "ecological index", "environmental index", "indicator species", "bioindicator", and "biomonitor," but these and other terms often were not clearly defined. Twenty percent of IS publications used only a single species as an indicator; the remainder used groups of species as indicators. Nearly 50% of the taxa used as indicators were animals, 70% of which were invertebrates. The most common applications behind the use of IS were to: monitor ecosystem or environmental health and integrity (42%); assess habitat restoration (18%); and assess effects of pollution and contamination (18%). Indicators were chosen most frequently based on previously cited research (40%), local abundance (5%), ecological significance and/or conservation status (13%), or a combination of two or more of these reasons (25%). Surprisingly, 17% of the reviewed papers cited no clear justification for their choice of indicator. The vast majority (99%) of publications used statistical methods to assess the performance of the selected indicators. This review not only improves our understanding of the current uses and applications of IS, but will also inform practitioners about how to better select and evaluate ecological indicators when conducting future IS research.

AB  - Ecological security plays a crucial role in the sustainable development of urban agglomeration, where high population and economic density brings great pressure on eco-system. This paper selected six indicators to build an ecological security index (ESI), and constructed a system dynamics (SD) model to simulate and forecast its future scenarios. It aims at establishing the nexus among the socio-economic and ecological indicators, and identifying the key driving factors of ESI. Taking Beijing?Tianjin?Hebei urban agglomeration (BTH) as a case, this paper assessed the historical situation in 2000?2015 and forecasted the future scenarios in 2016?2030. The results show that, the ESI of BTH decreased from 0.665 in 2000 to 0.648 in 2015. It will decrease to 0.632 in 2030 if the existing development mode continues. Though it belonged to the higher security level all along, obvious disparities will exist in 13 cities in BTH according to the spatiotemporal variations of ESI and its six indicators. Low guarantee degree of eco-water use and fragile ecosystem will be the primary risks of BTH all along. As the existing development mode has considered the socio-economic benefits and ecological protection, it is rational to continue for the whole BTH. However, especially in the southeast cities, the ecological development mode should be strengthened. This paper provides a framework to assess the current conditions and forecast the future scenarios of ecological security for urban agglomerations. It also might help to explore the coupling mechanism between human and ecological system.

AB  - Present study intends to quantify change of natural vegetation cover (mainly of mangrove forest) in Sundarbans Island between the time span of 2004-2010, when sustained efforts of a forestation and conservation has been in vogue. Vegetation indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI) have been used to decipher the measure of vegetation cover in this island and its changes during the period. Radiometric normalization technique is used to nullify various imaging condition anomalies while comparing multi-temporal data for change detection analysis. TDVI has been found to be more effective in vegetation cover change detection in such deltaic environment. Present study shows an overall net increase of vegetation cover in the island as a result of sustained conservation and plantation efforts.

AB  - This paper reviews the ecological environment protection measures of Chinese rural hydropower development schemes. China's rapid economic growth is making great energy demands and developing rural hydropower currently provides 30.4 GW annually. There is a conflict of interest between hydropower development and ecological and environmental protection. Potential problems include changes in hydrological condition, eutrophication, downstream nutrient reduction, sediment deposition, aquatic ecosystem alteration, and ecological water demand variation. Since most of the rural hydropower resources are located in ecologically fragile regions, it is significantly more important that ecological environment protection is being considered. As exploitation of rural hydropower has developed in China, ecological environment protection schemes had to adapt to changing boundary conditions. Due to improvements in environmental protection management, various environmental impact assessment methods have been applied including fuzzy analysis hierarchy process, ecological scheduling, pressure-state-response, and ecological environment evaluation index. The latter index can both qualitatively and quantitatively analyze ecological environment impacts and has become the most frequently used tool in the evaluation of rural hydropower exploitation. To rebalance the interests regarding energy generation and environmental protection, countermeasures originating from different aspects such as engineering design optimization, management improvement, and ecological restoration were recommended to promote ecological environment protection. The review concludes that by taking ecological environment protection into consideration in the whole rural hydropower plan, adopting ecological scheduling to guarantee river ecological water demand and implementing ecological restoration in watershed management are the most effective approaches in furthering sustainable development of rural hydropower.

AB  - The benthic macrofauna. of the Bay of Muggia and its evolution in time was analysed in order to assess the impact of man-made pollution in this port area. The north and NE zones are totally industrialised while the southern zone is mainly used for tourism and aquaculture. The most important anthropic impacts were stagnation and direct urban and industrial discharges, which operated until the beginning of the 1990s. Forty-four stations were sampled in 1981, 12 of which were monitored over time (1975, 1981 and 1994). From 172 taxa 11 783 organisms were identified. Polychaetes were the richest group, followed by molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. The dominant species was Corbula gibba (39.5%) followed by Pectinaria koreni (9%). Uni- and multivariate analyses showed a declining pattern for the fauna along a gradient of environmental stress. The very high concentrations of heavy metals in the Bay's sediments, especially Pb, contrasted with the diversity and biological index values found, indicating that many species could survive these conditions. The enforcement of the Italian ecological laws regarding water pollution control benefited the local macrofauna and evidenced the resilience of the system. C gibba constituted a good biological indicator of zones of high instability (especially sedimentary) and of intermediate levels of pollution. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine zones are used by fish as nursery, spawning and feeding grounds. However, these essential habitats are characterized by the presence of both natural and anthropogenic stressors that may represent potential threats for the wellbeing of aquatic organisms, particularly fish. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and understand the effects of environmental stressors, both natural and anthropogenic, on coastal fish species using Ramnogaster arcuata as bioindicator. Fish were captured in two zones with different human activity levels: a highly impacted zone in Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE) and a lightly impacted zone in the adjacent coastal zone (ACZ). Various indicators were used to determine fish responses to environmental stress. Main differences found between fishes from the two zones were in the condition index, trophic ecology (including feeding activity and diet composition) and liver metabolic biomarkers (ALT/AST enzymes, protein levels and lipid peroxidation). On the other hand, metal concentration levels analyzed in muscle did not show important differences between both environments. Physiological responses of R. arcuata from both zones were strongly correlated with natural stressors.

AB  - Human activities have altered estuarine environments leading to increased presence of different pollutants including metals. Although the implementation of new environmental policies has caused a considerable decrease in trace metal concentrations in estuaries around the Bay of Biscay, some elements such as copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) are still present in relatively high concentrations. Oysters have been widely used in environmental biomonitoring programs as sentinel organisms. Oysters Crassostrea gigas from an uncontaminated estuary were exposed to sublethal, environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu (2000 ng Cu/L) and Ag (500 ng Ag/L) during 14 days in brackish water (S = 18). A battery of cell and tissue level (exposure) biomarkers at different levels of biological complexity was applied and integrated into the Integrative Biological Response (IBR) index including: metallothionein contents, intralysosomal metal accumulation, digestive gland atrophy and digestive gland tissue integrity. Condition Index (CI) was incorporated into the IBR index as a complementary parameter that reflects the general physiological condition of oysters (organism level). Results indicated an increase in intralysosomal metal accumulation after 7 and 14 days of exposure to Ag together with an increase in the digestive epithelium atrophy and lipofuscin content after 7 days of exposure to Ag. The responses detected with the aid of biomarkers integrated in the IBR index showed higher toxicity in oysters exposed to Ag, inducing the dear onset of detoxification processes which also occurred, to a lower extent, in Cu exposed oysters.

AB  - Prediction of soil organic C sequestration with adoption of various conservation agricultural management approaches is needed to meet the emerging market for environmental services provided by agricultural land stewardship. The soil conditioning index (SCI) is a relatively simple model used by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service to predict qualitative changes in soil organic matter. Our objective was to develop a quantitative relationship between soil organic C derived from published field studies in the southeastern USA and SCI scores predicted from matching management conditions. We found that soil organic C sequestration (at 20 +/- 5 cm depth) could be reliably related to SCI across a diversity of studies in the region using the regression slope: 1.65 Mg C ha(-1) SCI-1 [which translated into a rate of 0.25 +/- 0.04 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) SCI-1 (mean +/- standard error of 31 slope estimates)]. The calibration of soil organic C on SCI scores will allow SCI to become a quantitative tool for natural resource professionals to predict soil organic C sequestration for farmers wanting to adopt conservation practices.

AB  - The condition of the semi-arid Borana rangeland in southern Ethiopia was assessed by studying different land-use systems (communal land, a government ranch and a traditional grazing reserve enclosure) and along a distance gradient (near, middle and far) from water sources. The assessment incorporated the soil, herbaceous and woody plant layers. Two methods were employed to evaluate the grass layer, viz. ecological condition index (ECI) and weighted palatability composition (WPC). The ECI on the government ranch was 21.7% and 26% greater than that of the traditional reserve and the communal land, respectively. The WPC on the government ranch was 83.3% and 48.6% greater than that of the communal area and the traditional reserve, respectively. Both ECI and WPC values were similar for all distance sites from water. Tree equivalent (TE) density, of all encroaching woody plants combined, was higher on the communal land (504 TE ha(-1)) than the government ranch (373 TE ha-1) and traditional grazing reserve (118 TEha(-1)), but with no marked variations in the distance sites from water. Height class distribution of encroaching woody plants in the study areas showed the largest abundance (range: > 50-100%) at the height class > 0-2 in. Tree equivalents per hectare of encroaching woody plants were negatively correlated (r = -0.60) with ECI and WPC and positively correlated (r = 0.87) with percentage bare ground. The correlation (r = 0.50) between percentage bare ground and soil compaction was positive and low. Although the government ranch had a greater composition of highly palatable grass species than the other land uses, the rangeland was not in good condition due to severe bush encroachment. The communal land was generally in poor condition. In the traditional grazing reserve, bush encroachment was not a problem, but the productivity of the grass layer was poor when assessed on the basis of ecological and palatability merits. The negative interaction of TE density of all encroaching woody plants combined with ECI or WPC and the positive interaction with bare ground, may suggest that the abundance of these species is more critical in aggravating deterioration in grassland productivity. Therefore, the priority of any bush control program must be towards minimizing the abundance of these woody plants. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Copper is released into the aquatic environment as a consequence of anthropogenic activities such as mining and runoffs of copper-containing pesticides and fertilisers. This may pose a threat to the health of the organisms inhabiting coastal water bodies or estuaries. The present study was therefore carried out to assess the toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of copper in the estuarine backwater clamMeretrix casta. In the experimental setup, clams were exposed to five concentrations of CuCl2(0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mu g/L) for 15 days in water. Biomarkers of genotoxicity (Micronucleus test and comet assay), oxidative stress (Catalase and malondialdehyde assays), acetylcholinesterase activity and condition index were employed to study the effects of copper on the clams. Genotoxicity, oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase activity and condition index were found to be non-significant in all the concentration groups indicating that such low concentrations of copper were unable to induce any toxic response. However, using the Integrated Biomarker Response index, a concentration-dependent increase was observed indicating that the integration of these biomarker responses could give information on early signs of copper contamination in aquatic habitats.Meretrix castacould potentially be used as a sentinel species for monitoring copper contamination in the estuarine environment.

AB  - Increasingly in the last decade biological monitoring and assessment have been used by federal and state agencies to assess water quality standards as required under the Clean Water Act. These efforts have led to the development of indices of biological integrity (often referred to as IBIs). Many states have created multi-metric indices, incorporating individual metrics into a quantitative value of community condition or biological integrity. The primary objective of this study was to develop the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI) as a tool to evaluate the biological integrity of Florida depressional freshwater forested wetlands.
   Vegetative community composition and chemical and physical water and soil parameters were measured at 118 wetlands throughout Florida. An independent measure of the human disturbance gradient, the Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, which is based on the use of nonrenewable energy within a 100 m buffer around a wetland, was calculated. Six macrophyte community composition metrics were selected for inclusion in the FWCI based on the strength of correlation with LDI (P < 0.01) and differentiation between low (LDI >= 2.0) and high (LDI >= 2.0) LDIgroups (P < 0.01). The metrics included tolerant indicator species, sensitive indicator species, exotic species, floristic quality assessment index, native perennial species, and wetland status species. Metrics were scaled between 0 and 10, with 10 representing the reference wetland condition (correlating to wetlands in undeveloped landscapes). Scaled metrics were then added together to create the FWCI, with values ranging from 0 to 60. The FWCI was significantly correlated with LDI (P < 0.001), and significantly differentiated among sample wetlands categorized by low and high LDI groups (P < 0.001). In addition, significant correlations were found among the six metrics, FWCl, and LDI with measured chemical and physical water and soil parameters, including water column pH, turbidity, ammonia-nitrogen concentration, and total phosphorus concentration, and soil moisture, organic matter, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentration. The primary efficacy of the FWCI was the calculation of a quantitative value of biological integrity for wetlands across a gradient of anthropogenic land use activities, which can be used objectively to assess water quality standards of Florida wetlands.

AB  - Climatic and edaphic conditions in the Amazon basin are ideal for the cultivation of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), this has led to a major expansion in plantations in recent years, to the point where oil palm cultivation has become one of the main threats to biodiversity in this biome. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oil palm crops on the integrity of freshwater environments and assess the response of aquatic assemblages. A set of 244 environmental metrics were measured at 22 Amazonian streams, either reference sites located in natural forest or oil palm plantation sites. We developed an aquatic environment integrity index for these sites. Biological sampling consisted of the collection of specimens of aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteropteran species. From environmental variables dataset, some were evaluated and five were screened to assess the environments and employed in the streams abiotic integrity index (SAII) to these environments. The SAII proved an excellent for assessing aquatic environments and assaying changes in the freshwater habitats (forest and oil palm) analysed in this study. The forest streams had higher environmental integrity than the plantation streams. Environmental integrity was associated with Heteropteran species richness, although not to abundance of individual species. These results are consistent with previous research on the effects of oil palm crops on aquatic habitats, which showed that the greatest impact was on factors associated with the structure of the riparian zone. These findings should inform development of a strategy to mitigate or minimise the environmental problems caused by ongoing expansion of oil palm plantations in the Amazon basin, in order to safeguard the region's aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Inland freshwater shallow lake ecosystem degradation is indistinctly intertwined with human-induced factors and climate variability. Changes in climate and human-induced factors significantly influence the state of lake ecosystems. This study provides evidence of the driver, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR) indicators for freshwater lake ecosystem dynamics, taking Lake Malombe in Malawi as a case study. We used the DPSIR framework and Tobit model to achieve the study's objectives. The study's findings indicate that top-down processes gradually erode Lake Malombe's ecosystem state. The lake resilience is falling away from its natural state due to increasing rates of drivers, pressures, and impacts, indicating the lake ecosystem's deterioration. The study shows that demographic, socio-economic, climatic drivers, pressures, state, and responses significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the lake ecosystem's resilience. The study suggests that substantial freshwater ecosystem management under the current scenario requires a long-term, robust, and sustainable management plan. The findings from this study provide a roadmap for short-term and long-term practical policy-focused responses, particularly in implementing a freshwater ecosystem restoration programs in Malawi and Africa more broadly.

AB  - Populations of commercially important bivalves along the coast of Portugal are depleted as a consequence of natural and anthropogenic causes. A pilot experiment was designed to determine the feasibility of transplanting individuals from natural clam beds to a closed fishing area in an effort to rebuild relatively high-density patches of Spisula solida. For this purpose, clams were equally partitioned into two groups (undersize and legal clams) and transplanted at a density of 40 clams m(-2) into two areas 50 m(2). Transplanted and control clams were sampled to estimate survival, condition index, biochemical composition, and reproductive condition. Generally, the physiological condition of clams was not affected by the method of transplanting. One year after transplanting, survival was 45%. The increase in local abundance of mature clams should facilitate successful fertilization and increase the residual reproductive value of each clam relative to its pre-transplant value. Transplanting undersize clams may be more advantageous because they are more likely to spawn at least once before harvest. The experiments demonstrate that spawner transplants may strengthen S. solida populations and can be used in stock-enhancement programmes which, in conjunction with effective management measures, can contribute to the sustainability of the S. solida fishery.

AB  - Introduction. Assessment of the ecological status of lakes is important for their conservation and protection. Many lakes are intensively used in recreation in Volyn Region. The development of the resort and recreational facilities requires significant additional volumes of fresh water to maintain the depth of the reservoirs in the bathing area, certain sanitary and temperature regimes of the reservoirs. The limiting factors are the sanitary and hygienic indicators of water. First and foremost, high quality of water should be provided for the organization of contact types of recreation (bathing, diving, water skiing, etc.).
   The purpose of article. The purpose of the article is ecological assessment of water quality in various lakes of Volyn Region, which are most intensively used in recreation.
   Methods. Research methods are expeditionary, methods of mathematical statistics and environmental assessment of water quality, which were carried out in accordance with the methodology for assessing the quality of surface water in the respective categories. During the preparation of the article, materials from their own expeditionary studies of the natural-economic state of the lakes were used, as well as the results of chemical analysis of the water composition conducted by the Water and Soil Monitoring Laboratory of the Regional Water Resources Office in Volyn Region and the Complex Laboratory for Observation of the Environmental Environmental Center.
   Results. The analysis of the qualitative indicators of the lakes Svitiaz, Velyke Zgoranske and Somyn showed the high quality of water in the lakes. For the period of 2015-2019, water quality was classified as,good" class II, by degree of cleanliness,clean", by category as,very good", by degree of cleanliness,clean" on all lakes. The value of IE for the Lake Velyke Zgoranske varied in the range of 1.81-2.44, in the range of 1.66-2.07 for the Lake Svitiaz, and in the range of 2.56-2.96 for the Lake Somyn. Index chi(2) (ecological and sanitary indicators) has the most influence on the magnitude of the ecological index of water quality.
   The scientific novelty lies in establishing block and integral indexes of ecological assessment of water quality, classes and categories of water quality of the most recreationally-developed lakes of Volyn Region, as well as in assessment of the dynamics of indicators of water quality of lakes during the years of 2015-19.
   Practical significance is defined with the opportunity of development of a set of measures for the rational use and protection of lakes.

AB  - Models for prediction of site index (SI) typically include only abiotic causal variables (e.g., soil) and lack biotic response variables (e.g., vegetation), which could exhibit greater sensitivity to important environmental factors affecting tree height growth. Our study objective was to evaluate Whittaker's moisture condition index (MCI) (R.H. Whittaker. 1956. Ecol. Monogr. 26: 1-80) as a potential biotic variable for inclusion with conventional abiotic variables in oak (Quercus L.) SI prediction models. The MCI is the sum of relative abundances of inventoried plot tree species weighted by their moisture affinity classification. We compared regression parameters of conventional base models including only abiotic variables with exploratory models configured with abiotic variables and MCI for explaining variation of SI. The best abiotic model included only aspect. When MCI was included in the abiotic model, aspect became insignificant, resulting in a single-variable biotic model that accounted for increased SI variation. The MCI biotic model remained significant when tested with independent data from a distant location. The MCI is easily calculated using plot inventory data, and with further evaluation, it may be confirmed as a useful biotic variable in combination with abiotic soil and topographic variables for prediction of oak SI.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, the Cerrado has been experiencing various antropic impacts that have brought about alterations to species composition, structure and functioning of aquatic habitats. Therefore, studies on negative impacts are useful to prevent future damage and restore environmental quality. The objectives of our study were: i) to adapt an index of biotic integrity of streams in the Rio Cuiaba Basin and ii) to analyze if the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) correlated with the environmental quality measured by the Index of Environmental Quality (IEQ) and with the mesohabitat structure. We sampled 26 streams in sub-basins of the Cuiaba River. In each stream, we closed a stretch of 50 m with blockage nets and used electrofishing to capture fish. To obtain a measure of environmental quality in sampled units, we characterized the stream and its micro basin. For the analyses, we used the Spearman Correlation, Kruskal-Wallis test and Analysis of Multiple Regression. We collected 697 individuals distributed into 6 orders, 15 families and 49 species. The IBI followed changes on environmental quality measured by IEQ when we removed streams that present natural barriers from the analysis (r(2) = 0.4; r(2) = 0.58). Types of land use did not affect the biotic integrity (n = 26; df = 4; H = 4,860; p = 0.302), but natural and artificial barriers affected it (n = 26; df = 4; H = 11,027; p = 0.026). The IBI was not sensitive to variations in mesohabitat structure (F-2,F-23 = 0.373; r(2) = 0.031; Axe 1 p = 0.620; Axe 2 p = 0.490). The IBI is certainly a reasonable instrument for evaluating changes in the environment, but we cannot ignore the fact that we were able to obtain the same result with any combinations of metrics. This makes its analysis and interpretation difficult.

TI  - Crime risk in urban neighbourhoods: the use of insurance data to analyse changing spatial forms
T2  - AREA
LA  - English
AB  - The recent British Crime Surveys have confirmed that there are significant spatial variations in the distribution of crime risk. However, it is notoriously difficult to represent the spatial patterns in Britain convincingly owing to the statistical inadequacy of the official crime data. This paper discusses the use of home contents insurance data as a proxy measure of crime risk, and examines the changing spatial distribution of crime risk in the two Northern conurbations of Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The analysis provides an explicit urban focus in order to establish links between the spatial distribution of crime risk and other patterns of deprivation or inequality in the urban environment. Since insurance data is used as a proxy measure of crime risk in the Department of the Environment's Index of Local Conditions, this analysis serves as an interesting basis for both academic and policy discussion.

AB  - A multimetric, fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was developed and tested to assess the ecological status of streams with different riparian conditions in the Piracicaba River Basin. Nine streams with three categories of riparian zone preservation were selected: native forest (NF) with preserved forest, secondary forest (SF) with forest in an advanced state of regeneration and surrounded by sugarcane plantations, and sugarcane (SC) without riparian vegetation and surrounded by SC crops. A continuous scoring system was employed, and candidate metrics were tested for range, responsiveness, and redundancy, resulting in the selection of eight metrics to compose the index. The final IBI score was positively correlated with an Environmental Index both in the dry (Spearman's rho = 0.76; P = 0.01) and rainy seasons (Spearman's rho = 0.66; P = 0.04), suggesting that this IBI is a suitable tool for the assessment of the biological conditions of these streams. The highest IBI values were observed in the rainy season at the NF and SF sites, with significant differences between the NF and SC sites (Kruskal-Wallis test: P = 0.03). The results indicated some variability in the biological integrity at SF and SC sites, suggesting a relationship with the intensity of the management of this crop. Patterns were consistent with other studies that have shown the effects of agriculture on the environmental quality of streams, which indicate the importance of the riparian zone to the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and supports the use of the IBI for biological monitoring in similar regions.

AB  - A new index of ecological status, named Mesophotic Assemblages Ecological Status (MAES) index, was elaborated on the basis of ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) photography and video footage in order to assess the status of mesophotic megabenthic assemblages from hard bottom. The index was tested on seven sites located between 50 and 150 m depth in the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas (western Mediterranean Sea). The MAES index considers three main parameters: (i) the community structure (number of megabenthic taxa, percent biotic cover in the basal layer, density of erect species); (ii) the condition of the dominant erect species (average height, percent of colonies with epibiosis/necrosis); (iii) the visible human impact (density of marine litter, including lost fishing gears). Two versions of the index have been elaborated, the complete version (MAES) and the quick version (q-MAES), which showed comparable results, therefore suggesting the possibility of fastening assessment times. The sensitivity of the MAES index was correlated with the putative human pressure acting upon the site (semi-quantitatively assessed considering fishing effort and coastal urbanization). A standard working protocol related to the evaluation of the MAES index is here proposed with the intent to create an effective monitoring tool for the assessment of the ecological status of mesophotic assemblages on a large scale, as required by the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. MAES index will enhance the comprehension of the dynamics of mesophotic Mediterranean megabenthic assemblages with respect to human pressures and will also provide marine scientists and managers with a valuable tool specifically designed for the conservation of such vulnerable marine ecosystems.

AB  - Numerous studies have stated that land use in urbanized areas can adversely affect water quality of streams. Previous studies reported that edges may play important roles in controlling flow rate of material in two systems. In this study, we examined the mediating effects of streamline geometry on the relationships between urban land use and the index of biological integrity (IBI) of the Nakdong River in Korea. Two mediation models with streamline geometry, including the partial mediation effect model and the full mediation effect model, were estimated to explore the mediating effect of streamline geometry. To measure streamline geometry, we calculated the fractal dimension of a streamline within a 1 km buffer from the sampling sites. The proportion of urban land use within a 5 km buffer of the sampling sites was also computed by GIS. We used biological assessment data from the National Aquatic Ecological Monitoring Program in Korea to delineate the IBI at the sampling sites. The results showed that urban land use significantly degraded stream morphology and IBI in the Nakdong River. It was also observed that streamline geometry mediated the influence of urban land use on the IBI. The results of structural equation modeling analysis for the two mediation models with the fractal dimension and IBI suggested that only two paths were significant in the partial mediation model, whereas all paths were significant in the estimated full mediation model.

AB  - A persistent question among ecologists and environmental managers is whether constructed wetlands are structurally or functionally equivalent to naturally occurring wetlands. We examined 19 variables collected from 10 constructed and nine natural emergent wetlands in Ohio, USA. Our primary objective was to identify candidate indicators of wetland class (natural or constructed), based on measurements of soil properties and an index of vegetation integrity, that can be used to track the progress of constructed wetlands toward a natural state. The method of nearest shrunken centroids was used to find a subset of variables that would serve as the best classifiers of wetland class, and error rate was calculated using a five-fold cross-validation procedure. The shrunken differences of percent total organic carbon (% TOC) and percent dry weight of the soil exhibited the greatest distances from the overall centroid. Classification based on these two variables yielded a misclassification rate of 11 % based on cross-validation. Our results indicate that % TOC and percent dry weight can be used as candidate indicators of the status of emergent, constructed wetlands in Ohio and for assessing the performance of mitigation. The method of nearest shrunken centroids has excellent potential for further applications in ecology.

AB  - Drought is one of the most complex natural hazards because of its slow onset and long-term impact; it has the potential to negatively affect many people. There are several advantages to using remote sensing to monitor drought, especially in developing countries with limited historical meteorological records and a low weather station density. In the present study, we assessed agricultural drought in the croplands of the BioBio Region in Chile. The vegetation condition index (VCI) allows identifying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation conditions associated with stress because of rainfall deficit. The VCI was derived at a 250 m spatial resolution for the 2000-2015 period with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 product. We evaluated VCI for cropland areas using the land cover MCD12Q1 version 5.1 product and compared it to the in situ Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for six-time scales (1-6 months) from 26 weather stations. Results showed that the 3-month SPI (SPI-3), calculated for the modified growing season (November-April) instead of the regular growing season (September-April), has the best Pearson correlation with VCI values with an overall correlation of 0.63 and between 0.40 and 0.78 for the administrative units. These results show a very short-term vegetation response to rainfall deficit in September, which is reflected in the vegetation in November, and also explains to a large degree the variation in vegetation stress. It is shown that for the last 16 years in the BioBio Region we could identify the 2007/2008, 2008/2009, and 2014/2015 seasons as the three most important drought events; this is reflected in both the overall regional and administrative unit analyses. These results concur with drought emergencies declared by the regional government. Future studies are needed to associate the remote sensing values observed at high resolution (250 m) with the measured crop yield to identify more detailed individual crop responses.

AB  - The objective was to develop a Minnesota aquatic macrophyte integrity index that can use plant checklist data from existing and ongoing lake plant survey programs without alteration. Using the extensive lake survey data collected by numerous state programs, we created a suite of predictive models for macrophyte richness and floristic quality and identified aquatic macrophyte community outliers to set potential impairment thresholds. The highest-ranked predictive models included total phosphorus, disturbance indices, and ecoregion variables. Models with all in-lake macrophyte taxa generally performed better than those based on just submerged aquatic macrophyte or those based on submerged and floating-leaf taxa. The best generalized linear mixed model for aquatic macrophyte richness was a model containing total phosphorus, alkalinity, lake size, maximum depth, ecoregion, survey type, and several interactions. The best linear mixed effects model for floristic quality also included these predictive variables. Richness and floristic quality thresholds were calculated using these models with associated disturbance-response breakpoints. The approach took sampling protocol into account by providing different thresholds based on sample design. These thresholds then identify potentially biologically impaired lakes. There appeared to be no disturbance-response breakpoints between aquatic macrophyte richness and floristic quality for the Northern Lakes and Forest ecoregion of northeastern Minnesota.

AB  - Fish feed waste enhancement of the particulate food supply and performance of mussels Mytilus edulis suspended near salmon cages at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site was assessed using a multi-indicator approach. Dietary indicators included bulk measurements of seston quantity and nutritional quality, proximate analysis (PA), fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) composition. Mussel tissue indicators consisted of PA and FA composition. Mussel performance was assessed from physiological integrations (scope for growth, SFG), growth efficiency (K-2) and condition index (Cl). All measurements were made over 2 days at a commercial IMTA farm and a monoculture mussel farm in the Bay of Fundy (Canada). Significant differences detected in seston quantity and quality were within the range of natural spatial variability. The SFG of IMTA mussels was lower (28.71 Jh(-1)) than monoculture mussels (38.71 Jh(-1)) and reflected site differences in natural food availability and composition that affected absorption rate. PA of mussel organs didn't reflect a significant fish feed contribution to the mussel diet. However, dietary enhancement and assimilation of fish feed waste was demonstrated by significantly higher levels of feed FA biomarkers 20:1 omega 9, 18:2 omega 6, 18:1 omega 9 and low omega 3/omega 6 ratio in seston, mussel tissues and feces at the IMTA site than at the mussel farm. SI (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in seston and mussel feces significantly differed among sites and IMTA mussels had significantly higher CI (21%) than monoculture individuals (16%). It was concluded that bulk indicators of the diet, short-term physiological integrations, and PA of mussel tissues have a limited capacity to detect dietary enhancement at IMTA sites. FA and SI tracers of fish feed waste were shown to be more sensitive for detecting the low-levels of diet enhancement within the large range of natural seston variation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rates of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss are alarming and current conservation efforts are not sufficient to stop them. The need for new tools is urgent. One approach is biodiversity offsetting: a developer causing habitat degradation provides an improvement in biodiversity so that the lost ecological value is compensated for. Accurate and ecologically meaningful measurement of losses and estimation of gains are essential in reaching the no net loss goal or any other desired outcome of biodiversity offsetting. The chosen calculation method strongly influences biodiversity outcomes. We compare a multiplicative method, which is based on a habitat condition index developed for measuring the state of ecosystems in Finland to two alternative approaches for building a calculation method: an additive function and a simpler matrix tool. We examine the different logic of each method by comparing the resulting trade ratios and examine the costs of offsetting for developers, which allows us to compare the cost-effectiveness of different types of offsets. The results show that the outcomes of the calculation methods differ in many aspects. The matrix approach is not able to consider small changes in the ecological state. The additive method gives always higher biodiversity values compared to the multiplicative method. The multiplicative method tends to require larger trade ratios than the additive method when trade ratios are larger than one. Using scoring intervals instead of using continuous components may increase the difference between the methods. In addition, the calculation methods have differences in dealing with the issue of substitutability.

KW  - BIOTIC INTEGRITY
AB  - An existing index of biotic integrity (IBI) for Vermont streams performed poorly in assessing coldwater streams with fewer than five species. A coldwater IBI (CWIBI) for these small streams was subsequently devised that effectively measures the integrity of fish assemblages containing two to four species. Fourteen candidate metrics were tested on eighteen least-disturbed stream sites and eleven degraded sites. Impacts to streams that were assessed included mostly physical habitat degradation with some experiencing acid mine drainage. Metrics were evaluated for sensitivity to impact and redundancy. Six were selected for final inclusion into the CWIBI. In composite, the metrics clearly reflected the widely observed shift from brook trout and slimy sculpin-dominated assemblages in least-degraded streams, to minnow-sucker based assemblages with increasing degradation.

AB  - Climate Forecast System, version 2, predictions of monthly U.S. severe thunderstorm activity are analyzed for the period 1982-2016. Forecasts are based on a tornado environmental index and a hail environmental index, which are functions of monthly averaged storm relative helicity (SRH), convective precipitation (cPrcp), and convective available potential energy (CAPE). Overall, forecast indices reproduce well the annual cycle of tornado and hail events. Forecast index biases are mostly negative and caused by environment values that are low east of the Rockies, although forecast CAPE is higher than the reanalysis values over the High Plains. Skill is diagnosed spatially for the indices and their constituents separately. SRHis more skillfully forecast than cPrcp and CAPE, especially during December-June. The spatial patterns of forecast skill for CAPE and cPrcp are similar, with higher skill for CAPE and less spatial coherence for cPrcp. The indices are forecast with substantially less skill than the environmental parameters. Numbers of tornado and hail events are forecast with modest but statistically significant skill in some NOAA regions and months of the year. Skill tends to be relatively higher for hail events and in climatologically active seasons and regions. Much of the monthly skill appears to be derived from the first 2 weeks of the forecast. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates forecasts and, to a lesser extent, forecast skill, during March-May, with more activity and higher skill during cool ENSO conditions.

AB  - DNA damage was evaluated in the haemolymph of Mytilus galloprovincialis from nine sites along the south coast of Portugal using the comet assay. DNA damage was low, in the same range of sites considered to suffer low impact from genotoxic contaminants. Even so, differences between sites, seasons and genders were found. Highest values were in mussels from the main estuaries and the fishery harbour, reflecting higher genotoxin levels, whereas the lowest values can be used as a baseline for future work. Non-contaminant related factors (e. g. temperature and oxygen) were also shown to influence DNA damage. Between seasons, highest values were in summer related not only to the increase of tourism in this region (similar to 10-fold), but also to temperature. Between genders, males were found to be more sensitive. The condition index was also generally higher in summer. Lipid peroxidation, another damage biomarker, was measured in gills to assess if there is any association between the responses of both biomarkers and if they are similarly affected by the same environmental conditions. LPO like DNA damage was higher in summer. This work confirms that DNA damage is a sensitive biomarker to discriminate genotoxic contamination, even in areas considered to suffer low impact from genotoxins.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the physiological parameters of reproduction (sex ratio and gametogenic cycle), parasitism and biological indices (condition index and gonadal index) in Donax trunculus. Samples were collected monthly over two years (from 2016 to 2017) from three sites along the coast of Taghazout (in Southern Morocco) hosting the tourist resort Taghazout Bay. Five stages were depicted by histological examination of gonads: undifferentiated, developing, mature, spawning, and spent. The results of this histological study of the gonads of D. trunculus show that the reproductive cycle of this species has two periods: the first one is characterized by high sexual activity and extends from February to June and the second one corresponds to sexual rest and lasts from July to October. In all three stations and during both years, individuals in the undifferentiated stage (sexual rest) are encountered from July to October. Two spawning periods were observed: the first in March followed by a resumption of activity in April, and the second from May-June. Seasonal variations of the biological indices (GI and CI) were associated with the reproductive and nutritive status of bivalves. The study of parasitism by the trematode Bacciger Bacciger revealed that all the infected individuals were females in the sporocyst stage with a total prevalence between 0 and 9% in August and September respectively. Our results serve as a warning for future management measures and justify the necessity of taking into account the biology of the species in a particular area for better management of resources.

AB  - Biological-fishery indicators have been widely studied. As such the condition factor (CF) index, which interprets the fatness level of a certain species based on length and weight, has been investigated, too. However, CF has been studied without considering its temporal features and distribution. In this paper, we analyze the CF time series via skewgaussian distributions that consider the asymmetry produced by extreme events. This index is characterized by a threshold autoregressive model and corresponds to a stationary process depending on the shape parameter of the skew-gaussian distribution. Then we use the Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance to compare CF by length classes. This distance has mathematical advantages over other divergences such as Kullback-Leibler and Jeffrey's, and the triangular inequality property. Our results are applied to a biological catalogue of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) from the northern coast of Chile, for the period 1990-2010 that consider monthly CF time series by length classes and sex. We find that for high values of shape parameter, JS distance tends to be more sensible to detect discrepancies than Jeffrey's divergence. In addition, the body condition of male anchovies with higher lengths coincides with the ending of the moderate-strong El Nino event 91-92 and for both males and females, the smaller lengths coincide with the beginning of the strong El Nino event 97-98.

KW  - Passenger comfort
AB  - As the annual air passenger traffic in India is increasing steeply (13.52 million in 2012 compared to 11.02 million in 2010), an environmental impact assessment on important cities connected by air is becoming increasingly indispensable. This study proposes an innovative screening method that uses a modified Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI). This modified EVI calculator includes aviation-related parameters and can be used to assess the environmental vulnerabilities of political states and cities, in addition to countries as is being already done. This study also suggests the need to include aspects of human comfort in the screening process through the use of state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamical software and large eddy simulations which can be used to estimate forces experienced by aircraft of different sizes during in-flight turbulence for various weather conditions. A comparative analysis is presented on how changing the size of the aircraft operating in a particular route between the cities of Chennai and Bengaluru has better implications on both passenger comfort and the environment. It is observed that if commercial airlines incorporated fewer medium-sized aircraft, there would be a significant reduction in the environmental vulnerability of the two connected cities.

AB  - Biochemical composition, growth, and survival of brown mussels (Perna perna) collected from subtidal and intertidal origins were compared after both groups of mussels were placed on a long line and grown to commercial size in Golfo de Cariaco, Sucre state, Venezuela. During the sampling period, data on length, dry mass of soft tissues and shell, as well as reproductive condition were collected for both groups. Proteins, carbohydrates and lipids were the biochemical components analyzed. Simultaneously, environmental conditions represented by chlorophyll a, salinity, temperature, and seston were registered. At the beginning of the experimental period, which lasted 213 days, lipid and carbohydrate contents were significantly higher in mussels from subtidal origin while no significant differences were observed in proteins between both mussel groups. These differences were only observed until day 15 for lipids and day 21 for carbohydrates. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between groups in growth (length and mass of soft tissues) and condition index, therefore showing similar potential for their use in suspended culture. Regarding the influence of environmental variables, temperature and chlorophyll a showed the strongest effects on biochemical composition of brown mussels.

AB  - Indian Deep-sea Environment Experiment (INDEX) is a multi-disciplinary study to establish baseline conditions and evaluate the possible impact of deep-seabed mining in Central Indian Basin. A disturbance was simulated to study the effects of sediment re-suspension and re-settlement in the benthic areas. Monitoring the process of restoration and recolonisation of benthic environment and development of predictive models for environmental impact of deep seabed mining are underway.
   Significant information on physical, chemical, biological and geological characteristics of water column and benthic baseline conditions has been generated in the programme. Evaluation of impact of simulated disturbance on the seafloor shows vertical mixing of sediment on the seafloor, lateral migration of sediment plume, changes in geochemical and biochemical conditions as well as reduction in biomass in the benthic environment. The results obtained are useful in determining the indicator parameters and standardising the methods for assessment of effects of large-scale mining. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Island ecosystems are increasingly threatened by pressures from both climate change and intensifying human activity, especially in developing countries. Evaluation of ecological quality is essential to implementation of interventions for adapting to climate change and alleviating human-nature land-use conflicts in the Anthropocene era. However, the temporal and spatial characteristics of island ecological quality, including variation arising from anthropogenic perturbations, climate change effects, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity, are rarely given serious attention. This study compares Xiamen Island and Kinmen Island, two neighboring islands with pronounced differences in urban density, adopting a Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) to describe the spatiotemporal differences in island ecological quality. The results show that the RSEI was positively correlated with greenness and humidity and negatively correlated with heat and dryness. Despite the fact that Xiamen Island has experienced extensive urban expansion and rapid population growth, its ecological quality has remained stable and even improved slightly, which mainly due to scientific urban planning. Despite the ecological advantages of its less urban setting, Kinmen Island has suffered reduced ecological quality due to deterioration of natural conditions, climate warming, and increasing human activity. These research findings provide empirical evidence for the need for scientific and systematic urban planning in high-density urban areas and serves as an important reference for planners and decision-makers for effective improvement in the ecological quality of Kinmen Island.

AB  - The understanding of the regional and local dimensions of vulnerability due to climate change is essential to develop appropriate and targeted adaptation efforts. We assessed the local dimensions of vulnerability in the tropical state of Kerala, India, using a purposely developed vulnerability index, which accounts for both environmental and socio-economic factors. The large extents of coastal wetlands and lagoons and high concentration of mangrove forests make the state environmentally vulnerable. Low human development index, large population of socially deprived groups, which are dependent on the primary sector, and high population density make the state vulnerable from a socio-economic point of view. The present study investigates climate change vulnerability at the district level in the State of Kerala relying on a purposely developed composite vulnerability index that encompasses both socio-economic and environmental factors. The Kerala coast contains the socio-economically and ecologically most vulnerable regions, as demonstrated by a composite vulnerability index.

AB  - Current rangeland assessment techniques show constraints making them difficult to use. Our objective was to propose and describe a reliable and simple method to evaluate rangelands. The method consists of a rangeland ecological contribution index (RECI) through estimation of four indicators. Range condition and RECI were estimated at 29 beef cattle ranches. Range condition was calculated by COTECOCA (Climax) methodology. RECI was estimated through visual observations of total vegetation cover, perennial forage species cover, water retention capacity, and soil stability. Data collected were analyzed by Chi-Square test, correspondence analysis, and logistic regression to determine their reliability. No statistical evidences (p < 0.01; Chi-Square) were found that support independence between RECI and range condition data at all vegetation types. Also, correspondence analysis and ordinal logistic regression (Goodman-Kruskal's gamma = 0.91, p < 0.01) showed a close relationship between results of RECI and range condition.

AB  - We developed an index of biotic integrity (IBI) to assess the health of fish communities inhabiting low-order tributaries of the Monongahela River in Pennsylvania. Environmental stressors observed were urbanization, agriculture, raw and treated sewage discharges, net alkaline mine drainage, and acid mine drainage (AMD). Species richness ranged from zero in streams impacted by AMD and/or untreated sewage to 24 in our reference stream. Our IBI classified the majority (> 90%) of streams in this region as significantly stressed, receiving qualitative evaluations of "fair" to "very poor." Moreover, of the 4,090 fishes collected, only four species representing 2% of the total number collected were classified as intolerant to pollution.

AB  - This article presents the definition of Markov chain indexed by homogeneous trees in Markovian environment. Then we mainly study the strong limit theorems for a Markov chain indexed by homogeneous trees in Markovian environment. We also establish the strong law of large numbers and the Shannon-McMillan theorems for finite Markov chains indexed by a homogeneous tree in a Markovian environment with finite state space. We only prove the results on a Bethe tree and then just state the analogous results on a rooted Cayley tree. There are abundant achievements in research of Markov chains in determined environments, but few results about this topic of Markov chains indexed by trees in random environment. The results of this manuscript are very meaningful to give a good start to establish the strong limit properties for Markov chains indexed by trees in different random environments.

AB  - The study was conducted between July 2018 and May 2020 to compare seasonal changes in growth parameters of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) at different depths in two different areas of the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea (Aegean Sea). In a preliminary study, mussels were placed in cages at different depths of an artificial reef (AR - shipwreck) and natural reef (NR). Temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen were determined seasonally at both sites at a depth of 37 m (deepwater) and 25 m (midwater). Linear increases in length and width of mussels at the AR site were recorded, while no consistent changes were observed for mussels at the NR. There was negative correlation between the specific growth rate (SGR) and salinity (r(2) = 0.5098) and temperature (r(2) = 0.1470) at the AR site. Negative correlations were also recorded between pH and the commercial condition index (CCI) at both the AR (r(2) = 0.3869) and NR (r(2) = 0.3600) sites. Our findings show that depth had a significant effect (p 0.05) on the CCI of mussels at the NR site, while its effect was insignificant for this index at the AR site (p 0.05). This study indicates that natural reefs provide more suitable conditions for the growth of Mediterranean mussels than shipwrecks used as artificial reefs.

AB  - Reproductive cycles of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) from the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, were followed between June 1998 and January 2000. Histological examination of the gonad confirms an annual cycle with a winter inactive period followed by rapid gonad development and a single short spawning period. The population gonad index correlated with seawater temperature and changes in tissue dry weight, condition index, and biochemical components. In winter, few individuals with early gametogenic stages were present and rapid development of primary oocytes (diam. 11 mum) occurred during spring (September-November). The developmental rate and the diameter of mature oocytes (37 mum) was similar for the 1998 and 1999 seasons. For a standard 110-mm-length oyster, maximal tissue body weight and condition index were recorded in December. Rapid weight loss in January was length dependent and was attributed to spawning. Temperature was the environmental variable which best correlated with the timing of gametogenesis. Food availability (phytoplankton biomass) may have been responsible for inter-annual variations. The biochemical composition (% glycogen, lipid, protein) of separated gonad and somatic tissues were variable seasonally and annually. Gametogenesis (oocyte diameter) was associated with increased gonad protein and glycogen and a decrease in lipid concentrations. These changes are similar to those in Pacific oyster populations from other parts of the world.

AB  - 1. Effective tools are needed to measure the 'health' of rivers at scales large enough to be useful for management. Indicators for assessing the complex of variables that constitutes river health need to be ecologically based, efficient, rapid and consistently applicable in different ecological regions.
   2. A large-scale survey of rivers in New South Wales, Australia provided data to test the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBT). The IBI employs the fish-community attributes, identified using regional and river-size data, expected for a river reach of excellent environmental quality. It uses metrics based on species richness, abundance, community structure and the health of individual fish. IBI metrics were established to suit a relatively low-diversity and unspecialized freshwater fish fauna in south-eastern Australia, totalling 55 species.
   3. The IBI was able to discriminate between relative levels of environmental quality within a diverse set of stream systems and four presumptive ecological regions. The index was validated by testing the repeatability of scores, and by comparison of IBI scores at eighty sites with an independent measure of potential catchment condition, the River Disturbance Index.
   4. Assessments of metric performance showed that eleven of the twelve metrics contributed satisfactorily. One metric based on trophic guild performed poorly and should be deleted from the index. Six other recommendations are made to enhance the performance of the IBI.
   5. Results show that, while all large rivers have been disturbed, rivers in the Murray region and those in many coastal montane areas are particularly degraded.
   6. The IBI results presented here demonstrate a validated method for large-scale monitoring of river health based on a fish fauna of limited diversity, in the absence of suitable reference sites.

AB  - 1. This study describes the development of an index for assessing stream habitats in northern Portugal at a variety of spatial scales and levels of perturbation. In developing the index, 86 environmental variables, including regional and local ones, were used to reflect the geomorphological characteristics, riverine habitat, and human activities occurring in each basin.
   2. Collections of benthic invertebrates were made at each sample site. To reflect the observed variation in assemblages, the streams were separated into two categories: the North-west catchments and the Douro catchments.
   3. Multivariate analysis techniques applied to the physical and biological data sets allowed the determination of the relative importance of local and regional environmental descriptors in the discrimination of the invertebrate assemblages.
   4. Successive statistical refinement procedures yielded 10 variables, all at the local scale. Variation along disturbance gradients allowed the development of a habitat index through scoring criteria that separated reference sites from stressed sites.
   5. The results indicate the reduced impact of catchment factors by a buffering influence probably resulting from the presence of a riparian corridor. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Assessment of ecosystem change often focuses on the degree of conversion and representation in networks of protected areas. While essential, these factors alone do not provide a holistic index of ecosystem conditions. Metrics that compare the current state of ecosystems to a meaningful reference condition can help identify "hidden" risks, lost functions, and provide conservation and management-relevant insights. Here we review a departure metric that can be used to measure ecosystem conditions and its implementation for all lands in the United States by the LANDFIRE Program. We then use two case studies to demonstrate how manually calculating the departure metric is used to explore under- and over-representation of structural stages. Finally, we document the assumptions, interpretation, and limitations of the departure metric, and discuss its current and possible future applications.

AB  - This paper presents an advanced version of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), a multimetric index to indicate ecosystem health. The multimetric index has been adapted in such a way that it not only indicates overall condition but also specific causes of environmental disturbance. The newly developed index (a) uses data of tolerant as well as intolerant species in a single metric to indicate environmental disturbance, (b) does not require knowledge about species from the literature, and (c) can be applied to artificial landscapes.
   The metrics proposed here consist of indicator species assemblages that are selected directly for their relationship with an environmental component or specific type of environmental degradation. Thus, each metric indicates a type of environmental concern, which enables conservation practices to be targeted more effectively. Species assemblages for each single metric consist of a combination of species that can be negatively and positively related to environmental disturbances, providing a better indication of stream ecosystem health.
   The area studied was assumed to be too diverse for one single index. Canonical Indirect-Gradient Principal Component Analysis indicated that the optimal division of subindices based on stream typology was for streams with drainage basin sizes <10 km(2) and >10 km(2). Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were used to identify relationships between anthropogenic disturbances and the composition and abundance of fish species at impacted as well as undisturbed sites. This index proved to be useful for indicating overall stream ecosystem health as well as local onsite environmental disturbances or the environmental components of greatest concern. This index does require extensive information about measured levels of anthropogenic disturbances with the accompanying composition and abundance of fish species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The spatial cumulative distribution function (SCDF) is a random function that provides a statistical summary of a random field over a spatial domain of interest. In this article we develop a spatial subsampling method fur predicting an SCDF based on observations made on a hexagonal grid, similar to the one used in the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We show that under quite general conditions, the proposed subsampling method provides accurate data-based approximations to the sampling distributions of various functionals of the SCDF predictor. In particular, it produces estimators of different population characteristics, such as the quantiles and weighted mean integrated squared errors of the empirical predictor. As an illustration, we apply the subsampling method to construct large-sample prediction bands for the SCDF of an ecological index for foliage condition of red maple trees in the state of Maine.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMID) characterized by low pH, high concentrations of dissolved metals and metal oxide deposits affects aquatic ecosystems severely. However, the quantitative impacts of AMID on lotic ecosystem, especially the seasonal variation of impacts, are still unclear. We developed a diatom-based index of biotic integrity (AMD-DIBI) to evaluate AMID impairment on Gaolan River. Pollution Tolerance Index (PTI), % No. of Cocconeis species, % No. of Pinnularia species, No. of Cymbella species, relative abundance of prostrate diatoms, and relative abundance of Achnanthes were selected to build AMID-DIBI. AMD-DIBI scores between reference and impaired sites displayed significant differences. On the basis of AMID-DEBI scores, the ecological conditions of most reference sites were "excellent" or "good", while the impaired sites were "Poor" or "Moderate". AMID impairments were more severe in dry season than that in wet season: about 20km lower reach were impaired in wet season, while 50km at least in dry season. AMD-DIBI is meaningful to assess the ecological conditions, quantify impairment of AMID and measure the effectiveness of restoration.

AB  - This article analyses investment from European Union cohesion policy funds into the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian environmental sectors during the budget period 2007-2013. Total investment from these funds in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania during that period will be about 14.7 billion euros, of which about 18 percent covers the environmental sector.
   The purpose is to analyse whether allocation of expenditure to the environment is sustainable. In their analysis the authors apply sustainability criteria based on the cost-benefit rule and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). The main finding is that the Baltic States allocate least environmental funds to those fields found to be most relevant to sustainability.

AB  - 1. Management of whole rivers and river catchments requires a comprehensive set of information about river condition and use, both existing and historical, and the links between them at regional, state or national scales. This paper outlines a new approach to the assessment of river condition, using a small team was able to assess 210 000 km of rivers across more than 3 million km(2) of Australia in little more than a year.
   2. The approach was driven by a hierarchical model of river function, which assumed that broad-scale catchment characteristics affect local hydrology, habitat features, water quality and, ultimately, aquatic biota. The model provided the basis for selecting important ecologically relevant features that indices should represent. For each reach of each river we derived a biological index and an environmental index based on measures quantifying catchment and hydrological condition, and habitat and water quality condition. Data came from existing state and national databases, satellite images, site measurements and process models.
   3. All indices were calculated as deviation from a reference condition, were range-standardised and were divided into equivalent bands of condition. Amalgamation of index components and of sub-indices was determined by consideration of their ecological effects; for example, general degradation might be additive, but toxic effects of one component would override all others.
   4. Several internal and external validation methods were employed, with the all-important validation of the final assessments undertaken by comparison with a similar index based on locally measured data.
   5. The environmental assessment classified 14% of reaches as largely unmodified, 67% as moderately modified and 19% as substantially modified by human impacts. The biological assessment based on site assessments and modelled data using invertebrates indicated that 70% of reaches were equivalent to reference condition and that 30% were significantly impaired. Catchment disturbance, elevated sediment and nutrient loads, and habitat degradation all contributed to these results. These impacts have all occurred during the last 200 years (post-European settlement).
   6. Partly as a result of the assessments of this study the Australian Government has begun to adopt a more environmentally sustainable approach to broad-scale water management.

AB  - Understanding the state of a social-ecological system (SES), a system that includes human and environmental subsystems interacting together, is important for sodo-economic development and for natural resources and disaster management. However, what index or measure should be used to show the actual status of an SES remains an important research question. This paper presents the social-ecological status index (SESI), which measures social-ecological status based on social-ecological resilience and pressure. It is derived by using a spatially explicit framework that integrates various geophysical and socio-economic indicators. In this paper, its structural composition is explored and the proposed framework for deriving this index is compared with the current practice of evaluating SESs. Its relationship with certain other indicators is also assessed through a case study, thereby highlighting its application in the provinces of the Philippines. It is found that the SESI does not seem to favor either the human or the environmental dimensions of an SES. This is an important feature, indicating that the SESI is a neutral, more complete, and robust measure for social-ecological status assessment. With the increasing availability of geospatial and socio-economic data, the flexibility and adaptability of the framework allow the proposed index to be applied in other geographic locations, at the same time providing an avenue for its further development.

AB  - The Balkhash Lake is a unique natural water body with a gradient of the total content of dissolved salts along its longitudinal axis and the increased level of toxic pollutions. To assess the spatial distribution of environmental factors along the Balkhash Lake surface, methods of bioindication and statistical mapping were used. An assessment of the overall level of toxic pollution was carried out using the Water Ecosystem State Index (WEST). Phytoplankton has been used to assess the ecological state of the Balkhash Lake in the summer of 2004. A total of 92 species were found in the algal communities, with prevalence of Chlorophyta in the western, fresher water part, and Bacillariophyta in the eastern, brackish part. Mapping showed a positive relationship between the species richness in algal Divisions and macrophytes. Changes in the proportion of indicator species within the composition of phytoplankton reflected the spatial gradient of depth, TDS, pH-values, organic pollution. According to bioindication data, the waters of the Balkhash Lake are moderately polluted, water quality class III. The WESI index calculation revealed the effect of the total toxic pollution on the phytoplankton of the Western Balkhash The spatial distribution of the WESI index showed that in the zone the influence of river flow has stimulating effect of biogenic elements on phytoplankton but was partially leveled by the increased level of toxic pollution.

AB  - After the implementation of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60, biotic indices became an important tool aiming at assessing the water quality of all water bodies, such as lakes, transitional, coastal and groundwater, and the restoration of their ecological integrity. Due to the fact that fish is one of the most important taxa for the assessment of the river quality in the present study an attempt was made to develop and apply a Fish-based River Integrity Index (FRII) for the assessment of the Greek riverine systems, which may also be applied for the assessment of other Balkan or Mediterranean rivers. Due to the high importance of the Balkan's Peninsula fish fauna in terms of endemicity, the assessment of the riverine systems is considered as sine qua non. The proposed index consists of multiple metrics, which attempt to describe the biological and demographical traits of the fish fauna. More specific the FRII is composed by seven metrics, of which three metrics were describing "Fish fauna composition and abundance'', three were describing the Reproduction strategies of the species, while the remaining one metric related to the "Habitat preferences''.

AB  - Production protocols as well as the origin of broodstock in hatcheries are the important factors determining the attributes of Crassostrea gigas oyster spat. Spat from diverse hatcheries may have different attributes for commercial activities. We described the biological performance (growth and condition index - CI) of spat stocks produced at different hatcheries (H1, H2, H3 and H4), and simultaneously cultivated in La Cruz lagoon (Mexico). Analysis of pathogens and genetic variability was performed for each stock. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and seston were measured during samplings. Stocks showed similar growth patterns but each one showed a distinctive curve. Temperature was the governing factor on growth but its effect was variable depending on the stock and whether the temperature increases, stays high or decreases. Availability of food was high producing elevated CI. No presence of pathogens was detected and it was not possible to obtain amplicons of the mitochondrial regions. Despite differences in performance among stocks, all of them showed higher values (growth rates, CI, survival) than the standards reported for the Gulf of California. These findings are useful for the production and cultivation of C. gigas, but more studies are needed to understand the influence of hatchery protocols on spat quality.

AB  - This paper reviews a selection of nine indicators for assessing the biological state of a fish population monitored only by using trawl surveys in which catchability is assumed constant from time to time and place to place. The intention is to inform or remind of the range of possibilities and of associated practical and statistical issues. The indicators, grouped according to relationships with abundance, length, age, weight, and reproduction, are documented in a standard format covering estimation, interpretability, sensitivity, considerations for reference points where possible, and an example of their application. Lastly, selected indicators together with year-class curves fitted to abundance indices-at-age are applied to the North Sea cod to demonstrate the feasibility of an assessment based on only one trawl survey. Results support findings of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) working group on the assessment of demersal stocks in the North Sea and Skagerrak.

AB  - This research aims to identify the vulnerabilities of Rio Grande basin in Minas Gerais state as well as to investigate, through technical, legal, social, and governmental aspects, the relevance of SEA as an environmental tool for the conservation and preservation of watersheds. Rio Grande basin evaluation was performed by using this following database: soil classes, land use classification, water quality index, and economic ecological index. It was performed multi-criteria decision analysis based on analytic hierarchy process methodology. 52.5% of the studied area was classified as "good" preservation condition. Alto Grande (GD1), Mortes/Jacare (GD2) and Furnas (GD3) units did not contain significant percentages of their areas corresponding to the preservation class "very good". In the studied area, 34.51% was classified as "medium" preservation condition, thus indicating the need for effective measures for the river basin conservation. These findings highlight the potential importance of including the SEA in the decision-making process for plans, policies and programs related to the integrated management of water resources.

AB  - Research Highlights: To inform eco-designers in green building conception, we propose a conceptual model for the assessment of the impact of using wood on the quality of ecosystems. Background and Objectives: The proposed model allows the assessment of the quality of ecosystems at the landscape level based on the condition of the forest and the proportion of different practices to characterize precisely the forest management strategy. The evaluation provides a numerical index, which corresponds to a suitable format to inform decision-making support tools, such as life cycle analysis. Materials and Methods: Based on the concept of naturalness, the methodology considers five naturalness characteristics (landscape context, forest composition, structure, dead wood, and regeneration process) and relies on forest inventory maps and data. An area within the boreal black spruce-feathermoss ecological domain of Quebec (Canada) was used as a case study for the development of the methodology, designed to be easily exportable. Results: In 2012, the test area had a near-natural class (naturalness index NI = 0.717). Simulation of different management strategies over 70 years shows that, considering 17.9% of strict protected areas, the naturalness index would have lost one to two classes of naturalness (out of five classes), depending on the strategy applied for the regeneration (0.206 NI 0.413). Without the preservation of the protected areas, the management strategies would have further reduced the naturalness (0.274 NI 0.492). Apart from exotic species plantation, the most sensitive variables are the percentage of area in irregular, old, and closed forests at time zero and the percentage of area in closed forests, late successional species groups, and modified wetlands after 70 years. Conclusions: Despite the necessity of further model and parameter validation, the use of the index makes it possible to combine the effects of different forestry management strategies and practices into one alteration gradient.

AB  - In this paper we describe work that progresses the understanding of socio-ecological systems from the perspective of exploring how the supply of ecosystem services might vary with changes in the state of ecosystem components. We developed and tested a new assessment approach (concept, framework and methodology) to assess the capacity of marine ecosystems to supply services, which could be carried out using available policyreported assessment information on marine biodiversity and ecosystem status. The starting point was an assessment that drew on an understanding of ecosystem state-service relationships, and that was extended to incorporate operational, policy-relevant ecosystem assessment information at European regional sea scales in response to the requirements of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. The assessment consists of three key steps: (1) identifying all the instances where a marine ecosystem component can potentially contribute to the supply of a marine ecosystem service; (2) developing a critical pathway analysis to identify the major ecosystem component(s) contributing to the supply of a given service; (3) interpreting available information on the state and trends of these major contributing components with knowledge of the ecosystem state-service relationship, to assess the ecosystem's capacity for service supply and its direction of change. The assessment provides a common approach that can be applied across marine regions, and in data rich or data poor situations. This approach captures the sustainability of ecosystem service supply capacity through retaining the connection with the state of the ecosystem and can help to inform management decisions and track the effectiveness of environmental policies.

AB  - Multimetric indexes constructed by summing metric scores have been criticized despite many of their merits. A leading criticism is the potential for investigator bias involved in metric selection and scoring. Often there is a large number of competing metrics equally well correlated with environmental stressors, requiring a judgment call by the investigator to select the most suitable metrics to include in the index and how to score them. Data-driven procedures for multimetric index formulation published during the last decade have reduced this limitation, yet apprehension remains. Multivariate approaches that select metrics with statistical algorithms may reduce the level of investigator bias and alleviate a weakness of multimetric indexes. We investigated the suitability of a direct-gradient multivariate procedure to derive an index of biotic condition for fish assemblages in oxbow lakes in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Although this multivariate procedure also requires that the investigator identify a set of suitable metrics potentially associated with a set of environmental stressors, it is different from multimetric procedures because it limits investigator judgment in selecting a subset of biotic metrics to include in the index and because it produces metric weights suitable for computation of index scores. The procedure, applied to a sample of 35 competing biotic metrics measured at 50 oxbow lakes distributed over a wide geographical region in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, selected 11 metrics that adequately indexed the biotic condition of five test lakes. Because the multivariate index includes only metrics that explain the maximum variability in the stressor variables rather than a balanced set of metrics chosen to reflect various fish assemblage attributes, it is fundamentally different from multimetric indexes of biotic integrity with advantages and disadvantages. As such, it provides an alternative to multimetric procedures.

AB  - This study investigates the distribution of selected trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and associated risk in coastal sediment samples taken from the Northwest Anatolia coastline of Turkey. The 451 km long coastal area contains many industrial areas and tourist sites. Trace metal concentrations in sediment samples collected from 100 stations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ecological risk was evaluated according to the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQG) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by calculating and examining pollution indices including the degree of contamination (Cd), modified degree of contamination (mCd), potential ecological risk index (Ri), and enrichment factors (EF). Trace metal concentrations were visualized and spatially described utilizing bubble maps. Based on the risk analysis, arsenic was found to be the most dominant pollutant in the study area and the other metals did not indicate a serious anthropogenic pollution.

AB  - Background Protected areas are organised in different climatic zones, which usually include typical ecosystems characteristic of certain climatic zones. In most cases, protected areas are biodiversity hotspots. These areas are benchmarks in terms of nature conservation and to determine their biological diversity is becoming an important task. It is important to investigate the carabid family of protected areas within the framework of understanding the overall biological diversity of these systems. In addition, ground beetles, as one of the largest groups of ground-based inhabitants, are indicators of the state of ecosystems and serve as markers of their well-being. New information We present 2,969 new occurrence records comprising 226 species of Carabidae, belonging to eight subfamilies, from the Mordovia State Nature Reserve (central Russia). Ten species are listed for the first time for the Mordovia State Nature Reserve fauna after previous research: Cicindela maritima, Bembidion striatum, Dyschirius angustatus, Dyschirius arenosus, Notiophilus aestuans, Bembidion argenteolum, Bembidion velox, Bradycellus caucasicus, Cymindis angularis and Syntomus truncatellus, five of which were first recorded for the Republic of Mordovia (Egorov et al. 2020). Previously, this information was not published anywhere and we wanted to make it available to everyone by embedding it in the global database on biodiversity (GBIF).

AB  - Developing a general, predictive understanding of ecological systems requires knowing how much structural and functional relationships can cross scales and contexts. Here, we introduce the CROSSLINK project that investigates the role of forested riparian buffers in modified European landscapes by measuring a wide range of ecosystem attributes in stream-riparian networks. CROSSLINK involves replicated field measurements in four case-study basins with varying levels of human development: Norway (Oslo Fjord), Sweden (Lake Malaren), Belgium (Zwalm River), and Romania (Arge River). Nested within these case-study basins include multiple, independent stream-site pairs with a forested riparian buffer and unbuffered section located upstream, as well as headwater and downstream sites to show cumulative land-use impacts. CROSSLINK applies existing and bespoke methods to describe habitat conditions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Here, we summarize the approaches used, detail protocols in supplementary materials, and explain how data is applied in an optimization framework to better manage tradeoffs in multifunctional landscapes. We then present results demonstrating the range of riparian conditions present in our case-study basins and how these environmental states influence stream ecological integrity with the commonly used macroinvertebrate Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index. We demonstrate that a qualitative index of riparian integrity can be positively associated with stream ecological status. This introduction to the CROSSLINK project shows the potential for our replicated study with its panoply of ecosystem attributes to help guide management decisions regarding the use of forested riparian buffers in human-impacted landscapes. This knowledge is highly relevant in a time of rapid environmental change where freshwater biodiversity is increasingly under pressure from a range of human impacts that include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.

AB  - The critical role of ecological preferences and opportunity in determining contaminant uptake and adaptive responses of sexes in the wild is still poorly understood. This ecological relationship was investigated by measuring metal bioaccumulation and antioxidant activity in male and female blue crab populations from open water habitat and the littoral/inter-tidal zone of the Lagos Lagoon. A total of 741 samples of blue crab (littoral zone: 263 females, 137 males; open water zone, 230 females, 111 males) was collected monthly over 24months (January 2010-January 2012) from each site and the measurements of morphometric features (wet weight, carapace length, carapace width) were recorded; condition index, metal (redox active: Cu, Zn, redox inactive: Pb, Cd) concentration in tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, gonads and muscle) and antioxidant activity (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and malondialdehyde) were measured for each sex. Monthly sediment samples for both habitats were also analysed for metals using standard methods. Female crabs were significantly larger (p<.05) with a better condition index than the male crabs across sites and seasons, while higher oxidative damage was recorded in male crabs in the littoral zone compared to the open water zone. The results show that there was a negative association between antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation; a negative relationship between concentrations of redox-inactive metals (Pb and Cd) and antioxidant activity in male crab tissues; and a positive relationship between uptake of a redox-active metal (Cu) and antioxidant activity in female crab tissues. Although these trends suggest sex-specific toxicity, they also associate redox-inactive metals with the downregulation of antioxidant activity and oxidative stress. Furthermore, the higher condition index of females corroborates the possibility of sex-specific toxicity, while the larger-sized females compared to males suggests size-sexual dimorphism in the blue crab populations. The site-specific oxidative damage between sexes may be attributed to the different complexity of both habitats, which affords different ecological opportunities for the sexes.

AB  - Biological indicators that signal changes in lake condition are essential tools for guiding resource management decisions. Macrophyte-based indicators have traditionally been selected and evaluated in the context of nutrient-based stressors, although the need to evaluate indicators that are sensitive to climate stressors has been increasingly relevant. Moreover, indicators should ideally exhibit minimal sampling variation and have low natural temporal variation so there is high power to detect changes in the mean value over time. Eight macrophyte indicators were estimated in 23 Minnesota (USA) lakes using four years of repeated surveys to estimate sampling and temporal variation, response to development (phosphorus concentration) and climate stress (annual growing degree days), and power to detect significant change at various annual sampling intervals. Indicators included a macrophyte index of biotic integrity, floristic quality index, maximum depth of growth, total species richness, common species richness, mean richness, and frequency occurrence of rooted species and Chara sp. Overall, regression and smoothed additive models indicated significant relationships of indicators to total lake phosphorus and mean annual growing degree days. The macrophyte index of biotic integrity, floristic quality index, and the frequency rooted species had minimal sampling variation in this study, were responsive to development or climate stress, and had low annual variation (coefficients of variation 0.08, 0.10, and 0.19, respectively) resulting in high to moderate power (>50%) for detecting significant change over a 20 year period. Results from these analyses will facilitate the use of precise and powerful indicators that respond to stressors that are of concern for the management of freshwater glacial lakes.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic and hierarchical approach for incorporating environmental considerations into all stages of chemical process design. The complexity of the environmental and economic assessments increases as the design proceeds. The design method integrates computer-aided process simulation with a suite of environmental impact, economic, and decision analysis software tools. At the earliest design stage, the environmental assessment includes emission estimates from major process equipment, considers pollution control efficiency, and generates nine risk-based environmental impact indices. The economic assessment is based on the cost of raw materials and reaction stoichiometry. This assessment method was applied to the selection of alternative feedstocks for a reaction step: benzene versus n-butane for maleic anhydride (MA) production. Using known yields and selectivities, the n-butane route was shown to be superior to the benzene route in both the raw material cost and environmental impacts. After synthesis of a process flowsheet and simulation, a series of "process diagnostic summary" tables was generated to identify early process improvement strategies. An "improved" base-case flowsheet was developed, simulated, and assessed for profitability and environmental impacts. The improved n-butane process flowsheet after implementation of heat integration yielded an 80% reduction in utility costs and a 13% reduction in the aggregate environmental index compared to the base-case flowsheet. Then, several design tasks, such as equipment sizing, scaled gradient analysis, and multiobjective optimization using a genetic algorithm, were applied. After optimization, the economic performance of both the n-butane and benzene flowsheets was substantially bettered over the previously improved base-case flowsheets. The aggregate environmental index for the n-butane process was decreased to the greatest extent as a result of early design activities and negligibly as a result of detailed design and optimization. The opposite was observed for the benzene process. The reasons for this difference in system behavior are explained. The early screening environmental and economic assessment methods were shown to be accurate when compared to the more rigorous assessment methods. Optimum operating conditions of the processes (reaction temperature and pressure, mass separating agent flow rate, etc.) change significantly when the objective function for optimization is either an aggregate environmental index or a profitability index.

AB  - This study aimed to establish the reproductive cycle of the mangrove oyster, Crassostrea rhizophorae cultured in the macrotidal estuary of the Paciencia River, Maranhao state, on the northeastern coast of Brazil, and its relationship with environmental factors. Oysters were collected monthly throughout 2013 for histological analysis of sex ratio, gonadal development and condition index. The sex ratio was 1:1.39 (M:F) and only 5 specimens presented hermaphroditism. The breeding process was continuous throughout the year and mature (IIIA stage) and spawning oysters (IIIB stage) were present in practically all months. Low variation in temperature seemed to be the main factor for the continuity of the reproductive cycle. Besides temperature, the relationship between rainfall, salinity and primary productivity affected the stimulus and timing of reproductive events. The rainy season, with low values of salinity and high values of chlorophyll a and particulate organic matter, appeared to be the main reproductive period, with release of gametes and production and maturation of new gamete cohorts in the short term. In the tropics, where gamete maturation and release seem to be continuous and concomitant, the condition index does not appear to be the best method to assess reserve accumulation peaks and gonadal repletion.

AB  - Growth and body size are influenced by the environment and each have consequences for reproduction and, thus, fitness. Anthropogenically altered habitats (i.e. cities) create novel conditions that may enhance or reduce fitness via environmentally induced changes in growth or body size. By comparing urban and natural habitats, we can quantify the effects of human-modified landscapes on fauna and increase our general understanding of responses to novel environments. We collected lizards, Anolis cristatellus (Dumeril & Bibron, 1837), from adjacent urban and forested areas, bred them in the lab under common conditions, measured body size, latency of oviposition, fecundity and egg size for each female and measured growth of hatchlings over 3 months. Female lizards from the city were larger, had a greater body condition index at the beginning of the breeding season and started laying eggs sooner than those from the forest, which increased their fecundity. Females from the forest, but not the city, improved their body condition during the study, so we infer that urban environments maximize body condition of anoles. Moreover, hatchlings from urban mothers had higher growth rates than those from the forest suggesting that body size differences may be due to intrinsic factors. Thus, we conclude that urban environments can enhance growth and reproduction in some vertebrate ectotherms.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the degree of multicollinearity and to identify the variables involved in linear dependence relations in additive-dominant models. Data of birth weight (n=141,567), yearling weight (n=58,124), and scrotal circumference (n=20,371) of Montana Tropical composite cattle were used. Diagnosis of multicollinearity was based on the variance inflation factor (VIF) and on the evaluation of the condition indexes and eigenvalues from the correlation matrix among explanatory variables. The first model studied (RM) included the fixed effect of dam age class at calving and the covariates associated to the direct and maternal additive and non-additive effects. The second model (R) included all the effects of the RM model except the maternal additive effects. Multicollinearity was detected in both models for all traits considered, with VIF values of 1.03-70.20 for RM and 1.03-60.70 for R. Collinearity increased with the increase of variables in the model and the decrease in the number of observations, and it was classified as weak, with condition index values between 10.00 and 26.77. In general, the variables associated with additive and non-additive effects were involved in multicollinearity, partially due to the natural connection between these covariables as fractions of the biological types in breed composition.

AB  - Drought is a type of natural disaster that has the most significant impacts on agriculture. Regional drought monitoring based on remote sensing has become popular due to the development of remote sensing technology. In this study, vegetation condition index (VCI) data recorded from 1982 to 2010 in agricultural areas of China were obtained from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data, and the temporal and spatial variations in each drought were analyzed. The relationships between drought and climate factors were also analyzed. The results showed that from 1982 to 2010, the agricultural areas that experienced frequent and severe droughts were mainly concentrated in the northwestern areas and Huang-Huai Plain. Moreover, the VCI increased in the majority of agricultural areas, indicating that the drought frequency decreased over time, and the decreasing trend in the southern region was more notable than that in the northern region. A correlation analysis showed that temperature and wind velocity were the main factors that influenced drought in the agricultural areas of China. From a regional perspective, excluding precipitation, the climate factors had various effects on drought in different regions. However, the correlation between the VCI and precipitation was low, possibly due to the widespread use of artificial irrigation technology, which reduces the reliance of agricultural areas on precipitation.

AB  - Biological indicators, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates, are widely used and effective measures of the impact of urbanization on stream ecosystems. A multimetric biological index of urbanization was developed using a large benthic macroinvertebrate dataset (n = 1,835) from the Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area and then validated with datasets from Cleveland, Ohio (n = 79); San Jose, California (n = 85); and a different subset of the Baltimore data (n = 85). The biological metrics used to develop the multimetric index were selected using several criteria and were required to represent ecological attributes of macroinvertebrate assemblages including taxonomic composition and richness (number of taxa in the insect orders of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), functional feeding group (number of taxa designated as filterers), and habit (percent of individuals which cling to the substrate). Quantile regression was used to select metrics and characterize the relationship between the final biological index and an urban gradient (composed of population density, road density, and urban land use). Although more complex biological indices exist, this simplified multimetric index showed a consistent relationship between biological indicators and urban conditions (as measured by quantile regression) in three climatic regions of the United States and can serve as an assessment tool for environmental managers to prioritize urban stream sites for restoration and protection.

AB  - A large number of white hard clam farms are in the estuary shoreline of Saigon-Dongnai Rivers, which flow through Ho Chi Minh City, a megacity, and numerous industrial zones in the basin catchment area. In this study, eleven trace elements (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb) in the hard clam Meretrix lyrata and its habitats including surface water, suspended particulate matter, and sediment were evaluated to understand the bioaccumulation of trace metals from the environment into the whole tissues of the hard clam as well as its different organs. The samples were collected monthly in dry, transition, and wet seasons of the southern part of Vietnam from March to September 2016. The results showed that seasonal and spatial variations of the studied metal concentrations in the hard clam M. lyrata might be influenced by the sea current as well as the surface runoff in the rainy season. The relationship between condition index and the element concentrations in M. lyrata might be affected by the living environment conditions and farming methods. In addition, the hazard index values of all trace elements in the hard clam M. lyrata harvested in the sampling time show that the hard clams farmed in the study area were safe for local consumers.

AB  - Measures of physiological condition are being used as sub-lethal endpoints in studies with unionids exposed to a variety of stressors, yet the natural seasonal variation in these measures are largely undocumented. We measured concentrations of glycogen in foot and mantle tissue and a tissue condition index (TCI) in Amblema plicata (Say 1817). about monthly, for 2 years in mussels that were: (1) obtained directly from the Upper Mississippi River (riverine group) and (2) relocated from the river into an artificial pond (relocated group). In both groups, we observed significant seasonal variation in all physiological indicators. Seasonal variation in glycogen was 72% in mantle and 52% in foot tissue and paralleled reproductive activity in this short-term breeder. In the relocated group, most of the variation in glycogen occurred during the first six months after relocation, suggesting that handling stress may have been a contributing factor. The significant seasonal variation in the TCI paralleled glycogen in riverine mussels. We observed tissue-specific differences in glycogen in the riverine group, but not in the relocated group. These data suggest that an interaction of environmental and biological factors influence the energetic status of mussels in natural populations. A better understanding of this variation is needed to interpret changes in physiological condition due to stressors such as relocation.

AB  - While the number of river restoration projects is increasing, studies on their success or failure relative to expectations are still rare. Only a few decision support methodologies and integrative methods for evaluating the ecological status of rivers are used in river restoration projects, thereby limiting informed management decisions in restoration planning as well as success control. Moreover, studies quantifying river restoration effects are often based on the assessment of a single organism group, and the effects on terrestrial communities are often neglected. In addition, potential effects of water quality or hydrological degradation are often not considered for the evaluation of restoration projects.
   We used multi-attribute value theory to re-formulate an existing river assessment protocol and extend it to a more comprehensive, integrated ecological assessment program. We considered habitat conditions, water quality regarding nutrients, micropollutants and heavy metals, and five instream and terrestrial organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic vegetation, ground beetles and riparian vegetation). The physical, chemical and biological states of the rivers were assessed separately and combined to value the overall ecological state.
   The assessment procedure was then applied to restored and unrestored sites at two Swiss rivers to test its feasibility in quantifying the effect of river restoration. Uncertainty in observations was taken into account and propagated through the assessment framework to evaluate the significance of differences between the ecological states of restored and unrestored reaches. In the restored sites, we measured a higher width variability of the river, as well as a higher width of the riparian zone and a higher richness of organism groups. According to the ecological assessment, the river morphology and the biological states were significantly better at the restored sites, with the largest differences detected for ground beetles and fish communities, followed by benthic invertebrates and riparian vegetation. The state of the aquatic vegetation was slightly lower at the restored sites. According to our assessment, the presence of invasive plant species counteracted the potential ecological gain. Water quality could be a causal factor contributing to the absence of larger improvements.
   Overall, we found significantly better biological and physical states, and integrated ecological states at the restored sites. Even in the absence of comprehensive before-after data, based on the similarity of the reaches before restoration and mechanistic biological knowledge, this can be safely interpreted as a causal consequence of restoration. An integrative perspective across aquatic and riparian organism groups was important to assess the biological effects, because organism groups responded differently to restoration. In addition, the potential deteriorating effect of water quality demonstrates the importance of integrated planning for the reduction of morphological, water quality and hydrological degradation.

AB  - Several indices were introduced for assessment of heat stress worldwide many of which developed in the North American or European countries and may encounter some restrictions when utilized in countries with different climates such as developing countries. Moreover, only a few of them can demonstrate the actual thermal condition, comprehensively. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study was to develop an Outdoor Environmental Heat Index (OEHI), which not only to be able to cover the important personal and environmental parameters affecting to heat stress and well correspond to created heat strain, but also can be used generally wherever of the Iran country and other countries with similar climates. The final presented index, OEHI, was modeled based on air temperature and air enthalpy. These parameters are part of the common metrological data reported daily by each weather station, so the index can be easily reported daily for public awareness of heat situation.

AB  - Indices of biological integrity of wetlands based on vascular plants (VIBIs) have been developed in many areas of the USA and are used in some states to make critical management decisions. An underlying concept of all VIBIs is that they respond negatively to disturbance. The Ohio VIBI (OVIBI) is calculated from 10 metrics, which are different for each wetland vegetation class. We present a candidate vegetation index of biotic integrity based on floristic quality (VIBI-FQ) that requires only two metrics to calculate an overall score regardless of vegetation class. These metrics focus equally on the critical ecosystem elements of diversity and dominance as related to a species' degree of fidelity to habitat requirements. The indices were highly correlated but varied among vegetation classes. Both indices responded negatively with a published index of wetland disturbance in 261 Ohio wetlands. Unlike VIBI-FQ however, errors in classifying wetland vegetation may lead to errors in calculating OVIBI scores. This is especially critical when assessing the ecological condition of rapidly developing ecosystems typically associated with wetland restoration and creation projects. Compared to OVIBI, the VIBI-FQ requires less field work, is much simpler to calculate and interpret, and can potentially be applied to all habitat types. This candidate index, which has been "standardized" across habitats, would make it easier to prioritize funding because it would score the "best" and "worst" of all habitats appropriately and allow for objective comparison across different vegetation classes.

AB  - The increasing number of water abstractions and water-use conflicts in alpine regions represents a significant threat for these fragile aquatic ecosystems. The use of tools, like multicriteria analysis (MCA), can support related decision-making processes towards sustainable solutions. In this paper, an innovative approach to assess water withdrawals sustainability by integrating the MesoHABSIM (Mesohabitat Simulation Model) into an MCA framework is presented and discussed. The methodology was implemented by replacing, within the MCA assessment, Water Framework Directive biological indicators with the MesoHABSIM based river Habitat Integrity Index, related to watercourse discharge and morphology, which allows quantifying the impacts of withdrawals on river ecosystems and fish communities. The resulting MCA procedure considers four criteria (energy, environment and fishing, landscape, economy) and requires only the use of measurable indicators based on watercourse discharge and its continuous monitoring. It was tested in Aosta Valley region (NW Italy) to both ex ante and ex post scenarios, for different types of water withdrawals and, currently, 20 experimentations, involving 58 hydropower plants and 12 farmer consortia, are ongoing. The proposed MCA process demonstrated its applicability with an increased decision-making quality and involved stakeholders' satisfaction and is being officially endorsed in the regional River Strategic Plan.

AB  - Submerged aquatic plants can act as measurable indicators of ecological conditions occurring within a lake, and they need only be monitored once a year or even less. Historically in New Zealand there has been a reliance on water quality sampling for monitoring the health of lakes and these methods can be complex and costly involving multiple site visits and chemical analysis of water samples. As a result, lake monitoring has been irregular, or not done at all. LakeSPI or 'Lake Submerged Plant Indicators' is a new management tool that uses aquatic plants to monitor and assess ecological condition in a wide range of lake types. The method generates three indices: a Native Condition Index (extent and diversity of native plants) and an Invasive Condition Index (extent and impact of alien weeds), which are generated from scores allocated to carefully selected vegetation features; and an integrated LakeSPI Index which is largely derived from components of the other two indices and provides an overall indication of lake ecological condition. The LakeSPI method can be used to assess the status of lakes and monitor trends occurring within them, and it is expected that the use of LakeSPI will facilitate regular monitoring and reporting on a much wider range of lakes than has been possible using traditional water quality methods. By utilizing submerged aquatic plants the method focuses on lake littoral margins where there is greatest public interaction and interest.

AB  - The efficiency, accuracy and universality of ecological assessment methods comprise an important foundation for comprehensive assessment and restoration of large river ecological health at the watershed scale. New evaluation metrics and methods are urgently needed to be developed to adapt the characteristics of large rivers, including geographical differences in surface runoff, regional ecological complexity, and seasonal changes. In this study, a bacteria-weighted index of biotic integrity was developed to assess the ecological health of large rivers (lrBW-IBI) based on compositional and functional characteristics of sediment bacterial communities from 33 sections of the lower mainstream of Yangtze River. Five key metrics were determined by range, responsiveness, and redundancy tests. Principal component analysis (PCA), entropy method, criteria importance through intercriteria correlation and random forest were applied to calculate weighted coefficients of key metrics. The optimal lrBW-IBI was observed through the sum of PCA weighted-metrics: the relative abundance of Latescibacteria (0.234), Gemmatimonadaceae (0.149), Nitrospira spp. (0.234), Rhizobiales (0.228), and nitrogenase NifH (0.156). According to PCA based lrBW-IBI, 12.12%, 24.24%, 39.39%, and 24.24% of river sections were labeled excellent, good, moderate, and relatively poor, respectively. The ecological status of the lower mainstream of the Yangtze River did not change significantly across seasons but declined gradually from upstream to downstream. This study provides a new assessment tool for the ecological health of large rivers and highlights the importance of microbial ecological index in river ecology.

Different kinds of water quality degradation were investigated in the streams running in the 'Appia Antica' Regional Park, placed in the southern suburbs of Rome. Water quality was assessed in 21 sampling points located in eight streams by the analysis of chemical [chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrates, ammonia, total phosphorus], biological (IBE index), microbial (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci, sulphite-reducing clostridia) ecosystemic (IFF index), and hydrological (flow) parameters. On the whole the results indicate an in depth degradation of water quality. However, IBE and IFF showed local condition of water stress that were not individuated by chemical parameters. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to highlight the different pressures on water quality of urban freshwaters. The presence of buffer zones in urban green areas does not avoid the impact arising from the surrounding urban area, (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia is an important geographical environment unit in the center of Eurasia. It is of great significance to the ecological protection and sustainable development of Central Asia to carry out dynamic monitoring and effective evaluation of the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin. In this study, the arid remote sensing ecological index (ARSEI) for large-scale arid areas was developed, which coupled the information of the greenness index, the salinity index, the humidity index, the heat index, and the land degradation index of arid areas. The ARSEI was used to monitor and evaluate the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin from 2000 to 2019. The results show that the greenness index, the humidity index and the land degradation index had a positive impact on the quality of the ecological environment in the Aral Sea Basin, while the salinity index and the heat index exerted a negative impact on the quality of the ecological environment. The eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin demonstrated a trend of initial improvement, followed by deterioration, and finally further improvement. The spatial variation of these changes was significant. From 2000 to 2019, grassland and wasteland (saline alkali land and sandy land) in the central and western parts of the basin had the worst ecological environment quality. The areas with poor ecological environment quality are mainly distributed in rivers, wetlands, and cultivated land around lakes. During the period from 2000 to 2019, except for the surrounding areas of the Aral Sea, the ecological environment quality in other areas of the Aral Sea Basin has been improved in general. The correlation coefficients between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the heat index and between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the humidity index were -0.593 and 0.524, respectively. Climate conditions and human activities have led to different combinations of heat and humidity changes in the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin. However, human activities had a greater impact. The ARSEI can quantitatively and intuitively reflect the scale and causes of large-scale and long-time period changes of the eco-environmental quality in arid areas; it is very suitable for the study of the eco-environmental quality in arid areas.

AB  - Condition index [CI= (meat weight x 100)/(total weight-shell weight)] of green mussels grown on longlines was monitored monthly for 2 years at 12 commercial farms in Pelorus-Kenepuru Sound. Water temperature and salinity, total particulate matter, chlorophyll a and particulate carbon were recorded at approximately 2-monthly intervals at six of the 12 CI stations. CI showed an annual cycle (high in autumn/winter/spring and low in summer) with year-to-year differences in amplitude, and a regional pattern (lowest at the most seaward stations, highest towards the upper reaches of the Sound). The environmental data paralleled the condition index data by showing gradients along the length of the Sound. Anomalies in the regional patterns resulted from localised environmental conditions occurring in major embayments off the main channel. On an industry-wide scale abiotic factors (temperature and salinity) were more highly correlated with mussel condition than factors measuring available food (chlorophyll a, carbon and particulates). However, at lower ambient food levels changes in food concentration were strongly associated with changes in CI. A food threshold, at about 200-mu-g C l-1. was identified, below which CI declined significantly. The variation in condition between years, months, and farms represents differences in meat yield which are economically significant.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural phenomenon. To effectively characterize the spatial extent and intensity of the phenomenon, multiple drought-related factors, such as precipitation, vegetation growth condition, and land surface temperature, should be considered comprehensively. However, the capability of each of these factors in drought monitoring varies with seasonal time. Thus, in formulating a drought index, different weights should be assigned to these factors at different time periods. This study proposes a novel remote sensing index, the Integrated Drought Condition Index (IDCI), for short-term drought monitoring. The index sets different weights for each month of the growing season into three components, i.e., precipitation, vegetation growth condition, and land surface temperature, based on the principle component analysis. To assess IDCI performance, the spatial drought conditions of the IDCI maps during the growing season in a typical dry year and individual month of August from 2003 to 2012 were compared with in situ drought indices in Northern China. Correlation analyses were performed between the IDCI and different timescale Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index values, and the year-to-year IDCI variations were compared with in situ drought indices. The results of the comparison and correlation analysis confirmed the effectiveness of IDCI in characterizing drought conditions and patterns.

AB  - This study seeks to define a bioassessment tool for the floodplain lakes of the lower Solimoes River (Amazonas, Brazil). We defined lakes in pristine condition as reference lakes and adapted a fish multimetric index of biotic integrity. The floodplain lakes analyzed were Baixio, Preto, Anana, Araca, Maraca and Poraque, located 30-400 km from Manaus, the state capital. To select the reference lakes we adapted a rapid bioassessment protocol that analyzes satellite imagines from Google Earth. Landscape characteristics were investigated in two different screening phases: preliminary (presence/absence) and final (semi-quantitative). Each screening phase used two landscape scales: buffer-zone (a 6 km-diameter circle around each lake) and local (an area extending 500 m from the lake's shoreline). The landscape attributes selected in these screening phases allowed us to define an Environmental Gradient Index (EGI) that represented the effect of the human presence on the lakes. Lakes Araca and Anana, which had no or very few signs of anthropogenic disturbance, were classified in the high EGI category and selected as reference lakes. A floodplain-lake index of biotic integrity (FL-IBI) was developed from twenty candidate fish assemblage metrics, of which four were selected after range, sensitivity, responsiveness and redundancy tests for inclusion in the final index (total number of species, total number of individuals, total number of individuals with moderate-high vulnerability and percentage of carnivores). Metrics were scored continuously from 0 to 10. Final FL-IBI scores were calculated by adding the scores for each selected metric and dividing the result by the number of metrics. To facilitate comparison with other indices, this was weighted to range from 0 to 100. The FL-IBI proved to be able to distinguish well between reference and non-reference lakes. Index scores had wide seasonal and temporal variability, largely because of the major changes in habitat caused by the intensity, duration, frequency and occurrence of the Solimoes flooding cycle. For the reference lakes, the lowest seasonal index variability (CV < 5%) was observed in the receding-water period, allowing us to consider this as the best index period for biomonitoring purposes. The greatest annual variability for the study period (2004-2007) was observed in 2005 ( CV > 20%) and was associated with the severe drought occurred in that year. These results show that the fish assemblages in the lakes studied are highly resilient and perfectly adapted to the hydrological cycle of the Solimoes River. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A multidisciplinary approach was used to estimate the pollution level of the marine environment in the North Eastern Adriatic by measurement of the isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13, delta N-15) metal/metalloids analyses (Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and Pb, including As speciation) in the Mytilus galloprovincialis, as well by using metallothioneins (MT) concentrations, micronuclei (MN) in gill cells and biological parameters (condition index and gonadosomatic index). Concentrations of MT were in the range from 44 to 175 mu g g(-1) wet matter tissue and were higher at the end of the winter season. The frequency of MN did not indicate an elevated level. Sewage sludge pollution was not confirmed. Elevated As concentrations in mussel are related to salinity and low nutrients concentrations and not to pollution. Elevated concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb were found in the Bay of Koper in comparison with the Bays of Strunjan and Piran. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human disturbances impact river basins by reducing the quality of, and services provided by, aquatic ecosystems. Conducting quantitative assessments of ecological security at the watershed scale is important for enhancing the water quality of river basins and promoting environmental management. In this study, China's Songhua River Basin was divided into 204 assessment units by combining watershed and administrative boundaries. Ten human threat factors were identified based on their significant influence on the river ecosystem. A modified ecological threat index was used to synthetically evaluate the ecological security, where frequency was weighted by flow length from the grids to the main rivers, while severity was weighted by the potential hazard of the factors on variables of river ecosystem integrity. The results showed that individual factors related to urbanization, agricultural development and facility construction presented different spatial distribution characteristics. At the center of the plain area, the provincial capital cities posed the highest level of threat, as did the municipal districts of prefecture-level cities. The spatial relationships between hot spot locations of the ecological threat index and water quality, as well as the distribution areas of critically endangered species, were analyzed. The sensitivity analysis illustrated that alteration of agricultural development largely changed the ecological security level of the basin. By offering a reference for assessing ecological security, this study can enhance water environmental planning and management.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on the ranges of variation of health related biochemical and haematological parameters in wildlife, but information is still scarce for enzymatic activities which can be extremely important in detecting potential responses to environmental change. In a Great Tit (Parus major) population, we describe the variation in relation to age, sex, season and year of: (1) morphological: body condition index, fat and muscle, (2) haematological: hematocrit, haemoglobin, white blood cell count and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, and (3) biochemical parameters: plasma protein and activities of plasma cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) activity and red blood cell glutathione peroxidase. Sex had significant effects on all morphological parameters except fat. Age significantly affected cholinesterase activities, H/L ratio and haemoglobin, and there was a significant interaction between sex and age affecting hematocrit. There were significant interactions of year and season affecting almost all parameters studied-body condition index, fat, protein, acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase activities, glutathione peroxidase activity and haemoglobin. This study indicates that these parameters are largely influenced by year and seasonal effects, besides the individual's intrinsic variation. Therefore, when evaluating experimental or environmental change effects, appropriate controls should be used.

AB  - Complex investigations of the Blagoevgradska Bistritsa River, left tributary of the trans-boundary Struma Riven were carried out in the summer of 2008. Seven representative sites were sampled Physico-chemical parameters such as water temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, oxygen saturation, conductivity, nitrates and phosphates were measured. The biological assessment was based on macroinvertebrate communities - one of the obligatory biological quality elements according to the Water Framework Directive requirements and the national legislation. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) was used for the explanation of the site-physico-chemical factors relationship. Indices of species diversity (c, e, H), saprobiological index (S-R), biotic index (BI) and trophic index (RETI/PETI) were used to determine the water quality and the ecological state of the water bodies.
   According to the values of the physico-chemical parameters, indices of species diversity and the saprobiological index, the water quality of the sites from the source to the city of Blagoevgrad was I - II category. The ecological state was assessed as high, according to Bland high and good, based on the trophic index RETI. The water quality at the Blagoevgradska Bistritsa mouth, influenced by the waste waters of the city of Blagoevgrad, was assessed as II - III category, and the ecological condition, as moderate and poor (BI) and bad (PETI). The distribution of the physico-chemical parameters at the ordination diagram divided the studied sites into two groups: upstream (clean, unaffected sites) and downstream (anthropogenically influenced sites) of the city of Blagoevgrad.
   Two periods of investigation (2002-2003 and 2008) and two standard methods for macrozoobenthos sampling (handnet sampling of aquatic benthic macroinvertebrates and quantitative samplers for benthic macroinvertebrates on stony substrata in shallow freshwater) were compared. The results showed that for a five-year period of time changes in the water quality and the ecological state of the studied sites had not been observed. The two sampling methods gave similar results as regards the values of the indices used.

AB  - Background: The organisms respond to changes in the environment, hence the reproductive process of an organism can be affected as a result of contamination. Chione undatella is a potential resource for fishing and cultivation, which has been intensively exploited for many years on the Mexican Pacific coast. Goals: The main objective of this study was to characterize the reproductive cycle and spawning temporality, estimate the size at first maturity, and determine if there is tissue damage that may have adverse effects on reproduction of C. undatella because of the contamination found in the mining port of Santa Rosalia, Gulf of California. Methods: Through histological analysis, the general condition index (GCI), and environmental parameters, we evaluated aspects of the reproductive biology and health of the frilled venus clam from the coastal area of the port of Santa Rosalia. Results: C. undatella has reproductive activity throughout the year, unrelated to the concentration of chlorophyll-a, or to temperature. An inverse correlation was found between the GCI and the phase of development with higher frequency in females. The size at first maturity is 57 mm LC. In the gonadal tissue (> 80% of the individuals) an infiltration of eosinophilic cells was observed in all phases of gonadal development with an intermediate to abundant intensity (> 60% of the organisms). Conclusions: Although C. undatella has reproductive activity throughout the year, the high prevalence of hemocytic infiltration in the gonadal tissue suggests a potential deficiency in its reproduction. We recommend more studies be undertaken to confirm this preliminary finding and determine the relationship of the deficiency with the contamination present in the area.

AB  - The possible use of quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton species diversity for water quality bioindication and for the search for ecologically admissible levels of abiotic factors is examined. Retrospective materials on the Don basin obtained from data of state environmental monitoring of freshwater in Russia are used. The effect produced on the characteristics by the diversity of errors in the calculation of the numbers of phytoplankton cells, the procedure used to assess rank distribution parameters, the adequacy of formal models of rank distributions, the relationship between the uniformity of rank distributions and species diversity, sampling season, water body type, and the geographic location of sampling site is analyzed. The obtained diversity characteristics are in agreement with the available monitoring data. Boundaries of the examined characteristics, corresponding to the well-being ranges of phytoplankton communities, were found. The ecologically admissible levels were calculated for the major abiotic factors.

AB  - Large state or regional environmental flow programs, such as the one based on the California Environmental Flows Framework, rely on broadly applicable relationships between flow and ecology to inform management decisions. California, despite having high flow and bioassessment data density, has not established relationships between specific elements of the annual hydrograph and biological stream condition. To address this, we spatially and temporally linked USGS gage stations and biological assessment sites in California to identify suitable paired sites for comparisons of streamflow alteration with biological condition at a statewide scale. Flows were assessed using a set of functional flow metrics that provide a comprehensive way to compare alteration and seasonal variation in streamflow across different locations. Biological response was evaluated using the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and Algal Stream Condition Index (ASCI), which quantify biological conditions by translating benthic invertebrate or algal resources and watershed-scale environmental data into an overall measure of stream health. These indices provide a consistent statewide standard for interpreting bioassessment data, and thus, a means of quantitatively comparing stream conditions throughout the state. The results indicate that indices of biological stream condition were most closely associated with flow alteration in seasonality and timing metrics, such as fall pulse timing, dry-season timing, and wet season timing. Magnitude metrics such as dry-season baseflow, wet season baseflow, and the fall pulse magnitude were also important in influencing biological stream conditions. Development of ecological flow needs in large-scale environmental programs should consider that alteration to any of the seasonal flow components (e.g., dry-season baseflow, fall pulse flow, wet-season baseflow, spring recession flow) may be important in restructuring biological communities.

AB  - Mussels from the Portuguese coast collected during several seasons of the year have shown Po-210 and Pb-210 body burdens (Bq mussel(-1)) that increased with mussels' body size but displayed significant decrease in radionuclide concentrations (Bq kg(-1)). For example, the increase of mussel size from 2.5 cm to 5.0 cm maximum shell length corresponded in average to a 50% decrease of Po-210 activity concentration in soft tissues from 1065 Bq kg (-1) (dw) to 540 Bq kg(-1) (dw). A similar reduction in concentration was observed for Pb-210. The physiological condition of mussels, relating to fat and glycogen storage, had an effect on radionuclide concentrations, although the total body burden of radionuclide in mussels remained nearly constant throughout the year. These factors may play an important role in data interpretation for environmental monitoring programmes. Besides the mussel size and condition index, due to the inter-individual variation even inside narrow mussel size classes, the sample size, i.e., the number of specimens in one mussel sample is another key factor to be considered when obtaining environmentally representative radionuclide concentrations.

AB  - This paper aims at collating and reviewing all data collected using the ESCA (Ecological Status of Coralligenous Assemblages) index from 2009 to 2018 during different local applications, in order to evaluate at large spatial scale its effectiveness and temporal variability. To this scope, the large-scale response of ESCA to anthropogenic disturbance was tested comparing ESCA values calculated at 42 sites of the Western Mediterranean Sea with the anthropization index. Moreover, the sensitivity of ESCA to punctual human disturbance and the robustness of the index across the natural space and time variability were evaluated. The large spatial scale study showed significant correlation between ESCA and the anthropization index, while very low correlation was detected when descriptors of ESCA (i.e., sensitivity levels, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity) were considered separately. The three impact evaluation studies highlighted significantly lower values of the ESCA index in disturbed conditions than in the control ones. The coastal monitoring study confirmed the robustness of the index which showed a high ecological quality of coralligenous reefs in reference conditions compared to more anthropized sites, and this pattern was maintained throughout the ten years study period. Application of the ESCA index to different situations tested positively its sensibility to different levels and type of human disturbance and its stability with respect to regional spatio-temporal variability. This confirm the reliability of the ESCA index already tested on the local and annual scale, thus broadening its range of application and validating it on a wider space-time scale.

AB  - This study analyses the environmental sustainability status of China using a modified ecological footprint (EF) method which takes into account the freshwater ecological footprint, improves the energy ecological footprint, and amends the equivalence factor and yield factor. Then the linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and non-linear artificial neural network (ANN) models are applied to predict future ecological security. The results show that: (1) The per capita EF increased by three times from 1978 to 2013, whereas the per capita ecological carrying capacity experienced only a slight increase although the equivalence and yield factors were both enhanced. (2) The 'degree of ecological security' appeared to show a tendency to increase, indicating that China is in a 'pretty unsafe' ecological state. (3) EF intensity, which is used to represent the resource consumption level corresponding to unit economic output, indicated that the utilisation ratio of Chinese natural resources was greatly enhanced during the study period. (4) The ecological footprint diversity index, and ecological and economic coordination coefficient, peaked in the 1990s and then began to fall, indicating that China's ecological environment, as well as its coordination with the economy, was considered to be better in the 1990s but then gradually deteriorated. (5) The predictions of ARIMA-ANN model indicated that the degree of ecological security in China would reach an unsafe state in a few years if certain effective measures were not taken. These findings could be helpful for decision-makers as they strive to make a better package of plans to ensure an ecological balance and a more sustainable future.

AB  - During environmental monitoring in the territory of licensed areas of the north of Western Siberia (YNAO), substances-indicators of pollution of the environment by drilling waste were identified. It has been established that the discharge significance of phenol, chlorides, Na+ and Ba2+ is most pronounced when discharging stratal waters. In the drill cuttings, the high level of chloride, petroleum hydrocarbon, Cu, Sr and Ba concentration was noted. To assess the ecological state of the natural environment in the gas condensate fields, a set of bioindication methods including determination of the chemical composition of soils and plants and biotesting of water extracts of soils using the Chlorella vulgaris and Daphnia magna test objects was applied. The content of heavy metals Zn, Cd, Cu, Sr, Fe, Mn, Cr, Pb, Ba, Co, and Ni is determined in 8 plant species. Indicators of early trends in the transformation of ecosystems under the influence of anthropogenic load have been identified. There are Ledum decumbens and Cladonia stellaris. The convergence of the results of methods of biotesting, the content of pollutants in soils and plants are established. The role of biological indication methods under unobtrusive changes in the state of the environment under conditions of gas condensate deposits is shown.

AB  - The Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is a conceptual model that describes changes in aquatic communities under increasing levels of anthropogenic stress. The BCG helps decision-makers connect narrative water quality goals (e.g., maintenance of natural structure and function) to quantitative measures of ecological condition by linking index thresholds based on statistical distributions (e.g., percentiles of reference distributions) to expert descriptions of changes in biological condition along disturbance gradients. As a result, the BCG may be more meaningful to managers and the public than indices alone. To develop a BCG model, biological response to stress is divided into 6 levels of condition, represented as changes in biological structure (abundance and diversity of pollution sensitive versus tolerant taxa) and function. We developed benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) and algal BCG models for California perennial wadeable streams to support interpretation of percentiles of reference-based thresholds for bioassessment indices (i.e., the California Stream Condition Index [CSCI] for BMI and the Algal Stream Condition Index [ASCI] for diatoms and soft-bodied algae). Two panels (one of BMI ecologists and the other of algal ecologists) each calibrated a general BCG model to California wadeable streams by first assigning taxa to specific tolerance and sensitivity attributes, and then independently assigning test samples (264 BMI and 248 algae samples) to BCG Levels 1-6. Consensus on the assignments was developed within each assemblage panel using a modified Delphi method. Panels then developed detailed narratives of changes in BMI and algal taxa that correspond to the 6 BCG levels. Consensus among experts was high, with 81% and 82% expert agreement within 0.5 units of assigned BCG level for BMIs and algae, respectively. According to both BCG models, the 10th percentiles index scores at reference sites corresponded to a BCG Level 3, suggesting that this type of threshold would protect against moderate changes in structure and function while allowing loss of some sensitive taxa. The BCG provides a framework to interpret changes in aquatic biological condition along a gradient of stress. The resulting relationship between index scores and BCG levels and narratives can help de-cision-makers select thresholds and communicate how these values protect aquatic life use goals.

AB  - Sufficient, clean and secure energy is the main driver for a worldwide growing welfare and economic development of a society. Environmental concerns on the expansion of offshore renewable energy and its impact on marine organisms need to be scientifically assessed for risks and consequences. In order to observe the effects of an operating wind farm on fish, we studied the rather stationary and benthic-living fish species viviparous eelpout(Zoarces viviparous) as model indicator organisms. We compared local populations of viviparous eelpout in the Lillgrund Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) with natural sites in the Oresund strait in Sweden. Eelpout studies on population dynamics, biometrics, reproductive success and fry development were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Condition index, histosomatic index, gonadosomatic index were measured additionally. Our findings showed that Lillgrund OWF neither had an impact on the condition index (CI), nor on brood development of female viviparous eelpout. Furthermore, populations size estimates in Lillgrund indicated that eelpout neither specifically aggregated in nor avoided the offshore wind farm, and no clear reef effect attracting eelpout to the foundations and scour protections of the OWF was observed. Our conclusion is that the operating wind farm did not have any potentially negative effects, since we did not observe any negative effects neither on the individual health of eelpout nor of the reproductive performance. We suggest that eelpout which may also be used as an indicator species for the environmental status of Lillgrund, as well as for other offshore wind farms and marine renewable energy installations, both in the Baltic and coastal waters in northern Europe.

AB  - Muskegon Lake was designated an Area of Concern because of severe environmental impairments from direct discharge of industrial and municipal wastes. Since diversion of all municipal and industrial wastewater in 1973, few studies have assessed ecological changes associated with improved water quality. We examined distributions and long-term changes in the benthic macroinvertebrate community at 2 7 sites. Distributions were evaluated relative to distance from the river mouth, water depth, grain size, and known areas of sediment contamination. Temporal changes were assessed relative to wastewater diversion. Oligochaeta and Chironomidae dominated the community, and the oligochaete trophic condition index indicated that, in 1999, the lake was generally mesotrophic to eutrophic. Cluster analysis resulted in four distinct site groupings. A cluster of sites near the river mouth had the highest total density (9,375 m(-2)) and lowest diversity (Shannon Weaver Index 1.05) suggesting an enriched habitat. A site cluster in the south central region had the lowest oligochaete density (2,782 m(-2)), lowest oligochaete trophic condition index scores (1.00), and highest diversity (2.24), suggesting the best habitat. The chironomid community in this site cluster was dominated by predatory species, possibly resulting from high concentrations of heavy metals at some sites. Densities of all major taxonomic groups increased significantly between 1972 and 1999. Decreasing proportions of oligochaetes (0.85 to 0.68) and increasing diversity suggest improved environmental conditions over this period. Evidence suggests that changes in Muskegon Lake's benthic community were more a result of wastewater diversion than Dreissena invasion.

AB  - Elevated concentrations of acidity and metals in acid mine drainage (AMD) may be effectively addressed by active and passive treatment technologies. However, typical evaluations consider only chemical water quality with little if any regard for biological metrics. Robust evaluations including both chemical and biological indicators of water quality improvement are needed. In this study, injection of alkaline fluidized bed ash (FBA) into a flooded underground coal mine was coupled with a five-cell passive treatment system to ameliorate an abandoned AMD discharge in eastern Oklahoma. The passive system included process units promoting both aerobic and anaerobic treatment mechanisms. Resulting water quality changes and biological responses were evaluated. Organisms of two distinct functional groups (the filter-feeding mollusk Corbicula fluminea and the wide-spectrum feeding fish Lepomis macrochirus) were exposed to mine waters in several treatment cells. The combination of treatment technologies was hypothesized to limit potential negative effects on these aquatic organisms. Tissues were harvested and analyzed for concentrations of several metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Ni, Cu and Zn) of interest. Organismal responses, such as hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and condition index, did not vary significantly among organisms exposed within different treatment cells when compared to non-AMD impaired waters. Metal tissue accumulation trends, compared to aqueous concentrations, were observed for Fe, Ni and Zn. Exposure experiments with these two organisms indicated that FBA introductions coupled with passive treatment decreased the potential adverse effects of AMD to biological systems.

AB  - The monitoring on abalone banks has been intensified since the declining of wild global production due to overfishing, disease, environmental changes and poaching. This is to support timely decisions to execute actions for mitigation, prevention, conservation and fisheries production benefits. Eight morphophysiological indices for green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi, 1845 from the Pacific coast of Mexico were evaluated and their performance were elucidated due to their potential as monitoring tools. The Boolootian's gonadic index (GIB) and gonadic area index (GAIA) were informative of complete reproductive cycle, thus are reliable for reproductive patterns monitoring. While gonadic index (GI) and gonadic index of calculated mass (MGI) were suitable indicators only of spawning. The condition index of calculated mass (MCI), foot index of calculated mass (MFI), condition index (CI) and foot index (FI) proved temporal changes of soft tissues condition. The MFI clearly defined the best nutritional status of the green abalone foot between March to August, indicating the time when fishing organizations can get the best yields and highest foot quality at Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Therefore MFI can be used as cheap and quick information to make decisions on the start-up of fishing operations and abalone condition monitoring.

AB  - The coastal zone as interface between land and sea faces much pressure from human activities. These pressures make it difficult for the coastal zones to fulfil their natural functions, so threatening the state of coastal environments and making them vulnerable to coastal disasters and degradation. This study aimed to test whether high resolution remote sensing imagery can be used to assess the integrity of coastal Strandveld vegetation at the high spatial resolution required as baseline information for local environmental management. The study focused on the Cape Flats Dune Strandveld vegetation in northern False Bay near Cape Town, South Africa. The approach modifies and adopts a method developed by Liick-Vogel et al. (2013) for a remote sensing derived habitat intactness assessment for the Sandveld region at South Africa's west coast.
   A regression analysis was performed on the eight spectral bands of two WorldView-2 images and five image derivatives to evaluate the most suitable bands for producing an ecosystem integrity index. Based on the results, only the RED and NIR bands were required to perform a decision tree classification for the integrity classification, which significantly simplifies the application and opens the way for transfer to sensors with similar spectral bands.
   The overall accuracy of the results was 80.5% with a kappa value of 0.75. This means that this approach provides results accurate enough for coastal management and conservation applications at a local scale. A further finding is the importance of seasonality to delineate natural and alien vegetation accurately. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drought is one of the major environmental disasters in southern Africa. In recent years, the damage from droughts to the environment and economies of some countries was extensive, and the death toll of livestock and wildlife was unprecedented. Weather data often come from a very sparse meteorological network, incomplete and/or not always available in good time to enable relatively accurate and timely large scale drought detection and monitoring. Therefore, data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board the NOAA polar-orbiting satellites have been studied as a tool for drought monitoring and climate impact assessment in southern Africa. The AVHRR-based vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) developed recently were used in this study because in other parts of the globe they showed goon results when used for drought detection and tracking, monitoring excessive soil wetness, assessment of weather impacts on vegetation, and evaluation of vegetation health and productivity. The results clearly show that temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in southern Africa can be detected, tracked, and mapped by the VCI and TCI indices. These results were numerically validated by in situ data such as precipitation, atmospheric anomaly fields, and agricultural crop yield. In the later case, it lans found that usable corn yield scenarios can be constructed from the VCI and TCI at approximately 6 (in some regions up to 13) weeks prior to harvest time. These indices can be especially beneficial when used together with ground data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon that causes a lot of damages annually in various sectors, including agriculture and natural resources. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of meteorological drought index on vegetation index. For this purpose, the standard precipitation index (SPI) as a meteorological drought index is calculated using the precipitation data of 28 meteorological stations located on the area of Lorestane province, Iran, during the years 1987-2017. Then, the vegetation condition index (VCI) is computed using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images that obtained from MODIS images of Terra satellite during 2000-2017. Dry, normal, and wet years were obtained based on the SPI results for 2008, 2013, and 2016, respectively. SPI and VCI were correlated using Pearson's correlation method. The results of the relationship between VCI and SPI showed that the highest Pearson correlation coefficient related to 9month SPI in November was equal to 0.64. Multivariate linear regression was also performed between SPI and VCI, and the results showed that SPI was significantly correlated with VCI at 5% level over a period of 9 and 12 months. Finally, a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the compliance of the SPI and VCI drought classes. Results showed that the VCI had the highest compliance in the moderate drought class with SPI.

AB  - Anthropogenic effects on ecosystems are one of the main causes of reduction in the planet's biodiversity. The present study aimed to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on the body condition of the Colombian endemic lizard Anolis antonii. Two populations from the department of Tolima (Colombia) were chosen for this work, one located in a secondary forest and the other in an agricultural area. Between January-June 2014, visual encounter surveys were simultaneously performed from 7: 00-18: 00 h in both habitats. Individuals were captured manually and sex, snout-vent length (SVL) and body mass (BM) were recorded for each. The Body Condition Index (BCI) was calculated from the residuals of the linear regression between BM and SVL, which was compared between the two populations (60 adults in the secondary forest and 52 in the agricultural area). No significant variation in SVL or BM was recorded in the inter-and intra-population comparisons, but the BM of lizards was closely related to SVL and the BCI of the population from the agricultural area was significantly lower than that of the secondary forest population. These results indicate that habitat disturbance as a consequence of agricultural practices has a negative impact on the body condition of A. antonii, which could reduce its abilities to compete and survive.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystem biomonitoring tools are largely lacking for many developing countries, resulting in adoption of tools developed from other countries/regions. In many instances, however, the applicability of adopted tools to the new system has not been explicitly evaluated. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of foreign diatom-based water quality assessment indices to urban streams in Zimbabwe, with the view of stimulating research to develop improved approaches for assessing ecological integrity of lotic systems in the country. The study evaluated the relationship between measured water quality variables and diatom index scores. The study found a high degree of concordance between water quality variables and diatom index scores. Thus, the indices proved useful in providing an indication of the quality of the investigated waters. This could be attributed to the occurrence of many widely distributed diatom species that have similar environmental tolerances to those recorded elsewhere. Diatom indices which exhibited consistent classifications and strong correlations with water quality variables such as Trophic Index, Saprobic Index, Pampean Diatom Index, Biological Index of Water Quality and Leclercq Index are recommended for use in the country. However, ecological requirements of some diatom species from Zimbabwe need to be clarified and incorporated in a diatom-based water quality assessment protocol unique to the country.

AB  - The petroleum spilt by the tanker "Erika" contained environmentally high concentrations of nickel (45 mg kg(-1)) and vanadium (83 mg kg(-1)). Our aim was to show that nickel and vanadium concentrations in marine organisms could be used as tracers of their exposure to oil deposits along the coast. Two biomarkers were determined, condition index (CI) and metallothionein levels. Samples were collected monthly from January to May 2000 from five sites along the coast of Vendee and Loire Atlantique: (1) Lerat, (2) La Govelle, (3) Saint Gildas, (4) La Bernerie and (5) La Fosse. Among benthic invertebrates, mussels Mytilus edulis (filter-feeders), periwinkles Littorina littorea (grazing-feeders) and dogwhelks Nucella lapillus (carnivora, bivalve predators) were selected. In addition, mussels were collected from a control site, Fier d'Ars (Re Island). The species chosen as bioindicators have responded to the presence of oil in their environment by accumulating nickel and vanadium. The bioaccumulation of vanadium occurred early one month after oil spill whereas nickel bioaccumulation was deferred, probably as a consequence of a lower stability of vanadylporphyrins compared to nickelporphyrins which are known in particular for their role in stabilizing emulsions (film at the water/oil interface). Interspecific differences may be explained by different food habits: periwinkles grazed contaminated algae; mussels as filter-feeders retained particles and colloids from the water column; dogwhelks fed on mussels. Spatio-temporal changes of nickel and vanadium concentrations may result from (i) the arrival of new oil slicks, (ii) the action of cleaning of the coasts contributing to the re-suspension of petroleum. In all of the three species, few changes of the Cl were observed from site to site. CI variations were linked to sexual ripening in mussels. Mussels originating from the control site showed NIT concentrations significantly lower than those in specimens from impacted sites. The highest MT concentrations were observed in January and February, and then a consistent decrease was registered in March and May. NIT concentrations in periwinkles increased very significantly in March and May. An increase in MT concentrations was also shown at this period in dogwhelks. Depending on the species, positive correlations were shown between NIT and nickel and/or vanadium concentrations.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is observed widely in plants and often studied with reaction norms for adult plant or end-of-season traits. Uncovering genetic, environmental and developmental patterns behind the observed phenotypic variation under natural field conditions is needed. Using a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genetic population evaluated for plant height in seven natural field conditions, we investigated the major pattern that differentiated these environments. We then examined the physiological relevance of the identified environmental index by investigating the developmental trajectory of the population with multistage height measurements in four additional environments and conducting crop growth modelling. We found that diurnal temperature range (DTR) during the rapid growth period of sorghum development was an effective environmental index. Three genetic loci (Dw1, Dw3 and qHT7.1) were consistently detected for individual environments, reaction-norm parameters across environments and growth-curve parameters through the season. Their genetic effects changed dynamically along the environmental gradient and the developmental stage. A conceptual model with three-dimensional reaction norms was proposed to showcase the interconnecting components: genotype, environment and development. Beyond genomic and environmental analyses, further integration of development and physiology at the whole-plant and molecular levels into complex trait dissection would enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation.

AB  - In recent years, a decline in competitiveness and in the quality of the business environment measurements has been reflected in the Slovak Republic, as noted, for example, in the assessments of the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, as well as in the business environment index (BEI from Business Alliance of Slovakia PAS), data from which we have used in our research. A multiple regression analysis along with the correlation analysis confirmed our assumption that in the Slovak Republic a state of institutional hysteresis exists. The hysteresis effect indicates rigidity despite the economic recovery, not restoring the original balance after a certain failure in the economic process. In our case, many external environment subindeces tend to decline while macroeconomic variables (employment, value added, R&D expenditures, revenues from corporate taxes) grow. On the other hand, the internal factors of a company, through which it itself affects the environment, such as the level of liquidity or innovation, is growing. We conclude that the companies we examined have adapted. The process of improving the assessment of the country (corruption, law enforcement, equality before the law, functioning of the judiciary) will become much more expensive over time. The result of this change should be an entrepreneurial environment in which the entrepreneur does not have to deal with the ongoing optimization of taxes and levies, a condition which in the long run would lead to the economic recovery in the Slovak Republic and to improvements in competitiveness.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic factors play an essential role in the structuring of natural communities. Aquatic ecosystems have complex interaction networks, encompassing predator/prey relationships and structural support. Among aquatic organisms, the order Odonata is a model group for understanding those relationships since they can be both predators and prey. Our hypotheses were that Zygoptera are (i) influenced positively by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and the Habitat Integrity Index (HIE), and negatively by fish and macrophytes; and (ii) Anisoptera are affected positively by EPT and macrophytes. and negatively by fish and HIE. We found that Zygoptera were affected by the fish functional trophic groups, while Anisoptera were affected by macrophytes, EPT, fish and HII. Macrophytes affected anisopterans positively because they provide perching sites for adults. The results for EPT and HIV may be related since these organisms are also sensitive to environmental changes. More open areas have lower HII values and the negative relationship with Anisoptera may be explained by physiological constraints. The negative relationship between EPT and Anisoptera could be explained by the low occurrence of EPT in open sites, which are the sites that were highly rich in Anisoptera. Finally. the dominance of specific functional trophic groups of fish influences Odonata suborders in different ways. In conclusion, the results show the importance of ecological interactions for Odonata in Amazonian streams in both direct and indirect ways.

AB  - Agaves can grow in marginal arid and semiarid lands where their special ecological and physiological adaptations to environmental conditions give them the potential to produce substantial biomass. Agave americana was the first agave species shown to be a Crassulacean Acid Metabolism plant, with CO2 uptake occurring primarily at night and with high water-use efficiency (photosynthesis/transpiration). A. salmiana and A. mapisaga can have high nocturnal net CO2 uptake rates and high productivities averaging 40 tonnes dry weight ha-1 yr-1. Agaves can benefit from the increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels accompanying global climate change. An Environmental Productivity Index can predict the effects of soil and environmental factors on CO2 uptake and hence on the regions appropriate for cultivating agaves. In turn, their increased cultivation can support the production of innovative earth-friendly commodities that can be used as new bioenergy feedstocks.

AB  - Water quality was assessed using samples collected at 11 sites, which were located along the Slupia River within the city of Slupsk and differed in the extent of riverbed transformations. The ecological state of the river section examined was determined using biological and chemical analyses in compliance with the biomonitoring guidelines. Water quality was found to be good (class I) as regards the pH and the concentrations of biogenic substances and chlorides. BOD(5) alone showed increased levels at sampling sites with major transformations in the riverbed. Water quality was also assessed by analyzing the macrozoobenthos with the aid of such bioindicators as BMWP-PL, ASPT, OQR and the Margalef biodiversity index (d). The comparison of these bioindicators revealed that within the urban area the ecological state of the river water was not as good as could have been inferred from the values of its chemical quality parameters. The investigated section of the Slupia River was characterized by waters of class III and class IV quality, which substantiates the negative influence of urbanization on riverine ecosystems. The study has demonstrated that riverbed transformations due to partitioning or placing concrete elements inhibit the growth of hydrobionts and thus deteriorate the ecological state of the river.

AB  - Clarias gariepinus and Oreochrornis niloticus are two hot-water fish species of African origin that have been recently reported to occur unnaturally in hot-water resources and springs in the Sakarya River Basin (northwestern Turkey). Within effective planning strategies to maintain native biodiversity, monitoring fishes' well-being can be useful to evaluate the status of nonnative fish populations and their degree of adaptation to new environments. Relative weight (W-s) is a condition index widely used to estimate the well-being of fish by comparing the actual weight of a specimen with a standard weight (W-s) that is the ideal weight of that fish at that length. In this study, length and weight data of C. gariepinus and O. niloticus, collected throughout the Sakarya River Basin, were used to estimate W, equations. The resulting W-s equations were log(10)Ws = -3.668 + 1.885 log(10)TL + 0.2087 (log(10)TL)(2) (TL range: 18-45 cm) for C gariepinus and log(10)W(s) = -8.796 + 6.751 log(10)TL - 0.8479 (log(10)TL) (TL range: 8-28 cm) for O. niloticus. The use of these W-s equations to estimate the fishes' condition is suggested as a monitoring tool to assess the status and the best management actions of these two nonnative species populations throughout the Sakarya River Basin.

AB  - Mussels were translocated from a shell-fish breeding area (Sete, on the French Mediterranean coast) to sites exposed to trace clement inputs in April 2000. They were recovered 3 months later. Whole soft tissues from all of the sites (n = 97) were analysed for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. Metallothioneins (MTs) ere also measured in the digestive gland and in the remaining tissues (allowing calculation of whole soft tissue concentrations) at 22 of the 97 sites. MT concentrations in the digestive gland and the whole soft tissues were strongly correlated. The condition index varied with food availability at different sites. This did not influenced MT concentrations in the whole soft tissues, whereas the condition index was negatively correlated to trace element concentration. A model is proposed to minimize this influence of condition, Metal concentrations adjusted Using this Model showed significant correlations with MT levels for those metals (cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc) that are known to bind to this protein, with the exception of mercury. Even in moderately contaminated sites, measurement of the MT level in the soft tissues of mussels as generally able to discriminate between different levels of contamination, allowing the use of a simplified procedure compared with dissection of the digestive gland. It is recommended to avoid translocation and sampling during the reproductive period, which is well documented for commercial species such as Mytilus sp.

AB  - Relative weight (W-r) is an index of condition that enables evaluation of the well-being of fish by comparing the actual weight of a specimen with the ideal weight of a specimen of the same species and the same length that is in good physiological condition (i.e., the standard weight [W-s]). This index was primarily developed to assess the status of sport fishes. Recently, however, many authors have encouraged the use of this index as a fisheries assessment tool for nongame species as well, especially those that are endangered or threatened. Length and weight data on brook chub Squalius lucumonis, an Italian endemic species listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, were collected across its area of distribution and used to compute a standard weight (W-s) equation by means of the empirical percentile method. The W-s equation thus obtained (log(10)W(s) = -7.75 + 5.75 log(10)[total length {TL}] -0.66 [log(10)TL](2); TL range of application = 90-210 mm) was not biased by length and is recommended as a way to compute Wr for brook chub.

AB  - The objectives of the present study is to describe the size for exploitation and gonadal maturation of L. pectinata in Pecas Island in Parana coast. Twenty two individuals were sampled every month, from an intertidal flat of the Pecas River, Municipality of Guaraquecaba, during two periods - summer/autumn and winter of the 2009. Environmental parameter data was obtained at the same time of the biological sampling: temperature, salinity and seawater transparency at the Pecas River mouth. The animals' height, length, width, gross weight, wet weight of meat and dry weight of meat were measured at the lab. The gonad development stages (GDS), condition index (CI) and yield index (Y) were calculated. Sex identification was conducted by direct observation of the gonads and gametes under an optic microscope. Individuals were classified as males (M), females (F) or undetermined (U). The medium height observed was of 49.62 +/- 6.84 mm. Period of more expressive gonad repletion were observed in summer when water temperature was higher. Results of GDS in both periods showed a predominance of partially filled gonad stages. This may be related with the fact that L. pectinata has intense gametogenesis activity, that is, the organisms do not have a resting interval, but go back to gonad restructuring rapidly after releasing the gametes. The continuity of the reproductive cycle of the specimens found in both studied periods could demonstrate a possible continuous reproduction of the species and a size for exploitation above 40.00 mm of height.

AB  - Non-wadeable rivers are relatively understudied compared to smaller, wadeable streams. Currently, protocols exist in most states, including Michigan, to evaluate the ecological condition of wadeable streams, but few protocols exist for larger, non-wadeable rivers. The goal of this research was to develop a multimetric index of biological integrity for Michigan's non-wadeable rivers, and we sampled 28 unique river reaches in Michigan that encompassed a wide range of human impacts and ecological conditions. In each reach, we collected physical, chemical, and macroinvertebrate samples. Using several techniques to eliminate redundancy among metrics and identify those biological attributes that correlated with anthropogenic influences, we developed a useful protocol that will allow the rapid bioassessment of such rivers in Michigan. When used together with the Non-wadeable Habitat Index, the Non-wadeable Index of Biotic Integrity (NW-IBI) will allow objective evaluation of non-wadeable rivers in Michigan.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variability in fish tissue lipid content may reflect resource availability, reproductive or maturity state, or environmental suitability. Here, we analyzed nonpolar (storage) lipid and morphometric condition indices of black sea bass (Centropristis striata) collected from coastal waters of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean from New Jersey to North Carolina, USA. We hypothesized that the elemental ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) within C. striata white muscle and liver tissue would be a robust proxy for nonpolar lipid content (NPLC) and that NPLC would predictably covary with traditional condition indices. Further, we analyzed our NPLC tissue indices to determine how regional and biological patterns in muscle and liver NPLC aligned with traditional condition indices. Our results indicated that muscle tissue NPLC was low compared to liver tissue, and regression analysis revealed strong positive relationships between C:N and NPLC for both tissues (muscle-best fit was linear; liver-best fit was asymptotic nonlinear). Correlations of muscle and liver NPLC with other condition indices were index and region dependent (e.g., a reproductive index was positively correlated with muscle NPLC, but negatively correlated with liver NPLC). Tissue NPLC and standard condition indices differed significantly as a function of region, sex, and fish length, although the patterns were not consistent across the different indices. Our results support the use of muscle and liver C:N values to estimate tissue-specific C. striata NPLC. Further, our results indicate that NPLC indices provide additional insight into C. striata physiological condition and could assist studies examining habitat suitability across large spatial or temporal scales.

AB  - The oyster pea crab Zaops ostreum (Say, 1817), is a parasite of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica Gmelin (1791). This study examined the frequency of occurrence and impact of pea crabs on adult (50-70 mm shell height [SH]) oysters from natural intertidal reefs in Hewletts Creek, Wilmington, NC and artificially created intertidal reefs from Jones Island, NC. The reefs at Hewletts Creek and Jones Island were also sampled in the fall of 2012 to quantify the presence of pea crabs in two co-occurring bivalve species, the scorched mussel Brachidontes exustus (Linneaus, 1758), and the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn, 1817). To evaluate the impact of pea crabs on juvenile oysters (mean SH 11.07 +/- 0.16 mm), oysters were deployed in Hewletts Creek at three densities during July 2013 and then retrieved in October 2013. The percent occurrence of pea crabs in adult oysters was low on the natural reefs (1%-3.7%), greater on the created reefs (10%), whereas the percent occurrence in the deployed juvenile oysters ranged from 22.5% to 27.6%. The condition index of oysters from all treatments was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in the presence of a pea crab; however, pea crabs did not influence (P > 0.05) oyster SH-length ratios. Juvenile oyster densities did not influence (P > 0.05) the incidence of pea crabs, although carapace width of pea crabs increased (P = 0.05) with decreased densities. On the naturally occurring reefs, pea crabs were found in scorched mussels (2.5% incidence) and ribbed mussels (2.0% incidence), but on the created reefs at Jones Island, pea crabs were only found in ribbed mussels (2.0% incidence). Results of this study highlight the impact of this parasite on the host oyster and the potential of this parasite to infect a significant portion of the younger oyster population, which may influence oyster population dynamics, as indicated by low infestation rates in adult oysters. This study also provided a quantitative foundation for understanding the prevalence of pea crabs in alternative hosts, as the pea crab population may be underestimated if multiple hosts are used.

AB  - Measuring fish condition should link ecosystem drivers with population dynamics, if the underlying physiological basis for variations in condition indices are understood. We evaluated traditional (K, K-n, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, energy density, and percent dry weight of muscle (%DWM) and liver (%DWL)) and newer (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and scaled mass index (SMI)) condition indices to track seasonal cycles in three flatfishes - winter founder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus; three stocks), yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea; three stocks), and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus; one stock) - with contrasting life histories in habitat, feeding, and reproduction. The %DWM and %DWL were good proxies for energy density (r(2) > 0.96) and more strongly related to K, K-n, and SMI than to BIA metrics. Principal component analysis indicated many metrics performed similarly across species; some were confounded by size, sex, and maturity along PC1, while others effectively characterized condition along PC2. Stock differences were along PC1 in winter flounder, reflecting different sizes across stocks, whereas in yellowtail flounder differences occurred along PC2 related to condition. These comparisons, within and across species, highlight the broad applicability of some metrics and limitations in others.

AB  - With the rapid development of urban agglomerations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), an increasing number of ecological problems have been exposed to the surrounding coastal zones. The timely and accurate understanding of the eco-environment in PRE has become of increasing concern. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate multi-temporal eco-environment conditions and then detect the conflicting patterns of the eco-environment under the influence of coastal exploitation in PRE. The ecological index was derived from remote sensing images by means of principal component analysis, and the composite coastal development index was then constructed to characterize the coastal exploitation from the perspective of ecological influence, which was implemented by using the panel data analysis. This method was verified with a significant test accuracy of 0.9. Based on this, the coupling coordination patterns of the coastal economy?environment system were disclosed for all six prefectural units at both the pixel scale and the city scale. The results showed that the coupling coordination degree and inner coupling relationships in each city presented periodical characteristics, with the highest values in 2008 and the lowest values in 1988. The dominant conflict between coastal exploitation and the eco-environment in each period was capricious. This evaluation will provide a reference for decision-making in coastal zone planning and ecological red line policy to encourage the sustainable development of coastal zones.

AB  - Intermittent streams occur across global regions, and are increasingly recognized to support high biodiversity and perform important ecological roles within catchments. New tools are needed to better characterize biotic responses to the full spectrum of environmental conditions that occur in these dynamic systems, because the biological indices developed to assess ecological responses to flow in perennial rivers may be inaccurate in intermittent streams. We present the Monitoring Intermittent Streams index (MIS-index), a new biological index that can be used to assess invertebrate responses to environmental changes spanning flowing, ponded and drying states. As well as fully aquatic taxa, the index includes seini-aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates from marginal habitats, which arc collected during the standard surveys used by regulatory agencies to assess ecological quality. We explore how including these taxa within an index informs our understanding of aquatic-terrestrial invertebrate community responses to changing habitat composition, as intermittent streams transition from lotic to lentic then drier conditions. We explain the development of the MIS-index and explore its performance compared with other indices. We suggest index combinations that can be used to detect different aspects of ecological responses to variation in instream conditions, and highlight the advantages of including semi-aquatic and terrestrial taxa. We call for researchers to test the performance of the MIS-index across a wide range of intermittent stream types, to enable its development into an internationally applicable tool for the holistic assessment of ecological responses to changing hydrological conditions including drying.

AB  - Bioindicators are often more sensitive indicators of both biodiversity and environmental change than abiotic pollution parameters. The responses of selected plants and animals to anthropogenic insults can be used to assess environmental responses at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. This study maps the response of key reptile, mammal, bird and plant species to airborne contaminants around a large mine and mineral processing operation at Olympic Dam in and Australia.
   The responses of different bioindicators should ideally be integrated in order to comprehend overall trends in biological integrity adjacent to pollution sources. Assimilation of different bioindicator responses allows greater precision and geographic coverage of the monitored region and reduces potential distortion from unrelated biological or monitoring responses of individual indicator groups. A single, integrated measure of ecosystem health that overlays the responses of otherwise incompatible datasets, is also of more value to industrial operators and environmental regulators than several disparate responses. Biohyets, which are the contours of bioindicator index values derived from multiple biotic measurements, are here used to map variability in ecosystem health and to identify regions, response variables and disturbance parameters for more rigorous analysis.

AB  - The present work evaluates the state of the environment in Mexico based on indicators of the present status of the country's natural resource management, social and economical conditions and anthropogenic modifications. The Mexican environment is interpreted as a spatially open system having a historical character that is essentially determined by the continual interaction between nature, society and economy. The landscape approach is followed, considering as units of territorial analysis each one of the 145 biophysical environmental units included in the national physiographic regionalization. The assessment of 16 indicators for each biophysical environmental unit was made considering their regional environmental integrity problems, the degree of disarticulation of their structure and function, and the alteration of their territorial structure, all of which determine whether or not they accomplish their environmental functions and achieve environmental stability. The classification of the state of the environment included 5 categories in 8 combinations represented in the map of the state of the environment in Mexico for the year 2008. The map shows that nearly 47.10% of the country's surface has an environmental status ranging between unstable and critical, the problematic areas being mostly concentrated in the southeast and center of the national territory.

AB  - The solitary sea squirt Pyura chilensis, is considered a resource of economic importance in the artisanal fisheries sector. This organism has a great capability to colonize artificial substrates, taking part in the encrusting fauna in long-line culture systems of ostreid and mussel, affecting the growth efficiency of these resources. For this reason, is necessary to know biological - reproductive aspects of P. chilensis in order to generate new information for future implementation of management plan, conservation and cultivation of this resource in the Region de Los Lagos, Chile. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reproductive cycle and settlement patterns of P. chilensis, analyzing the condition index and gonadal histology of organisms which come from a mussel farming system in Estero Huito, Calbuco (41 degrees 43'S; 73 degrees 09'W) during 12 months. In addition, the settlement substrate preference of P. chilensis larvae was examined, using two artificial surfaces. The condition index (wet mass-siphonal distance) showed an increase between June and September, coinciding with low temperatures period and the spawning season (organisms in stage IV). However, recruit presence between November and June shows possible spawning events in other seasons. It was observed between 40 and 100% to gonadal stages II and/or III in the sampled organisms during the study period, which suggest a continuous gametogenesis. In addition, the larval settlement was higher in rough-dark substrate (raschel mesh) than in plastic surface. In conclusion, the study area may be recruiting throughout the year, but at different intensity levels. This information would allow planning the collectors location to attract the seasquirts recruits, generating a continuous production of P. chilensis and decreasing the infestation in others crops.

AB  - Eight heavy metals (HMs: As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) were measured from 337 top and 80 deep soil samples in Tongliang District (Chongqing, SW China), and consequently multiple statistics and indices (PI - pollution index; Igeo - geoaccumulation index; EF - enrichment factor, and RI potential ecological risk index) were employed for risk evaluation of HMs in soils. The concentrations of Cd and Hg in top soils exceeded threshold values for China's State Environmental Quality Standards for soils. PI suggested the contamination of HMs in top soils was ranked as: Cr < As < Cu < Ni < Pb < Zn < Hg < Cd, while deep soil showed a different order as: Cr < As < Cu < Hg < Cd < Pb < Zn < Ni. EF showed moderate enrichment of Cd in top soils, and top soils were unpolluted to moderately polluted by Cd and Hg, as indicated by Igeo. However, minimal enrichments of HMs in deep soils were found. It should be noticeable that several sites in top soils showed As, Cd and Hg with Igeo > 1, indicating moderate pollution. RI showed that 59% of top soils and 8% of deep soils were moderate risk, while 3% and 1% of top soils were considerable and high risk, respectively. PCA (principal component analysis) identified two possible sources for HMs, which explained 69% and 71% of total variances in top and deep soils, respectively. The sources for Ni, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb could be fertilizers, pesticides, and domestic wastes. The sources for Hg and As enrichment could be industrial activities.

AB  - Recently there has been a growing interest and need for sound and robust ecological indices to evaluate ecosystem status and condition, mainly under the scope of the Water Framework Directive implementation. Although the conceptual basis for each index may rely on different assumptions and parameters, they share a common goal: to provide a useful tool that can be used in assessing the system's health and that could be applied in decision making. This paper focuses mainly on benthic community-based, biotic indices. We supply a general overview of several indices premises and assumptions as well as their main advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided of a straightforward application of benthic index of biotic integrity and benthic condition index. As a reference, their performance is compared to the Portuguese-benthic assessment tool. Limitations of the tested indices are discussed in context of the Mondego estuary (Portugal) case study.

AB  - The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is used to describe the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium in water that is very important in both aquaculture and agriculture. SAR treatments including of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 were adjusted in 10-L containers. Initial larval density was fixed at 100 larvae L-1 and during the culture period, various larval quality parameters were evaluated. Our findings illustrated that at initial stages of larval development, different SAR treatments affected the larval condition index (LCI), but no influences on larval stage index (LSI) were apparent. Importantly, this process at the final larval stages became reversed. In addition, survival at SAR 30 was 12.4% greater than among any other treatments. The highest larval resistance to stress (191 +/- 5 ppm), as measured by the 24-h LC50 formalin test also was observed for SAR 30, at the 11th larval stage. Analysis indicated that calcium absorption during larval developmental stages is affected by SAR levels in the environment and also showed that the optimal SAR treatment was 30 for Macrobrachium rosenbergii larviculture in inland hatchery brackish water. According to our findings and desired SAR for the environment and agricultural soil (<15), effluent of M. rosenbergii inland hatcheries must be treated at least two times by dilution and adding calcium and magnesium salts.

AB  - The ecological risk resulting from the accumulation of some heavy metals in the sediments of Iskenderun Bay was assessed using the following measures: enrichment and contamination factor, pollution load index (PLI), and potential ecological risk index (RI). The concentrations of the studied heavy metals were in the following order: Fe > Ni > Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Hg. Ni and As had the highest EF values. This situation is most likely due to the presence of iron, pesticide, and fertilizer plants in the region. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Ni, As, Mn, and Cr may have harmful effects on faunal communities in sediments. According to the RI, Site 4 was more contaminated and toxic than the other seven study sites, with "moderate" ecological risk. Pearson's correlation coefficient was determined by multivariate methods - cluster and principal component analysis. As can be inferred from the RI values, the potential toxic effect of As and Ni in the sediments is moderate.

AB  - River and catchment management usually proceeds from the identification of an undesirable state (e. g. pollution, sedimentation, excessive water extraction, dams, invasion by exotic species) to a strategy for reaching a desirable state described as a target. Desirable states are usually determined from community values, economic assessments and ecosystem functions, or a combination of these. Where a catchment is highly disturbed, the target is usually not a natural state, as that cannot be achieved while maintaining human uses, and a history is needed to document the disturbance, understand its cause and define the 'existence space', that is, the range of natural states that have occurred in the past. Where a catchment is less disturbed, a former natural state could provide a target for management. But which of the many natural (equilibrium) states that have occurred in the past should be the target? The paper reviews what is known of the quantitative difference between pre- and post-disturbance states, searches for the presence or otherwise of equilibrium and comments on the utility of this information for catchment management. The focus is on erosion and sediment transport.

AB  - Annual average deep-water salinity of the Baltic Sea was found to be usable as an index for environmental forcing that largely determines the level of recruitment of cod (Gadus morhua). Ricker's stock-recruitment equation with annually averaged salinity in the deepest basin of the central Baltic as an environmental factor explained 85% of the interannual variation in the recruitment of cod from 1974-2004 and closely predicted the drastic decrease in recruitment in the 1980s. The reproductive volume index, based on salinity and oxygen concentrations in the reproduction areas, does not provide such a high coefficient of determination. This finding is useful for multispecies modelling of the Baltic fish stocks, and also supports the hypothesis that hydrographic conditions play a dominant role in the recruitment success of cod. The most probable mechanisms are direct effects on the survival of eggs and indirect effects on the early phases of cod via the species composition of the planktonic food organisms.

AB  - Accurate and reliable predictions of the future development of forest site productivity are crucial for the effective management of forest stands. Static models which simply extrapolate productivity into the future are inappropriate under conditions of environmental change since they lack a close link between fundamental environmental drivers and forest growth processes. Here we present a dynamic environment-sensitive site index model formulated in the framework of a nonlinear state space approach based on longitudinal data from long-term experimental plots. Estimation of the model parameters was carried out using the prediction error minimization method. Our aim was to identify dynamic relationships between site index and environmental variables and to make conditional predictions of the future development of site index under climate change scenarios. Nonlinear, interactive, as well as accumulative effects of environmental factors (climate/weather and nitrogen influx) on the growth response were considered in the model. In the study, we estimated the dynamic environment-sensitive site index model using data from 604 Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) long-term experimental plots in southwest Germany with measurement data covering a period of more than 100 years from the end of the 19th century until today. We used the calibrated model to project future site index changes under increasing growing season temperature scenarios. Conventional climate change impact studies usually utilize a gradient approach and apply space-for-time substitution for the parameterization of models that are calibrated using spatial variability in the data. In contrast, the approach presented here utilizes the longitudinal data structure of multiple real growth time series to simultaneously exploit spatial and temporal variation in the data to provide more reliable and robust projections. Limitations of the space-for-time substitution approach in forest growth modelling are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptive modification and use of Karr's index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the upper Yangtze River, including 12 metrics in five categories, have typically occurred in line with the data collected by 6-year commercial fisheries investigation. These investigations were undertaken annually in four sections of the Upper Yangtze main channel between 1997 and 2002. These four monitoring sections (Yibin - YB, Hejiang - HJ, Mudong - MD, and Yichang - YC) were selected because they represent the part of the river that will be covering a 1000 kin stretch that includes the future Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), upstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), an area influenced by the construction of TGD. in addition, historical data were used to show changes in the watershed by comparison with field investigations recently. The biotic integrity of the four sections were calculated and classified into different levels annually for recognizing its spatial and temporal variations. It was observed that IBI scores were becoming lower diminishingly since 1997 in all the four sections. Because all the data were collected before the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, it is obvious that human activities, especially over-fishing, must be crucial factor instead of damming in the upper Yangtze River in that period.

AB  - The dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum is increasingly recognized as a harmful algal bloom (HAB) species that affects filter-feeding shellfish. An experiment was done to investigate possible interactions between parasitic diseases and exposure to P. minimum in Manila clams, Ruditapes philippinarum. Manila clams, with variable levels of infection with Perkinsus olseni, were exposed for three or six days to the benign phytoplankton species Chaetoceros neogracile or a mixed diet of C. neogracile and P minimum. After three or six days of exposure, clams were assessed individually for condition index, parasite status, and plasma and hemocyte parameters (morphological and functional) using flow-cytometry. Histological evaluation was also performed on individual clams to assess prevalence and intensity of parasitic infection, as well as other pathological conditions.
   Prorocentrum minimum caused several changes in Manila clams, especially after six days of exposure, such as decreased hemocyte phagocytosis and size and clam condition index. Pathological conditions observed in Manila clams exposed to P. minimum were hemocyte infiltration in the intestine and gonad follicles, myopathy, and necrosis of the intestine epithelial cells. The parasite P. olseni alone had no significant effect on Manila clams, nor did it modulate the hemocyte variables in clams exposed to P. minimum; however, the parasite did affect the pathological status of Manila clams exposed to the P. minimum culture, by causing atrophy and degeneration of residual ova in the gonadal follicles and hyaline degeneration of the muscle fibers, indicating synergistic effects of both stressors on the host over a short period of time. Additionally, an in vitro experiment also demonstrated detrimental effects of P. minimum and exudates upon R olseni cells, thus suggesting HAB antagonistic suppression of transmission and proliferation of the parasite in the natural environment over a longer period of time. The results of this experiment demonstrate the complexity of interactions between host, parasite, and HAB. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using tax abatements, financial incentives, and public investments to attract (or retain) firms is the primary economic development tool for many local governments. Often local job creation policies focus on increasing capital through grants, low-interest financing, and other economic development incentives. Theory predicts that capital subsidies induce firm behaviors that limit their job creation effects. This paper employs the Incentives Environment Index, constructed from state constitutional provisions that limit and structure the ability of state and local governmental entities to aid private enterprises, and county panels to test theoretical predictions on county capital expenditure and input mixes as well as industry establishment shares. The results indicate the act of increasing capital subsidy tools is associated with capital-labor substitution, decreased employment density, and changes in local industry mix. Results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and measures of capital subsidy availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oysters are considered sentinel organisms in environmental water quality monitoring programs in which cell and tissue level biomarkers are reliable tools. Copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) are present in relatively high concentrations in several estuaries, potentially affecting environmental and human health. Crassostrea gigas oysters were exposed during 28 days to a range of environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu and Ag alone or in mixture. Effects were studied through cell and tissue level biomarkers approach. Results indicated: changes in the Condition Index (CI), altered digestive gland epithelium and, presence of histopathological alterations in the gonad and digestive gland of exposed oysters. A time-dependent increase in lipofuscin contents in exposed oysters and an increase in intralysosomal metal accumulation in digestive cells through the experiment were also recorded. The Integrative Biological Response (IBR) Index showed that even at low exposure levels, Ag and Cu can produce alterations on oysters' health status. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Disturbance has long been recognized as an important determinant of community characteristics in aquatic systems. The aims of our study were to evaluate the impact of different disturbances on the macrophyte diversity and on river quality. To this end, we investigated the floristic composition for different stretches impacted by disturbances and we tested both diversity indices and the trophic index (IBMR) "Biological Index Macrophytes in Rivers" in the Moselle river (NE of France). The river was divided into four sections of different lengths based on uniformity of morphological characteristics, substrate conditions and flowing velocity: the upper, the wild, the resectioned and the downstream Moselle. Floristic composition and water chemical parameters were analysed from 1999 to 2001. The man-made increase of nutrient concentration favoured the floristic richness in the last sites of the upper Moselle, whereas river dynamics and floods did not allow the development of vegetation in the wild Moselle. Disturbances caused by industrial sewage and eutrophication allowed the spreading of pollu-tolerant and riparian alien species. The aquatic macrophyte approach is a useful means to detect impact of disturbances on diversity and on river quality. However, it was not effective in assessing disturbances such as flood overflow or chemical pollution.

AB  - The biota of aquatic systems are integrators of overall habitat quality, revealing both episodic as well as cumulative disturbance, and therefore are able to serve as natural monitors of the systems they inhabit. Invertebrate communities from three relatively pristine coastal wetlands located along the northern shore of Lake Huron were compared to those from three relatively impacted Saginaw Bay coastal wetlands in Lake Huron to identify components of the community that could ordinate wetlands according to anthropogenic disturbance. A total of 24 potential metrics were examined for each of four vegetation zones at the study sites. Of these, 14 successfully discriminated between sites and were used to generate a preliminary index of biotic integrity (IBI) for Lake Huron coastal wetlands. This IBI was then tested by assessing coastal wetlands, including five additional sites, based on invertebrate data collected the following year. The preliminary IBI seemed to provide an accurate depiction of the wetlands used to generate the IBI as well as the five additional wetlands. We do not recommend use of the presented IBI as the definitive assessment tool for Lake Huron coastal wetlands. Instead, we suggest that it be tested further on a series of wetlands with known degrees of anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - In a pilot field study the long term response of transplanted bioindicator organisms Mytilus spp. was analyzed on the basis of physiological indices and biochemical measurements related to the energy budget. Three different time series with deployment times of eight to twelve months were compared according to seasonality and repeatability of the responses. Test organisms were incubated at a coastal station in the anthropogenically impacted estuary of the river Elbe and at a North Sea station located in vicinity to the Island of Helgoland in the German Bight. The stations differ in their hydrological as well as chemical characteristics. They can be discriminated by statistical factor analysis based on the measured biochemical parameter. Levels of all energy budget biomarker varied between seasons; however, the degree of variation of the specific response was differently expressed. The mussels deployed at Helgoland showed a reproducible high Condition Index in each sampling series and an oscillating Gonadosomatic Index representing the reproduction cycle. The lowest available energy was recorded in mussels at the estuarine sampling station compared to the off-shore station. This may be caused by the energetically costly maintenance of osmotic balance and consequently result in a lower amount of energy available for defense again chemical stress, growth and reproduction.

AB  - An experiment was conducted under field conditions to assess the incidence of viral diseases in 20 accessions of sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.]. Using symptomatology, biological indexing, nitrocellulose membrane ELISA (NCM-ELISA) and PCR, the accessions were assessed for disease incidence and symptom severity. Symptom expression varied among the accessions with severity index ranging from 2.24 in UK/BNARI at eight weeks after planting (wap) to 3.63 in US029 at 12 wap. Mean disease incidence varied significantly among the accessions, ranging from 43.2% to 96.3%. Using NCM-ELISA, 85% of the sweet potato plants tested positive to Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV, 55%), Sweet potato collusive virus (SPCV, 45%), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV, 30%), Sweet potato virus G (SPVG, 20%), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV, 5%), Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV, 1.67%) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, 1.67%). PCR detected Sweet potato leaf curl virus (SPLCV) in accessions UK/BNARI and CRI054. Biological indexing resulted in characteristic symptoms, commonly vein-clearing with eventual death of plants grafted with scions mix-infected with SPCSV and SPFMV. This work provides the first detailed report on sweet potato virus diseases in Ghana correlating symptoms, grafting, serology as well as PCR. It emphasizes the importance of selecting resistant cultivars as planting materials and the enforcement of quarantine measures to minimise the introduction of viruses into Ghana and their subsequent spread.

AB  - Drought is one of the billion-dollar natural disasters and hard to trace and measure. In recent years drought monitoring becomes much easier with remote sensing. However, it is still difficult to pin vegetation variances on drought because of the delay of the caused vegetation stress. To assess vegetative drought, it is important to first understand the relationship between meteorological condition and vegetation condition, and measure the vegetation responses to meteorological drought. It would be very helpful for effective early warning about agricultural drought. This study uses the CONUS as the study area, and utilizes remote sensing products such as NDVI/VCI (normalized difference vegetation index/vegetation condition index) and SPI/SPEI (standardized precipitation index/standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) to give a comparative evaluation to the vegetation's drought response. The used vegetation products and meteorological data are ensured to be consistent. The scale and lag of vegetation response to drought for various vegetation types and aridity levels were thoroughly investigated. The results show that: The AVHRR and MODIS NDVI series pairs and the meteorological drought index series pairs (SPEI and SPI) have fairly good consistencies. Among them, 69.5% and 84% have rho (correlation coefficient) values greater than 0.8 respectively. For the NDVI series pairs, the maximum rho value is 0.98, the minimum rho value is -0.47, and the mean rho value is 0.79, which are 0.97, 0.68, and 0.87 respectively for the meteorological index series pairs. Compared to rho values of the meteorological index series pairs, the rho values of the NDVI series pairs have more outliers indicating instability. The correlation between SPEI and VCI significantly relies on time lags and has high spatial inhomogeneity. 1- and 2-month lags of SPEI have more significant positive correlation with VCI in Arid, Semi-Arid and Dry sub-humid areas of central west CONUS with less precipitation and lower temperature. For various time scales (time scale is SPEI reference range), the most significant positive correlation between SPEI and VCI happens in the time scales of 6- to 12month in summer, the time scales of 3- and 6-month in spring and autumn, and the time scales of 2- and 3month in winter regardless of time lags. Despite of the different vegetation types and aridity levels, the maximum correlations between SPEI and VCI are observed in Hyper arid regions in January, Arid regions in April, Semi-arid regions in July, and Dry sub-humid regions in October. Shrub has prominent responses in January and April, grass responses appear in July and October, and Evergreen forest shows least responses in all seasons. The results add more insights of the connection between vegetation and climate, and guide the development of new technology leveraging remote sensing data for vegetation drought monitoring and earlywarning. The results are also helpful to provide important references for studying large-scale physiological and phenological properties of the vegetation under different climate conditions.

AB  - The Biological Diatom Index (BDI) is a standardized method routinely used in France for the surveillance of watercourse quality. This index is based on a list of 209 key species showing different pollution sensitivities. The pollution sensitivity, or "ecological profile", is determined through the species presence probability values along a seven quality classes gradient. In a sample, the presence and abundance of species from this list are used to calculate the BDI score. Recently, water managers pointed out several weaknesses of this index: (a) the BDI fails to correctly assess water quality in acidobiontic and brackish conditions, and (b) pollution sensitivity and tolerance of several key species used to calculate the index need to be improved.
   This paper presents and discusses the new version of the BDI, called BDI-2006. 2802 samples were used to create this new index (samples collected on all French river types during the last thirty years), where 1063 diatom species were identified. For each sample, the community was described with species relative abundance, and relevant physico-chemical parameters were collected: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, ammonium, orthophosphates and nitrates.
   Eight hundreds and thirty eight key species were finally kept, including species typical of acidic and brackish waters, tropical taxa and abnormal forms of many widespread taxa (as evidence of toxicological impacts).
   The physico-chemical and the biological datasets were explored with classical analysis (Principal Component Analysis) and neural networks (Self-Organizing Maps), combined to draw the new key species ecological profiles. Comparing to the initial version of the BDI, several species profiles (Nitzschia paleacea for example) were clearly enhanced.
   This new version was adopted by the French standardisation authority (AFNOR) in October 2007. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sound policy needs tools for production analysis under uncertainty such as the state-contingent approach. Apart from demonstrating the potential applicability of the approach for the grain producing sector in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, this contribution addresses one of the key challenges to its empirical applications in the context of agricultural production analysis under uncertainty, namely the definition of the states of nature and the construction of environmental indicators to detect the occurrence of the so-defined states. This study proposes such an environmental indicator based on biophysical crop yields and suggests two methods for statistical data clustering to evaluate its values. To the extent to which simulated data reflect key characteristics of the real data this contribution presents estimates for the state-contingent production technology. The hypothesis of an output-cubical technology is rejected in contradiction to assumptions implicit to conventional production analysis under uncertainty.

AB  - The ecological impact of urban development and population increase is an area of increasing relevance as human modification of the landscape continues unabated. The prediction of this impact will help inform urban planning and decision making around population growth, impervious surface (IS) increase and associated ecological effects. The Xiong'an New Area is a state-level new area to be established in North China. The population growth goal for the area is going to reach 2.5 million and the area is planned to expand to 2000 km(2). The potential population growth and area expansion will result in a massive increase in IS area and thus may impact the regional ecological quality. A clear understanding of the impact would help to minimize the influence of the new area's development on regional ecological quality. Therefore, this study investigated current land cover types and ecological status in the Xiong'an New Area using feature inversion techniques and the improved remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI). Statistical models were developed to predict ecological effects responding to the forthcoming population and associated IS increase in the new area. This was achieved by relating population growth to IS area increase and exploring the relationships between IS area and RSEI. The results show that the area's land surface has not been intensively developed and the current ecological status is good. The RSEI-based prediction shows that IS area has a noteworthy effect on regional ecological conditions. The variation of IS proportions in the new area can result in a significant shift of RSEI. A balance amount of total IS area in the 2000 km(2) new area is 433 km(2). Exceeding/reducing the amount would result in a decline/rise of the area's ecological quality. Introducing a quantity of IS area-related population density (IPD) reveals that the area's ecological quality is actually related to IPD rather than to traditional population density when the total area and future population of the new area are given. Therefore, the forthcoming regional master planning for the new area should include specific efforts to control IS area increase.

AB  - The capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, is the largest extant rodent of the world. To better understand the correlation between size and body mass, and biochemical parameters of capybaras from areas with different degrees of anthropization (i.e., different food supplies), we sampled free-ranging capybaras from areas of natural landscapes (NLs) and human-modified landscapes (HMLs) in Brazil. Analyses of biometrical and biochemical parameters of capybaras showed that animals from HMLs were heavier (higher body mass) than those from NL, a condition possibly related to fat deposit rather than body length, as indicated by Body Condition Index (BCI) analyses. Biochemical parameters indicated higher serum levels of albumin, creatine kinase, cholesterol, fructosamine and total protein among capybaras from HMLs than from NLs; however, when all adult capybaras were analyzed together only cholesterol and triglycerides were positively correlated with body mass. We propose that the biochemical profile differences between HMLs and NLs are related to the obesity condition of capybaras among HMLs. Considering that heavier animals might live longer and reproduce more often, our results could have important implications in the population dynamics of capybaras among HMLs, where this rodent species is frequently represented by overgrowth populations that generate several levels of conflicts with human beings.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine, on the same pedological, topographic and climatic conditions, the effect of a continuous giant reed cropping (GR), a cropping sequence (CS) as well as of untilled native grassland (NO) on some soil quality characteristics. Between the parameters examined, total soil organic carbon (TOC), light fraction carbon (LFC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), cumulative mineralized carbon (Cm), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), potentially mineralizable carbon (C(0)), dehydrogenase (DHA), catalase (CA) and B-glucosidase (GL) activities, as well as fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), biological index of fertility (BIF) and initial potential rate of carbon mineralization (C(0).k), were higher in the continuous giant reed cropping than in the cropping sequence. The C mineralization rate (k) was lower in GR than in CS, while the metabolic potential (MP) was similar in the two sites.
   Concerning the difference between OR and NO, the latter being considered as a reference or baseline in evaluating attributes of soil quality, OR showed higher values for TUC, LFC, DOC and catalase activity. TOC and catalase, also for their analytical simplicity, may be suggested as the most suitable soil biochemical indicators for differentiating the effects of different crop management systems.

AB  - The hard-rock hilly Aravalli terrain of Rajasthan province of India suffers with frequent drought due to poor and delayed monsoon, abnormally high summer-temperature and insufficient water resources. In the present study, detailed analysis of meteorological and hydrological data of the Aravalli region has been carried out for the years 1984-2003. Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) has been used to quantify the precipitation deficit. Standardised Water-Level Index (SWI) has been developed to assess ground-water recharge-deficit. Vegetative drought indices like Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) have been computed using NDVI values obtained from Global Vegetation Index (GVI) and thermal channel data of NOAA AVHRR satellite. Detailed analyses of spatial and temporal drought dynamics during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons have been carried out through drought index maps generated in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment. Analysis and interpretation of these maps reveal that negative SPI anomalies not always correspond to drought. In the Aravalli region, aquifer-stress shifts its position time to time, and in certain pockets it is more frequent. In comparison to hydrological stress, vegetative stress in the Aravalli region is found to be slower to begin but quicker to withdraw. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prediction models and methodological developments in geographical information systems (GIS) for regional analysis and predictions of environmental states are considered. The complex and interdisciplinary nature of environmental problems requires the development of a new class of GIS, integrating mathematical models, databases and expert knowledge based on a conceptual model. It is known that chemical contamination is one of the main factors of the environmental pollution of regions. Therefore, a new environmental quality index, taking into account the chemical contaminants' parameters, is created for solving regional environmental problems. An approach to identifying environmental danger zones (EDZs) in a region's territory was developed; the zones are represented on a computer map of that region. A GIS technology scheme for predicting EDZ changes is discussed. The scheme is based on using an analysis of the region's economical development scenario. Samples of regional environmental prediction for the Siberian region are given in this paper. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Even though existing remote-sensing-based drought indices are widely used in many different types of ecosystems, their utility has not been widely assessed in tropical dry forests (TDFs). The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of three remote-sensing-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), for meteorological drought monitoring in TDFs using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The correlation between the VCI, TCI, and VHI and multiple time scales of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 months) for each month (January to December) and each season (dry season, dry-to-wet season, wet season and wet-to-dry season) were conducted using the Pearson correlation analysis. We also correlated year-to-year changes of satellite-based drought indices with the changes of the in situ annual SPI (A_SPI) which provides annual information on the mean meteorological drought. The analysis reveals that the ability of these remote-sensing-based drought indices for meteorological drought monitoring varies with timing, and the TCI outperforms the VCI and VHI in terms of seasonal and annual scale. These remote-sensing indices performed well in monitoring meteorological drought in the dry season, poorly in the in the dry-to-wet season, and moderately in the wet season. The TCI performed best in monitoring meteorological drought in the wet-to-dry period, followed by VHI, whereas the VCI performed worst. All of these remote-sensing-based drought indices failed to detect drought in May during the green-up period and in September, October, and November when the water content in the root regions was abundant. Our results indicate that the evapotranspiration of TDFs is more sensitive than canopy greenness to detect meteorological drought. Results from this study increase the ability to provide real-time drought monitoring and early warnings of drought in TDFs.

AB  - The unique ecosystems of the Abraus peninsula on the Caucasian Black Sea coast persisted in the Utrish State Nature Reserve (Russia), are represented by dry Eastern Mediterranean subtropics with a large number of endemics and relics that have been persisted from the Tertiary period. This is one of the few places in Russia where juniper pistachio (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus) woodlands grow. In 2016-2018, a study was conducted on the content of the biological properties of brown soils in two areas of the Abraus peninsula. The main focus is on the monitoring of Vodopadnaya shchel' on the Utrish State Nature Reserve monitoring site, located in the post-fire area of juniper woodland (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus) at an altitude of 110-140 m a.s.l. on the southern spurs of the Ridge Navagir. The fire happened in 2009. Additionally, in April 2018, the site of the burnt area of 2013 was investigated in the immediate vicinity of the Sukhaya shchel' of the Utrish State Nature Reserve. The area of the burnt site was several hectares including violation of terrestrial vegetation and changes in the ecological state of the soil. We have demonstrated that brown soils are rare for Russia (Cromic Cambisol and Cromi-Leptic Luvisol according to the WRB international classification). But these are widespread in most parts of the Abraus peninsula, including the Utrish State Nature Reserve. The main features of brown soils include the brown colour of the soil profile; intense textural lining of the middle part of the soil profile; eluvial-illuvial type of decarbonisation closed to neutral reaction of the environment; soil richness with elements of mineral nutrition. The studied soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve are characterised by higher stoniness and rubble, no carbonate growths, fragmentation of the forest floor due to the low-mountain dissected relief of the territory. We have studied the ecological and biological properties of these soils in response to fire (e.g. temperature, moisture, soil bulk density, organic carbon and carbonate content, bacteria abundance, catalase, peroxidase, dehydrogenase, and invertase activities). In the grass-shrub stage, the restorative succession was in both burnt areas. The fire had a significant effect on the ecological and biological properties of brown soils 5-9 years after the fire impact. Many of the biological properties of post-fire soils differed significantly in comparison with the properties of control areas of juniper light forest. The organic carbon content and biological activity of post-fire soils as a whole are reduced as compared with the soils of control areas of juniper light forest. In this case, a high variation of the biological parameters of the soil was noted in different parts of the same burnt area. The variation is associated both with the peculiarities of the mountain relief, and with the nature of the vegetation, which forms refugia different in the number of plant residues. The rate of carbon dioxide production in the surface horizons of the burnt area soil is more than 2 times lower than the values in control areas. Five years after the fire, the post-fire soil of the Sukhaya shchel' area contained almost half of the humus content at the 5 cm surface layer compared to the soil of the control area of juniper woodlands. At a depth of 15-25 cm, the difference between the soils areas remained at the same level as for the upper horizons.
   Thus, we demonstrated a significant effect of fires on the biological parameters of the subtropical soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve, which has been persisted for many years.

AB  - Transformation in human-dominated ecosystems results from cumulative impacts of human activity. A comprehensive system for State of Environment Reporting (SOER) must take into account indicators of stress on ecosystems, indicators of the state of the system (i.e., ecosystem structure and function), and indicators of social response (policy interventions). The Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model for State of Environment Reporting developed by Statistics Canada in the mid 1970s incorporated these elements. By adopting an ecosystem perspective, it represented a significant advance from the then prevailing engineering-based approaches, with their focus on contaminants in air, water and land. The PSR model, however, has its own inherent limitations: its focus on isolating "pressures", "states", and "responses" tends to provide a static representation of the environment, ignoring the significant dynamic processes that comprise the interactions between these components. The PSR model also lacks a 'bottom line' that would provide the policy community and the public with an overall assessment of environmental trends. These limitations can be overcome by adopting an ecosystem health approach, which allows for a determination of the overall viability of environments and for the identification of the collective pressures from human activity that threaten that viability. An ecosystem health approach also allows for a more explicit connection between the state of the environment and human well-being. In this paper, we trace the evolution of SOER and provide some of the building blocks for overcoming its present limitations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance. Soil-ecological potential of technogenic landscape among other components is determined by properties of lithogenic resource, which for mining areas are, primarily, heavy tonnage wastes - overburden rocks and mineral processing wastes.
   The purpose of this work is to assess the soil-ecological state of the natural-technical system of the tailings dump of the Kachkanarsky Ore Mining and Processing Plant and to identify prospects of ecosystems development and potential for their self-restoration.
   The research objectives included identification of soil formation features and determination of basic agrochemical and environmental characteristics of technogenic surface formations, assessment of their phytotoxicity, assessment of the vegetation cover condition, and identification of the need for reclamation.
   The object of the study is technogenic soils, which are part of the lithogenic basis of the natural and technical system of the tailings dump of the Kachkanarsky Ore Mining and Processing Plant.
   Methods. The study of technogenic surface formations was carried out in the areas of their removal outside the tailings dump. The field studies included general acquaintance with the area, field study of soils and technogenic surface formations, soil sampling, and study of vegetation cover of the area. Laboratory investigations were carried out in specialized laboratories using unified methods. The content of microelements was determined by ICP-MS method.
   Results. According to obtained results, natural and technogenic deposits represented by tailings of wet magnetic separation of sand fraction are identified as technogenic surface formations of artifact group, artiindustrates subgroup. Compared with the background soils, they are characterized by lower content of organic matter, total nitrogen, and less acidic reaction of the soil solution. They are non-saline in the content of water-soluble ions and are characterized by the admissible level of pollution by elements of hazard classes 1-2 and the absence of acute toxic effect on the studied biological test systems. Active reforestation processes on technogenic surface formations and satisfactory state of vegetation demonstrate the absence of negative effect of the mentioned deposits on the vegetation. Following revegetation of technogenic surface formations, signs of initial soil formation appear. These processes are identified by formation of forest floor, accumulation of organic matter in the upper layers, and initial differentiation of soil horizons. The soil-ecological state of the studied natural-technical system can be recognized as satisfactory. Currently, no special environmental protection measures are required to restore the soil and vegetation layer at the waste disposal sites outside the tailings management facility.

AB  - Thirty streams, located in Manaus in the central part of Brazilian Amazonia, were examined to evaluate the correlations between environmental integrity and the local communities of adult dragonflies and damselflies. The presence of damselflies would have a positive correlation with environmental integrity, and dragonflies a negative one due to their contrasting ecophysiological requirements. The environmental integrity of each site was estimated based on the Habitat integrity index (HII), which was modified for this study in an urban area. The hypothesis that would be differences in assemblage composition between streams in differently urbanized areas was supported, possibly because most damselfly species are considered to be specialists that are found in pristine habitats, whereas dragonflies seem to be generalists and are likely to be found in disturbed environments. The ordination indicated systematic differences in community composition based on the degree of conservation of the environment, with the communities found in well-preserved habitats being distinct from those found in intermediate and degraded ones. Differences in the composition of odonate communities reflect differences in the integrity of the environment, but they can also provide a measure of the intensity of impacts, thus contributing to the development of effective conservation strategies. In addition, the HI!, which is applied rapidly and easily, provides environmental managers with an objective measure of the degree of alteration of aquatic habitats. Maintenance of forest cover along watercourses is clearly essential for the conservation of hydrological resources and the aquatic organisms that depend on these environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The model of the "coast - sea" ecological-economic system, in which rational balance between the economic profits resulted from the production waste disposal and maintaining the marine environment ecological state is based on managing the system according to two criteria: the economic efficiency and the biological diversity index in the marine environment, is proposed. The balance equations of the method of adaptive balance of causes with the locally acting management agents are used for the economic and environmental subsystems "coast" and "sea", respectively. A new method for assessing the normalized coefficients of influences calculated based on the ratios of the average values of the system variables is applied in the model equations. Influence of variations of temperature in the sea upper layer, the surface wind speed module and the chlorophyll-a concentration upon the ecological-economic processes is studied based on tracing the pollution accumulation-assimilation balance in the marine environment. The results of managing the economic efficiency and the level of the marine environment bio-diversity in the mode of purifying the coastal runoff of pollution are represented. It is shown that effectiveness of managing the polluting coastal runoff is conditioned not only by penalties, but also by intensity of the pollutants' biochemical decomposition processes and by the marine environment thermodynamic characteristics.

AB  - Biodiversity has been recognized as one of the key components of environmental sustainability. Assessment of biodiversity trends and progress toward targets requires effective and sound indicators. In our article, we review and compare the leading multispecies biodiversity indices used in global and regional assessments. We reviewed basic characteristics of these aggregated and composite biodiversity indicators and evaluated them with regard to their ecological performance, policy relevance and other accounting aspects. Indices analyzed include species and populations based indicators, such as Living Planet Index and Red List Index, as well as ecosystem based indicators like Natural Capital Index and Biodiversity Intactness Index. We also include measures of ecological integrity such as Marine Trophic Index and Index of Biotic Integrity. Indicators analyzed differ in both their ecological focus, baselines, basic units or policy use. Multispecies biodiversity indices illustrate prevailingly negative trends in the state of nature as a result of human induced pressures, especially land cover change. Biodiversity loss is therefore not decoupled from socioeconomic progress. We show that current indicators include a balanced mix of important biodiversity aspects and have some policy resonance. Leading biodiversity indices should be further promoted and integrated into monitoring, modelling and decision-making frameworks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction of alien species leading to unfavorable economic impacts and ecosystem collapse is a well-known threat. The aim was to define if high salinity may be a limiting factor for the survival and spread of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Both sexes were exposed to increasing salt concentrations reaching 35.3 parts per thousand after 65 days to simulate the natural transition from freshwater into seawater. Higher mortality was recorded for salinity-treated females than for males. Condition indexes gave evidence of minor adverse effects, whereas altered values of oxidative stress biomarkers suggested a perturbation of redox state induced by the exposure conditions. The female survivors showed a strengthening of levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. A moderate oxidative pressure was recorded for gills in both sexes. Nevertheless, the non-indigenous red swamp crayfish has shown great resistance and adaptability to these simulated adverse environmental conditions. Survival of P. clarkii at high salinity may suggest that both sexes can be able to invade estuarine brackish water and lagoons initially exploited as ecological corridors, causing ecological imbalances in transitional ecosystems and in seawater. Moreover, this alien invasive species could be able to descend rivers up to the sea and vice versa to colonize new environments.

AB  - Prioritizing the relationship between heterogeneity of sediment habitats and river bends is critical when planning and reconstructing urban rivers. However, the exact relationship between ecological heterogeneity and river bends remains ambiguous. Therefore, this research proposed a new approach to quantify and predict bendinduced ecological heterogeneity, incorporating the bacteria-based index of biotic integrity (Ba-IBI), path model, and random forest regression model. The developed Ba-IBI quantified heterogeneity in sediment microbial communities, ranging from low (1.40) to high (3.97). A path model was developed and validated in order to further investigate the relative contributions of environmental factors to the Ba-IBI. The established path model, which was considered acceptable with a CMIN/df = 1.949 < 4, suggested that primary environmental factors affecting the sediment bacterial communities were flow velocity and ammonium concentration in sediment. To further characterize the relationship between environmental factors and the Ba-IBI, a function was constructed using the random forest regression model that predicts the responses of sediment bacterial communities to environmental factors with R2 = 0.6126. The proposed approach and prediction tools will provide knowledge to improve natural channel design and post-project evaluations in river restoration projects.

AB  - Protothaca thaca is an important bivalve species inhabiting the upwelling ecosystem of Chile and Peru. Temperature in this ecosystem changes dramatically during El Nino (EN) events, with P. thaca showing high tolerance to increased temperatures. To understand the metabolic processes behind this adaptation we studied the effects of temperature on standard metabolism, growth and body condition index of P. thaca from Northern Chile. Oxygen consumption, daily growth rate and body condition index of animals acclimated to 12, 16 and 20 degrees C were measured using an intermittent flow-through system. Our results show that these processes are significantly lower at 12 degrees C compared to 16 and 20 degrees C. No differences are observed between the higher temperatures. The relative thermal independence of routine metabolism is suggested to conserve energy, which allows the species to be more tolerant to high temperatures. Overall, the physiological responses of P. thaca at whole-animal level largely confirm that this clam is well suited to tolerate positive thermal anomalies associated with strong EN in the study area. However, results at lower temperatures show contrasting responses, which emphasizes the need to be cautious in sclerochronological studies, which tend to assume direct relationships between single environmental factors and micro-growth increment width.

AB  - The present work is concerned with the development of methodological procedures for studying the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the marine environment. Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; D-Mg, Margalef's index; D-Mn, Menhinick's index; D-Od, Odum's species per thousand individuals; H', Shannon's Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study the effects of gender, age and nutritional status on tissue concentrations of some trace elements (Zn, Cu, Mn, and Cr) in wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), Spanish shrew (Sorex granarius), and great white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) were investigated. Four sampling stations were selected for the study: a restored mine dump, an area characterised by ultrabasic soil and two sites in oak woods in the vicinity of a power plant. Gender had no effect on the tissue concentrations of the metals studied, except for the concentration of Zn in brain tissue from C russula. The relative age of the individuals was estimated on the basis of crystalline lens weight in mice and dental abrasion in shrews, as body weight was considered a poor indicator of age because of the strong inter-individual overlap in the populations. Age was only significantly (and negatively) correlated with the concentration of Cr in livers of mice from one station, a finding that may indicate physiological stress on growth at this site. The nutritional status was estimated from the body mass index; the relationships between this index and metal concentrations for both A. sylvaticus and C. russula were negative, which can be attributed to the weight-specific metabolic rate that leads to a relatively low uptake of metals per unit of body weight. As there was no relation between duration of exposure and concentrations of metals in the organs analysed, age should not be included as a variable factor in the condition index.

AB  - We developed an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for the Interior Plateau Ecoregion (WE), USA, which assessed effects of human disturbance on the biotic condition of stream diatom communities. We selected 7 metrics from 59 diatom attributes at reference and impaired sites (training sites), based on significant differences between site groups using the Mann-Whitney U test, high separation power, and a low coefficient of variation. We calculated IBIs by summing metrics for a site after transforming them to a discrete 1, 3, 5 scale or a continuous 0-10 scale. Both discrete and continuous scaling systems successfully separated reference and impaired sites, and IBI scores were significantly related to agricultural land use in IPE watersheds. We then tested the diatom IBI using a 2(nd) data set from IPE streams (test sites), processed by slightly different sampling methods and taxonomic references, and classified sites as reference or impaired based on the same criteria used for the training-site data set. Diatom IBI scores differed significantly between reference and impaired streams and correctly classified 80% of sites in the test-site data set. Compared with other diatom IBIs, our measure showed higher separation power among sites and provided an accurate characterization of stream impairment in study watersheds. The developed diatom IBI can be a useful tool for stream and watershed management.

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches (EBAs) to managing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems, adapting to changes in ecosystem states (indicators of ecosystem health), and mitigating the impacts of state changes on ecosystem services are needed for sustainable development. EBAs are informed by integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) that must be compiled and updated frequently for EBAs to be effective. Frequently updated IEAs depend on the sustained provision of data and information on pressures, state changes, and impacts of state changes on services. Nowhere is this truer than in the coastal zone, where people and ecosystem services are concentrated and where anthropogenic pressures converge. This study identifies the essential indicator variables required for the sustained provision of frequently updated IEAs, and offers an approach to establishing a global network of coastal observations within the framework of the Global Ocean Observing System. The need for and challenges of capacity-building are highlighted, and examples are given of current programmes that could contribute to the implementation of a coastal ocean observing system of systems on a global scale. This illustrates the need for new approaches to ocean governance that can achieve coordinated integration of existing programmes and technologies as a first step towards this goal.

AB  - The development of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has greatly improved the living environment. The Building Research Institute of the Ministry of the Interior of Taiwan also utilizes smart building data to improve the intelligence and humanity of buildings and meet the needs of modern people in the smart-life era. The greenhouse effect, extreme weather, and smog make people more susceptible to weather conditions. To satisfy the health/comfort specifications required for buildings in Taiwan to be awarded smart building marks, technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data are imported to meet people's needs for a comfortable indoor living space. A temperature and humidity sensor, air quality sensor, and gas sensor are used to obtain the indoor physical environment index. An environmental control system for a smart household is established through Arduino in this study to provide a low-cost and highly smart environmental monitoring and sensing system. A micro-algorithm mechanism is used to start adjustable devices, and mobile phone interface apps are utilized to convey the environmental conditions in real time and regulate the operation of household appliances so as to improve the comfort of the indoor space and provide a comfortable and protective environment for work and living.

AB  - This study assessed seasonal variation of total liver proteins level (LPLs) and biotransformation biomarkers in two fish species, G. niger and Z. ophiocephalus, during a one year-survey in the low contaminated Ghar-El-Melh lagoon, Tunisia. Analyzed biomarkers were compared with physiological indexes such as the condition index, hepato-somatic index, and gonado-somatic index and environmental parameters. A significant annual rhythms of glutathione-S-transferase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities were validated by cosinor. The highest peak (acrophase) of activities occurred in summer likely related to the elevated seawater temperature. Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm and amplitudes were higher in Z. ophiocephalus than in G. niger. The results showed, as well, an acrophase of (LPLs) in spring coinciding with reproductive period in Z. ophiocephalus and beginning of reproductive period in G. niger. This study established a baseline for the selected enzymatic activities in gobies, which required information for a correct interpretation of biomarker responses in environmental monitoring.

AB  - Drought is a complex hazard which directly affects the water balance of any region. It impacts agricultural, ecological and socioeconomical spheres. It is a global concern. The occurrence of drought is triggered by climatic phenomena which cannot be eliminated. However, its effect can be well managed if actual spatio-temporal information related to crop status influenced by drought is available to decision-makers. This study attempted to assess the efficiency of remote sensing products from space sensors for monitoring the spatio-temporal status of meteorological drought in conjunction with impact on vegetation condition and crop yield. Time series (2000-2019) datasets of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were used to compute Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was used to compute Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Association between SPI and VCI was explored. YAI was calculated from the statistical data records. Final observations are that the agricultural crop yield changed as per the climate variability specific to location. The study indicates drought indices derived from remote sensing give a synoptic view because of the course resolution of the satellite images. It does not reveal the precise relationship to the small-scale crop yield. Remote sensing can be an effective way to monitor and understand the dynamics of the drought and agriculture pattern over any region.

AB  - Ichthyoplankton samples were collected from Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary in May 2016. Species composition was studied by DNA barcoding and morphological identification. To make better use of the estuarine biotic integrity index (EBI) to assess the ecosystem health of the Changjiang River estuary over the past 30 years, we collected the data of a spring ichthyoplankton survey in the estuary from 1986 to 2016. The EBI was calculated using 12 evaluation metrics, namely, the number of total ichthyoplankton species, estuarine spawning species, estuarine nursery species, estuarine resident species, benthic species, pelagic species, and intolerant species, and the percentages of tolerant species, omnivores, insectivores, carnivores, and natural hybrid species. EBI was calculated in spring in four periods (1986, 1999, 2007, and 2016) by assigning points of 1, 3 or 5, giving values of 50, 38, 36, and 32, respectively, corresponding to "Good", "Fair-Poor", "Fair-Poor", and "Poor" EBI levels, respectively. Changes in species composition were the primary reason for the significant decreases in EBI between 1986 and 1999, and for the large differences between 1986 and 2007 and between 2007 and 2016. The changes in species composition were influenced by declines in ichthyoplankton species, pollution sensitive species, estuarine nursery species and estuarine sedentary species, and an increase in pollution resistant species. An analysis of EBI interdecadal variability showed that the health status of the Changjiang River estuary ecosystem over the last 30 years first declined and then stabilized at a lower level. This result further settled the argument for urgent protection and restoration of the Changjiang River estuary.

AB  - Changes in biological indices (weight, length, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, hepatosomatic index, intraperitoneal fat ratio and fillet portion), and body composition were examined in sharpsnout seabream (30 to 500 g) maintained in culture for one and a half years. Growth was rapid during May-September, and slow from October to April. Gonadal development took place between August and October, and gonadosomatic index peaked in October (GSI: 1.14%). The condition factor, the hepatosomatic index and the intraperitoneal fat ratio varied (CF: 1.83 -2.51, HSI: 0.80-2.47%, IPF ratio: 1.27-2.95%, minimum and maximum values, respectively), falling during the warmer months of the year (May-Oct). The fillet portion (the eviscerated fish with the head, fishbone and tail removed), represented a 55% of body mass.

AB  - In the Kola Subarctic, a mining industry has developed, which is a source of environmental pollution with heavy metals. The objects of study were the tailings of three large mining enterprises in the region: apatite-nepheline, complex and loparite ores. The geotechnical characteristics were studied, and the granulometric composition of the samples was established. The main minerals that make up the material of ore dressing tailings have been determined. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the content of trace elements, in particular heavy metals and rare earth elements, has been established. The enrichment factor, the geoaccumulation indexes, the potential ecological risk index factor and the potential environmental hazard index have been calculated. Priority pollutants characteristics for specific objects have been identified. It is noted that the finely dispersed material of the tailings of loparite and complex ores is 1.5-3 times enriched in heavy and rare earth metals in comparison with the total material of the tailings. In laboratory conditions, experiments were carried out to simulate the process of interaction of dust particles with soil solutions containing different amounts of dissolved organic matter and at average seasonal temperatures. It was found that a decrease in the pH of the solution and an increase in the amount of organic carbon and temperature lead to the mobilization of heavy and rare earth metals from the tailings.

AB  - Long-term physiological stress in individual animals may be an important mechanism linking ecological change with impaired wildlife population health. In the Southern Hudson Bay (SH) subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus), increasing stress associated with climate warming may be related to declining body condition. Accordingly, the development of tools to assess long-term stress in this species may prove invaluable for conservation efforts in this threatened population. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) has shown promise as a potential biomarker of long-term stress in free-ranging bears. However, to serve as a useful management tool, factors influencing HCC in polar bears must be identified and then revealed to establish linkages between environmental conditions and the fitness of individual animals. We determined HCC (median = 0.48 pg/mg [range = 0.16-2.26 pg/mg]) in 185 polar bears captured in southern Hudson Bay from 2007 to 2009. HCC was influenced by sex, family group status, and capture period but not by body region or hair type. Using models developed through a combination of hypothesis testing and information theory, we also determined that HCC was negatively associated with growth indices (length, mass, and body condition index) linked to fitness in polar bears. Additional research will be required across several polar bear populations to establish the utility of HCC as a tool for polar bear conservation. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Ecosystem health assessment is vital for regional ecological restoration and management. Although many studies have improved the framework of ecosystem health assessment at the regional scale, most of them primarily focus on the single measurements of the natural states of ecosystems or external disturbances. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation methods based on the ecological integrity and human demand for ecosystem ser-vices from the perspective of coupled human and ecological systems. In this study, we proposed an improved method that considers the ecological integrity and ecosystem services demand, which comprises four aspects of indicators: vigor, organization, resilience and ecosystem services (ES) supply-demand ratio. We used the Mid-dle Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China as a case study to apply the evaluation method. Our re-sults indicate that (1) the level of ecosystem health is low in the middle of the study area and high on the periphery from 2000 to 2015. The moderate and good health levels dominate throughout the study area in 2000 and 2015. (2) The ES supply-demand ratio can objectively measure the actual status of ES, and the strong ES deficit aggravated dramatically the deterioration of regional ecosystems. (3) Urbanization exhibited a signif-icant negative correlation with the ecosystem health index, and the greatest impact was observed in the urban agglomeration regions. Our framework extend the ecosystem health assessment methodology, and the research results can provide significant references for regional ecological protection and management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Worldwide rise of obesity may be partly related to the relaxation of natural selection in the last few generations. Accumulation of mutations affecting metabolism towards excessive fat deposition is suggested to be a result of less purging selection. Using the WHO and UN data for 159 countries there is a significant correlation (r = 0.60, p<0.01) between an index of the relaxed opportunity for selection (Biological State Index) and prevalence of obesity (percentage of individuals with BMI > 30kg/m(2)). This correlation remains significant (r = 0.32., p<0.01) when caloric intake and insufficient physical activity prevalence are kept statistically constant (partial correlation analysis, N = 82). The correlation is still significant when gross domestic product per capita is also kept constant (r = 0.24, p < 0.05, N = 81). In the last decades, prevalence of both obesity and underweight has increased in some countries despite no change in caloric intake nor in physical inactivity prevalence. Relaxed selection against genes affecting energy balance and metabolism may contribute to the increase of fatness independent from commonly considered positive energy balance. Diagnoses of individual predispositions to obesity at an early age and individual counselling on diet and behaviour may be appropriate strategies to limit further increases in body mass.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) was developed to assess benthic community health and environmental quality in Chesapeake Bay. The B-IBI provides Chesapeake Bay monitoring programs with a uniform tool with which to characterize bay-wide benthic community condition and assess the health of the Bay. A probability-based design permits unbiased annual estimates of areal degradation within the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries with quantifiable precision. However, of greatest interest to managers is the identification of problem areas most in need of restoration. Here we apply the B- IBI to benthic data collected in the Bay since 1994 to assess benthic community degradation by Chesapeake Bay Program segment and water depth. We used a new B- IBI classification system that improves the reliability of the estimates of degradation. Estimates were produced for 67 Chesapeake Bay Program segments. Greatest degradation was found in areas that are known to experience hypoxia or show toxic contamination, such as the mesohaline portion of the Potomac River, the Patapsco River, and the Maryland mainstem. Logistic regression models revealed increased probability of degraded benthos with depth for the lower Potomac River, Patapsco River, Nanticoke River, lower York River, and the Maryland mainstem. Our assessment of degradation by segment and water depth provided greater resolution of relative condition than previously available, and helped define the extent of degradation in Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - In this investigation a body-condition index (BCI) was developed for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), based on residuals from the regression of total body mass against a linear measure of size, straight-line body length (SLBL). Transformation of mass-length data from 1198 polar bears, 595 black bears, and 126 grizzly bears to natural logarithms resulted in a linear relationship between mass and length. However, the relationship in polar bears differed from that in black and grizzly bears. SLBL had a close positive relationship with skeletal (bone) mass in polar bears (n = 31) and black bears (n = 33), validating the use of SLBL as an accurate index of body size. There was no correlation between SLBL and BCI for polar bears (r = 0.005, p = 0.87, n = 1198) or for black bears and grizzly bears (r = 0.04, p = 0.30, n = 721), indicating that the BCI was independent of body size. The BCI had a close positive relationship with true body condition, measured as the standardized residual of the combined mass of fat and skeletal muscle against SLBL, in polar and black bears that were dissected to determine individual tissue masses. The BCI also had a close positive relationship with the standardized residual of fat mass against SLBL. Estimation of BCI values for polar bears, or for black bears and grizzly bears, is facilitated by prediction equations that require measurement of total body mass and SLBL for individual animals.

AB  - Phytostabilization of mine soils contaminated by potentially toxic elements (PTEs) requires plants tolerant to PTE toxicity and to the poor soil physico-chemical characteristics of these areas. A pot experiment was carried out to assess the phytostabilization potential of Brassica juncea and Dactylis glomerata in mine soils amended with compost and biochar. Furthermore, the Environmental Risk of the soils and the effects of the phytostabilization process on the microbiological population size and activity in the soils were also determined. According to the Ecological Risk Index (ERI) the soils studied presented "very high risk" and As, Cd and Pb were the target elements for phytostabilization. Both amendments improved soil conditions (e.g., increasing total-N and total organic-C concentrations) and contributed to PTE (Cd, Pb and Zn) immobilization in the soil. Compost showed a more marked effect on soil microbial biomass and nutrients release in soil, which led to higher B. juncea and D. glomerata biomass in compost treated soils. Biochar treatment showed a positive effect only on D. glomerata growth, despite it provoked strong PTE immobilization in both soils. The addition of both amendments resulted in an overall reduction of PTE concentration in the plants compared to the control treatment. In addition, both plant species showed higher accumulation of PTE in the roots than in the shoots (transfer factor<1) independently of the treatment received. Therefore, they can be considered as good candidates for the phytostabilization of PTE contaminated mine soils in combination with organic amendments like biochar and compost. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A multivariate measure of river quality, the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), was adapted to a West African river, the Konkoure (Republic of Guinea). Fish assemblages were sampled using gill-nets during the dry season to provide data for the IBI. Ten metrics were subsequently defined. The capacity of the modified IBI to assess the impact of a bauxite treatment plant was tested. The IBI decreased as expected at the impacted station. Detailed examination of the data revealed that one family, the Mormyridae, was almost eliminated from the impacted station, suggesting that members of this familiy can be considered as intolerant species in future uses of the IBI in other African rivers.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to develop optimal analytic methods for detecting urinary 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA) and thiocarbamide simultaneously and to evaluate the usefulness of these metabolites to a biological exposure index (BEI) for carbon disulfide (CS2) exposure. For this experiment, synthesized TTCA and thiocarbamide were used. The synthesized TTCA was identified by infrared spectrophotometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer and thin layer chromatography. The recovery rates of both metabolites were calculated to find the optimum analytical method. The amounts of urinary TTCA and thiocarbamide were measured by using an ultraviolet detector connected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after the administration of CS2 (350, 700 mg/kg) into Sprague-Dawley rats intraperitoneally. The maximum absorbance wave lengths for TTCA and thiocarbamide were 272 and 236 nm, respectively. Ethyl acetate extraction with NaCl as a salting-out reagent was used as a simultaneous extraction method for these metabolites. HPLC conditions for these metabolites included using a NH2 column, 50 mM KH2PO4: acetonitrile (85 : 15) and pH 3. Excreted amounts of urinary TTCA and thiocarbamide were increased significantly following CS2 administration. TTCA, which was already adopted as a BEI for CS2 by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), seems to be a more useful BEI for CS2 exposure than thiocarbamide. However further studies are needed to increase analytical efficiency before thiocarbamide can be adopted as a BEI and to apply this analytic method for simultaneous analysis of these metabolites in workers exposed to CS2.

AB  - Fish are important sentinel organisms for the assessment of water quality and play a central role in ecotoxicological research. Of particular importance to the assessment of health and fitness of fish stocks in response to environmental conditions or pollution are morphometric (e.g. Fulton's condition index) and somatic indices (e.g. hepatosomatic, and gonadosomatic index). Standard measurements of somatic indices are invasive and require, by definition, the sacrifice of examined animals, thus prohibiting longitudinal studies and relocation of animals captured in the field. As a potential solution, in the present study, we propose the use of micro-computed tomography (mu CT) as imaging modality to non-invasively tomographically image rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to different sediment suspensions. We here demonstrate that mu CT can be used as a tool to reliably measure the volumes of different organs, which could then be applied as a substitute of their weights in calculation of somatic indices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the results of mu CT analyses in the context of ecotoxicological research in rainbow trout. It has the potential to greatly increase the information value of experiments conducted with fish and also to potentially reduce the number of animals required for studying temporal effects through facilitating longitudinal studies within the same individuals.

AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) could provide information on plant physiological response to water stress (e.g., drought). There are growing interests to study the effect of drought on SIF. However, to what extent SIF responds to drought and how the responses vary under different precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration conditions are not clear. In this regard, we evaluated the relationship between satellite-based SIF product and four commonly used meteorological drought indices (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, Standardized Precipitation Index, Temperature Condition Index, and Palmer Drought Severity Index) under diverse climate regions in the continental United States. The four drought indices were used because they estimate meteorological drought conditions based on either single or combined meteorological factors such as precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration, representing different perspectives of drought. The relationship between SIF and meteorological drought varied spatially and differed for different ecosystem types. The high sensitivity occurred in dry areas characterized by a high mean annual growing season temperature and low vegetation productivity. Through random forest regression analyses, we found that temperature, gross primary production, precipitation, and land cover are the major factors affecting the relationships between SIF and meteorological drought indices. Taken together, satellite SIF is highly sensitive to meteorological drought, but the high sensitivity is constrained to dry regions.

AB  - A Lake Multi-biotic Integrity Index (LMII) for the China's second largest interior lake (Dongting Lake) was developed to assess the water quality status using algal and macroinvertebrate metrics. Algae and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were sampled at 10 sections across 3 subregions of Dongting Lake. We used a stepwise process to evaluate properties of candidate metrics and selected ten for the LMII: Pampean diatom index, diatom quotient, trophic diatom index, relative abundance diatoms, Margalef index of algae, percentage of sensitive diatoms, percentage of facultative individuals, percentage of Chironomidae individuals, percentage of predators individuals, and total number of macroinvertebrate taxa. We then tested the accuracy and feasibility of the LMII by comparing the correlation with physical-chemical parameters. Evaluation of the LMII showed that it discriminated well between reference and impaired sections and was strongly related to the major chemical and physical stressors (r=0.766, P<0.001). The re-scored results from the 10 sections showed that the water quality of western Dongting Lake was good, while that of southern Dongting Lake was relatively good and whereas that of eastern Dongting Lake was poor. The discriminatory biocriteria of the LMII are suitable for the assessment of the water quality of Dongting Lake. Additionally, more metrics belonging to habitat, hydrology, physics and chemistry should be considered into the LMII, so as to establish comprehensive assessment system which can reflect the community structure of aquatic organisms, physical and chemical characteristics of water environment, human activities, and so on.

AB  - Possible xenoestrogenic effects were investigated, for the first time, in two bivalve species from the Lagoon of Venice (Italy): the clam Tapes philippinarum and the cockle Cerastoderma glaucum. Bivalves were collected far from their reproductive phase at the very early stage of gametogenesis (January), and in the pre-spawning period (June) in six sites. Vitellogenin (Vg)-like proteins (a biomarker of exposure to estrogenic compounds) were measured by the alkali-labile phosphate method (ALP), in both haemolymph and digestive gland from males and females (when it was possible to distinguish sex by microscopic observation of gonadal tissue). Haemolymph calcium concentrations (a parameter considered closely related to the presence of Vg-like proteins) and the bivalve condition index (CI) were also measured. In both seasons, bivalves collected at Campalto (near a sewage treatment plant) and Marghera (a highly contaminated area) had hiaher Vg-like protein levels, particularly in haemolymph, than animals from the other sampling sites. Interestingly, CI had high values in these polluted sites. In June only, Vg-like proteins and Ca2+ levels in haemolymph exhibited similar trends in both bivalve species at most sampling sites. The responsiveness of bivalves to environmental xenoestrogens was higher in June, allowing better discrimination among sites. The present study demonstrates that animals from highly polluted areas have increased Vg-like protein levels. As endocrine disruption due to exposure to estrogenic compounds may cause fertility reduction, alterations in the sex ratio, and a decrease in reproductive rate, a condition of potential risk for bivalve populations in estuarine areas is highlighted.

AB  - The Crop protection system is dominated by the use of synthetic insecticides however incorporation of fungal biocontrol agents (FBA) at lower doses is considered to consolidate the integrated pest management (IPM) program. The success of IPM is delimited and relies on the understanding of how its performance is affected by adverse effects on FBA by agrochemicals deployed for its management as well as of other pests and diseases. In this study, laboratory grade actives of three different insecticides used for the control of Tetranychus urticae were tested at different concentrations to determine their effects on germination, mycelial growth and sporulation of eight entomopathogenic fungal isolates under in vitro conditions. The fungal isolate with the most adverse effects on the biological index was further studied for underlying reasons of antagonism. This paper reports for the first time changes in conidial surface morphology, its germination and penetration capacity on mite cuticle, post insecticide treatment. Bioassays showed that all insecticide actives at their lowest concentration (12.5% MC) were most toxic to Beauveria bassiana P isolate. Ethion and chlorpyriphos were compatible with Hirsutella thompsonii PDBC-1 at 12.5% MC while propargite showed compatibility with B. bassiana MTCC 6097, Metarhizium anisopliae MTCC 4104 and Cordyceps fumosorosea MTCC 4636 at the same concentration. Further, SEM studies showed that post-insecticide treatments, there were structural deformations on the conidial surface with a decrease in its germination and germ tube penetration capacity on the cuticle of T. urticae. Future studies in this area will help in improving IPM along with overcoming insecticide resistance problems.

AB  - Bathymodiolus azoricus, thriving at Mid-Atlantic Ridge deep vents, benefits from a symbiosis with methane- and sulphide-oxidising (MOX and SOX) bacteria, and feeds on particulate and dissolved organic matter. To investigate the temporal evolution in their nutrition adult mussels were collected from one location at the Menez Gwen vent site (817 m depth) on four occasions between 2006 and 2007 and studied using different techniques, including stable isotope analyses and FISH. Gill and mantle tissues delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures varied by 2-3 parts per thousand during the year and these variations were linked to fluctuations in tissue condition index, C and N contents and SOX/MOX volume ratios as quantified by 3D-FISH. October and January mussels presented a particularly poor condition, possibly related with the prolonged summer period of low sea-surface primary production and/or with the stress of the transplant to acoustically retrievable cages for the October mussels, and with their reproductive state in January mussels, since they were spawning. Our results point to the possibility that May mussels benefited from a pulse of sinking sea-surface plankton material. Results underline the dependency of stable isotopic signatures on the physiological state of the mussel at the time of collection, and on the type of tissue analyzed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The heavy metal (HM) pollution of forest soil has been known as one of the most challenging pollution issues due to their characteristics. In order to know the HM pollution condition in urban forest, identify the possible source of HM, 102 sub-samples of soil in 34 sites and 39 tree rings sub-samples in 7 sites were collected in the outer-ring greenbelt (ORG) in Shanghai, China. Concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd in soil and tree rings were analyzed, and the soil properties pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and organic matter were analyzed too. Geo-accumulation index and potential ecological risk index were used for assessing the contamination level of HMs. Nonparametric tests, one-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis were applied. The results showed that: (1) concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cd in soil were significantly higher than their corresponding background values of Shanghai (BVs); concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Pb in tree rings increased gradually in the past 10 years; (2) Zn and Cd were in unpolluted to moderately polluted level, Cd has moderate degree potential ecological risk; (3) vehicle exhausts and abrasion of vehicle parts of tires and historical agricultural activities were the main sources of HM contamination; (4) Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. has the potential to reconstruct the change of Cu, Zn, and Pb as a bioindicator. In conclusion, Cd should be considered as a priority control component. The relationship between plant and soil should take further focus and more studies of the behavior of HMs in soil and plants are required.

AB  - Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) in the Americas are significantly affected by drought related to El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The analysis builds upon two drought indices: the MODIS-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly in the Nin similar to o 3.4 region. Temporal correlation analysis and Moving Window Correlation Analysis (MWCA) were used to explore the long-term and short-term responses at multiple sites. Results illustrate Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) at SRNP-EMSS (Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site) and PEMS (Parque Estadual da Mata Seca) in the dry season were negatively impacted by the long-term SST anomaly across multiple ENSO phases (warm, neutral, and cold phases), while there was no long-term impact at CCBR (Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve) and TVMWR (Tucabaca Valley Municipal Wildlife Reserve). Findings from a short-term perspective, suggest that the GPP at SRNP-EMSS and CCBR were sensitive to the ENSO warm phase. TDFs GPP at PEMS and TVMWR were resistant to El Nin similar to o. Our results reveal that stronger El Nin similar to o events may lead to severe droughts in more regions across TDFs, but there is no direct relationship between the intensity of an individual El Nin similar to o event and the precipitation condition in each study site. Except for their teleconnections, the biophysical characteristics and seasonality can impact the response of ENSO on the GPP.

AB  - A new methodology for crop-growth stage-specific assessment of agricultural drought risk under a variable sowing window is proposed for the soybean crop. It encompasses three drought indices, which include Crop-Specific Drought Index (CSDI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The unique features of crop-growth stage-specific nature and spatial and multiscalar coverage provide a comprehensive assessment of agricultural drought risk. This study was conducted in 10 major soybean-growing districts of Madhya Pradesh state of India. These areas contribute about 60% of the total soybean production for the country. The phenophase most vulnerable to agricultural drought was identified (germination and flowering in our case) for each district across four sowing windows. The agricultural drought risk was quantified at various severity levels (moderate, severe, and very severe) for each growth stage and sowing window. Validation of the proposed new methodology also yielded results with a high correlation coefficient between percent probability of agricultural drought risk and yield risk (r = 0.92). Assessment by proximity matrix yielded a similar statistic. Expectations for the proposed methodology are better mitigation-oriented management and improved crop contingency plans for planners and decision makers.

AB  - The present study characterizes a population of Hydromedusa tectifera in a human-disturbed stream in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. We analyzed the variation of abundance, sex ratio, body condition index, and size class distribution across 3 sections of the Rodriguez stream with different degrees of urbanization regarding house density (null, low, and high) along the stream margins. Fieldwork was carried out from March 2017 to January 2018. Turtles were caught manually, and the following variables were recorded: site, transect and margin, sex, straight carapace length, and weight. We found 109 H. tectifera individuals (56 males, 46 females, and 7 hatchlings) with a balanced sex ratio and body condition index that did not vary among sites. Most turtles were caught at the site with greatest urbanization degree. However, our results showed no significant differences in the number of turtles caught among stream sites. Regarding size class distributions, the population consists largely of medium-sized to large adult turtles (150-250 mm). The present study demonstrates that the moderate urbanization degree occurring along the Rodriguez stream seems not to have negative impact on the studied population of H. tectifera. Some of the topics highlighted here constitute a first step to understanding how urbanization impacts this species. In any case, we suggest that a periodic monitoring program of the studied population is necessary in order to monitor the studied parameters and include new ones, such as habitat requirements, reproduction sites, and food quality, among others, that would probably be useful for population management to achieve better integration between the city and the turtles living there.

AB  - The ingress of an urban stream carrying high contaminant loads into a large coastal river originates a "dispersion plume" subject to the hydrological conditions of a river affected by tidal influences. In the present study 21 sites within the "contaminant plume" of the Riachuelo River in the Rio de la Plata were analysed on the same date in order to evaluate the biological status of the area which receives this strong environmental impact, and to examine its effect on the zoobenthic communities. Diversity, taxonomic richness, abundance, physico-chemical parameters and a biological index (IMRP) were used to assess the responses of the macroinvertebrates. The correlation between exposure and effect was calculated by means of the exposure index (IEX). The relationship between the macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables was examined using CCA analysis. Conductivity, Cr, BOD and COD, were most strongly correlated with Axis 1, suggesting the existence of a gradient of environmental degradation. The most severely contaminated sites (IMRP= 1.1-2.5; IEX = 100-78%) were all characterized by a reduced community dominated by Nematoda and Oligochaeta. A moderate response was observed between 1400 and 1600 m from the coast (IMRP = 2.6-3.9; IEX = 36%) largely owing to the physico-chemical characteristics of the recipient river which contributed to moderating the effect of the anthopogenic perturbation. For statistical validation, this area was compared with historical physico-chemical and biological data, where OD and COD showed the same tendency throughout the 10-year period.

AB  - Studying the change of resources consumption and eco-environmental carrying capacity are of importance to the sustainable development of urbanization. Based on the China's economic and social statistical data from 1950 to 2006, the ecological footprint, ecological footprint intensity, ecological deficit and surplus, and eco-environment quality comprehensive index are calculated, the correlation between urbanization and eco-environmental change is analyzed and the eco-environmental guarantee for China's urbanization in 2030 is forecasted. The major results could be summarized as follows: (1) there is a positive linear relation between urbanization and ecological footprint, negative linear relation between urbanization and ecological footprint intensity, ecological deficit and surplus and the negative exponential relation between urbanization and eco-environment quality comprehensive index. (2) By 2030, the urbanization level will reach 61.32%, the ecological deficit will increase to 42.2866x10(8) hm(2) and the eco-environment quality comprehensive index will drop to 0.3016 on the condition that the total quantity ecological footprint achieves 55.9348x10(8) hm(2). (3) Under the existing urban development pattern, the ecological overload will be more serious in the next 24 years. Constructing the reasonable industrial structure and establishing the intensive resources utilization system to alleviate the eco-environmental pressure are the tough challenges in China's urbanization process.

AB  - This paper is the outcome of an effort of several years to formulate a methodology for determining the State of the Environment over a territory. The case study is the State of Michoacan in Southern Mexico. The methodology establishes an environmental diagnostic with an integral, holistic, approach. A geoecological approach, following theoretical and methodological principles of Landscape Geoecology, serves to guide the spatial analysis of spatial units defined with a typology based on physical geography. The environmental diagnostic is done with the integration of indicators describing biophysical degradation, anthropogenic modification and socioeconomical and demographic conditions. The indicators were calculated, classified and spatialized employing Geographical Information Systems, multivariate statistics and techniques, specifically using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The results for the case study show that 19.1% of the territory of Michoacan is under states 'critical' and 'unstable to critical; and another 40% corresponds to landscapes in a state categorized as 'unstable This speaks of an environmental state that can be categorized as worrisome. The integrated diagnostic of the state of the environment is very useful as an instrument of planning within the framework of land planning policy at any government level, but also to support any protection, conservation, preservation or sustainable action on the environment of a territory.

AB  - In order to identify potential traits determining yield under terminal heat stress during grain filling stages, correlation and path coefficients analyses were conducted to study character associations among 25 morphological and physiological traits in a set of genetically divergent 36 bread wheat genotypes under normal and late sown conditions. Grain yield depicted positive association with grain weight (GW), grains/spike (G/S), biological yield (BY), harvest index (HI) under normal (NS) and late sown (LS) conditions, GGR-3 (grain growth rate at 28 days after anthesis) in LS and negative association with DM (days to maturity), HU (heat units) and PTU (photothermal unit) in NS and with ChA-1(CHB "a" at anthesis), CHB "a"-1 (total CHB at anthesis) and CHB "a"-2 (total CHB at 28 days after anthesis) in LS. Path coefficient analysis revealed that out of eight characters significantly related to yield under normal sown conditions, PTU, harvest index, biological yield and grains per spike directly affected the grain yield in positive direction. On the basis of strong association with yield and marked direct influence on yield, the numbers of grains are considered to be first order, yield components and ought to have top priority in selection under normal sown conditions. Under late sown conditions BY, harvest index (HI), CHB "a"-1 and grain weight had direct positive effect but the grains per spike exhibited negative direct effect despite of the fact that it possessed a positive significant correlation with grain yield. Based on results, it is suggested that high numbers of grains and high grain weight should be given priority for selection of high yielding genotypes in NS and LS, respectively.

AB  - Ecological water quality problems are frequently connected to increment of phytoplankton productivity and overdominance of some phytoplankton species. Metrics that show monotonously increasing or decreasing tendencies along stressor gradients is recommended for ecological state assessment. Diversity metrics are influenced by various physical disturbances and show high within-year variability; thus, there is no agreement on the usefulness of these metrics as state indicators.
   To test the usefulness of phytoplankton diversity in ecological state assessment we investigated the productivity diversity relationships for lakes and rivers in the Carpathian Basin (Hungary). We demonstrated that the shape of productivity diversity relationship depends on the investigated water body type. Regarding lakes, hump-shaped relationship was found for all computed metrics. Parallel with the increase in phytoplankton productivity values, diversity metrics showed monotonously increasing tendencies in rhithral and decreasing tendencies in large potamal rivers. We found no systematic relationship in the case of small lowland rivers.
   Changes of diversity metrics calculated for species and functional groups showed similar tendencies within the types, only the slopes of regression lines differ each other.
   The use of diversity metrics as ecological state indicators should be restricted to water body types where diversity decreases or increases monotonously with phytoplankton biomass. Regarding the lakes the use of diversity metrics is not recommended for ecological state assessment. In rhithral and large potamal river assessment, application of diversity metrics should be strongly considered. We demonstrated that diversity metrics can be useful components of multimetric indices proposed to use by the Water Framework Directive. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in the tintinnid community were studied in the neritic area of the middle Adriatic Sea from January 1998 until November 1999. Variability in tintinnid abundance showed a clear seasonal pattern with winterspring and autumn maxima. The vertical distribution of tintinnid populations was affected by their taxonomic structure. A total of 51 taxa belonging to 11 families and 20 genera were identified. Helicostomella subulata, Codonellopsis schabi, Stenosemella nivalis and Salpingella decurtata were the dominant species. Species richness was positively related to overall abundance temporally at each station, and was also affected by environmental trophic state. The total tintinnid abundance, the dominant species abundance and the dominance grade increased significantly with increasing trophic state, while the diversity indices decreased. Hence we conclude that abundance and dominance may be straight indicators of ecosystem trophic state. In addition to environmental trophic state and food availability, tintinnid species distribution was strongly affected by temperature, which was the most important environmental factor determining their seasonality.

AB  - The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 sets as an objective the restoration of 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020. This challenge raises at least two major questions: (i) How to restore and (ii) how to measure restoration success of said ecosystems? Measurement of restoration success is necessary to assess objective achievement and to adjust management with regard to objectives. Numerous studies are being conducted to try to work out synthetic indices to assess ecosystem diversity or integrity in the context of global change. Nevertheless, at the community level, there is no index that allows the assessment of community integrity regarding its restoration or resilience, despite the fact that a lot of indicators are used such as species richness, Shannon diversity, multivariate analyses or similarity indices. We have therefore developed two new indices giving new insights on community states: the first index, coined as the Community Structure Integrity Index, measures the proportion of the species abundance in the reference community represented in the restored or degraded community, and the second index, coined as the Higher Abundance Index, measures the proportion of the species abundance in the restored or degraded community which is higher than in the reference community. We illustrate and discuss the use of these new indices with three examples: (i) fictitious communities, (ii) a recent restoration (2 years) of a Mediterranean temporary wetland (Camargue in France) in order to assess restoration efficiency, and (iii) a recently disturbed pseudo-steppe plant community (La Crau area in France) in order to assess natural resilience of the plant community. The indices provide summarized information on the success of restoration or on the resilience of the plant community, which both appear less positive than with standard indicators already used. The indices also provide additional insights useful for management purposes: the Community Structure Integrity Index can indicate whether the improving target species abundance is needed or not while the Higher Abundance Index can indicate whether controlling the high abundance of some species is needed in order to approach a reference ecosystem. These relatively simple indices developed on community composition and structure state can provide a base to further indices focusing on ecosystem functioning or services not only calculating values as a static point but also its temporal or spatial dynamic.

AB  - High-elevation forests that contain mature, closed canopy stands are considered important habitat for American martens (Martes americana (Turton, 1806)) in the northeastern United States. To investigate this hypothesis, we monitored 15 radio-collared martens over a 2-year period and measured spatial use, as well as second-and third-order resource selection, from 33 seasonal home ranges and 889 telemetry locations. The population was composed primarily of adults that had small home-range size with average seasonal fidelity. During leaf-off seasons, martens selected against regenerating forest at both scales and selected for mixedwood and softwood forests and areas with rugged terrain within home ranges. Second-order selection was less pronounced during leaf-on seasons, yet martens exhibited greater selection for hardwood forest and areas with rugged terrain within home ranges. Home-range size was correlated positively with the amount of regenerating forest and body-condition index scores were lower during winter, indicating that these spatial and temporal attributes were influential. Although martens utilized low-elevation forest with extensive timber harvesting, contiguous, mature, and rugged high-elevation forest was used preferentially during winter. Land managers should minimize disturbance of montane ecosystems to ensure population viability for martens and other boreal forest species along distributional edges.

AB  - This study investigated the spatial variability of heavy metal emission patterns and associated measures of contamination on Riccarton Campus at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland. Road deposited sediments were collected from 12-different sites representing typical urban/sub-urban road layout over a 10 month period covering seasonal variations. The heavy metal concentrations of the road sediments collected from different sites of a road were determined by strong nitric acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry. The contamination levels of the heavy metals in the road deposited sediments were assessed by the accumulation index, the degree of contamination and the ecological risk index. The outcomes of the investigation showed highly site-specific heavy metal emissions that primarily varied with road lay-out, with also influences from road surface condition, surrounding land use and traffic volume. The degree of contamination and the associated ecological risk index revealed that bus stops, a road bend, a road with speed control measures and a road intersection site were the pollutant hot-spot areas among all the sites that may likely pose moderate to considerable levels of pollution to the nearby water environment.

AB  - In China, a large number of tailings deposited on natural surfaces, the potential risk of tailings attracts people's attention. In this study, heavy metals distribution, geo-accumulation index, ecological risk index, microbial diversity and community were examined to evaluate the risks of a tailings pond. Results indicated the tailings pH is about 8.17, and the redox potential was lower than zero. Heavy metals could be leached and migrate from the tailings. The tailings pond had more influence on the distribution of Pb, Zn, As, Cu, and S. The influence distance of Pb, Zn, and Cu was less than 10 m, and the influence distance of As and S was less than 50 m. S and As had stronger migration capability than other elements in the soil. The biggest potential ecological risk resulted from Pb, and the distances more than 100 m had low ecological risk. The tailings decreased microbial richness and diversity of the surrounding environment. Oxidising bacteria and reducing bacteria existed in both the tailings and the surrounding soils; however, there were more oxidising and reducing microbes in the tailings than in the surrounding soils. The tailings pond currently has little impact on the environment, but the potential risk still exists.

AB  - Seasonal changes in condition index and the biochemical components (proteins, lipids and glycogen) of the gonad/digestive gland, foot, labial palp, mantle, gills and adductor muscles of Donax trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 from the Gulf of Tunis were monitored seasonally, from November 2006 to October 2007, in relation to environmental conditions and reproductive events. The condition index increased during late gametogenesis and the ripe stage, coinciding with enrichment of the water by phytoplankton, and decreased during late summer and autumn (i.e. the spawning and rest periods). Glycogen increased during early gametogenesis and peaked during winter, pointing to its mobilisation in the formation of active ripe gametes. The foot, gonad/digestive gland, and adductor muscle were the three major glycogen-reserve tissues. Protein content was high during the end of summer in the whole individual and during autumn in the gonad/digestive gland. Lipid content started to increase as gametogenesis began, reached its peak at gonad ripeness and during the early spawning stage (summer) and sharply declined due to the shedding of gametes (autumn). A transformation of glycogen for de novo synthesis of lipids, in the gonad/ digestive gland, was suggested during the later stages of the gonadic cycle, in support of gametogenesis. Temporal fluctuations in environmental factors, particularly temperature and food supply, drive the cycle of storage and utilisation of metabolic energy reserves which in turn govern gametogenesis in Donax trunculus.

AB  - The ecological state of the Inari Lake-Pasvik River system, the largest in northern Fennoscandia (in the near-border territories of Russia, Norway, and Finland) was assessed based on studying concentrations of heavy metals (HM) in the bottom sediments (BS). The water body (Kuetsjarvi Lake) contaminated with liquid wastes from the Pechenganickel smelter contains the highest HM (Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Pb, Cd, Hg, and As) concentrations in the uppermost BS layers. In water bodies down and up the Pasvik River of the discharge site of waste waters from the smelter, the uppermost BS layers do not contain elevated concentrations of contaminating HM typical of the area (Ni, Cu, Co, Zn) but do contain higher concentrations of chalcophile elements (Pb, Cd, Hg, and As), which come mostly from trans-border sources. In the lakes receiving domestic wastes, phosphorus concentrations increase up the vertical section of the BS, which may suggest the development of eutrophication processes. They result in reducing conditions in the bottom waters and uppermost BS layers and, consequently, the transfer of ionic species of elements susceptible to variations in the redox potential from BS to waters. This process leads to depletion of the uppermost BS layers, first of all, in Fe and Mn and also in HM adsorbed on the surface of Fe and Mn oxides and hydroxides. In the water bodies that have preserved their oligotrophic nature, the uppermost BS layers were determined to accumulate Fe and Mn, whose concentrations are up to 50 times higher than the Earth's crust average and the background values. Quantitative parameters of the factors and degrees of contamination are determined, as also are the ecological risk indexes for the contamination of the water bodies with HM, using the L. Hakanson method adapted to the regional conditions. The nonessential metals Hg and Cd, which are the most toxic and dangerous for hydrobionts, are determined to be the most ecologically hazardous in all of the water bodies. Nickel is a highly ecologically hazardous element in a single water body: Kuetsjarvi Lake. In all other water bodies of the Inari Lake-Pasvik River system, elements emitted and discharged by the smelter (Ni, Cu, Co, Pb, and As) are moderately and low ecologically hazardous for the aquatic systems.

AB  - Rangeland condition was assessed in the lowveld of Swaziland to determine the current status with emphasis on contrasting different land management systems and soil classes in two study areas. The assessment incorporated the grass and woody plant layer. The methods employed to evaluate the grass layer were ecological condition index (ECI) and weighted palatability composition (WPC). The government ranch had significantly higher ECI (mean 714.5) and WPC (mean 61) than the communal land (mean: ECI - 533.5; WPC - 48.7) and the game reserve (mean: ECI - 578.9; WPC - 47.9). The ECI and WPC values did not differ between the soil classes in most cases (range: ECI 551.5-645.9 and WPC - 43.7-57.6). The density of all woody plants and encroaching plants alone were the highest in communal land. Basal cover ranged from poor (2-3%) to good (> 5%), while bare ground was rated from low (< 1%) to high (> 5%). Overall results showed great variability of studied variables at site and landscape levels of resolution. Generally, the grass layer was rated between fair and good when assessed on the basis of ecological and palatability merits. There was a clear indication of advancement of bush encroachment.

AB  - Previous studies have provided evidence of a reduced aerobic metabolic capacity, both at the cellular (metabolic enzyme activity) and the whole organism (aerobic scope) level in juvenile triploid white sturgeon, compared to diploid siblings. The downstream costs of this reduced metabolic capacity are still unclear, yet a lower aerobic scope suggests triploid white sturgeon likely have less energy to allocate to biological processes like growth and development. We conducted a 15-week growth trial to assess energy allocation to somatic growth in 2-month-old diploid and triploid white sturgeon. Spontaneous swimming activity, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and deformities were also measured throughout the growth trial as indices of energy allocation to activity and fish condition. In general, our results indicate that triploid white sturgeon may have less energy available for processes beyond basal maintenance. This could be linked to a reduced overall performance as evidenced by lower weights and more deformities when compared with their diploid counterparts. However, many indices were still mostly unaffected by triploidy (condition factor, hepatosomatic index, and swimming activity). Whether this lower growth performance seen in juvenile triploid white sturgeon continues through sub-adulthood, puberty and final maturation requires further long-term studies.

AB  - The effects of extreme freshwater events on Perkinsus marinus-Crassostrea virginica interactions remain unexplored. The effects of freshwater events on R marinus infection in C. virginica and oyster survival were therefore examined in controlled laboratory experiments and a field study. For the laboratory experiments, oysters were collected in spring, summer and winter from an area in Louisiana where R marinus is endemic. Oysters were placed in 2 recirculating water systems at a salinity and temperature similar to their collection site. They were subjected to 2 salinity treatments (freshet and control). Freshet events were simulated by reducing the water to salinities of 0 to 1 ppt over a 48 h period, and maintained for a 21 d period. Control oysters were maintained at the initial salinity. Thirty oysters were sampled prior to the freshet event, and 30 oysters per treatment group (freshet, control) were sampled on Days 7, 14 and 21 after initiation of the freshet event. Oyster mortality, R marinus infection intensities, oyster condition index and oyster plasma osmolality were measured in weekly samples. All 3 simulated freshet events (i.e. spring, summer, winter) resulted in a significant reduction in P. marinus infection intensity, but failed to eliminate infection. The failure of the oyster plasma to reach very low osmolality (<50 mOsm kg(-1)) provides a likely explanation for the lack of complete P. marinus elimination. The field study involved sampling oysters monthly in the Caloosahatchee estuary, Florida, from September 2000 to February 2002, and determining P. marinus weighted prevalence and condition index of wild oysters, and growth and survival of caged juvenile oysters. The data strongly support the contention that the numerous freshwater releases to the Caloosahatchee River kept P. marinus infection intensities in oysters at low levels, resulting in an overall low weighted prevalence, low oyster mortality and good growth. Data from our field study appear to support the hypothesis that repetitive and well-timed freshet events can prevent infection of oysters with P. marinus or at least maintain P. marinus infections at non-lethal intensities (e.g. <10(6) parasites g(-1) wet tissue) in oyster populations. The use of an adaptive management approach involving control of freshwater inflows could be invaluable to the oyster industry in areas close to freshwater diversion projects.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) to help understand how the increasing anthropogenic pressure may impact the subtropical Xiangxi River in China. Benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental surveys were conducted at 77 sites in early summer 2004. Each collection site was categorized as reference or impaired based on physical, chemical, biological, and land-use information. Six non-redundant metrics from 35 metrics were used to differentiate between reference and impaired sites. We selected six metrics for the final IBI. The scoring criteria of each metric were normalized based on the quadrisection and 0-10 scaling systems. Both scaling methods were used to assess the aquatic health of each site in the Xiangxi River watershed. The results showed that most sites were in fairly poor condition. Furthermore, we identified the relationship between B-IBI metrics, water-quality, and land-use variables with a principal component analysis. A composite of nutrients and land-use intensity explained most variances. These results suggest that the B-IBI may be a suitable method for assessing river conditions within the subtropical Xiangxi River in central China.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variability in the reproductive output of marine invertebrates affects individual energy balance and physiology, reproductive evolution, and population connectivity and recruitment. Multiple factors modulate reproductive investment and generate temporally varying or persistent spatial patterns across different scales. We used a hierarchical sampling design at 4 spatial scales over 2 consecutive years to characterize spatial patterns in the intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus along 600 km of central Chile. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the condition index were assessed in monthly samples collected during peak reproduction. No latitudinal trends or regional breaks were observed across the region. The largest fraction of variability was explained by differences among localities, separated by 10s of kilometers, and among individuals, spaced a few centimeters to meters apart. Intermediate spatial scales, i.e. few kilo meters or 100s of meters, explained only small fractions of the total variance. Persistent variability at the scale of locality is understood as resulting from topographic modulation of upwelling intensity over mesoscales. Variability among individuals is interpreted as variation in both microenvironmental and individual hormonal conditions. Sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, and upwelling intensity were not correlated with GSI across space. Our results are consistent with the idea that a suite of variables, rather than a single dominant factor, modulate reproductive output and generate environmental mosaics over 10s of kilometers. Observed spatio-temporal patterns also suggest that spatial variability in larval output may have important consequences on metapopulation dynamics and that territory-based conservation of reproductive stock can be an effective management strategy.

AB  - The seasonal variations in biochemical composition and reproductive activity of the venus clam Cyclina sinensis (Gmelin) from the Yellow River delta in China were investigated from April 2007 to March 2008 in relation to environmental factors. According to histological observations, gametogenesis began in January when the water temperature was low. Gametes matured mainly in June and July when the condition index (CI) and mean oocyte diameter peaked. Spawning occurred primarily in August when the temperature was highest, and coincided with phytoplankton bloom. The CI and oocyte diameter decreased sharply after spawning occurred, as mostly larger, mature gametes have been released. In autumn, the plentiful phytoplankton and higher water temperature were fit for the larvae to grow. Biochemical analysis indicated that gametogenesis took place at the expense of reserves accumulated in the various tissues previously during winter. A slight increase in lipid and protein content in female gonad visceral mass during sexual maturation was observed, demonstrating that lipid and protein would be accumulated as vitellin in oocytes. Conversely, the lipid and protein content in the male gonad visceral mass decreased during sexual maturation. The biochemical compositions in the adductor muscle and mantle varied during the study period, suggesting that they could support reproduction and growth. Seasonal variation in the RNA-to-DNA ratio suggests that it cannot reflect the situation of gonad development in this species.

AB  - With the implementation of human activities, such as logging, reclamation, and construction, the increasing fragmentation of ecological space and the increasing blockage of biological migration corridors cause many threats to biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the Northwest Beijing Ecological Containment Area as the research area. Based on an integrated circuit theoretical model, we identified functional connectivity networks and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of ecological blockage patterns in the region from 1998-2018 in terms of the landscape connectivity, ecological breakpoints, pinch points, and barriers, respectively. The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index had a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and a total of 33, 34, and 63 habitat core areas and 70, 74, and 152 ecological corridors were identified in 1998, 2010, and 2018, respectively. The regions with high ecological blockage were mainly in the central part of Yanqing District, the southwest corner of the study area, and the eastern urban area. Although the number of potential ecological corridors gradually increases with the probability of migration in the study area, the blockage status and vulnerability of the ecological corridors continue to increase due to the conflict between land uses. The ecological status of the study area reflects the comprehensive effectiveness of the capital's high-quality development under the strategic deployment of ecological civilization. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the effective protection and restoration of the ecological conditions in the ecological function areas is of great importance in guaranteeing the ecological quality and sustainable development of the country.

AB  - Ecological indicator approaches typically compare the prevailing state of an ecosystem component to a reference state reflecting good environmental conditions, i.e. the desirable state. However, defining the reference state is challenging due to a wide range of uncertainties related to natural variability and measurement error in data, as well as ecological understanding. This study propose a novel probabilistic approach combining historical monitoring data and ecological understanding to estimate the uncertainty associated with the boundary value of an ecological indicator between good and poor environmental states. Bayesian inference is used to estimate the epistemic uncertainty about the true state of an indicator variable during an historical reference period. This approach replaces the traditional boundary value with probability distribution, indicating the uncertainty about the boundary between environmental states providing a transparent safety margin associated with the risk of misclassification of the indicator's state. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to a time-series of an ecological status indicator, 'Abundance of coastal key fish species', included in HELCOM's Baltic Sea regional status assessment. We suggest that acknowledgement of the uncertainty behind the final classification leads to more transparent and better-informed decision-making processes.

AB  - Methods for metric scoring and health status classification in development of index of biotic integrity (IBI) vary considerably across published studies. The difference between ecosystem health assessment results from these alternative methods for scoring and classification has rarely been studied systematically. Poyang Lake in China has experienced severe degradation over recent decades. Here, we aimed to develop a benthic macroinvertebrate-based index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) to assess the wetland health of Poyang Lake, and to evaluate the difference in assessment results using different methods of scoring and classification. Data on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, water quality and human-induced disturbances were collected at 30 sampling sites. Forty-nine attributes of macroinvertebrate assemblages were tested, and only the attributes that were significantly correlated with disturbance gradients or showed strong discriminatory power between reference and impaired sites were selected as the B-IBI metrics. Two scoring, two thresholding and three classification methods were applied for metric scoring and health status classification. Five assemblage attributes, i.e. the number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, % Diptera, ASPT index and the number of predator taxa, were selected as the B-IBI metrics. Health status assessments varied considerably among the various metric scoring and classification methods, suggesting the importance of standardizing the methods for scoring and classification to be able to compare assessment results across different areas and time periods. The wetland health of Poyang Lake was rated as fair, which indicates that the wetland has experienced anthropogenic pressure and substantial changes in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. Further, sample sites adjacent to tributary river mouths were in poor or very poor condition, suggesting that pollutant input by rivers has strong negative impacts on wetland health. Effective management of the entire lake basin and its watershed is therefore important for the wetland conservation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Around the world, the decreasing health of coral reef ecosystems has highlighted the need to better understand the processes of reef degradation. The development of more sensitive tools, which complement traditional methods of monitoring coral reefs, may reveal earlier signs of degradation and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive responses. We identify new, sensitive metrics of ecosystem processes and benthic composition that allow us to quantify subtle, yet destabilizing, changes in the ecosystem state of an inshore coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Following severe climatic disturbances over the period 2011-2012, the herbivorous reef fish community of the reef did not change in terms of biomass or functional groups present. However, fish-based ecosystem processes showed marked changes, with grazing by herbivorous fishes declining by over 90%. On the benthos, algal turf lengths in the epilithic algal matrix increased more than 50% while benthic sediment loads increased 37-fold. The profound changes in processes, despite no visible change in ecosystem state, i.e., no shift to macroalgal dominance, suggest that although the reef has not undergone a visible regime-shift, the ecosystem is highly unstable, and may sit on an ecological knife-edge. Sensitive, process-based metrics of ecosystem state, such as grazing or browsing rates thus appear to be effective in detecting subtle signs of degradation and may be critical in identifying ecosystems at risk for the future.

AB  - This paper critically reviews the way land-cover stock and change data are used for 'state of the environment' reporting. The paper considers the relative merits of the indicator approach as opposed to one based on natural resource accounting. It is shown that indicators have a number of shortcomings as measures of the sustainability of land-cover change, and that land-cover accounts offer a more rigorous framework in which to develop and test policy. The argument draws upon the experience gained in the preparation of land-cover accounts for Great Britain using data from Countryside Survey 1990.

AB  - Federal and state environmental agencies conduct several programs to characterize the environmental condition of Chesapeake Bay. These programs use different benthic indices and survey designs, and have produced assessments that differ in the estimate of the extent of benthic community degradation in Chesapeake Bay. Provided that the survey designs are unbiased, differences may exist in the ability of these indices to identify environmental degradation. In this study we compared the results of three indices calculated on the same data, and the assessments of two programs: the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA). We examined the level of agreement of index results using site-based measures of agreement, evaluated sampling designs and statistical estimation methods, and tested for significant differences in assessments. Comparison of ratings of individual sites was done within separate categories of water and sediment quality to identify which indices summarize best pollution problems in Chesapeake Bay. The use of different benthic indices by these programs produced assessments that differed significantly in the estimate of degradation. A larger fraction of poor sites was classified as good by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program's Virginian Province and MAIA benthic indices compared to the Chesapeake Bay benthic index of biotic integrity, although overall classification efficiencies were similar for all indices. Differences in survey design also contributed to differences in assessments. The relative difference between the indices remained the same when they were applied to an independent dataset, suggesting that the indices can be calibrated to produce consistent results.

AB  - A simple environmental vulnerability assessment scheme is developed and illustrated using several streams in Azerbaijan as examples. Vulnerability of a river ecosystem is defined in terms of a combined impact of pressure factors such as water withdrawals, pollution, climate change impact on flow variability, and land use. These factors are used to measure the sensitivity of various elements/components of the system to impacts. The choice of these indicators may vary from area to area and depends on the nature of man-made and natural conditions. Each factor is characterized and quantified using a specific indicator and score. The total vulnerability score is estimated as a sum of the scores of all indicators. Most of the streams studied in Azerbaijan were found to be very vulnerable or extremely vulnerable, according to the developed scheme. The overall approach is straightforward and transparent. Conclusions are made about the vulnerability and/or resiliency of streams, to be taken into consideration when planning for water-sources development for the future.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare environmental pollution and ecological states of two different areas of the Songhua River areas: near Harbin City and Tongjiang City, located at a distance of about 500 km downstream. The anthropogenic pollution concentrations of heavy metals (HM) were determined. The results showed that concentrations of eight metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the water were in the range of 0.001-0.588 mg/L for Tongjiang and 0.001-0.508 mg/L for Harbin, while that in sediments were in the range of 0.67-1575.37 mg/kg for Tongjiang and 0.07-5617.13 mg/kg for Harbin, respectively. Bivalves from tested sites exposed to environmental pollution exhibited significantly different physiological states. The latter was assessed using the method of physiological loading, based on measuring the recovery time (T-rec) of heart rate (HR) after removal of the load. Trec in mussels from Harbin was recorded in the range of 151 to 234 min, while that from Tongjiang was only 115 min. Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in mollusk soft tissues were also determined for Harbin and Tongjiang, respectively. The metal pollution index (MPI) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) in the mollusks were calculated for each metal. BCF in the mussels from the Tongjiang area was lower than that from the Harbin area. Physiological testing, as well as the concentration of HM in water, and sediment, and also the bioaccumulation of HM in tissue showed that the ecological state of the Tongjiang area was better than that of Harbin. Apparently, after more extensive studies, a methodological approach of assessing the ecological state of water areas, based on physiological state testing of aboriginal mollusks, could be used in the monitoring of pollution effects in water bodies and streams.

AB  - Globally, non-native species (NNS) have been introduced and now often entirely replace native species in captive aquaculture; in part, a result of a perceived greater resilience of NSS to climate change and disease. Here, the effects of ocean acidification and warming on metabolic rate, feeding rate, and somatic growth was assessed using two co-occurring species of oysters the introduced Pacific oyster Magallana gigas (formerly Crassostrea gigas), and native flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Biological responses to increased temperature and pCO(2) combinations were tested, the effects differing between species. Metabolic rates and energetic demands of both species were increased by warming but not by elevated pCO(2). While acidification and warming did not affect the clearance rate of O. edulis, M. gigas displayed a 40% decrease at 750 ppm pCO(2). Similarly, the condition index of O. edulis was unaffected, but that of M. gigas was negatively impacted by warming, likely due to increased energetic demands that were not compensated for by increased feeding. These findings suggest differing stress from anthropogenic CO2 emissions between species and contrary to expectations, this was higher in introduced M. gigas than in the native O. edulis. If these laboratory findings hold true for populations in the wild, then continued CO2 emissions can be expected to adversely affect the functioning and structure of M. gigas populations with significant ecological and economic repercussions, especially for aquaculture. Our findings strengthen arguments in favour of investment in 0. edulis restoration in UK waters.

AB  - Large-scale continuous crop monitoring systems (CMS) are key to detect and manage agricultural production anomalies. Current CMS exploit meteorological and crop growth models, and satellite imagery, but have underutilized legacy sources of information such as operational crop expert surveys with long and uninterrupted records. We argue that crop expert assessments, despite their subjective and categorical nature, capture the complexities of assessing the "status" of a crop better than any model or remote sensing retrieval. This is because crop rating data naturally encapsulates the broad expert knowledge of many individual surveyors spread throughout the country, constituting a sophisticated network of "people as sensors" that provide consistent and accurate information on crop progress. We analyze data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress and Condition (CPC) survey between 1987 and 2019 for four major crops across the US, and show how to transform the original qualitative data into a continuous, probabilistic variable better suited to quantitative analysis. Although the CPC reflects the subjective perception of many surveyors at different locations, the underlying models that describe the reported crop status are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason.

AB  - 1. Restoration ecology that maximizes ecosystem services (ES) requires planning at large spatial scales, which are often the most meaningful for ecosystem functioning and ES supply. As economic resources to undertake ecological restoration at large scales are scarce, prioritizing sites to enhance multiple ES supply is critical.
   2. We present the Relative Aggregated Value of Ecosystem Services (RAVES) index, to prioritize sites for ecological restoration based on the assessment of multiple ES. We tested the spatial heterogeneity of ES to identify the relevant scale to managing ES and to apply the RAVES index using a local case study. We also used the RAVES index to compare three alternative restoration scenarios to enhance ES based on the availability of socio-economic resources.
   3. The highest RAVES values were found in areas with natural vegetation and in gorges with riparian forests. The lowest values were found in crop fields, steep slopes and river stretches without riparian forest. The multiscale spatial analysis indicated that most ES showed significant heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, especially at broad (20-30 km) and very broad (40-50 km) scales. For spatial scales smaller than 2 km, only biological control showed significant heterogeneity.
   4. The optimal socio-economic conditions to enhance ES supply were met when both private and public land, together with economic funds, were available to implement ecological restoration. As most areas with low RAVES were in private lands, even with limited funds restoration of private lands would result in a large increase in RAVES.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The Relative Aggregated Value of Ecosystem Services (RAVES) index is a practical tool to hierarchically prioritize sites for ecological restoration across large spatial scales. The RAVES index integrates both ecological information and societal values by weighting ecosystem services (ES) via a multicriteria analysis and can be used in scenario analysis to identify optimal management scenarios. We highlight the importance of analysing the spatial heterogeneity of ES to identify the most relevant scale to applying the RAVES index and to managing ES via ecological restoration.

AB  - Ecological state of groundwater used as a source of potable water in urban areas of the city of Ivano-Frankivsk and its satellites is dealt with. Groundwater is assessed as a ratio between the content of pollutants and the relevant hygiene standards. Environmental assessment grounded on the materials of chemical analysis (74 samples) compared to maximum allowable concentrations and background values. Calculations of the value of hazard and the intensity of pollutions were the methods of ecological and geochemical evaluation of groundwater contamination. Based on calculation results, geochemical maps were compiled depicting satisfactory, hazardous and critical degrees of hydro-ecological situation. Developed maps can serve for the purposes of further geochemical monitoring of ecological situation.

AB  - Spatially explicit ecosystem services valuation and change is a newly developing area of research in the field of ecology. Using the Beijing region as a study area, the authors have developed a spatially explicit ecosystem services value index and implemented this to quantify and spatially differentiate ecosystem services value at 1-km grid resolution. A gravity model was developed to trace spatial change in the total ecosystem services value of the Beijing study area from a holistic point of view. Study results show that the total value of ecosystem services for the study area decreased by 19.75% during the period 1996-2006 (3,226.2739 US$ x 10(6) in 1996, 2,589.0321 US$ x 10(6) in 2006). However, 27.63% of the total area of the Beijing study area increased in ecosystem services value. Spatial differences in ecosystem services values for both 1996 and 2006 are very clear. The center of gravity of total ecosystem services value for the study area moved 32.28 km northwestward over the 10 years due to intensive human intervention taking place in southeast Beijing. The authors suggest that policy-makers should pay greater attention to ecological protection under conditions of rapid socio-economic development and increase the area of green belt in the southeastern part of Beijing.

AB  - We tested hypotheses about how estuarine fish assemblages respond to habitat degradation and then integrated these responses into an overall index, the Estuarine Biotic Integrity Index (EBI), which summarized observed changes. Fish assemblages (based on trawl catches) and habitat quality were measured monthly or biweekly at nine sites in two estuaries from March 1988 to June 1990. Submerged aquatic vegetation habitats were classified as low or medium quality based on year-round measurements of chemical and physical characteristics (phytoplankton blooms; macroalgae; dissolved oxygen; nutrients; dredged channels). We tested 15 metrics and selected 8 for inclusion in the EBI: total number of species, dominance, fish abundance (number or biomass), number of nursery species, number of estuarine spawning species, number of resident species, proportion of benthic-associated fishes, and proportion abnormal or diseased. Fish assemblages in low-quality sites had lower number of species, density, biomass, and dominance compared with medium-quality sites. Fish abundance peaked in July and August, and was lowest in January to March. The seasonal cycle in low-quality sites was damped compared with medium-quality sites. Abundances of fishes using estuaries as a spawning and nursery area and of benthic species were lower in low-quality sites compared to medium-quality sites. The individual metrics and the overall index correlate with habitat degradation. The EBI based on biomass did not do better than the EBI based on number, indicating that the extra effort to obtain biomass may not be warranted. We suggest the EBI is a useful indicator of estuarine ecosystem status because it reflects the relationship between anthropogenic alterations in estuarine ecosystems and the status of higher trophic levels.

AB  - Land use changes associated with urbanization may increase ecological risk and subsequent geohazard risk. Africa is particularly vulnerable at preset as, since 2005, the highest rates of rapid urbanization-associated forest degradation have occurred there. On August 14, 2017, a compound geohazard in Freetown, Sierra Leone, caused thousands of fatalities and destroyed hundreds of houses. Land use change is considered the main factor contributing to geohazard initiation. Here, we use Freetown as a case study to quantitatively assess the magnitude of the increase in ecological risk associated with land use changes. To achieve the aim, satellite images are used in the case study area from 2007 to 2017, the data are integrated into a geographic information system. A series of indices are then used based on the processed images to describe land use and ecological risk, including dynamic index, trend and state index, and ecological risk index. The results show that Freetown experienced a rapid urbanization process, together with an unbalanced increase in urban land and complex conversion of bare and grass land, from 2007 to 2017. Significantly degenerated forest was converted into urban land (2.77%), bare land (6.47%), and grassland (10.27%), while the ecological risk level increased from low to high. The ecological risk in the affected area of geohazard is found higher than that of the surrounding mountainous area. It indicates that vegetation may reduce the risk of disaster. This result is helpful for the trade-off between urban development and ecological protection and rational urban planning. For disaster resilience and sustainable development of Freetown, and also other rapidly urbanizing cities in mountainous areas, ecological protection must be incorporated into development planning.

AB  - The use of aquatic insects in ecological studies of oil palm plantations provides an effective evaluation of biodiversity loss caused by changes in habitat. Approaches at the population or community level associated with biomarker analyses might help in the management and conservation of impacted habitats. Our aim was to assess detoxification responses (Glutathione S-transferase activity) of three aquatic invertebrates (Mnesarete aenea, Cylindrostethus palmaris, and Campylocia anceps) in oil palm plantations and forested areas in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. A total of 20 streams were sampled during the dry season of 2017, in the municipality of Tailandia, Para - Brazil. The response of this exposure biomarker was related with water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, canopy cover and habitat integrity index. The species M. aenea and C. palmaris showed differences in detoxification response induction, with higher specific activity in oil palm areas than in forest areas. The conversion of natural landscape and use of agrochemicals in oil palm plantations might affect the dynamics of organisms that are sensitive to changes in habitat quality. We suggest that differences in Habitat Integrity Index between oil palm and Amazon forest areas is a determining factor in increased GST induction in M. aenea. This result indicates that this organism might act as a sentinel for biomarker evaluations, providing an early warning signal via its biochemical responses that could help to prevent changes at the population and community levels.

AB  - Pyrethroids and fipronil insecticides partition to sediment and organic matter in aquatic systems and may pose a risk to organisms that use these matrices. It has been suggested that bioavailability of sediment-sorbed pesticides is reduced, but data on toxicity of sediment-associated pesticides for pyrethroids and fipronil are limited. In the current study, 10-d sediment exposures were conducted with larval Chironomus tentans for bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, fipronil, fipronil-sulfide, and fipronil-sulfone, the last two being common fipronil metabolites. Sublethal endpoints included immobilization, instantaneous growth rate (IGR), body condition index, and growth estimated by ash-free dry mass (AFDM). Pyrethroid lethal concentrations to 50% of the population (LC50s) were 6.2, 2.8, and 24.5 mu g/g of organic carbon (OC) for bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and permethrin, respectively; with the former two lower than previously published estimates. Fipronil, fipronil-sulfide, and fipronil-sulfone LC50 values were 0.13, 0.16, and 0.12 mu g/g of OC, respectively. Ratios of LC50s to sublethal endpoints ( immobilization, IGR, and AFDM) ranged from 0.90 to 9.03. The effects on growth observed in the present study are important because of the unique dipteran life cycle involving pupation and emergence events. Growth inhibition would likely lead to ecological impacts similar to mortality ( no emergence and thus not reproductively viable) but at concentrations up to 4.3 times lower than the LC50 for some compounds. In addition, C. tentans was highly sensitive to fipronil and metabolites, suggesting that dipterans may be important for estimating risk and understanding effects of phenylpyrazole-class insecticides on benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

AB  - Two type of ready to eat supplementary food formulations were developed by roller drying based on wheat, soy protein concentrate, whey protein concentrate, and green gram flour and were fortified with vitamins and minerals to meet the one third of the Recommended daily allowance (RDA). The supplementary food formulations contained 20-21% protein, 370-390 kcal of energy and 2,300 mu g of beta-carotene per 100 g serving. The physico-chemical, functional and nutritional characteristics were evaluated. The chemical score indicated that sulphur containing amino acids were the first limiting in both the formulations. The calculated nutritional indices, essential amino acid index, biological value, nutritional index and C-PER were higher for formula II. Rat bioassay showed higher PER (2.3) for formula II compared to formula I (2.1). The bioaccessibility of iron was 23%. Sensory studies indicated that the products were acceptable with a shelf life of 1 year under normal storage condition. However, the formulations were nutritionally better than only cereal based supplementary food formulations available commercially. The product could be served in the form of porridge with water/milk or in the form of small laddu.

AB  - Environmental standards are not harmonized in ports and neither are the instruments used for the assessing the condition of environmental efficiency of a port system. The purpose of the research conducted in the framework of this paper is to propose the methodology for calculating the Port Environmental Index (I-E) which synthesizes all environmental aspects of port operations into a single value. The goals of the paper were the following: (1) to integrate the relevant environmental aspects of port activities and evaluate the impact of port terminal processes on the environment by calculating the I-E and (2) to validate the index by applying it to a container terminal in the north-western part of Croatia. I-E was constructed using the compound index method where compilation and aggregation of individual indicators were used to form a compound index of the overall effect of port processes on the environment. The validation of I-E by applying it to a container terminal (Port of Rijeka, north-western part of Croatia) showed that the I-E can be easily applied and its application allows monitoring the overall changes in environmental performance of port areas. In addition, I-E can be used to test different pollution abatement strategies including testing interventions in the port processes and determining their share in the overall impact on the environment. In addition, the potential constraints to using such an approach are discussed in the paper.

AB  - This study used two different collectors made of polypropylene (PP) rope and polyethylene (PE) fishing net to determine Mediterranean mussel's settlement, growth, condition index (CI), meat yield (MY) and shell thickness index (STI) during the period spent between June 2017 and November 2018. With this regard, chlorophyll a, water temperature, salinity, pH and particulate matter were defined through water samples that were collected on monthly basis triplicate. The mean chlorophyll a level was recorded as 0.32 +/- 0.31 mu g/L, while water temperature was 19.73 +/- 5.14 degrees C, salinity was 35 +/- 2.070 parts per thousand, pH was 8.12 +/- 0.04, and TPM was 14.91 +/- 10.48 mg/L. As a result of the cultivation period of 8 months spent following the first intense grip, the length of the mussels is measured as 31.79 +/- 6.20 mm. Based on the Pearson correlation analysis results, the most important environmental parameter affecting Mediterranean mussels growth in length on PP rope collectors is the temperature (p < .05). The STI and CI were determined to be related with environmental temperature parameters, while no determinations could be obtained concerning the correlation of MY with environmental parameters. Assessment of Mediterranean mussels' growth rate in PP rope collectors proved significant differences (p < .05) between March and November 2018. As no Mediterranean mussels are observed on PE fishing nets during the samplings performed throughout the study period, it is determined that PE fishing nets are not suitable collector types for Mediterranean mussel cultivation.

AB  - The Saharan sand viper, Cerastes vipera, and the crowned leafnose, Lytorhynchus diadema, are small coexisting psammophilic desert snake species, consume primarily lizards and do not engage in male to male combat. They differ in that C vipera is ovoviparous and L diadema is oviparous, C vipera moves by sidewinding while L. diadema uses serpentine movement and C vipera is a sit-and-wait ambusher while L. diadema is an active hunter. Results showed that C vipera was heavier than L. diadema per unit snout-vent length (SVL). We concluded that this was related to foraging, as L diadema had to move quicker than L diadema, and to reproduction, as C vipera needed more abdominal space for developing embryos. Sexual size dimorphism was found in adults in both species and it appeared that ecological advantages took precedence over phylogenetic affinity in determining size differences. The relatively small size, ovoviparity, sandy habitat with sidewinding, and lack of male to male combat for C. vipera whereas oviparity and sandy habitat for L diadema may explain partly sexual size dimorphism in these species. Females showed seasonal fluctuations in BCI in both species but males did not and C vipera females showed greater fluctuations than L diadema females. We concluded that the former resulted from higher energy costs of females than males and the latter because ovoviparity is costlier than oviparity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have analyzed mainly the situation of environmental justice at Corrego do Morro do "S" basin, located in the southern area of the Municipality of Sao Paulo. The structural principle of environmental justice is: vulnerable populations should not be exposed to a greater burden of environmental problems, like geologic risks and a lack of urban infrastructure, public services and afforestation in their residence places. To create an appropriate index of environmental justice, we have employed data of the 2010 Census conducted by IBGE [the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics] for each census tract as well as features from the Digital Map of the City of Sao Paulo. Population has been divided according this index of environmental justice, and the various groups have been analyzed according to income and ethnic composition. The results, which are graphically presented, have shown a deep inequality between wealthy neighborhoods e poor neighborhoods, including communities living in precarious conditions, according to an economic and racial bias.

AB  - Coastal power stations entrain large volumes of cooling water, requiring biocidal treatment to prevent biological fouling. Discharged effluent is both heated and contaminated with residual traces of biocide and so it is necessary to quantify the impacts of this discharge. Cooling water from Heysham 2 nuclear power station, NW England, UK, is discharged to the intertidal area, via a culvert (to minimise erosion and maximise dilution and dispersion by directing the effluent into the receiving water at all states of the tide) within which the effluent is contained at low water. The culvert and surrounding coastal area support a population of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Mussel health was determined along a gradient of exposure, using three physiological indices: Scope for Growth, Gonad Mantle Index and Somatic Condition Index (K Factor). The Mussels within the culvert exhibited reduced physiological index values compared to an external site. A trend was identified down the length of the culvert, representing a gradient of exposure and indicating a potential negative effect on growth and reproductive output. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calibration of the soil conditioning index (SCI) to a diversify of field studies with known changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) would improve the usefulness of the SCI by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to assess the environmental services provided by agricultural land stewardship. Our objectives were to (1) calibrate SCI scores against SOC from published field studies in the Midwest and (2) compare the calibration with a recently derived calibration from the southeastern United States. We found that SOC sequestration (at 25 +/- 6 cm [10 +/- 2 in] depth) could be reliably related to SCI across a diversity of studies in the region using the regression slope: 4.52 Mg C ha(-1) SCI-1 (2.02 tn ac(-1) SCI-1), which translated into a rate of 0.35 +/- 0.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) SCI-1 (314 57 lb ac(-1) yr(-1) SCI-1), which is the mean +/- standard error of 18 slope estimates. Calibration slopes did not vary significantly between the Midwest and southeastern United States, resulting in a combined calibration of 0.29 +/- 0.03 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) SCI-1 (255 (+/-) 30 lb ac(-1) yr(-1) SCI-1), which is the mean +/- standard error of 49 slope estimates. The calibration of SCI scores to SOC will allow SCI to become a quantitative tool for natural resource professionals to predict SOC sequestration for farmers wanting to adopt conservation practices.

AB  - Five parental forms of squash Cucurbita pepo var. Giramontia Duch. and 20 hybrids F-1 created in the research laboratory of Bioinformatics of SPSU, similar in precocity, but differing in the size of seeds are considered in the research. The variability of morphometric signs (weight, length, width and thickness of a seed) of seeds in a gradient of reproduction conditions (7 years) was put in the limelight. To characterize the variability of seed bearers vegetation conditions, environment indexes calculated by "the mass of a seed" were used. The genetic analysis of variability and inheritance of signs was carried out with the use of the experimental material received according to the scheme of the complete diallelic crossing (5 x 5). The aim of the work was to research ecologic and genetic behavior of morphometric signs of a squach seed for the purposes of selection, seed-growing and technological tasks. Variability of morphometric signs of seeds in the research conducted in 2005-2012 showed, first of all, hydrothermal conditions of a reproduction year by rotation of crops on the sites of one field, genotypical factors, and interaction of the type "genotype-environment". The regression analysis adequately revealed the role of genotype in the change of a slope angle. The most responsive to conditions of a reproduction year of characterizes were weight and width of a seed. The length of a seed only slightly reacts to the conditions of a reproduction year. In various environmental conditions (the hydrotermal coefficient = 1.31 and 0.92) of seeds reproductions was revealed the unidirectional dominance of such a characteristics as seed width. Dominant genes are responsible for a more considerable expression of the feature. However at poor humidification the tendency of decreasing by 0.73 of the genes block determining seed width dimensions, in comparison with the results in conditions of high humidification. At the same time increase in genes additivity was observed. It was shown that the widely used in practice sorting (calibration) of seeds according to the linear dimensions (as for squash, seed width calibration), requires specifications according to ecological conditions of their reproduction year, genotype specifics, and the character of interaction "genotype - environment".

AB  - The gastrointestinal tracts of 32 free-ranging, 9-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) from north-central Florida were examined for the presence of helminths during July 1991 to November 1993. Aspidodera sp. (Nematoda: Aspidoderidae), most closely resembling Aspidodera sogandaresi, were recovered from 20 of 32 armadillos examined. Total numbers of A. sogandaresi ranged from 1 to 1,021 per infected animal, and followed an inverse correlation to body condition index for those animals. The cystacanth stage of 1 acanthocephalan, Macracanthorhynchus ingens, was present in 1 armadillo, and is the first report of M. ingens in the 9-banded armadillo. The present study contributes to the known natural history of the 9-banded armadillo, an important animal research model.

AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) was developed for freshwater fish in New Zealand streams. Data on freshwater fish occurrence for 5497 sites over the entire country were obtained from the New Zealand freshwater fish database for the period 1980-2002. Environmental habitat descriptors for the stream watersheds above or at each of these sites were obtained from an existing river environment classification using a geographic information system. Of the many IBI metrics in use globally, only six were adapted and applied because of differences between the fish faunas of New Zealand and the United States. A number of evaluation methods showed that all six metrics contributed to the overall IBI scores with high levels of consistency. The IBI assessment of sites sampled at different times showed high levels of temporal concordance. The IBI scores differed significantly among the geological areas, the sampling method used, and the year of survey. Overall, the results presented demonstrate the potential for New Zealand freshwater fish to be used to assess river condition at large spatial scales in New Zealand in the absence of specifically selected reference sites. This application demonstrates the effectiveness of the El approach even with a fauna of limited diversity and limited ecological specialisation as in the New Zealand fish fauna.

AB  - The performance evaluation of the effluent treatment plants (ETP) is generally based on measuring only the quality of the final effluent, not taking into account other parameters, which also contribute substantially to the performance. In this sense, indicators are important tools, for being able to summarize in a single value the state of the object evaluated, considering its various aspects and characteristics. The objective of this work is to score the importance of performance indicators for ETP evaluation and licensing, in addition to evaluating the use of ETP quality indicators established through two institutional norms (NOI-INEA 11 and NOI-INEA 14) prepared by the State Institute of Environment (INEA - Instituto Estadual do Ambiente), an environmental agency of the state of Rio de Janeiro. A bibliographic review was carried out on articles on the subject of ETP performance indicators, together with a survey on the websites of all state and district environmental agencies. In addition, for critical analysis, the methodology for researching official documents in INEA's digital archive was adopted. With this, it was possible to perceive that, in Brazil, the existence of legislation that uses indicators for ETP evaluation is still restricted to the alluded state. However, despite being little used, the indicators have great potential to assist in environmental licensing and in the substantiation of technical opinions, contributing to better information and participation of society.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural phenomenon that can cause reduced water supplies and can consequently have substantial effects on agriculture and socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought and its relationship with meteorological factors in China. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) dataset calculated from NOAA/AVHRR images from 1982 to 2010 was used to analyse the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought in China. This study also examined the trends in meteorological factors and their influences on drought using monitoring data collected from 686 national ground meteorological stations. The results showed that the VCI appeared to slowly rise in China from 1982 to 2010. From 1982 to 1999, the VCI rose slowly. Then, around 2000, the VCI exhibited a severe fluctuation before it entered into a relatively stable stage. Drought frequencies in China were higher, showing a spatial distribution feature of "higher in the north and lower in the south". Based on the different levels of drought, the frequencies of mild and moderate drought in four geographical areas were higher, and the frequency of severe drought was higher only in ecologically vulnerable areas, such as the Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin. Drought was mainly influenced by meteorological factors, which differed regionally. In the northern region, the main influential factor was sunshine duration, while the other factors showed minimal effects. In the southern region and Tibetan Plateau, the main influential factors were sunshine duration and temperature. In the northwestern region, the main influential factors were wind velocity and station atmospheric pressure.

AB  - The concept of vulnerability has been used to describe the susceptibility of physical, biotic, and social systems to harm or hazard. In this sense, it is a tool that reduces the uncertainties of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) since it does not depend exclusively on the value assessments of the evaluator, but rather is based on the environmental state indicators of the site where the projects or activities are being carried out. The concept of vulnerability thus reduces the possibility that evaluators will subjectively interpret results, and be influenced by outside interests and pressures during projects. However, up until now, EIA has been hindered by a lack of effective methods. This research study analyzes the concept of vulnerability, defines Vulnerability Importance and proposes its inclusion in qualitative EIA methodology. The method used to quantify Vulnerability Importance is based on a set of environmental factors and indicators that provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental state. The results obtained in Colombia highlight the usefulness and objectivity of this method since there is a direct relation between this value and the environmental state of the departments analyzed.

AB  - Multimetric indices are considered a low-cost and rapid means of assessing ecological integrity in streams. The present study aimed to develop and validate multimetric indices that permit evaluation of reduced impact logging (RIL) effects on the ecological integrity of streams in the Eastern Amazon. We sampled 47 stream sites, 13 of them in reference areas and 11 in conventional logging (CL) areas, which were used to develop indices. The remaining 23 stream sites were sampled in RIL areas and used for validation of the developed indices. In each stream site we measured metrics relating to habitat structure and ecological features of fish assemblages, which were used to develop a habitat integrity index (HII), biotic integrity index (BII), and a general multimeric index (GMI). The values of the indices obtained for the RIL areas were compared and tested both in relation to the values observed in the reference and CL areas, and in relation to temporal gradients (i.e. time since logging) in RIL areas. All developed indices differed between RIL and CL, however only the HII differed between RIL and reference areas. We also detected a decrease in the GMI in recently logged RIL areas compared with streams in older RIL areas.. The lack of distinction in GMI and BII indices between reference and RIL areas demonstrates the benefits of RIL practices for fish assemblages compared to conventional logging methods. However, the intermediate values obtained from these indices in RIL areas for all developed indices, the distinction of HII between reference and RIL, and the temporal variation of GMI in RIL areas can be considered as an important warning regards the possible impacts of RIL practices on ecological integrity in Amazonian streams. In summary, the multimetric indices were shown to be good indicators of ecological integrity in Amazonian streams subject to RIL. Even where the deleterious effects of logging are controlled by technical guidelines, indices presented a high sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, reinforcing their value as tools to evaluate and monitor ecological integrity of streams in human-modified tropical landscapes.

AB  - This paper characterizes the conditions for strong risk aversion and second-order stochastic dominance for cumulative prospect theory. Strong risk aversion implies a convex weighting function for gains and a concave one for losses. It does not necessarily imply a concave utility function. The latter does follow if the weighting functions are continuous. By investigating the exact relationship between loss aversion and strong risk aversion, a natural index for the degree of loss aversion is derived.

AB  - The study of trophic ecology of terrestrial salamanders is central for a better understanding of their adaptability and dispersal, in particular in Mediterranean ecosystems where their feeding activity is reduced because of prolonged arid periods. Terrestrial salamanders are generalist predators that feed on a large array of invertebrate prey groups, however, there are few studies comparing the feeding strategy and the trophic specialization at the individual level in conspecific populations of salamanders living in different habitats. In this study, two populations of the Sardinian endemic salamander Speleomantes imperialis were sampled in areas characterized by different climate, vegetation and geological substrate. Dietary habits, obtained by stomach flushing, and physiological condition, assessed through a body condition index, were analysed and compared between populations. The two populations displayed different diets on the basis of the taxonomic composition of prey categories, but both of them behaved as generalist predators and shared a similar body condition index. Moreover, in both populations the indices of individual trophic specialization were significantly different from null models assuming a random prey distribution among predators. Therefore, the two populations were largely composed by individually specialized salamanders. Overall, these findings are in good agreement with other studies on the trophic ecology of top predators and in particular of terrestrial salamanders. The realized trophic strategies, i. e. generalist at the population and specialist at the individual level, were highly consistent geographically and the two populations exploited the different arrays of prey found in their environments similarly.

AB  - With the construction of wind farms all across the North Sea, numerous artificial reefs are created. These windmill artificial reefs (WARs) harbour high abundances of fish species which can be attracted from elsewhere or can be the result of extra production induced by these wind farms. To resolve the attraction-production debate in suddenly altered ecosystems (cf. wind farms), the possible consequences of attraction should be assessed; thereby bearing in mind that ecological traps may arise. In this paper we investigated whether the wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea act as ecological traps for pouting and Atlantic cod. Length-at-age, condition and diet composition of fish present at the windmill artificial reefs was compared to local and regional sandy areas.
   Fish data from the period 2009-2012 were evaluated. Mainly I- and II-group Atlantic cod were present around the WARs; while the 0- and I-group dominated for pouting. For Atlantic cod, no differences in length were observed between sites, indicating that fitness was comparable at the WARs and in sandy areas. No significant differences in condition index were observed for pouting. At the WARs, they were slightly larger and stomach fullness was enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. Also diet differed considerably among the sites. The outcome of the proxies indicate that fitness of pouting was slightly enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. No evidence was obtained supporting the hypothesis that the WARs act as an ecological trap for Atlantic cod and pouting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mortality and biological performances of half-grown Crassostrea gigas were studied from spring 2000 to autumn 2001 at six instrumented stations located in two areas (Gefosse and Grandcamp) of the Bay of Veys (Normandy). Shell and meat growth, condition indexes and a macroscopic maturity index were determined on oysters deployed at the six stations in order to assess spatial variability in the influence of environmental conditions. In addition, histological and biochemical analyses were performed in order to determine the sex and establish the reproductive cycle (at all six sites) and the biochemical composition (at four stations). The data set including monthly mean temperatures and data provided by examination of 2,837 oysters were analysed by Principal Component Analysis and a Hierarchical Ascending Clustering which resulted in the formation of four clusters. The highest station on the shoreline belonged to a cluster characterized notably by low total weight due to a short immersion/feeding period, whereas all other stations belonged to another single cluster. Nevertheless, various biological differences were found between these stations, e.g. the reproductive cycle was generally synchronized throughout the bay but some differences relative to spawning occurrence were observed. In 2000, oyster mortality was higher at Gefosse than at Grandcamp, the latter being a more marine area. In 2001, oyster mortalities were significantly higher and all stations were strongly affected. In the Bay of Veys, oyster biological performances and mortality thus showed spatio-temporal variations which were worthy to be discussed.

AB  - There has been an increased emphasis on incorporating bioavailability-based approaches into freshwater guideline value derivations for metals in the Australian and New Zealand water quality guidelines. Four bioavailability models were compared: the existing European biotic ligand model (European Union BLM) and a softwater BLM, together with 2 newly developed multiple linear regressions (MLRs)-a trophic level-specific MLR and a pooled MLR. Each of the 4 models was used to normalize a nickel ecotoxicity dataset (combined tropical and temperate data) to an index condition of pH 7.5, 6 mg Ca/L, 4 mg Mg/L, (i.e., approximately 30 mg CaCO3/L hardness), and 0.5 mg DOC/L. The trophic level-specific MLR outperformed the other 3 models, with 79% of the predicted 10% effect concentration (EC10) values within a factor of 2 of the observed EC10 values. All 4 models gave similar normalized species sensitivity distributions and similar estimates of protective concentrations (PCs). Based on the index condition water chemistry proposed as the basis of the national guideline value, a protective concentration for 95% of species (PC95) of 3 mu g Ni/L was derived. This guideline value can be adjusted up and down to account for site-specific water chemistries. Predictions of PC95 values for 20 different typical water chemistries for Australia and New Zealand varied by >40-fold, which confirmed that correction for nickel bioavailability is critical for the derivation of site-specific guideline values.

AB  - Expansion of invasive species in new host habitats is mediated by a combination of concurrent biotic and abiotic factors. Xenostrobus securis is an invasive mussel species that is spreading in the inner part of the Galician Rias Baixas, particularly in areas of low salinity. It co-occurs with the commercially important blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in mixed patchy aggregations on intertidal shores. We asked whether biotic interactions, i.e. competition, facilitation and predation, could explain patterns of coexistence of the 2 species in an estuarine habitat. We also examined whether the effects of such interactions were dependent upon the environmental context. We manipulated predator access to synthetic aggregations of juvenile mussels at different sites using monospecific aggregations of X. securis and M. galloprovincialis and mixed aggregations at high and low densities. Performance of the species was measured as survivorship, growth and condition index. Predation played an important role in determining abundances of both species, especially in the case of the invader, although the effects on survivorship were context dependent. We did not find evidence of intra-or inter-specific competition. Growth rates of the invader were affected by environmental variability (i.e. significant site effect). Condition index of M. galloprovincialis improved in high density aggregations (monospecific and mixed), but only towards the sea (i.e. the outermost site). Results suggest that facilitative rather than competitive interactions contribute to the abundance patterns of the 2 species, at least during the juvenile stage. The environmental context was an important driver of such patterns. We emphasise the need to address the role of positive interactions regarding marine non-indigenous species.

AB  - The biochemical properties inherent to the main types of automorphic soils developed in different bioclimatic conditions of Elbrus and Terek variants of the vertical zonality within Kabardino-Balkaria were compared. The natural-climatic conditions of these variants noticeably affect the soil cover pattern. The ratio of the oxidase and hydrolase activities is sensitive to the moisture conditions in which these soils are formed. The redox processes are more active in drier conditions, whereas hydrolytic processes are more active under higher moisture. The level of the biological activity of the automorphic soils is estimated using the integral index of the ecological-biological soil status.

In existing and new systems, the species may become commercially and ecologically important, supporting both local fishing activities and populations of shorebird predators of conservation importance. This study assessed potential fishing effects and population dynamics of R. philippinarum in Poole Harbour, a marine protected area on the south coast of the UK, where the species is important for oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus as well as local fishers. Sampling was undertaken across three sites of different fishing intensities before and after the 2015 fishing season, which extends into the key overwintering period for shorebird populations. Significant differences in density, size and condition index are evident between sites, with the heavily dredged site supporting clams of poorer condition. Across the dredge season, clam densities in the heavily fished area were significantly reduced, with a harvesting efficiency of legally harvestable clams of up to 95% in this area. Despite occurring at significantly higher densities and growing faster under heavy fishing pressure, lower biomass and condition index of R. philippinarum in this area, coupled with the dramatic reduction in densities across the fishing season, may be of concern to managers who must consider the wider ecological interactions of harvesting with the interest of nature conservation and site integrity.

AB  - An individual-based model was developed to simulate growth of the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, in response to temperature, salinity and food supply conditions. Unique characteristics of the model are that: (1) length and tissue weight are related only by condition index, so that weight, up to a point, can vary independently of length, and (2) age is decoupled from length. Tissue weight changes result from the difference in assimilation and respiration. Changes in hard clam condition are determined from a standard length-weight relationship for average hard clam growth. Changes in hard clam length (growth) occur only when condition index is greater than zero, which happens when excess weight for a given length is attained. No change in length occurs if condition index is zero (mean case) or negative (less weight than expected at a given length). This model structure resolves limitations that accompany models used to simulate the growth and development of shellfish populations. The length-frequency distribution for a cohort was developed from the individual-based model through simulation of a suite of genotypes with varying physiological capabilities. Hard clam populations were then formed by the yearly concatenation of cohorts with partially independent trajectories that are produced by cohort- and population-based processes. Development and verification of the hard clam model was done using long-term data sets from Great South Bay, New York that have been collected by the Town of Islip, New York. The ability to separately track length and age in the simulations allowed derivation of a general mathematical relationship for describing age-length relationships in hard clam populations. The mathematical relationship, which is based on a twisted bivariate Gaussian distribution, reproduces the features of age-length distributions observed for hard clam populations. The parameters obtained from fitting the twisted bivariate Gaussian to simulated hard clam length-frequency distributions obtained for varying conditions yield insight into the growth and mortality processes and population-dependent processes, compensatory and otherwise, that structured the population. This in turn provides a basis for development of theoretical models of population age-length compositions. The twisted bivariate Gaussian also offers the possibility of rapidly and inexpensively developing age-length keys, used to convert length-based data to age-based data, by permitting a relatively few known age-length pairs to be expanded into the full age- and length-frequency structure of the population.

AB  - This study presents the first analysis of the reproductive cycle of the razor clam Ensis arcuatus and the effect of oceanographic conditions. From February 1998 to July 2000, samples were taken at 2-week intervals from the natural submerged bank of the Cies Islands in the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain). A follow-up gonadal condition index (GCl) was conducted and calculated as gonad fresh weight/valve dry weight. From histological preparations of the gonad stained with haematoxylin and cosine, a gametogenic scale was drawn up based on seven stages: (0) sexual rest, (1) start of gametogenesis, (II) advanced gametogenesis, (IIIA) ripe, (IIIB) start of spawning, (IIIC) restoration and (IV) exhaustion. E. arcuatus is gonochoric and the gonadal development of the two sexes is highly synchronous. During the summer, they were in the sexual rest stage, coinciding with the upwelling period in the Ria de Vigo when the cold, nutrient-rich waters from the bottom rise to the surface. This phenomenon produces phytoplanktonic blooms which mean an increase in the availability of food. Gametogenesis began at the start of autumn when upwelling ceased and food was less plentiful. During the winter and spring, consecutive spawns occurred interspersed with gonadal restoration periods. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems can have tipping points at which the system shifts abruptly to alternate states, although quantitative characterization is extremely difficult. Here we show, through critical analysis of two different reach scale (25 m and 50 m) studies conducted downstream of two point sources, two tributaries (main stem and confluences) and a 630 km segment of the Ganga River, that human-driven benthic hypoxia/anoxia generates positive feedbacks that propels the system towards a contrasting state. Considering three positive feedbacks-denitrification, sediment-P- and metal-release as level determinants and extracellular enzymes (b-D-glucosidase, protease, alkaline phosphatase and FDAase) as response determinants, we constructed a 'river ecosystem resilience risk index (RERRI)' to quantitatively characterize tipping points in large rivers. The dynamic fit intersect models indicated that the RERRI<4 represents a normal state, 4-18 a transition where recovery is possible, and >18 an overstepped condition where recovery is not possible. The resilience risk index, developed for the first time for a lotic ecosystem, can be a useful tool for understanding the tipping points and for adaptive and transformative management of large rivers.

AB  - In order to determine the effects of extended wet-storage under ambient conditions we investigated the physiological response of blue mussels held for up to 3 months in a commercial holding facility. During the summer and the fall there was a significant decline in dry weight and condition of mussels held over time when compared to field controls. Neutral red retention time decreased significantly in holding for both seasons but not in the field controls, indicating an increase in stress response for held mussels. Little variation was noted in the expression of the oxidative stress genes superoxide dismutase and GSH-peroxidase during the summer or fall regardless of treatment. Expression of the antimicrobial peptide MGD2 was evident in the summer holding samples as early as 1 week but did not occur in the fall holding samples until 3 months. This suggests that holding conditions have stimulated the immune response in a manner potentially related to time in holding and environmental temperature. Based on our results we recommend that one month should be the maximum time allowable in ambient extended holding during warm water seasons. During the warmest part of the summer this could be reduced to two weeks. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modifications and use of Karr's Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for assessing the effects of anthropogenic impacts to aquatic ecosystems have typically occurred using data collected at the macro scale. However, some non-point sources of habitat degradation occur at small scales. One possible source of perturbation to fish habitat in boreal rivers is the application of rip rap shoreline armouring in human use areas. In this study we assess the use of IBI in a small scale setting and discuss the potential impact of rip rap shoreline armouring. We captured small and juvenile fishes weekly during 2002-2003 from 12 sample sites within the littoral zone of a human use area using a modified beach seine. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the data to examine the relationship between species composition and IBI scores. We also performed PCA on the IBI metrics to assess our modifications. The IBI method produced higher scores for armoured sites than for unarmoured sites. We found a strong rank order correlation (Spearman's p > 0.93; p < 0.001) between the modified IBI scores and the first principal component, suggesting that Karr's original empirically-based IBI is strongly linked to species composition. We found a high degree of redundancy between the metrics of the IBI that validate our modifications. These results suggest that IBI can be a suitable method for assessing non-point impacts from within a small study area. Our results also indicate that fish habitat from rip rap armoured sites within the test area had consistently higher IBI scores that unarmoured sites.

AB  - Population studies of invasive species allow us to understand how invaders react to new biotic and abiotic conditions, and how native species react to invasion. We evaluated the colonisation efficiency of the invader Zaprionus indianus (Gupta), in the urban area of Porto Alegre city, southern of Brazil. Samples of flies were taken from three urban parks, and ecological indexes were used based on the frequency of the sampled species. The indexes were calculated for breeding and feeding sites separately. The highest frequencies of Z. indianus compared to the other drosophilids were registered during seasons of highest mean temperatures, both for the feeding and the breeding sites. The highest values for the dominance index (D) and the lowest values for diversity (IT) were found at the same seasons and for both components. An analysis of the values for Morisita similarity index shows that the Botanical Garden and Farroupitha Park had higher similarity in terms of diversity of the breeding sites. For the feeding sites the highest similarity was between Farroupilha Park and Gabriel Knijnik Park. Despite the three parks have some particularities, the ease with which Z indianus became established at these places seem to be the same. The arrival of this invader seems to be promoting adjustments in the survival strategies of the resident species, at least at certain periods when the frequency of the populations of the invader increases significantly. However, most of species seem to be able to coexist with the invader.

AB  - The reformation of Russian agriculture and the development of landscape-adaptive agricultural systems have generated interest in the agroecological aspects of studying soil cover patterns. The qualitative evaluation of soil resources is necessary for objective comparison of their quality at the landscape, regional, and interregional levels. The applicability of the soil-ecological index (SEI) as an integral criterion for quality assessment of soils, soil associations, and soil cover patterns on the basis of a common all-Russia scale has been experimentally verified on test plots. This index can also be applied for assessing the degree of contrast in the soil cover. The analysis of different soil-climatic regions in the European part of Russia has shown that the SEI value is well correlated with the soil-climatic conditions. However, for a particular farm, the climatic component of the SEI becomes equal for all the fields. At the same time, the soil properties and geomorphic conditions limiting soil fertility are usually different for different soil combinations, and they become essential upon calculation of the SEI for the particular field. Feasibility of verification and correction of the calculated SEI on the basis of experimental data is shown. This makes it possible to find better-grounded decisions on the agrotechnologies applicable for a given field.

AB  - A number of physical, chemical and biological water quality parameters are measured to understand quality conditions of a riverine environment. Various aggregation techniques have been used to reflect the combined effect of the existing or proposed quality levels. Water Quality Index (WQI) has been developed primarily for fresh water environments. Organic pollutants are not considered in many WQIs because analyses of organics are rather expensive. In general, fecal coliform and total coliform counts are measured to reflect biological contamination of water. With growing consensus on considering rivers as ecological entity, rather than merely a source of water for human consumptions, the emphasis is changing from water quality index (WQI) to River Health Index (RHI). As benthic macroinvertebrate species are differentially sensitive to many biotic and abiotic factors in river environment, macroinvertebrate community structure has commonly been used as indicator of stream water condition. A number of river health assessment methodologies have been proposed in past and several indices such as Ecological Health Index (EHI), Ecological Quality Index (EQI), Overall Index of Pollution (01P) and River Pollution Index (RPI) have been developed using water quality variables and aquatic species for evaluating the ecological health of river systems. This paper attempts to review and summarize some of these indices with particular emphasis on measurable parameters included in such formulations. The analyses suggest that with sufficient scientific experience and understanding in this area, it is possible to define a River Health Index (RHI) by including algae, macroinvertebrates and fish species as measurable parameters along with routine physico-chemical characteristics of river water. One such formulation on RHI has been proposed by the authors in this paper. The novelty of the proposed formulation include simple calculations and presentation of RHI value on 0-100 scale. The biological indices used in ACEDP (2011) requires biological expertise which is not normally available with water resource managers. Hence species identification and counting based simple biotic indices have been proposed so that it can be easily done by non experts also. River Health Level (RHL) can be categorized as 'critical' or 'excellent' based on RHI value < = 20 or > 80. Thus RHI values can be used to identify the healthy or unhealthy stretches of the river. RHI can serve as scientific tool to assess the current status, need and effectiveness of any intervention required to improve the condition of the river. Application of this RHI formulation on main stream of river Ganga (India) is under study.

AB  - Background: Genomic prediction using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) genotype by sequencing platform has not been reported in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi). The principal aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap and to assess predictive ability of genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (gBLUP) for traits of commercial importance in a yellowtail kingfish population comprising 752 individuals that had DNA sequence and phenotypic records for growth traits (body weight, fork length and condition index). The gBLUP method was used due to its computational efficiency and it showed similar predictive performance to other approaches, especially for traits whose variation is of polygenic nature, such as body traits analysed in this study. The accuracy or predictive ability of the gBLUP model was estimated for three growth traits: body weight, folk length and condition index.
   Results: The prediction accuracy was moderate to high (0.44 to 0.69) for growth-related traits. The predictive ability for body weight increased by 17.0% (from 0.69 to 0.83) when missing genotype was imputed. Within population prediction using five-fold across validation approach showed that the gBLUP model performed well for growth traits (weight, length and condition factor), with the coefficient of determination (R-2) from linear regression analysis ranging from 0.49 to 0.71.
   Conclusions: Collectively our results demonstrated, for the first time in yellowtail kingfish, the potential application of genomic selection for growth-related traits in the future breeding program for this species, S. lalandi.

AB  - Evaluating the nutritional condition of fish larvae is imperative to establish the importance of starvation, understanding the causes of larval mortality and determining favorable zones for growth and survival within nursery areas. We assessed the nutritional condition ofMerluccius hubbsilarvae employing RNA/DNA index (sRD)and its derived index of growth performance (Gpf). Larvae (N = 395) were collected during the reproductive peak in 2010 and 2011. Principal Component Analysis and Generalized Linear Models were used to study the relationship between larval condition and endogenous factors (size, weight, growth rate, trophic incidence, and carbon content per stomach) and exogenous variables (temperature, chlorophyll concentration, potential prey availability, ctenophore biomass, and hake larvae density). The year of sampling was also considered as a variable. The significant variables in the model selection were size, temperature, the density of hake larvae, and year. The larval size was positively related to the condition while larval density and temperature showed a negative relationship with thesRDindex. The year was also a significant variable, with higher larvalsRDvalues in 2010. The negative relationship betweensRDand larval density suggests the existence of mechanisms of density-dependence operating upon larval condition. On the other hand, the lower temperatures occurred in stratified waters (with greater availability of food) a fact that might explain the negative relationship betweensRDand temperature. The fitting of the models suggests that other explanatory variables might be considered to improve the understanding of the nutritional condition index nature.

AB  - Considerable resources are being used to develop and implement bioassessment methods for wetlands to ensure that "biological integrity" is maintained under the United States Clean Water Act. Previous research has demonstrated that avian composition is susceptible to human impairments at multiple spatial scales. Using a site-specific disturbance gradient, we built avian wetland indices of biological integrity (AW-IBI) specific to two wetland classification schemes, one based on vegetative structure and the other based on the wetland's position in the landscape and sources of water. The resulting class-specific AW-IBI was comprised of one to four metrics that varied in their sensitivity to the disturbance gradient. Some of these metrics were specific to only one of the classification schemes, whereas others could discriminate varying levels of disturbance regardless of classification scheme. Overall, all of the derived biological indices specific to the vegetative structure-based classes of wetlands had a significant relation with the disturbance gradient; however, the biological index derived for floodplain wetlands exhibited a more consistent response to a local disturbance gradient. We suspect that the consistency of this response is due to the inherent nature of the connectivity of available habitat in floodplain wetlands.

AB  - Metallothionein is a cytosolic protein found in a variety of tissues and have been involved in the regulation of essential trace metals such as copper and zinc, and in the detoxification of essential and nonessential metals. With the aim to study their seasonal variation and their possible role in reproductive behavior, we evaluated metallothioneins (Mts) in Perna viridis, taken from Rio Caribe and Chacopata localities in the North coast of Sucre state, Venezuela. A total of 325 samples were obtained from February to December 2003. We determined the following biometric indices in bivalves: Condition Index (CI), meat yield (RC) and dry weight-length relationship (PSL). Besides, Mts in whole tissue were separated by molecular exclusion chromatography, Sephadex G-50 and quantified by saturation with cadmium. Our results showed that the biometric indices (RC and PSL) had seasonal variations between localities and maturity stages, with the exception of IC. No significant differences were found between sexes. Mts showed seasonal variations between localities, with the highest concentrations between February and March, and minimum ones between September and December, coinciding with the respectively high and low productivity periods in the area. The mussels from Rio Caribe had higher Mts concentration than those from Chacopata. Furthermore, immature mussels showed the highest Mts concentration while the lowest was found in spawned specimens. We found a significant negative relationship between Mts and CI. Our results demonstrated that MTs in Perna viridis are influenced by the condition index and reproductive status, as well as physico-chemical factors in the marine environment.

AB  - The water quality of many streams in Lake Victoria Basin, Kenya is affected by agricultural intensification, municipal and industrial effluent, as well as water abstraction, livestock and deforestation. Management efforts have been hampered by lack of clear standards against which to judge the degree of environmental degradation. To achieve this goal, a macroinvertebrate-based Index of Biotic Integrity was developed to monitor ecological integrity of selected rivers occurring in the same ecological zone in the upper reaches of the basin. Macroinvertebrates were sampled with a Surber sampler at 22 stations. The stations were grouped into three condition categories (reference, intermediate and impaired stations) according to the level of degradation. Twenty metrics representing the structural and functional organization of macroinvertebrates were computed using Mann-Whitney U tests. The separation power of the metrics was evaluated using box plots. Final metrics were evaluated for responsiveness by Pearson's correlations with physicochemical parameters. Of the 20 metrics, 9 met the test criteria, as they displayed variability across the stations, and were used to provide the final scores for Macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (M-IBI). Metric values at both reference and impaired sites were used to establish the scoring criteria using inter-quartile ranges. This index provided preliminary evidence of response to changes in ecosystem integrity exhibited by resident macroinvertebtrate assemblages in rivers in the upper reaches of Lake Victoria Basin. It was recommended that the index developed be used to assess and monitor rivers in the upper catchments of Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya.

AB  - The comparative assessment of natural potential of agro-chernozems of Siberia in order to plan rational land use, protection of soils and soil cover is carried out. The score was determined by soil-ecological index (SEI). SEI calculation was carried out on climatic, agrochemical and soil parameters. At calculating the climate index, the sum of temperatures above 100 degrees C and precipitation was taken into account; the agrochemical index was calculated by the content of humus, mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium, the reaction of the medium and the soil index - by alkalinity, salinity, erosion, granulometric composition of soils. According to the data of the Landsat satellite and the QGIS software, a map of the distribution of chernozems in the Siberian region was created. Interactive map is comparable to the relief map of the study area, cadastral, geological and other maps. The most valuable soils for agricultural use are formed in the Krasnoyarsk and Altai Krai, where up to 50% of the total chernozem area of the Siberian Federal district (SFD) is concentrated. SEI of agro-chernozems of Siberia decreases in a number: Krasnoyarsk Krai - Altai Krai - Irkutsk region - Omsk region - the Republic of Tuva. The development of erosion and deflation to an average degree reduces the SEI value by 14-36%. The calculated SEI values of agro-chernozems can be used to determine their resource potential, cadastral and market assessment, development of recommendations for land transformation. In modern conditions, the unused chernozems are considered as unrecorded reserve for expansion of arable land, most balanced, anthropogenic, environmental resource.

AB  - The presence and persistence of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) requires a robust and rapid monitoring method. Measurement and monitoring of NOM fractions using current technology is time-consuming and expensive. This study uses fluorescence measurements in combination with Parallel Factor (ParaFac) analysis to characterize NOM fractions. This was achieved through: (1) determining the origin and composition of NOM fractions using fluorescence index (FI), humification index, biological index, and freshness index, and (2) using multivariate analysis to reveal key parameters and hidden NOM fraction characteristics influenced by seasonal changes and environmental activities. The ParaFac model revealed that the NOM fractions for Belgium plants are mainly hydrophobic acids, aromatic proteins, biological activity, humic acid-like, and fulvic acid-like moieties. The NOM fractions in South African plants were mainly aromatic protein, humic acid-like, fulvic acid-like, tryptophan-like, and protein-like moieties. For Belgium plants in spring FI >1.7, indicating high microbial sources, whereas FI < 1.3 for South African plants, signifying terrestrial sources of NOM. On the one hand, the first principal component (PC1) interpreted 33.02% of the total variance, and is a measure of fluorescent NOM relative concentration. On the other hand, the PC2 interpreted 21.47% and contains most of the information on humification, freshness, and biological indicators, while PC3 interpreted 17.74% and contains information on the origin and variation in environmental conditions. These results will assist in developing a method for online monitoring of NOM fractions in water sources based on environment activities and spectral measurements.

AB  - Not all boundaries, whether stratigraphical or geographical, are marked by species-level changes in community composition. For example, paleodata for some sites do not show readily discernible glacial-interglacial contrasts. Rather, the proportional abundances of species can vary subtly between glacials and interglacials. This paper presents a simple quantitative measure of assemblage turnover (assemblage turnover index, ATI) that uses changes in species' proportional abundances to identify intervals of community change. A second, functionally-related index (conditioned-on-boundary index, CoBI) identifies species contributions to the total assemblage turnover. With these measures we examine benthonic foraminiferal assemblages to assess glacial/interglacial contrasts at abyssal depths. Our results indicate that these measures, ATI and CoBI, have potential as sequence stratigraphic tools in abyssal depth deposits. Many peaks in the set of values of ATI coincide with terminations at the end of glaciations and delineate peak-bounded ATI intervals (PATIs) separated by boundaries that approximate to glacial terminations and to transgressions at neritic depths. These measures, however, can be used to evaluate the assemblage turnover and composition at any defined ecological or paleoecological boundary. The section used is from Ocean Drilling Program (OPD) Hole 994C, drilled on the Blake Ridge, offshore SE USA.

AB  - Chatnelea gallina is an infaunal bivalve, widespread in sandy bottoms along Mediterranean coasts. It is an important economic resource for fisheries in the Adriatic, although in recent years over-fishing, and other concurrent factors, have dramatically decreased clam harvesting. In this context, it is of great interest to gain information on seasonal variations in the physiological performance of clams, for an overall evaluation of their well-being. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to define allometric relationships and effects of temperature on clearance and respiration rates of C gallina. The mean values of b coefficients were calculated and used to correlate physiological measurements to 'standard' body mass, when seasonally collected clams were analysed. The highest clearance rate (0.42 L h(-1)) was measured in clams collected in July 2000; the highest respiration rate (12.22 mu mol O-2 h(-1)) was observed in July 2001, leading to a negative scope for growth (-2.8 J h(-1)). The influence of environmental and endogenous factors, mostly reproduction, was discussed. Survival in air and condition indices, showing higher stress conditions in December 2000 and July 2001, were in good agreement with the other physiological measurements. The physiological responses examined in this study appear to be suitable for providing detailed indications on the well-being of C gallina and may be useful for future studies aimed at eco-sustainable management of the resource.

AB  - It has been suggested that metallothionein (MT) not only can regulate essential metals and detoxify toxic metals, but that MT can also play a significant role as an antioxidant and can be induced by oxidative stresses other than metals. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the combined effect of H2O2 and cadmium (Cd) on MT induction and condition index (CI) in dogwhelks Nucella lapillus. Adult male dogwhelks (27 +/- 1 mm in shell length) were exposed for 20 days to (1) control (filtered natural seawater only); (2), 0.50 ppm Cd; (3) 2.0 ppm H2O2 + 0.50 PPm Cd; (4) 1.0 ppm H2O2 + 0.25 ppm Cd: (5) 2.0 ppm H2O2; (6) 1000 ppm H2O2 or (7) 1000 ppm H2O2 + 0.50 ppm Cd. The concentration of MT in the Leiblein gland of N. lapillus was quantified using the silver saturation method. MT or MT-like proteins in the animals were induced by Cd (0.5 ppm), H2O2 (2.0 ppm) or Cd + H2O2, indicating that MT in this gastropod species can be induced by either metal or oxidative stresses. Exposure to high H2O2 (1000 ppm) alone or combined with Cd, and exposure to Cd (0.50 ppm) or H2O2 (2.0 ppm), resulted in significant weight loss? indicated by a reduction of CI. However, CIs of groups (3) and (4) were similar to that of the control suggesting that Cd antagonistically reduces toxicity caused by H2O2 since Cd-induced MT may have a protective function against hydroxyl radicals.

AB  - OCs (organochlorine compounds), such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and OCPs (organochlorine pesticides), and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) were determined in wild and raft mussels collected in several stations from Ria de Vigo during the period 2010-2019. The concentration levels of Sigma PCBs Sigma DDs (sum of pp'-DDE and pp'-DDD metabolites) and Sigma PAHs ranged from 22.1, 2.63 and 7.55 ng g(-1) to 58.0, 6.89 and 25.2 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The concentrations of isomers of PCBs in mussel were in the order hexachlorobiphenyls > pentachlorobiphenyls > tetrachlorobiphenyls > trichlorobiphenyls. PCBs 153 and 138 were the most abundant in all samples. Pp'-DDE was the predominant metabolite (70.8% of Sigma DDs). The main PAHs in decreasing order of abundance were CHR > BbF > BaA > IcdP. Three biological parameters: lipid content, shell length and condition index have also been investigated. Univariate techniques confirmed that levels of many compounds presented significant relation (p<0.05) with two of the biological parameters (shell length and condition index). In the case of lipid content, only PCB180 congener was significantly related. Multivariate techniques of data exploration such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that spatial distribution of PCBs, OCPs and PAHs levels appeared in the studied samples and was justified by local human pressures. Temporal trends (linear regressions) showed a decrease, mainly of OCs levels, along the period 2010-2019. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three water flow rates (3.1, 7.3, and 12.1 cm s(-1)) were used during a 26-day period to determine their effects on shell dimensions, tissue mass, condition index, biochemical composition of tissues, and mortality of the penshell Atrina maura and mussel Mytella strigata kept in an open-flow flume. These parameters were measured at the beginning and end of the trial and significant differences were determined using non-parametric comparisons of multiple independent samples. Both species were able to withstand high seston loads and daily oscillations of temperature, which yielded negligible mortalities. Both species were affected differently by water flow. Atrina maura grew significantly larger above a flow of 7.3 cm s(-1), which appears typical of species inhabiting tidal channels. At this flow, there was a significant increase in lipids and acylglycerols within the digestive gland, adductor muscle, and mantle tissue, accompanied by a significant decline in proteins and carbohydrates within the same organs. In contrast, the flow did not have a significant effect on M. strigata, except for increased lipid and acylglycerol reserves within body tissues at 3.1 and 7.3 cm s(-1), and increased lipid and acylglycerol levels within the gonad at 7.3 and 12.1 cm s(-1). Digestive gland proteins, carbohydrates, and glycogen increased at the highest flow. Data suggest that the penshell is a flow-conforming mollusk that prefers flows exceeding 7.3 cm s(-1), and that the strigate mussel is a flow-regulating species in the range of flows that were studied.

AB  - The reproductive cycle of bivalves is regulated by several natural environmental factors but exposure to chemical pollutants can also interfere and may result in advanced or delayed spawning season. To our knowledge, the gametogenic cycle of the suspension-feeder bivalve Donax trunculus has not yet been used as biomonitoring tool in ecotoxicological surveys. The aim of this study was to examine over a year physiological reproductive endpoints (sex-ratio, gametogenic and energy reserve cycles) and biological indices (condition index, allometry) in D. trunculus originating from two sites differing by their level of contamination. Specimens were collected bimonthly from November 2008 to October 2009 from a polluted site (Rades Meliane) and a comparatively reference site (Sidi Jehmi) in the Gulf of Tunis (Tunisia). Five stages were depicted by histological examination of gonads: undifferentiated, developing, mature, spawn and spent. Differences in the gametogenic cycle according to the site of origin of bivalves were observed. The spawning period began in March and was maximum in May in bivalves from both sites, but the percentage of spawning animals was higher in the polluted site vs the reference site. The spawning period was shorter in animals from the polluted site comparatively to the reference site. Energy reserves (glycogen, lipids) were higher in March and May comparatively to the other studied periods in bivalves from both sites. Lower energy reserves levels were usually observed in animals from the polluted site compared to the reference site. Seasonal variations of the condition index were associated to the reproductive and nutritive status of bivalves. Differences in allometry were depicted between bivalves from both studied sites. If we try to link allometry, energy reserves and reproduction, it can be hypothesized that for bivalves from the reference site, energy reserves are allocated to gametogenesis and length growth. For bivalves from the polluted site, energy reserves could be devoted to tolerance to chemical stress and to reproductive processes. Therefore, D. trunculus appears as a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of the ecotoxicological risk of contaminants such as endocrine disruptors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to account for host age-biased parasite distribution, with some of them suggesting a key role of ectoparasites in the evolution and maintenance of weight hierarchies within broods. We examined parasite distribution among individual hosts across the whole period of host exposure to the parasite in a host system that shows distinct within-brood differences in age and age-related mortality. By contrast to previous hypotheses, we found that the abundance of a haematophagous, mobile ectoparasite Carnus haemapterus on nestling European rollers (Coracias garrulus) was highest approximately during the mid-nestling stage of their host, coinciding with the inflection point of the host growth phase. Parasite load increased neither with absolute resource availability (i.e. body size), nor body condition index. By contrast to previous evidence, higher parasite load under natural conditions was associated with a stronger cell-mediated immune response. However, this association was moderated by low parasite densities, as well as a better brood body condition index. Overall, although we revealed remarkable host ontogenetic effects on parasite distribution, the present study suggests that a highly mobile ectoparasite generally prefers healthier hosts. We propose that, in host systems with a marked asynchrony of hatching and background mortality within the brood, parasites favour persistence rather than nutritional attractiveness of the host.

AB  - During last decades semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands have undergone several hydrological and biological changes as a consequence of increased water inputs from agricultural areas. Specific indices are needed in order to assess the condition of these unique ecosystems in relation to major hydrological disturbances at watershed level. Through the long-term study of selected plant taxa in a set of representative wetlands in Murcia province (SE Spain), together with the characterization of their watershed agricultural land uses, plant indicators of wetland condition were sought and then combined into a wetland condition index. Percentages of land cover classes of interest were weighted taking into account land cover arrangement and receiving wetland size. Characteristic perennial plant taxa were sampled in 1989 and 2008 and significant taxa frequency changes at each wetland site were determined. Regression analysis was used to relate wetland plant taxa frequency and watershed condition during the study period. Limonium spp., Arthrocnemum glaucum, Phragmites australis, Tamarix canariensis and Atriplex halimus showed significant relationships with watershed condition. Indicator taxa were thus identified and their frequencies were combined into an integrated index of wetland condition, which showed a robust relationship with watershed hydrological condition.

AB  - Background: Originating from Northeast Asia, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas has been introduced into a large number of countries for aquaculture purpose. Following introduction, the Pacific oyster has turned into an invasive species in an increasing number of coastal areas, notably recently in Northern Europe.
   Methods: To explore potential adaptation of reproductive traits in populations with different histories, we set up a common garden experiment based on the comparison of progenies from two populations of Pacific oyster sampled in France and Denmark and their hybrids. Sex ratio, condition index and microarray gene expression in gonads, were analyzed in each progeny (n = 60).
   Results: A female-biased sex-ratio and a higher condition index were observed in the Danish progeny, possibly reflecting an evolutionary reproductive strategy to increase the potential success of natural recruitment in recently settled population. Using multifarious statistical approaches and accounting for sex differences we identified several transcripts differentially expressed between the Danish and French progenies, for which additive genetic basis is suspected (showing intermediate expression levels in hybrids, and therefore additivity). Candidate transcripts included mRNA coding for sperm quality and insulin metabolism, known to be implicated in coordinated control and success of reproduction.
   Conclusions: Observed differences suggest that adaptation of invasive populations might have occurred during expansion acting on reproductive traits, and in particular on a female-biased sex-ratio, gamete quality and fertility.

AB  - National activities to protect the natural environment ave on the rise. Conventional explanations of the phenomenon emphasize domestic processes, set in motion by environmental degradation and economic affluence. We propose instead a top-down causal imagery that hinges an a global redefinition of the "nation-state" to include environmental protection as a basic stare responsibility. We test our view using event-history analyses of five indicators Of environmentalization. the proliferation of (I) national parks, (2) chapters of international environmental associations, (3) memberships in intergovernmental environmental organizations, (4) environmental impact assessment laws, and (5) environmental ministries in countries around the would over the twentieth century For all five measures, the top-down global explanation proves stronger than the bottom-up domestic alternative: The global institutionalization of the principle that nation-states beau responsibility for environmental protection drives national activities to protect the environment. This is especially true in countries with dense ties to world society and prolific "receptor sites," even when controlling for domestic degradation and affluence It appears that blueprints of nation-state environmentalization, which themselves become more universalistic over time, are drawn in world society before being diffused to and enacted by individual countries.

AB  - The sea cucumber Isostichopus fuscus (Ludwig, 1875) has been exploited, legally, and illegally, on the Baja California peninsula since 1988. The fishery was closed in 1994 due to overfishing symptoms but reopened in 2007 under management strategies and harvesting permits. Nocturnal samplings surveyed abundance, size and weight of 1. fuscus. Density, proportion of individuals above the minimum size for fishing (MSF), weight length relationship parameters, relative condition index (Kn), parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation (VBGE), individual and average age from the VBGE, natural mortality rate (M) and survival percentage cohort were estimated from the data set for the population in 2005 2007, and compared with the same population in 2013 at the Biosphere Reserve Bahia de los Angeles. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to obtain the stakeholders' perspectives and opinions about the fishery. There were no significant differences in the weight length relationship (W = 7.17.L-129), relative condition index (Kn = 1.08), and parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation (L-infinity = 35.74 cm, K = 0.26 y(-1)), between the study periods. The population in the 2005-2007 period was mainly constituted by individuals <20 cm in length (90%), probably due to intensive poaching. Only 10% of the population was in the reproductive age (4-5 y; 21 cm), and juveniles were observed (4%). The mean length and proportion of individuals >= 20 cm in length increased in the 2013 samplings (17.8 +/- 3.8 cm and 35%), although observed mean length is shorter than minimum size for fishing and size at first maturity. On the other hand, density decreased in 2013 (0.15 +/- 0.01 ind m(-2)), compared to the 2005-2007 period (0.27 +/- 0.04 ind m(-2)). Interviewees agreed that poaching was the main problem for the fishery, as well as the difficulty for fishers to obtain their own harvesting permits, because they were dependent on the permits holders to operate. Our results corroborated that the growth rate and mortality rate of the 1. fuscus population in its northernmost geographical distribution were similar to those from southern locations. However, the observed values of the density and mean length were well below those previously registered in Bahia de los Angeles or in other localities, and may compromise reproductive success, because low recruitment was observed. Some actions are proposed for the sustainable management of this resource. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable development supports watershed processes and functions. To aid the sustainable development of the western Balkans' transboundary river and lake basins, the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adapted the EPA's Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) following the devasting 2014 floods in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. The IWI evaluates six watershed functions based on a suite of anthropogenic stressors (e.g., impervious surfaces, reservoirs). A key feature of the IWI is its ability to accumulate the impact of upstream activities of any specific location in a river network. A novel feature of the IWI, compared with other watershed assessment tools, is its capacity to provide actionable information at the local scale. IWI scores-ranging from 0 (low integrity) to 1 (high integrity)-calculated for the 1084 catchments of the study area indicated highest integrity in the Alpine geographic region (mean = 0.55, standard deviation (SD) = 0.11) and intermediate to lowest integrity within the Mediterranean (mean = 0.49, SD = 0.12) and Continental (mean = 0.40, SD = 0.10) geographic regions. The IWI results are presented hierarchically for data analysts (stressor, functional component, Index of Catchment Integrity and IWI), ecologists (stream/catchment, watershed, basin), and managers (local, national, international). We provide real-world examples for managers, and suggestions for improving the assessment.

AB  - 1. A multimetric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) based on fish data was developed to assess the ecological status of Iberian streams, in the context of the European Water Framework Directive.
   2. Fish assemblages were determined by electrofishing at 114 sites from 10 basins of the Jucar River Basin District. The sampled streams were typical Mediterranean streams with strong variation in flow, a species-poor and tolerant fish fauna, and low ecological specialization of the fish species. These features make it difficult to employ metrics based on species richness, trophic specialization, and reproductive strategy, which are typical of IBIs and similar indices.
   3. The proposed IBI (IBI-Jucar) is composed of five metrics related to fish health, age-structure, and abundance and richness of native and alien species. IBI-Jucar was validated by demonstrating high correlation with various measures of environmental degradation and with several biotic and habitat indices. It was also highly correlated with the European Fish Index (EFI+), despite different methods used for development and contrasting metrics obtained.
   4. The results underline the complementarity of different biotic indices and show that indices based on fish can be a valuable tool for determining environmental quality, even in species-poor Mediterranean streams. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Dogwhelks Nucella lapillus feed mainly on mussels and barnacles, and may experience periods of starvation. We report effects of nutritional state and prey type on the survival, growth, cadmium (Cd) accumulation, metallothionein (NIT) induction and glycogen stores in N. lapillus exposed to Cd in water. Adult dogwhelks, with similar shell length (30.0 +/-1.5 mm), were either starved or fed to satiation with barnacles Semibalanus balanoides, mussels Mytilus edulis or Cd-dosed M. edulis, and kept in filtered natural seawater ( < 0.01 mug Cd l(-1)) or Cd-contaminated (400 mug Cd l(-1)) seawater for 80 days. Mortality and individual growth rate were determined. Cd, MT and glycogen were measured in different tissues. Prolonged starvation and exposure to Cd significantly reduced the survivorship of N. lapillus, but feeding could help dogwhelks to combat Cd toxicity and minimise mortality. Extended starvation also caused tissue wastage, leading to higher concentrations of Cd and NIT in tissues, whereas fed animals increased in weight and had lower Cd and NIT concentrations because of the tissue dilution effect. Prey type significantly affected growth rate of dogwhelks and indirectly influenced Cd accumulation, NIT induction and glycogen stores. Eating mussels promoted better growth and higher glycogen reserves than eating barnacles. Individual growth rate decreased with increasing Cd accumulation. Cd-exposed survivors grew faster and consumed more than control animals, implying that these survivors may have better fitness and greater tolerance to Cd toxicity. The use of growth, condition index, MT and glycogen as biomarkers of environmental pollution are discussed. These results indicate a need to incorporate biological data including growth (or at least condition index) and prey type into biomonitoring programmes to allow sound interpretation.

AB  - Road dust samples from industrial, urban, and tourist areas of the international tourist city of Guilin, China, were collected to study the concentration, spatial distribution, pollution level, and health risk of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) using an array-based risk assessment model from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The geoaccumulation index (I-geo), ecological risk index, and spatial interpolation were used to investigate the road dust pollution level. The results indicated that apart from Ni and Al, the concentration of all the heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr, Cd, Fe, Mn, and As) were markedly higher than the corresponding background values in the three functional areas. Based on the I-geo, the study area had an uncontaminated to moderate pollution level, and the industrial area was slightly more polluted and posed a greater ecological risk than the urban and tourist areas. Comparatively, Pb, Zn, and Cu exhibited higher pollution levels in the three functional sites. Hotspots of PTEs were more concentrated in urban and industrial areas than in tourist areas. Furthermore, the health risk model revealed significant non-carcinogenic risks to children from As in urban, industrial, and tourist areas as the hazard quotients (1.64, 2.04, and 1.42, respectively) exceeded the threshold standard of 1.00. The carcinogenic risk via ingestion (RIing) illustrated significant risks to children from Cr, As, and Ni because the RIing values were considerably higher than the threshold standard (1.00E-6 to 1.00E-4) in the three functional areas. However, no cancer risk was observed from the dermal and inhalation pathways. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliable drought information is of utmost importance for efficient drought management. This paper presents a fully operational processing chain for mapping drought occurrence, extent and strength based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data at 250 m resolution. Illustrations are provided for the territory of Kenya. The processing chain was developed at BOKU (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria) and employs a modified Whittaker smoother providing consistent (de-noised) NDVI "Monday-images" in near real-time (NRT), with time lags between zero and thirteen weeks. At a regular seven-day updating interval, the algorithm constrains modeled NDVI values based on reasonable temporal NDVI paths derived from corresponding (multi-year) NDVI "climatologies". Contrary to other competing approaches, an uncertainty range is produced for each pixel, time step and time lag. To quantify drought strength, the vegetation condition index (VCI) is calculated at pixel level from the de-noised NDVI data and is spatially aggregated to administrative units. Besides the original weekly temporal resolution, the indicator is also aggregated to one-and three-monthly intervals. During spatial and temporal aggregations, uncertainty information is taken into account to down-weight less reliable observations. Based on the provided VCI, Kenya's National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) has been releasing disaster contingency funds (DCF) to sustain counties in drought conditions since 2014. The paper illustrates the successful application of the drought products within NDMA by providing a retrospective analysis applied to droughts reported by regular food security assessments. We also present comparisons with alternative products of the US Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). We found an overall good agreement (R-2 = 0.89) between the two datasets, but observed some persistent (seasonal and spatial) differences that should be assessed against external reference information.

AB  - Over the past two decades, Diporeia in all of the Laurentian Great Lakes, except Superior, have declined dramatically. These declines have seemingly coincided with expansion of invasive Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis, however the exact mechanisms underlying decreasing Diporeia densities are obscure. We explored the use of RNA:DNA (RID) ratios as a conditional index for Diporeia by experimentally demonstrating that Diporeia RID responds to periods of starvation. Moreover, during 2008-2009 we collected Diporeia from throughout the Great Lakes and Cayuga Lake (New York, USA), and used R/D ratios to index condition of these in situ collected animals. We evaluated spatial and temporal variation of nucleic acid indices using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis with a suite of environmental variables included as potential predictors. Diporeia R/D of in situ collected specimens exhibited pronounced spatial and temporal variation, but multiple CART models described only a small amount of this variation. While we observed some variation in Diporeia R/D among lakes, nucleic acid ratios appeared to respond weakly to Diporeia population characteristics and local environmental conditions. Specifically, CART analyses revealed that Diporeia R/D was particularly low at extreme depths, and interestingly, Diporeia nucleic acids were not strongly associated with the presence of dreissenids. In summary, while a limited amount of variation in Diporeia RID was attributable to environmental conditions, the majority of Diporeia R/D variation was unaccounted for. Hence, the causative factors underlying spatio-temporal variation of Diporeia R/D and the mechanistic reasons for Diporeia declines in the Great Lakes remain largely unknown.

AB  - Single-pass electrofishing was used to define the most efficient sampling distance to assess stream condition using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) methodology in headwater (< 36 km(2) drainage area), warmwater streams in the Eastern Corn Belt Plain ecoregion. Based on wetted widths (1-3.3 m) of sampled reaches, we defined effort based on increased area (range 50-555 m(2)). Sampled area necessary to capture a representative fish assemblage increased until 167-m(2) distance, which is equivalent to a minimum sampling distance of one habitat cycle. No significant difference in metric actual observed value response was found with increasing habitat cycle. Increased effort is required in smaller streams widths (a parts per thousand currency sign1 m) to achieve the recommended sample area. The effect of rare fish on the IBI was tested using a modified Walford method. A significant decrease in IBI score was observed when 10 % of the rare data were removed. The presence of rare fish did not influence individual IBI metrics or scores for either the increased effort or reduced effort calibrations until greater than 3 % of the data was removed for number of species, 15 % removal of data for number of minnow species, and 5 % removal of data for catch per unit effort (CPUE). Increased effort did not affect any metric or IBI score, while reduced effort influenced the number of darter, madtom, and sculpin species and catch per unit effort metric scores but did not affect IBI score.

AB  - Few studies have addressed within-year temporal variation of IBI scores. We compared index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores for two summer sampling events from a large river during 25 annual periods. The results indicated that IBI scores calculated from June samples were not significantly different from July samples. Spatial autocorrelation was present, such that sites that were closer together produced similar IBI scores and could not be considered independent. Temporal autocorrelation was present, but was not strong. Lower quality sites (low IBI score) did not have higher variation than higher quality sites. Our results show that a single sample of fishes by boat electrofisher during the summer in a large river such as the Wabash River can produce a repeatable estimate of IBI score. Thus, repeated or additional sampling within the summer season to improve the quality of the evaluation is not warranted.

AB  - The main objectives of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC of 23 October 2000, establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, is to protect and to prevent all kinds of water from pollution and to achieve by 2015 a good ecological and chemical state of water. One of the tools used to achieve these objectives is monitoring, which should provide consistent and complete information on the state of ecological and chemical status of waters. Control of the dynamics of ecological state changes in aquatic ecosystems is a task of special ecological monitoring, which should be based on principles other than regular monitoring of environmental pollution. The most important component of the monitoring of surface waters is an assessment of their ecological status. For the assessment of ecological status of surface waters various criteria were developed, The main characteristics of the ecological status are usually the indicators of species diversity, reflecting the richness and diversity of water biocenosis. Despite their strength the indicators of biodiversity have some serious drawbacks. It can therefore be assumed that the most adequate criterion that reflects the ecological status of surface water is the material, energetic or kinetic balance of production and destruction of organic matter. At the same time, this balance characterizes the trophic state of water bodies, because the degree of water trophy-is conditioned by the final balance of these processes. The indicators presented by the author can be used for the ecological monitoring, for assessing the trophic level of surface waters and at the same time their state of ecological balance. They also can be applied in solving engineering tasks and in mathematical modelling.

AB  - A benthic index of biotic integrity was developed for use in estuaries of the southeastern USA (Cape Henry, VA; St. Lucie Inlet, FL) using a modification of the method developed by Weisberg et al. (1997. An estuarine benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) for Chesapeake Bay. Estuaries, 20 (1), 149-158). Data from non-degraded stations sampled in 1993 and 1994 were analyzed using classification analysis of species composition to define major habitat types relative to selected physical parameters. Various benthic metrics were then tested on a larger 1994 data set for each major habitat to determine those that discriminated between nondegraded and degraded sites classified on the basis of dissolved oxygen, sediment chemistry, and sediment toxicity results. Scoring criteria for each metric were developed based on the distribution of values at non-degraded sites. Average scores from different combinations of the most sensitive metrics were compared to derive the final index, which integrates the average scores of four metrics (number of taxa, abundance, dominance, and percent sensitive taxa). An independent data set representing sites sampled in 1993 and 1995 was used to validate the index. The final combined index correctly classified 93% of stations province-wide in the developmental data set and 75% of stations in the validation data set. Comparison of the index results with those of individual benthic measures and sediment bioassays from stations sampled in 1993 and 1995 showed that the index detected a higher percentage of samples where bioeffects were expected (based on sediment chemistry) than did any of these other measures individually.

AB  - Since the present quality state of the Wadden Sea is judged more discordantly than that of the North Sea, it is examined whether the Wadden Sea is a separate ecosystem.  The nutrient load into the Wadden Sea and the trend of the load are assessed.  Biological indicators of the ecological state of the Wadden Sea are examined with the result that there are signs of a bad as well as of a good state.  This contradiction is assigned to the fact that quality standards are absent.  Self-protection mechanisms of the Wadden Sea are discussed with respect to their responsibility for the relatively good state.  A qualitative model is proposed to explain the long-term behaviour of the ecosystem.

AB  - Parameters of biological activity (humus and microbial biomass reserves, potential intensity of the CO2 emission, and enzyme activity) have been determined in arable and natural chernozems on the plains of Kabardino-Balkaria as a part of the system for the ecological assessment of the state of the soil cover. Integral parameters of the eco-biological state of studied soils have been calculated on the basis of obtained data, and the level of changes in their total biological activity has been determined. A statistically significant decrease of the values of all the considered biological properties under the impact of tillage has been found. The data of two-way ANOVA suggest a stronger influence of agricultural management in comparison with genetic features of chernozems at the level of subtype. Differential approach is insufficient for evaluating the total level of soil biological activity, because there are many biological properties of soil, and the degrees of their changes in agrogenic soils are different. An integral approach has been used; it integrates the obtained data into a single integral assessment parameter. In arable soils, this integral parameter decreases by 39-46% and makes it possible to assess the degree of disturbance of the ecological functions of soils and their capacity for self-restoration.

AB  - Despite the ecological and economical importance of tropical forests they are currently affected by human activities, mainly through deforestation and selective extraction. With the aim of making an opportune diagnosis of the condition of forests, we developed an ecological index based on qualitative and semi-quantitative data, allowing a quick diagnosis in order to manage and conserve tropical forests. We evaluated 44 plots of tree vegetation, measuring canopy height, number of strata, tree cover, dominant trees, number of tree species, as well as the management of and damage to the forest. The data of each parameter was classified in categories of 3,4 or 5, which were normalized between 0 and 1 for the worst and best characteristics, respectively. For the purpose of analysis, the average, a set of IF-THEN rules, and fuzzy logic were applied and as a result we obtained a model that measures the ecological condition of the tropical forests. The model has the advantages of having an ecological basis, allows data to be gathered quickly and is clear and easy to manage and interpret. When running the model, the value of each intermediate variable is displayed, thus allowing the detection of where necessary action is required to improve the ecological condition of the forest. We expect this index to contribute in evaluating the effectiveness of forest management and possibly offer advice for the short-term management and conservation of the remnants of tropical forests.

AB  - Shellfish aquaculture implies the placement of artificial structures in the coastal environment and the alteration of natural bivalve populations, which calls for the establishment of legislative regulatory frameworks based on an ecosystem approach. One of the challenges for policy makers is the need to monitor the effectiveness of management actions. In this study, a meta-analysis across different bays, covering a large spatial scale in Atlantic Canada, was performed to test the response of two potential indicators of aquaculture intensity: (1) the bivalve growth using both Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) and Scope For Growth (SFG) approaches, and (2) the bivalve condition index (CI = (meat weight/shell weight) x 100). Our underlying premise was that overstocking of bivalves leads to increased competition for food resources, which might ultimately have a significant effect on bivalve growth performance and the Cl. Bivalve growth performance for cohorts of Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea virginica were simulated by combining satellite remote sensing (temperature and chlorophyll) with individual based models using both DEB and SFG approaches. These models were calibrated for each cohort, by adjusting the half-saturation coefficient of the food ingestion function term (X-K), which is a common parameter related to feeding behavior in both approaches. A significant correlation between X-K and lease coverage (lease area/bay area, dimensionless) was found for M. edulis. However, because of unrealistic X-K values in some M. edulis cohorts and the lack of consistent simulations for C. virginica precluded using X-K as a reliable indicator of aquaculture intensity. By contrast, according to the observed results CI emerged as a good indicator of aquaculture intensity for both species. A General Additive Model (GAM) for C. virginica provided a regression that included the initial dry meat weight as a linear term and the lease area as a non-linear term, explaining a total deviance of 59.9% in describing final CI values. The GAM for M. Mulls included only non-linear terms, lease coverage, and lease area, explaining a total deviance of 61.0%. Since the CI theoretically integrates the effects of changing trophic conditions over time, the good relationship between the CI and lease/bay characteristics provides a scientific framework for its use as a reliable ecological indicator of aquaculture intensity. From an applied perspective, this finding is of relevance because the CI is easy to measure and is widely available in government and industry datasets. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heterotrophic bacteria are assumed to play an important role in processing of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Although the algae-derived organic matter is commonly studied, the transformation and processing of DOM by epiphytic bacteria for phytoplankton have rarely been investigated, especially under warming and acidification. In this study, Bacillus pumilus is used to explore the ecologically important marine diatom Skeletonema dohrnii-derived DOM under different conditions (temperature, 27 degrees C and 31 degrees C; pCO(2), 400 and 1,000 ppm), utilizing fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Fluorescence regional integration and the peak selecting method are used to generate B, T, N, A, M, and C peaks in the EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. The main known fluorophores including that protein-like components (peaks B and T), unknown components (peak N), and humic-like component (peaks A, M, and C). Our experimental results showed that under higher temperature and pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) conditions, S. dohrnii-derived DOM fluorescence was dominated by a protein-like signal that slower waning throughout the experiment, becoming an increasingly humic-like substance, implying that processing by the epiphytic bacteria (B. pumilus) produced more complex molecules. In addition, spectroscopic indices (e.g., fluorescence index, biological index, freshness index beta/alpha, and humification index) were changed in varying degrees. This study reveals and confirms the direct participation of heterotrophic bacteria in the transformation and generation of algae-derived DOM in the laboratory, underlining the influence of global warming and ocean acidification on this process.

AB  - Detection and monitoring of seasonal agricultural drought at sub-regional scale is a complex theme due to inefficient spatiotemporal indicators. This study presents a new time-based function of spaceborne soil moisture as an efficient indicator. Bundelkhand of Central India, a frequently agricultural drought affected region, was used as the study area. Rabi agricultural season (October-May) being the dominant agricultural return period, was chosen as the study period. Coarse resolution soil moisture (SMc) obtained from European space agency under climate change initiative program was spatially downscaled (SMd) to meet spatial scale at sub-regional level with overall root-mean-square error under 0.065cm(3)/cm(3). Indirect validation of SMd was done using temporal impact of rainfall/dry spell on SMd and spatiotemporal impact of SMd on vegetation condition. SMd was found to agree with phenomenon as expected in natural processes and hence it was assumed to be validated. The time-based function derived from spatiotemporal SMd (FSMs) was found to be better related with fluctuations in seasonal crop yield (Y-s) at district level as compared to a similar function (FVCIs) derived using vegetation condition index (VCI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. FSMs outperformed FVCIs having better correlation coefficient (R0.8) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) than FVCIs for most of the districts. Unlike FVCIs, it also efficiently detected the lowest and highest Y-s for majority of the districts representing better association with agricultural drought. Subsequently, frequent soil moisture deficit areas were mapped by using FSMs to visualize the spatiotemporal severity of agricultural drought in the region during Rabi season.

AB  - We evaluated the relationship between two environmental features, a morphometric (Naturaly Matrix) and another vegetational (Vegetation Heterogeneity), and the effect on diversity of macrolepidoptera present in three freshwater marshes in the Gran Concepcion (Biobio, Chile), to measure the effects of urbanization on the patterns of diversity in these ecosystems. Analysis determined that the diversity of species present in the wetlands was positively related to the matrix of naturaly, and negatively to vegetation heterogeneity; as a result, significant differences in the diversity of species and their abundance among wetlands, were found. The results of this study indicate that macrolepidoptera could be used as indicators of the effects of urbanization on the functioning of these ecosystems.
   Finally, a method for obtaining the index of Naturaly Matrix, which allows a better representation of the habitat and facilitates morphometric analysis, is postulated.

AB  - Effects of environmental conditions experienced during early life, as indicated by nestling body condition and hatching date, on migratory body condition and fat reserves were studied using data on nestling Blue Tits Parus caeruleus recaptured during their first autumn migration. Body condition index and fat score recorded during the migration were strongly inter-correlated, indicating that much of the variation in body condition index is due to differences in amount of stored Eat. Nestling body condition was found to be a good predictor of amount of subcutaneous fat during migration (four months later) for males, but less so for females. However, the amount of fat during migration was negatively correlated with hatching date and positively correlated with recapture date in females, while male fat reserves were independent of both hatching and recapture dates. These results suggest that differences in body condition established during early life may be maintained over considerable periods of time, and that the time window for selective events leading to positive covariance between nestling body condition and fitness can be much wider than previously appreciated. In particular, through its effects on the amount of migratory fat, nestling condition or some trait closely correlated with it, may affect the young bird's probability of survival during the energetically demanding migration. Based on the findings of this and related studies, we outline some general mechanistic models which may account for the association between early life condition and adult performance.

AB  - Background. In Europe, the western tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris (Heckel, 1837), is the smallest and one of the most expansive species among invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies. The aim of the presently reported study was to investigate reproductive parameters of the tubenose goby population from the Vistula River, as one of the biological traits that might facilitate its successful invasion.
   Materials and methods. Fish were sampled monthly from March through October and the following parameters were determined: sex ratio, gonadosomatic index (GSI), fecundity (absolute, relative, batch), oocyte size distribution, and body condition (Fulton's and Clark's indices).
   Results. GSI varied considerably between sexes and between individual spring months. The increase of GSI and oocyte diameter distributions indicated that spawning of P. semilunaris in the Vistula River lasted from the end of April till July. Multimodal oocytes distribution during reproductive season suggested at least two or three spawning events. The absolute fecundity ranged from 504 to 1250. The mean batch fecundity (+/- standard deviation) was 338.35 +/- 89.22. Both, the absolute and batch fecundity, but not the mean oocyte diameter in the batch, were related to the female standard length. The highest values of Fulton condition index were observed in the reproductive period compared to pre- and post-spawning, while Clark condition index showed a different pattern.
   Conclusion. The western tubenose goby displays reproductive strategy typical for other fish invaders that successfully naturalized in central Europe.

AB  - Drought is one of the most detrimental natural disasters. Studying the changing characteristics of drought is obviously of great importance to achieve the sustainable use of water resources at river basin scales. In this paper, the satellite-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VH) were firstly calculated by using NDVI and brightness of the Global Vegetation Index dataset derived from Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer for China in growing seasons over 1982-2005. Then, the long-term VCI and VH data were employed to study the variation of droughts in the ten basins covering the whole country. The linear trend of each pixel showed that most parts of China were getting wetter in growing seasons, and the drought areas defined by the number of drought pixels have decreased in most basins. The increasing trend of basin averaged values of VCI and VH also indicates the whole country was generally getting wetter. At last, to better understand the two remote sensing drought indices, the response of the growing-season VCI and VH was compared to that of the Palmer Drought Severity Index and 6-month Standard Precipitation Index. Significant spatial variability of the relationship between the VCI, VH, and the station-based meteorological drought indices was shown, and some more closely related areas were found. The study will be useful for water resources management for each basin in the future.

AB  - The analysis of macroinvertebrate communities is essential in aquatic ecology studies. Nonetheless, sample collection, processing and species determination of macroinvertebrates are extremely time-consuming and require huge efforts. Moreover, despite the crucial need for refined sampling protocols, investigations on viable benchmark sampling efforts are still scarce. This study provides a preliminary analysis on the optimisation of the sampling effort required to study macroinvertebrate communities from rice fields. Twenty core sediment samples were collected from a non-vegetated Mediterranean lagoon (rice field) in Valencia (Spain), and their macroinvertebrate community assemblages were obtained. Characterisations of the minimum number of samples needed for both faunistic inventories and environmental quality assessments were carried out using diversity indexes (number of taxa, Shannon, Simpson, and Margalef indexes), ecological indicators (Nutritional Mode Index, IMN) and several species richness estimators (Chao 1, Chao 2, Jacknife 1, Jacknife 2, ACE, ICE, Bootstrap and EstimateS 9.1.0). Our results indicate that in surveys in which the taxa richness of the communities is the objective, 20 samples or even more could be needed. However, when the objective of the study is to assess the environmental quality by means of ecological indexes such as the IMN, three samples could be an acceptable benchmark. Our findings, despite being limited by our experiment conditions, can provide methodological guidelines for ecological assessments in Mediterranean rice fields and shallow non-vegetated lagoons. Further research involving multiple study areas and seasonal patterns will help meliorate the accuracy of this protocol and refine sampling efforts in wetlands.

AB  - Bioassessment is widely used to measure ecological integrity of natural habitats following anthropogenic disturbances and modifications. Traditionally, bioassessment has been based exclusively on species-environment interactions, i.e. niche processes. However, dispersal processes, and in particular mass effect, could mask the influence of niche processes and lead to erroneous conclusions about ecosystem health. To circumvent this problem, we identified 40 diatom species with distributions driven primarily by mass effect and propose an alternative version of the Biological Diatom Index (IBD2007) excluding these species. We tested the environmental responses of both the original IBD (IBD2007) and the modified IBD (IBDmod) with a benthic diatom dataset from France, collected between 2007 and 2013 and including 9487 samples from 3913 spatially distinct localities. Our results indicate a better relationship between the IBDmod scores and environmental conditions, compared to the IBD2007 scores, leading to a more accurate determination of river ecological status, especially in conditions of moderate nutrient enrichment. This study supports the idea that mass effect may result in biased evaluation of water quality. It is advocated that this process is considered in other diatom-based indices, and by extension, in any biotic index.

AB  - A total of 118 benthic diatom taxa were recorded during a survey in 2007 of the Kebir-East wadi, north-eastern Algeria. Fourteen samples were collected at seven sampling stations in winter and summer. The majority of diatom taxa comprised cosmopolitan species widely distributed along the hydrosystem. Canonical correspondence analysis, used to examine spatial patterns of diatom communities in relation to environmental gradients, was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). The first axis accounted for 45% and the second for 22% of the total variance. Seasonal and physicochemical gradients were clearly defined and indicated the water quality. A cluster analysis was then carried out to represent the different groups of the sampled stations sharing the same flora. Agglomerative cluster analysis grouped the sampled sites into seven clusters according to the community data. For clusters gathering more than one single sample, typical diatom taxa were determined with an indicator species analysis. The reliability of the biological diatom index BDI 2007 was tested under our environmental conditions and it was concluded that, considering the very particular geochemical context of this wadi, a specific diatom index should be developed.

AB  - The gametogenic cycle of the Cerastoderma glaucum was analyzed using both qualitative and semi-quantitative methods. The condition index and glycogen concentrations were determined in order to provide information on energy storage. The cockles were collected monthly from a Bayyadha site located 15 km south of Sfax City (Gulf of Gabes) between January 2007 and January 2008. From histological point of view, we applied two approaches: (i) the qualitative method describing the various stages of gamete development for males and females during a cycle of 13 months, and (ii) the semi-quantitative method concerning the estimation of different tissue surfaces. The results showed that there is evidence of three periods of reproduction in this population. A comparison between the surfaces occupied by the three organs showed that the foot and the gonad surfaces are higher than the surface of the adductor muscle. This could suggest that these two organs are more involved in the process of glycogen reserve storage. The results of the glycogen concentrations in the different tissues (gonad, adductor muscle, and "remainders") show that during the second and third periods of reproduction, glycogen was stored in the adductor muscle and in the remainder during sexual rest, and in the gonad during the gametogenesis phases in order to supply the reproductive effort. On the contrary, in the first period of reproduction, the low concentrations of glycogen recorded in the gonad coincided with its high degree of development. This fact could be related to environmental conditions (low temperature and food) recorded during this period.

AB  - 1. Based oil the inclusion of macroalgae in the European Union Water Framework Directive as quality elements for the evaluation of the ecological status of coastal Waters. the suitability of one (Ecological Evaluation Index, EEI) of several previously proposed evaluation methods in the particular ecological conditions of the northern Adriatic Sea was tested.
   2. The EEI was assessed for 10 locations (polluted and putatively pristine) scattered along 60 km of the western Istrian coast. The sampling was performed seasonally at 1 and 3 m depth by destructive (determination of species cover and biomass) and non-destructive (determination of species coverage using digital photography) methods.
   3. When assessed at 1 m depth the spatial scale weighted EEI for the west Istrian coast was 8.1. corresponding to all ecological status class (ESC) value of high. However, data for 3 m depth gave a spatial EEI of 6.72 which corresponds to in ESC value of good. Regressions of the ratio of ecological state group I (ESC I. i.e. thick leathery, calcareous and crustose species) over total algal abundance,with the Pollution gradient (obtained using principal components analysis (PCA) ordination of environmental variables) were significant at 3 m but not lit 1 m depth. This was due to the high abundance of ESG I macroalgae Corallina elongata and Cystoseira compressa at 1 m depth Lit Polluted stations. Similar regressions were obtained using, cover. biomass and coverage.
   4. It IS Concluded that the EEI method may be suitable for the classification of coastal waters in the northern Adriatic only in certain cases. A better assessment of ecological Status using this method would require more realistic estimations based oil the inclusion of data from several sampling depths. As all three abundance measures (cover, biomass, coverage) gave similar results, coverage (using digital photography) is suggested as being a preferred measure owing to the rapidity of sampling at several depths and less time-consuming laboratory Work.

AB  - Phytoplankton and macrophytes are the main primary producers in shallow lakes, and lake eutrophication can induce excessive increases in producer productivity and biomass. To create an ecological index, the equivalent chlorophyll a (EC-a) content of phytoplankton and macrophytes was calculated with an uniformisation model of the phytoplankton chlorophyll a and macrophyte biomass, which is very important to analyse the potential trophic state of the ecosystem in shallow lakes. There was competitive balance between phytoplankton and macrophytes in some shallow lakes of Jiangsu province, China. The EC-a did not significantly correlate with trophic state indicators such as the transparency, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand in the studied lakes. No significant correlation appeared between the EC-a and TSI in the three lake groups investigated. The traditional assessment of the trophic state only utilised the biomass of phytoplankton and excluded the biomass of macrophytes in the water column. Thus, the EC-a index is better suited to characterise the potential trophic state of shallow lakes considering the potential impact of macrophytes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fecundity and sexual structure of weatherfish (Misgurnus fossilis) population, an inperilled and protected freshwater fish with a poorly known life history, was studied in three waterbodies: the River Ner, the Poludniowy canal and the Nowy Row canal (Poland) differing in hydrological character. We compared reproductive traits; i.e. sex ratio, absolute and relative fecundity, oocyte size, gonado-somatic index and body condition. In all study sites, the sex ratio of weatherfish did not differ from parity (1: 1), though in the River Ner, the highest GSI values were recorded for females whilst male GSI did not differ among sites. The absolute (FA = 2860 +/- 2065) and relative fecundity (FR = 120 +/- 55 eggs per g of female body weight) in the River Ner were significantly lower than in the other two sites. In the River Ner the frequency distribution of oocyte diameter, decomposed using the Bhattacharya method, showed two distinct groups in equal numbers. Oocytes that were ready to spawn were larger in the River Ner than in the Poludniowy and Nowy Row canals. Fish in the River Ner were also characterized by the lowest Fulton condition index (mean K = 0.36 +/- 0.1). The trade-off between impaired fecundity and increased egg diameter may result from the different nature of the studied watercourses or levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as steroid compounds.

TI  - An index of biological integrity for northern Mid-Atlantic Slope drainages
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY

KW  - ASSESSING BIOTIC INTEGRITY
KW  - STREAMS
AB  - An index of biological integrity (1131) was developed for streams in the Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna River drainages in the northeastern United States based on fish assemblage data from the Mohawk River drainage of New York. The original IBI, developed for streams in the U.S. Midwest, was modified to reflect the assemblage composition and structure present in Mid-Atlantic Slope drainages. We replaced several of the Midwestern IBI metrics and criteria scores because fishes common to the Midwest are absent from or poorly represented in the Northeast and because stream fish assemblages in the Northeast are less rich than those in the Midwest. For all replacement metrics we followed the ecology-based rationale used in the development of each of the metrics of the Midwestern IBI so that the basic theoretical underpinnings of the IBI remained unchanged. The validity of this modified IBI is demonstrated by examining the quality of streams in the Hudson, Delaware, and lower Susquehanna River basins. The relationships between the IBI and other indicators of environmental quality are examined using data on assemblages of fish and benthic macroinvertebrates and on chemical and physical stream characteristics obtained during 1993-2000 by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment Program in these three river basins. A principal components analysis (PCA) of chemical and physical variables from 27 sites resulted in an environmental quality gradient as the primary PCA axis (eigenvalue, 0.41). Principal components analysis site scores were significantly correlated with such benthic macroinvertebrate metrics as the percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (Spearman R = -0.66, P < 0.001). Index of biological integrity scores for sites in these three river basins were significantly correlated with this environmental quality gradient (Spearman R = -0.78, P = 0.0001). The northern Mid-Atlantic Slope IBI appears to be sensitive to environmental degradation in all three of the river basins addressed in this study. Adjustment of metric scoring criteria may be warranted, depending on composition of fish species in streams in the study area and on the relative effort used in the collection of fish assemblage data.

AB  - The intensification of modern agriculture may impact amphibian populations through habitat loss and the direct and indirect effects of the pesticides upon which it relies. The increased homogeneity of modern agricultural landscapes may be detrimental in times of extreme low and high temperatures associated with climate change, as refuge abundance and habitat connectivity decrease. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of the herbicide glyphosate and subsequent intense drought on the Common Tree Frog, Hypsiboas pulchellus, inhabiting an agricultural landscape. We examined a series of organismic indices (stomach content index, hepatosomatic index, body fat index, gonadosomatic index, condition factor) as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress (hepatic catalase activity and reduced glutathione [GSH] content), exposure to contaminants (hepatic gluthatione-S-transferase activity), and genotoxicity (frequency of micronuclei). No significant differences were observed in the parameters measured when comparing frogs sampled before, 2, and 15 days after glyphosate exposure. However, anurans sampled in the same site two months later, when a drought was at its peak, presented a decrease in stomach content and hepatosomatic index, as well as an increase in hepatic catalase activity, hepatic GSH content and micronuclei frequency in peripheral circulating erythrocytes. Our findings demonstrate that drought is challenging to these anurans in this environment as evidenced by an apparent reduction in food intake and oxidative stress.

AB  - Since the early 1990s a number of projects have developed indexes to measure vulnerability to environmental change. This article investigates the key conceptual and methodological problems associated with such indexes. It examines in detail an index that explicitly addresses environmental change as an issue of vulnerability, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). This examination offers some broader lessons for indicator-based projects, all of which require a simple model of complex and uncertain social-ecological systems, and entail difficult choices about the selection, standardization, weighting, and aggregation of indicators selected to represent important aspects of those systems. We conclude that indexes of vulnerability to environmental change cannot hope to be meaningful when applied to large-scale systems, and so should focus on smaller scales of analysis. We argue that they should not be used as the basis for disbursing funds, comparing countries, or for measuring the performance of countries in environmental management. We also argue that vulnerability is a context-specific rather than a generic condition. Finally, we suggest that because vulnerability is about values at risk, there should be more input from a broader array of people when indexes are being developed and tested.

AB  - This work is the first, the purpose of which was a comprehensive assessment of the ecological state of the lower reaches of the Zarafshan River using bioindication of water quality by diatoms based on species' ecological preferences, pollution indices, statistics, and ecological mapping. A total of 198 species and subspecies of diatoms were first identified from 195 samples collected four times a year at six sites in the lower reaches of the Zarafshan River in 2009-2015. The richest species were Cymbella, Navicula, and Nitzschia. Pleurosira laevis, resistant to salinity, was first found in aquatic habitats in Uzbekistan. Bioindicators of nine environmental variables make up 91% of the list. Distribution analysis of variables, pollution indices (SLA-SladecDek index of saprobity), and toxicity indices (WESI-Water Ecosystem State Index) show increases in salinity, turbidity, and decreases in organic pollution downstream. The source of acidification can be the Navoi region. We found an increase in the ability to self-purify with an increase in species richness and abundance of diatoms in the lower part of Zarafshan. Thus, the ecosystem of the studied part of the river successfully copes with the incoming pollution from the middle part of Zarafshan and demonstrates some stability and successful self-purification with a water quality class of 2-3. The first studied lower reaches of the ecosystem of the Zarafshan River using bioindicators, statistics, and ecological mapping show that the problem of aridization in Central Asia does not necessarily lead to degradation of the river ecosystem and an increase in pollution, but with rational water use can improve water quality and self-purification processes. Hence, diatoms can be good indicators of river water quality in a semi-arid region and reflect the climate and anthropogenic load change. We recommend that attention be paid to nutrient and turbidity management and to expand state monitoring points to the lower part of the river up to the Karakul region.

AB  - High concentrations of heavy metal in farmland threatens food production and human health. Our study assesses soil quality and the distribution of Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb and Ni, to identify possible sources of heavy metals along the banks of the Yangtze River in Huangshi. Heavy metal concentrations of 22 topsoil samples were measured using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry instrument and data was analyzed by multivariate statistic approaches. Heavy metal contamination risk assessment was performed using a combination of the Nemerow multi-factor index method, the Hakanson potential ecological risk index method and the Muller index of geo-accumulation method. These methods determined similar results indicating that cadmium (Cd) poses a health risk to residents at the study site while Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb and Ni do not. The Nemerow multi-factor index method demonstrated that 18 samples were heavily polluted, three moderately polluted and one lightly polluted. The Muller index of geo-accumulation method found ten samples were moderately to strongly polluted by Cd, five were moderately polluted, six were lightly to moderately polluted and one was lightly polluted. The Hakanson potential ecological risk index method proved six samples were strongly polluted, seven were moderately polluted and nine were lightly polluted. Since our sampling sites were all in agricultural lands, we recommend the potential ecological risk index method as the most effective given it not only considers the range of pollutants contributing to soil pollution but factors in heavy metals toxicity. We are apt that the source of the high concentrations of Cd found in topsoil is derived from alluvial sediments upstream of the Yangtze River with a high percentage of residual speciation and a low percentage of exchangeable speciation distribution of Cd. This in turns indicates that a high concentration of Cd in soil had little impact on the natural environment. However, 31.9% of the iron-manganese oxides bound speciation indicating that such levels of Cd in soil would be potentially hazardous to the crops, particularly if exposed to a reductive condition.

AB  - The Agri-environment Footprint Index (AFI) was developed as a generic methodology to assess farm-scale changes in the environmental impacts of agriculture and to assist the assessment of European agri-environment schemes. Using the AFI method, context-specific indicators were developed for relatively extensive dry-stock, and relatively intensive dairy farming in the northwest and south of Ireland, respectively. Both these farming contexts are subject to the same multi-objective Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme. The rationale and detailed structure of four indicators are presented: these relate to: organic nutrient application, organic nutrient storage, the biodiversity value of intensive grass husbandry, and the aesthetic landscape value of grass husbandry practice. Sixteen other indicators are detailed in Supplementary material. The majority of the indicators developed involved risk assessment of farm management practices, as a proxy (surrogate) means to assess environmental state. In this sense, they provide an indirect measure or estimate of likely environmental quality, or relative environmental risk. In many cases, the complexities of environmental concerns required the development of integrative multi-metric indicators with corresponding transformation functions. Wherever possible, these functions were based on known (evidence-based) regional or national impact models. Such models (including quantification of relevant environmental quality levels) were frequently unavailable, in which case a participatory process of stakeholder and expert engagement was essential to fill knowledge gaps. Links between the developed indicators and the European Commission's Common Evaluation and Monitoring Framework (CMEF) that was developed around the same time, are presented. In this sense, the context-specific and policy-relevant indicators (and the method to generate them) provide a useful addition to the CMEF common indicators, especially to reflect the specific objectives of national/regional agri-environmental policies. Despite their customisation to the farming contexts studied, the basic structure and underlying logic of many of the developed indicators may be of much wider use in similar livestock-based agro-ecosystems. A common, geo-referenced spatial framework built on contextual indicators that takes into account climate and farming type, would represent a significant advance in the harmonised development of indicators relevant to analysis of agri-environmental policy.

AB  - Measurements of biomarker responses in fish from contaminated sites could provide valuable data for environmental risk assessment. Biomarkers are sensitive to both environmental pollution and confounding factors that are not related to pollution (e.g., season, nutritional status, and population density). Unfortunately, data about the latter group are scarce. Therefore, juvenile sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus L.) specimens were collected on a monthly basis from the Danube River from September 2002 through August 2003 to determine if seasonal changes exist in condition, hepatosomatic index, and parasitism. Fulton condition factor (FCF range: 0.27-0.79), hepatosomatic index (HSI range: 1.14-6.67) and Skrjabinopsolus semiarmatus parasite prevalence (range: 37.9-85.7%), intensity (range: 1-337 parasites per fish) and the mean intensity (range 9.6-89.2) in sterlet showed significant seasonal variations. This study pointed out that biomarker sampling on different locations has to be performed within the short time frame in order to avoid differences generated by confounding factors. Better understanding of the life cycle of S. semiarmatus and sensitivity of different phases to pollution is needed.

AB  - The lack of biological systems for the assessment of ecological quality specific to mountain ponds prevents the effective management of these natural resources. In this article we develop an index based on macroinvertebrates sensitive to the gradient of nutrient enrichment. With this aim, we sampled 31 ponds along a gradient of trophy and with similar geomorphological characteristics and watershed use in protected areas of the central Apennines. A bioassessment protocol was adopted to collect and process benthic samples and key-associated physical, chemical, and biological variables during the summer growth season of 1998. We collected 61 genera of macroinvertebrates belonging to 31 families. We calculated 31 macroinvertebrate metrics based on selected and total taxa richness, richness of some key groups, abundance, functional groups and tolerance to organic pollution. The gradient of trophy was quantified with summer concentrations of chlorophyll a. We followed a stepwise procedure to evaluate the effectiveness of a given metric for use in the multimetric index. Those were the pollution tolerance metric ASPT, three metrics based on taxonomic richness (the richness of macroinvertebrate genera, the richness of chironomid taxa, and the percentage of total richness composed by Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera), two metrics based on FFG attributes (richness of collector gatherer taxa and richness of scraper taxa) and the habit-based metric richness of burrowers. The 95th percentile of each metric distribution among all ponds was trisected for metric scoring. The final Pond Macroinvertebrate Integrity Index ranged from 7 to 35 and had a good correlation (R(2) = 0.71) with the original gradient of environmental degradation.

AB  - Evaluating landscape ecological sensitivity in estuarine areas is important for providing reference for landscape optimization and ecological conservation, however, the comprehensive characteristics of the landscape ecological sensitivity, including the changes under various disturbances, the spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and the multiple scale effects, have received insufficient attention. A model to evaluate estuarine landscape ecological sensitivity was established based on landscape pattern across temporal and spatial scales. Two new indices, namely, landscape ecological condition index (LECI) and landscape ecological sensitivity index (LESI), were proposed using remote sensing and geographic information system methods. Chongming Island, a typical and important estuarine area in China, was selected as the study area to demonstrate the model. Evaluation factors were integrated following the landscape pattern; different years and periods in the last 30 years were used to reflect the temporal scales; and spatial scales of 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, and 800 m, which refer to the evaluation unit size, were adopted to validate the spatial scale effect and seek the optimal scale to apply the model. Results indicated that the LECI initially slightly decreased and then increased from 1988 to 2017, and the LESI continuously increased along the periods. The two indices exhibited distinct spatiotemporal heterogeneities, which were driven by different development goals and strategies of the island in different periods. Along the scales from 100m to 800 m, the LECI and LESI in the entire study area gradually decreased; they tended to be homogenizing, and the details were lost in the spatial distributions. The 200m scale balanced all the demands of accuracy, spatial heterogeneity, and appropriate data volume, and was the optimal spatial scale to apply the model. The application of the model in Chongming Island verified its effectiveness to represent the comprehensive characteristics of the estuarine landscape ecological sensitivity, and the model can be widely used in different estuarine areas because of its high applicability.

AB  - Studies on sustainable development rely on diverse and seemingly conflicting concepts that yield contrasting results. The root of these conflicting concepts is the lack of agreement on the path toward achieving sustainable development (SD), namely, weak (or economic) versus strong (or ecological) sustainability. This article revisits the Solow-Hartwick model (Solow 1974, 1986; Hartwick 1977, 1978a, 1978b), which suggests that an economy can achieve intergenerational equity by mandating the Hartwick rule of investing the amount of rents from natural capital into renewable capital. It constructs a modified Solow-Hartwick model in which the assumptions of constant population and no technological progress are relaxed and from which it derives a more general form of the Hartwick rule. The modified Solow-Hartwick investment rule presents how weak sustainability can be attained and explains how the residual Hotelling rents (or proceeds from natural resources) could be utilized in order to achieve strong sustainability. In this article, we apply the modified Solow-Hartwick investment rule to a selection of developing and developed Asian economies to assess their sustainability. We then compare our results with two existing measures of sustainability, the genuine savings (GS) model and the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI), both of which frequently present contradicting evaluations on the status of sustainability.

AB  - Nowadays the use of diagnostic tools to assess to condition of high voltage components is steadily increasing. Depending on the diagnostic tool used, the results of the measurements are different diagnostic parameters, e.g. partial discharge (PD) inception voltage, PD magnitudes at different voltages, tangents delta, return voltages, etc. It is also known that aging, degradation, and failure mechanisms are statistical in nature. Moreover, to estimate the time to failure correct statistical interpretations is needed. As a result, due to statistical behavior of these mechanisms diagnostic results need statistical features. As the amount of usable data is increasing with number of measurements conducted, this opens up the opportunity to statistically analyze this data.

KW  - VEGETATION
AB  - Wetland areas are known as 'the kidneys of the Earth' because they provide important functions towards stabilizing the environment, long-term protection of water sources, effectively minimizing sediment loss, purifying surface water from industrial and agricultural pollutants, and enhancing aquifer recharge. The condition of water supply in wetlands directly affects the growth of wetland plants and local biodiversity. Therefore, drought monitoring is vital in wetlands. In this study, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) is used to observe the drought status of the wetland in the cross-border (China and North Korea) Tumen River Basin from 1991 to 2016. For this purpose, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data for six periods were used for the analysis. Soil moisture maps acquired from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System Version 1.0 (CLDAS-V1.0) were then introduced for validating the reliability of the drought monitoring method. The results showed that most areas with a normal moisture level (decreased 25.8%) began experiencing slight drought (increased 29.7%). The coefficient of determination (R-2) between VTCI and soil moisture showed values of 0.69, 0.32, and 0.2 for 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, and 10-20 cm thicknesses, respectively. Although climate change probably contributes to the formation of drought by decreasing precipitation (50 mm decrease in Chinese section) and increasing temperature (0.5 degrees C increase in North Korean section), human activities such as surges in daily water consumption appear as the main threats that leading to droughts in this wetland.

AB  - Agricultural development to meet rapidly growing demands for food and biofuel and the abandonment of traditional land use have had major impacts on biodiversity. Habitat diversity is one of the most important factors influencing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In this study we propose an ecological index of ecosystem or habitat diversity in agricultural landscapes - the Satoyama Index (SI) - that is discernible under appropriate spatial units (e.g., 6 km x 6 km) from 1 km x 1 km gridded land-cover data available from an open-access web site. A high SI value is an indicator of high habitat diversity, which is characteristic of traditional agricultural systems, including Japanese satoyama landscapes, while a low value indicates a monotonic habitat condition typical of extensive monoculture landscapes. The index correlated well with the spatial patterns of occurrence of a bird of prey (Butastur indicus) and species richness of amphibians and damselflies in Japan. The values of the SI also corresponded well to the spatial patterns of typical traditional agricultural landscapes with high conservation value in other countries, for example, the dehesas of the Iberian Peninsula and shade coffee landscapes in Central America. Globally, the pattern of East/South-East Asian paddy belts with their high index values contrasts markedly with the low values of the Eurasian, American. and Australian wheat or corn belts. The SI, which correlates landscapes with biodiversity through potential habitat availability, is highly promising for assessing and monitoring the status of biodiversity irrespective of scale.

AB  - The pejerrey, Odontesthes bonariensis (Valenciennes 1835) (Atheriniformes, Atherinopsidae) is a highly valued food and sport fish both in Argentina and abroad, and has been introduced in numerous natural and manmade environments in this country, Chile, Japan, and Italy. Considering a wide array of environments, where the pejerrey lives and somewhere it does not, we demonstrate its considerable eurytopy and define its range as water traits and chemical composition concern. Moreover, as pejerrey's natural habitat, the pampasic lagunas (lakes of third-order) in temperate Argentina display a wider range of chemistry traits than many other environments throughout the country, we confirm its adaptability, suggested by previous introduction success. Relative influence of total conductivity and particular ions is evaluated, as well as the relationship of water traits with the fish distribution. A water quality index is provided, which allows the determination of the best conditions for pejerrey cultivation in both artificial and natural conditions. The index summarizes many traits of the realized niche of the fish.

By establishing the relationship between a change in the room environment (environmental evaluation index) and the heat capacity consumption of the room (the amount of change of the enthalpy) by the air conditioning, we can calculate the target heat capacity consumption feasible as an environmental target. Relying on an environmental target in calculating the target heat capacity consumption enables setting suitable targets to avert the risk of heat exhaustion or even heatstroke to the residents of the building. In addition, a useful room heat capacity model is suggested that includes a management method using a heat capacity consumption target, with an administration table for evaluating the target.

AB  - With economic development in China, human-induced pressures on aquatic environments have grown and created an urgent need for tools measuring the ecological condition of aquatic systems. However, biological indicators for wadeable streams in China were poorly developed. This study developed and validated a multi-metric index of fish assemblages for wadeable streams of southern China to meet the requirement of the water project which has been carried on in China in recent years. Fifty-seven stream sites were sampled in April-May and November-December 2010 to develop an index of biotic integrity. A set of 45 candidate metrics were evaluated for range, responsiveness and redundancy, resulting in the selection of six metrics for the index: number of native species, number of rheophilic species, proportion of benthic riffle individuals, number of lithophilic species, number of omnivore species, and number of fish per hour sampling. The publicly available census data were used as independent data set to validate our method. Twenty-three sites were assessed as subject to significant (SP) or non-significant pressures (NSP) based on anthropogenic pressure evaluation. Our index performed well in discriminating NSP and SP sites, which suggested that our method could provide an accurate measure for wadeable streams ecosystem condition. We believe this integrated approach would meet the requirements for the water projects of China, and the process of developing the method could be used as reference for managing the subtropical streams in other areas of China or other states.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in mining area soil and its impact on human health have been becoming one of the most important global environmental problems. This study investigated the heavy metals in the soil around the tungsten-molybdenum mining area in southwestern Luoyang, Henan Province, assessed the level of heavy metal pollution in the soil around the tungstenmolybdenum mining area, and quantified the risks of these pollutants to human health. To assess these potential threat levels, The pollution index, potential ecological hazards and health risk assessment methods recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) are applied. The results indicated that the average soil content of the heavy metals Zn, Cr, Cd and As exceeded the soil pollution risk screening value. The Nemerow comprehensive pollution index (PN) was greater than 3, which indicated severe pollution. The potential ecological risk index (RI) of each sampling point was integrated in the order RI #7 > RI #6 > RI #5 > RI #3 > RI #4 > RI #2 > RI #1. Among the heavy metals, Cd posed the greatest ecological threat, accounting for 91.32% of RI. The effect of heavy metals in soil on the single non-carcinogenic health risk index (HQ) and non-carcinogenic total index (HI) through three exposure pathways, oral intake > skin contact > respiratory inhalation, was HQ Zn < HQ Cu < HQ Cd < HQ Pb < HQ Cr< 1. The sum of HI Pb and HI Cr accounted for 92.96 and 92.98% of adults and children, respectively. In addition to the inhalation route CR Cd, CR Cr and CR Cd in the study area were higher than the maximum acceptable human-level recommended by the U. S. EPA -(10-6), and the CR and TCR were higher in children than in adults. Therefore, the heavy metal pollution of soils in the studied tungsten-molybdenum mine area was found to pose a serious threat to the surrounding ecological environment and residents' health.

AB  - A conceptual and analytical framework to assess ecological integrity at a landscape level. A conceptual and methodological approach for the ecological integrity analysis at landscape level is presented. The aim is providing a tool for land planning and nature conservation. With this purpose the meaning of integrity and related concepts are discussed, and a model to evaluate landscape integrity by a comprehensive scheme is proposed. The first index is based in metrics of landscape ecology theory (connectivity, cover of both conservation areas and human managed land, etc.) to evaluate the different ecosystem fragments pattern. The second one, an ecosystemS integrity index, is focused to evaluate remnants with a structure close to maturity and evaluates the mathematical distance to a reference hypothetical composition. Finally, the agricultural area is evaluated by a coherence index, with emphasis in ecological processes but also including the natural structures with conservation functions. These indexes are combined in a model that facilitates the joint consideration of their values and the comparison with theoretical scenarios. The model allows us to develop a concurrent management of relevant variables that usually are associated to different environmental qualities. Because of its characteristics and the intermediate scale of application, the model constitutes an important tool for matching ecosystem integrity and land planning. Both are actions and concept and relevant for nature conservation and landscape management, but in general independently considered.

AB  - Assessment of the water quality of the Arys River basin based on the spatial distribution of richness of phytoperiphyton communities and abiotic variables was given for the first time. Altogether, 82 species were revealed in phytoperiphyton, including Bacillariophyta of 51, Cyanobacteria of 20, Chlorophyta of 7, and Charophyta of 4. Cluster analysis revealed the uniqueness of the composition of periphyton communities related to the abiotic conditions. The environmental preferences of the algae indicated fresh organic pollution in the lower reaches of the Arys River and weak or moderate levels of organic pollution in the rest of the basin. The ecological mapping of chemical data generally confirmed this conclusion. According to the maps, the highest water quality was revealed in the upper stream of the basin. The middle part of the river basin had the lowest water quality in terms of transparency, nitrite-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen. The downstream of the Arys was characterized by a secondary deterioration in water quality according to the Aquatic Ecosystem State Index (WESI) index. We revealed the complicated interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors that caused changes in water quality in the Arys River basin.

KW  - INDICATORS
AB  - Our premise is that measures of ecological indicators and habitat conditions will vary between reference standard sites and reference sites that are impacted, and that these measures can be applied consistently across a regional gradient in the form of a Regional Index of Biological Integrity (RIBI). Six principles are proposed to guide development of any RIBI: 1) biological communities with high integrity are the desired endpoints; 2) indicators can have a biological, physical, or chemical basis; 3) indicators should be tied to specific stressors that can be realistically managed; 4) linkages across geographic scales and ecosystems should be provided; 5) reference standards should be used to define target conditions; and 6) assessment protocols should be efficiently and rapidly applied. To illustrate how a RIBI might be developed, we show how four integrative bioindicators can be combined to develop a RIBI for forest riparian ecosystems in the Mid-Atlantic states: 1) macroinvertebrate communities, 2) amphibian communities, 3) avian communities, and 4) avian productivity, primarily for the Louisiana waterthrush (Seirius motacilla). By providing a reliable expression of environmental stress or change, a RIBI can help managers reach scientifically defensible decisions.

AB  - Eutrophication of estuaries via anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is an issue being addressed extensively on a global scale, however it remains a topic that garners further attention due to its complexity. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a recently proposed eutrophic condition index in five permanently open estuaries, subsequent to flow variations. Further, in order to elucidate their potential role in augmenting eutrophic conditions, the influence of vegetated habitats on associated microalgal communities was investigated. The study took place in the summer of 2014 and 2015. On each sampling occasion, all of the proposed 'state' indicators (nutrients, oxygen and microalgal communities) were assessed and supplemented with a heuristic 'pressure' component (flow conditions). Overall, the proposed index was shown to be sensitive to environmental perturbations providing shifts in classification ratings illustrating the dilution (Swartkops Estuary) or augmenting (Kromme, Gamtoos, and Kariega estuaries) effect of freshwater pulse events. Additionally, the sensitivity of selected epiphyte and microphytobenthos (MPB) parameters to water quality variations was verified, thus supporting their inclusion as indicators in the proposed index. Regarding the role of microhabitats in promoting microalgal growth, it was found that MPB biomass was higher (5-290%) and benthic diatom diversity generally lower (5-50%) in vegetated compared to unvegetated habitats - an important consideration when applying the index. The habitat complexity and stabilisation provided by estuarine macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Zostera capensis) supported notable autotroph colonisation. This highlights their importance in structuring trophic pathways, whilst also potentially providing a corridor for the intensification of eutrophic symptoms in estuaries. Overall, this study provides an important step towards the verification of a proposed assessment methodology which may serve to provide a baseline from which the eutrophic status of estuaries can be monitored - particularly in countries where such assessment frameworks are lacking.

AB  - In a recent work, Ziad (Ziad, A., 1997. A New Necessary Condition for Nash Implementation. To appear in the Journal Of Mathematical Economics) has defined a new condition for the problem of implementation of a social choice correspondence. He has formulated a family of conditions called B-k-monotonicity that are necessary for Nash implementation, where k is a natural number that indexes a particular condition. The B-k-monotonicity is in general a stronger condition than Maskin monotonicity, but is necessary for implementation. In this note we improve the algorithms proposed by Sjostrom (Sjostrom, T., 1991. On the necessary and sufficient conditions for Nash implementation. Soc Choice Welfare 8, 333-340) to determine a condition which is necessary and sufficient for implementation. The main result is that in some non implementability cases we do not have to repeat the operation of Sjostrom algorithms up to their terminations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB  - Epilithic diatom communities offer a holistic and integrated approach for assessing water quality as they remain in one place for a number of months and reflect an ecological memory of water quality over a period of time. The objective of this study is to use diatom assemblages to distinguish between particular land types and associated water quality impacts that are linked to these land-use patterns. Water quality and diatom community data were collected from sites in the Crocodile and Magalies Rivers (Gauteng and North West Province, South Africa) associated with agricultural, urban and natural (reference) adjacent land use respectively. The data collected were subjected to multivariate statistical techniques to analyse spatial and temporal patterns in water quality (principal component analysis) and diatom community structures (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to elucidate hypothesised differences in community structure per land-use type. Five diatom response indices (Generic Diatom Index, Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index, Biological Diatom Index, Eutrophication/Pollution Index and Percentage Pollution Tolerant Valves) incorporated in the OMNIDIA software were implemented to assess the integrity of diatom communities per land-use type. Principle component ordination of water quality describes 56.6% of the variation in data observed, and indicates the separation of reference sites from test sites for low and high flow conditions combined. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the agricultural and urban land-use sites using PCA based on water quality data. One-way ANOSIM showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between reference groups, agricultural groups and urban groups, with no significant differences noted (p > 0.05) between groups made up of sites exhibiting the same land-use patterns. Diatom indices showed that agricultural sites were in a slightly more modified ecological state than urban sites overall. Based on the species similarity (SIMPER analyses), reference sites showed strong associations with Achnanthes minutissima, Gomphonema venusta and Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, whilst urban sites were associated with Diatoma vulgaris, Navicula tripunctata and Amphora pediculus Agriculture could be separated into high- and low-intensity practices based on species composition. Sites where high-intensity agriculture took place were dominated by motile species of the genus Nitzschia, and low-intensity agriculture was indicated by motile species of the genus Navicula. Urban sites contained a combination of species that were tolerant of spikes in water quality.

AB  - The toxic effects of low level metal contamination in sediments are currently poorly understood. We exposed different sized Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, to sediment spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of either zinc, cadmium or a zinc-cadmium mixture for one week. This freshwater bivalve is well suited for sediment toxicity tests as it lives partly buried in the sediment and utilises sediment particles as a food resource. After one week, the whole tissue composition of low molecular weight metabolites was analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The condition index (ratio of tissue dry weight to volume inside the shell valves) was also measured. Small and large clams were clearly differentiated by their metabolic composition and the two size classes showed opposite responses to the mixture spiked sediment. No effects of zinc alone on the metabolome were found and cadmium only influenced the smaller size class. The main perturbations were seen in amino acid and energy metabolism, with small clams using amino acids as an energy resource and larger clams primarily drawing on their larger storage reserves of carbohydrates. Our study demonstrates that metabolomics is a useful technique to test for low level toxicity which does not manifest in mortality or condition index changes. The differing effects between the two size classes stress that it is important to consider age/size when conducting metabolomic and ecotoxicology assessments, since testing for the effects on only one size class makes it more difficult to extrapolate laboratory results to the natural environment.

AB  - The Macroinvertebrate Biotic Integrity Index (MBII) was developed from data collected at 574 wadeable stream reaches in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region (MAHR) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). Over 100 candidate metrics were evaluated for range, precision, responsiveness to various disturbances, relationship to catchment area, and redundancy. Seven metrics were selected, representing taxa richness (Ephemeroptera richness, Plecoptera richness, Trichoptera richness), assemblage composition (percent non-insect individuals, percent 5 dominant taxa), pollution tolerance [Macroinvertebrate Tolerance Index (MTI)], and one functional feeding group (collector-filterer richness). We scored metrics and summed them, then ranked the resulting index through use of independently evaluated reference stream reaches. Although sites were classified into lowland and upland ecoregional groups, we did not need to develop separate scoring criteria for each ecoregional group. We were able to use the same metrics for pool and riffle composite samples, but we had to score them differently. Using the EMAP probability design, we inferred the results, with known confidence bounds, to the 167,797 kilometers of wadeable streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands. We classified 17% of the target stream length in the MAHR as good, 57% as fair, and 26% as poor. Pool-dominated reaches were relatively rare in the MAHR, and the usefulness of the MBII was more difficult to assess in these reaches. The process used for developing the MBII is widely applicable and resulted in an index effective in evaluating region-wide conditions and distinguishing good and impaired reaches among both upland and lowland streams dominated by riffle habitat.

AB  - A measure of stream quality, the index of biotic integrity (IBI), was adapted to great rivers (>3226 km(2)) and calibrated using a variety of spatial scales. Fish fauna was sampled at 60 localities within 15 impoundments of the Ohio River drainage, eastern Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, with boat electroshocker methods during the summers and autumns of 1990-1993 to provide biological information for the IBI. Significant correlation was not found between ecoregion or differing reservoirs; however, the IBI was sensitive to differences in land use and variable industrial and municipal loadings. Species richness, the percentage large river faunal group, the proportion of round-bodied sucker species, the number of centrarchid species, the number of sensitive taxa and the proportion of simple lithophilous spawning species showed the greatest change between riverine and lacustrine habitats within an impoundment. The percentage large river faunal group metric was not significantly different between riverine, transitional and lacustrine habitats; however, the metric reflected significant differences when evaluated with habitat information. The number of centrarchid species was higher in lacustrine habitats, whereas round-bodied sucker species were highest in transitional habitats. The inherent variation of proportional metrics was significantly reduced with the removal of gizzard shad. This modification of the IBI will enhance assessment sensitivity over the original approach designed for wadable streams and rivers.

AB  - The physiological condition of animals connects resources in the environment to demographic responses through reproduction, survival and abundance, and it provides critical information for conservation and management of wildlife populations. We used archived data (early-wet season 1987, late-wet and early-dry season 1988) from culls of impala (Aepyceros melampus) to compare how the kidney fat index (KFI, short-term index of body condition) and carcass mass (long-term index) varied seasonally. For females, KFI increased across seasons, a pattern similar for all age classes. For males, KFI was low and relatively invariable for juveniles and yearlings. For adults, KFI varied with reproductive cycle; highest KFI occurred early in the rut for males and around the second trimester for females. Carcass mass increased over time for growing juveniles and yearlings. For adults, female carcass mass varied according to reproductive cycle and was highest when KFI was highest. Male carcass mass was highest toward the end of the rut when KFI was relatively low. Although changes in body condition can be associated with seasonal changes in forage and activity, KFI and carcass mass are most useful when comparing across years with varying conditions, but within age, sex, and season.

AB  - Employment in the informal sector of the economy has become a refuge that allows the subsistence of people who are unemployed. In Ecuador it is estimated that currently 46.7% of the Economically Active Population (EAP) works within the informal economy and in the city of Ambato this phenomenon has increased relatively in the absence of opportunities in the labor market. The literature deals with the informal economy from the economic aspect, neglecting the social aspect, therefore, this research aims to determine the living conditions from socioeconomic, physical, psychological and environmental aspects. The results obtained enabled the evaluation of the living conditions, for which a survey based on the questions of the Living Conditions questionnaire of the Ecuadorian Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) was used as an instrument, for the construction of the Living Conditions Index (LCI) proposed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). A total of 383 informal entrepreneurs from the city of Ambato participated in the collection of the information. The main results showed an index of living conditions of 0.34 on a scale where an index close to 0 indicates better conditions while 1 reflects unfavorable conditions.

AB  - Relationships between site index, environmental variables, and understorey vegetation were examined for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in the eastern part of France. The study area concerns all the native range of Norway spruce in France and the northeastern plains. The analysis is based on 2087 plots from the French National Forest Inventory database. The data measured on each plot cover topography, soil, geology, and vegetation. Additional environmental variables were estimated using two methods: climatic data estimated from a climatic model developed by Meteo-France (AURELHY), and nutritional variables predicted from vegetation data and species indicator values. General linear model regression was used to predict site index as a function of environmental variables. The best model explains 64% of the site index variance and involves eight variables (elevation, mountain zone, topographic concavity, proportion of plot area occupied by rock outcrop, rock type, soil depth, pH, and C/N ratio). The two main results of this study are (i) the combination of large databases allowed the study of soil-site relationships and construction of a pertinent model, which covers a wide range of ecological conditions, and (ii) vegetation was found to be relevant to separate the effect of acidity from those of nitrogen nutrition on Norway spruce productivity.

AB  - An increasing amount of evidence indicates that different forms of environmental stress influence the expression of genetic variance in quantitative traits and, consequently, their evolvability. We investigated the causal components of phenotypic variance and natural selection on the body condition index (a trait often related to fitness in wild bird populations) of blue tit (Parus caeruleus) nestlings under contrasting environmental conditions. In three different study years, nestlings grown under a poor feeding regime attained lower body condition than their full-sibs grown under a good feeding regime. Genetic influences on condition were large and significant in both feeding regimes, and in all three study years. However, although estimates of additive genetic variance were consistently higher in the poor than in the good environment, heritability estimates for body condition index were very similar in both environments due to higher levels of environmental variance in the poor environment. Evidence for weak genotype x environment interactions was obtained, but these contributed little to variance in nestling condition. Directional natural selection on fledging condition of nestlings was detected, and there were no indications of year or environmental effects on the form and intensity of selection observed, in a sample of 3659 nestlings over four years. However, selection on hedging condition was very weak (standardized selection gradient, beta = 0.027 +/- 0.016 SE), suggesting that, in the current population, the large additive genetic component to fledging condition is not particularly surprising. The results of these analyses are contrasted with those obtained for other populations and species with similar life-histories.

AB  - A large amount of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid (FFBF) from the process of shale gas exploitation causes obvious ecological harm to health of soil and water. However, biological hazard of soil microbial populations by fracturing flowback fluid remains rarely reported. In this study, the microbiological compositions were assessed via analyzing diversity of microbial populations. The results showed significant differences between polluted soil by fracturing flowback fluid and unpolluted soil in different pH and temperature conditions. And then, the microbe-index of biological integrity (M-IBI) was used to evaluate the toxicity of the fracturing flowback fluid based on analysis of microbial integrity. The results showed that polluted soil lacks key microbial species known to be beneficial to soil health, including denitrifying bacteria and cellulose-decomposing bacteria, and 35 degrees C is a critical value for estimating poor and sub-healthy level of damage to microbial integrity by fracturing flowback fluid. Our results provide a valuable reference for the evaluation of soil damage by fracturing flowback fluid.

AB  - Multimetric indices, such as the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI), are increasingly used by management agencies to determine whether Surface water quality is impaired. However, important questions about the variability of these indices have not been thoroughly addressed in the scientific literature. In this study, we used a bootstrap approach to quantify variability associated with fish IBIs developed for streams in two Minnesota river basins. We further placed this variability into a management context by comparing it to impairment thresholds currently used in water quality determinations for Minnesota streams. We found that 95% confidence intervals ranged as high as 40 points for IBIs scored on a 0-100 point scale. However, on average, 90% of IBI scores calculated from bootstrap replicate samples for a given stream site yielded the same impairment status as the original IBI score. We suggest that sampling variability in IBI scores is related to both the number of fish and the number of rare taxa in a held collection. A comparison of the effects of different scoring methods on IBI variability indicates that a continuous scoring method may reduce the amount of bias in IBI scores. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban Surface Ecological Status (USES) reflects the structure and function of an urban ecosystem. USES is influenced by the surface biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties. The assessment and modeling of USES is crucial for sustainability assessment in support of achieving sustainable development goals such as sustainable cities and communities. The objective of this study is to present a new analytical framework for assessing the USES. This analytical framework is centered on a new index, Remotely Sensed Urban Surface Ecological index (RSUSEI). In this study, RSUSEI is used to assess the USES of six selected cities in the U.S.A. To this end, Landsat 8 images, water vapor products, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover and imperviousness datasets are downloaded for use. Firstly, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Wetness, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) are derived by remote sensing methods. Then, RSUSEI is developed by the combination of NDVI, NDSI, Wetness, LST, and Impervious Surface Cover (ISC) with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Next, the spatial variations of USES across the cities are evaluated and compared. Finally, the association degree of each parameter in the USES modeling is investigated. Results show that the spatial variability of LST, ISC, NDVI, NDSI, and Wetness is heterogeneous within and between cities. The mean (standard deviation) value of RSUSEI for Minneapolis, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle yielded 0.58 (0.16), 0.54 (0.17), 0.47 (0.19), 0.63 (0.21), 0.50 (0.17), and 0.44 (0.19), respectively. For all the cities, PC1 included more than 93% of the surface information, which is contributed by greenness, moisture, dryness, heat, and imperviousness. The highest and lowest mean values of RSUSEI are found in "Developed, High intensity" (0.76) and "Developed, Open Space" (0.35) lands, respectively. The mean correlation coefficient between RSUSEI and LST, ISC, NDVI, NDSI, and Wetness, is 0.47, 0.97, -0.31, 0.17, and -0.27, respectively. The statistical significance of these correlations is confirmed at 95% confidence level. These results suggest that the association degree of ISC in USES modeling is the highest, despite the differences in land cover and biophysical characteristics in the cities. RSUSEI could be very useful in modeling and comparing USES across cities with different geographical, climatic, environmental, and biophysical conditions and can also be used for assessing urban sustainability over space and time.

AB  - Long-term and high-resolution environmental proxy data are crucial to contextualize current climate change. The extremely long-lived bivalve, Arctica islandica, is one of the most widely used paleoclimate archives of the northern Atlantic because of its fine temporal resolution. However, the interpretation of environmental histories from microstructures and elemental impurities of A. islandica shells is still a challenge. Vital effects (metabolic rate, ontogenetic age, and growth rate) can modify the way inwhich physiochemical changes of the ambient environment are recorded by the shells. To quantify the degree to which microstructural properties and element incorporation into A. islandica shells is vitally or/and environmentally affected, A. islandica specimens were reared for three months under differentwater temperatures (3, 8 and 13 degrees C) and food concentrations (low, mediumand high). Concentrations of Mg, Sr, Na, and Ba were measured in the newly formed shell portions by laser ablationinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The microstructures of the shellswere analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Shell growth and condition index of each specimen were calculated at the end of the experimental period.
   Findings indicate that no significant variation in the morphometric characteristics of the microstructures were formed at different water temperatures or different food concentrations. Shell carbonate that formed at lowest food concentration usually incorporated the highest amounts of Mg, Sr and Ba relative to Ca+2 (except for Na) and was consistent with the slowest shell growth and lowest condition index at the end of the experiment. These results seem to indicate that, under food limitation, the ability of A. islandica to discriminate element impurities during shell formation decreases. Moreover, all trace element-to calcium ratios were significantly affected by shell growth rate. Therefore, physiological processes seem to dominate the control on element incorporation into A. islandica shells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Donax trunculus is a much-appreciated commercial clam whose natural populations have been overexploited in southern-western Spain during the last decades. In order to control the decrease of natural beds, local governments establish annual closed seasons based on socioeconomic reasons, such as economic necessity or tourism interest. The objective of this study was to develop an efficient tool for predicting gonadal stages based on environmental condition data. This tool will allow for an improvement in fishery management since in this manner the closed season can be based on the reproductive cycle. The natural population's reproductive cycle was studied for more than 2 years. The obtained gonadal and condition indexes (GI and CI) values were statistically related to environmental conditions, specifically surface seawater temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chlo-a) levels with these data being provided from satellite remote sensing observations (SRS). The best statistical relationship was obtained between GI and the SST registered 60 days before bivalve sampling (SST-60). The regression equation allows for an estimate of GI value based on the SST-60 and, as each value is related with one gonadal stage (resting, maturation, ripe), for prediction of the reproductive cycle. Therefore, the closed season can be established when most of the population is in the ripe stage and can be adjusted taking into account the possible temperature variations across the years. For ease of use, GI values estimated with this tool have also been converted using different colours onto a map of wedge clam reproductive stages in its natural beds.

AB  - Human activities have long been altering the natural conditions of streams, including the quality of their water, throughout most of Brazil. This problem is even worse in regions with low rainfall levels, such as the Brazilian Northeast, where water quality needs to be monitored more carefully. In this context, the present study investigated the effects of environmental integrity on the physicochemical characteristics of the streams of the basin of the Itapecuru River in northeastern Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that streams with lower habitat integrity would have higher conductivity, pH, and temperature, due to the reduced input of allochthonous organic matter and the greater washout of sediments to the stream bed. A total of 15 streams, of a sedimentary basin, were evaluated in the municipality of Caxias, in the Brazilian state of Maranhao, between June 2015, and July 2016; each stream was sampled once a month during the drought period in the region, where physicochemical measurements were taken to determine the environmental integrity of the stream through the application of a habitat integrity index. Streams with greater habitat integrity had lower conductivity, pH, and temperature and had higher discharge rates. The index proved to be not an effective tool for the evaluation of water quality, but was found to be important for the management of hydrographic basins by indicating important changes in environmental variables. In this case, the index can be used primarily for the management of hydrographic basins, given that it can be applied straightforwardly, it can be interpreted easily by decision-makers, and it can quantify alterations to the structure of the system with precision.

AB  - Background: Condition-dependence is a ubiquitous feature of animal life histories and has important implications for both natural and sexual selection. Mate choice, for instance, is typically based on condition-dependent signals. Theory predicts that one reason why condition-dependent signals may be special is that they allow females to scan for genes that confer high parasite resistance. Such explanations require a genetic link between immunocompetence and body condition, but existing evidence is limited to phenotypic associations. It remains unknown, therefore, whether females selecting males with good body condition simply obtain a healthy mate, or if they acquire genes for their offspring that confer high immunocompetence.
   Results: Here we use a cross-foster experimental design to partition the phenotypic covariance in indices of body condition and immunocompetence into genetic, maternal and environmental effects in a passerine bird, the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. We show that there is significant positive additive genetic covariance between an index of body condition and an index of cell-mediated immune response. In this case, genetic variance in the index of immune response explained 56% of the additive genetic variance in the index of body condition.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that, in the context of sexual selection, females that assess males on the basis of condition-dependent signals may gain genes that confer high immunocompetence for their offspring. More generally, a genetic correlation between indices of body condition and imuunocompetence supports the hypothesis that parasite resistance may be an important target of natural selection. Additional work is now required to test whether genetic covariance exists among other aspects of both condition and immunocompetence.

AB  - Simple, yet reliable models are needed to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) changes for the wide diversity of agricultural management conditions in the United States. We compared the outputs of two relatively simple models currently available for farmers and government-financed farm support agencies: the Carbon (C) Management Evaluation Tool for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (COMET-VR) and the Soil Conditioning Index (SCI). Simulations were conducted for 18 locations throughout the United States for five soil textural regimes (loamy sand, sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam), three tillage management systems (conventional tillage [CT], minimum tillage [MT], and no tillage [NT]), and two crop rotations (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.]-potato [Solanum tuberosum L.] and wheat-four-year alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.] in western states and corn [Zea mays L.]-soybean [Glycine max L.] and corn-soybean-wheat in eastern states). Both models ranked SOC change as NT > MT > CT, whereby SOC change decreased with increasing soil disturbance with tillage However, models were divergent with regards to soil texture; SOC change was greater in coarse-textured than in fine-textured soils with COMET-VR, but SOC change was lower in coarse-textured than in fine-textured soils with SCI. For crop rotations, SOC change was greater or equal in simpler than in more complex rotation with COMET-VR, but smaller in simpler than in more complex rotations with SCI. Overall, SOC sequestration predicted by COMET-VR was positively related to SCI score, especially when accounting for differences in environmental conditions of a location. Our results suggest that both Models have value and limitations and that measures of SOC sequestration are predictable with these tools under a diversity of typical management conditions in the United States.

AB  - C. rhizophorae and C. brasiliana occur respectivelly in the intertidal and infralitoral region of Parana State. Species of this genus are considered eurihaline and eurithermic, adapted to estuarine environments (QUAYLE, 1988). Due to their value for nutritonal human consumption they are an important commercial resource (WAKAMATSU, 1973; ABSHER et al., 1987). The development of oyster culture in Guaratuba Bay, Parana has been increasing both among fisherman and local authoties even as an alternative to fishing in the closed season. Condition index (IC) was used as a method to estimate the reproductive period of these species in order to furnish data for the best period for harvesting (ABSHER & CHRISTO, 1993). Meat yield (R) as meat percentage in relation to total weight was calculated. Temperature, salinity, water transparency and tidal level were also measured. Bimonthly samples were collected from March/2002 to March/2003 in 2 fixed stations in Guaratuba Bay. Station I was located in a natural intertidal bank of C. rhizophorae and Station II in C. brasiliana artificial cultivation Thirty individuals of each local were collected and brought to the laboratory where they were measured, had their reproductive stages evaluated and sexes identified. The results indicated the highest values of IC (2,30%) and R (18,44%) in January/2003 for C. rhizophorae and 2,41% and 14,57% in May for C. brasiliana. In the same period the highest values for shell hight of C. brasiliana (83,89 mm), shell length (62,36 mm) and weight (99,78 g).were observed. As for gonadal replenishment both species showed the highest percentuals in January/2003, occurring at the same time as highest IC and R for C. rhizophorae. These results are of great interest for shellfisheries and oyster culture in the region.

AB  - The performance of juvenile Argyrosomus regius released off the coast of Mallorca Island (Balearic Islands, Spain) was assessed by comparing the body condition, stable isotope signature and stomach contents of aquaculture-produced A. regius that had been released, fished and returned by fishermen after spending from a few days to >1 year at liberty with A. regius reared under controlled conditions on two contrasting diets (well-fed and unfed). During the first 40 days of the experiment, the condition index (K-R) of the returned A. regius and the unfed A. regius followed the same decreasing trend. Thereafter, the K-R values of the returned A. regius were significantly higher than those of the unfed A. regius but never reached the values of well-fed A. regius. The C-13 signal of the returned A. regius clearly increased (in comparison with the well-fed A. regius) after they had spent a few months at liberty. The temporal pattern depicted by the stable isotopes and the most likely prey composition inferred from this pattern strongly suggest a shift in diet. The stomach contents of the returned A. regius that had spent <100 days at liberty consisted almost exclusively of decapods. The diet of the few returned A. regius that had spent >100 days at liberty consisted entirely of fishes. Wild A. regius from the remaining fishery on the Spanish coast exhibited the same ontogenetic diet shift from invertebrates to fishes, but at a smaller size threshold. Overall, the results demonstrated that culture-reared A. regius experience adverse conditions during the first days after release into the wild but that at least some A. regius are able to adapt to the natural environment after a few months at liberty.

AB  - A Planktonic Integrity Index (PII) for the China's largest alpine barrier lake (Jingpo Lake) was developed to assess the water quality of Jingpo Lake by using phytoplankton and zooplankton metrics. Phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages were sampled at 26 sites in Jingpo Lake. A total of 140 species of phytoplankton and 92 species of zooplankton were obtained in the investigations. We used a stepwise process to evaluate properties of candidate metrics and selected five for the PII: Algal cell abundance, Species richness of algae, Trophic diatom index, Zooplankton Shannon index, and Zooplankton Margalef index. Evaluation of the PII showed that it discriminated well between reference and impaired sites and the discriminatory biocriteria of the PII were suitable for the assessment of the water quality of Jingpo Lake. The further scoring results from the 26 sites showed that the water quality of Jingpo Lake was fair to good. The results of analyses between PII and major environmental factors indicated that water temperature (WT), transparency (SD), dissolved oxygen (DO), potassium permanganate (CODMn) and total nitrogen (TN) were the main factors influencing on the composition and distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Additionally, more metrics belonging to habitat, hydrology, physics and chemistry should be considered for the PH, so as to establish comprehensive assessment system which can reflect the community structure of aquatic organisms, physical and chemical characteristics of water environment, human activities, etc.

AB  - In population studies, individual physiological metrics can reveal important aspects of ecology and act as indicators of overall population health. Body condition is frequently used as a metric of physiological status and commonly quantified as some function of mass relative to structural size. In this study, we examined the natural variation in body condition of two central Texas spelerpines (Eurycea sosorum and E. tonkawae: Plethodontidae) to understand their nutritional status as a function of environmental variability and reproductive condition. Rather than using a mass-based metric to generate a body condition index (BCI), we used residuals from a linear regression of tail width vs. body length measured from subject photographs taken from the dorsal perspective. Overall, mean BCI for both species was lowest in the winter and generally higher in spring and summer. Streamflow had a small positive effect on E. tonkawae BCI and a negative effect on E. sosorum. BCI. Gravid individuals for both species had lower BCI during autumn and winter (when the proportion of gravid individuals was the greatest) than nongravid individuals. By contrast, the few gravid E. sosorum we observed in summer had higher BCI than nongravid individuals. Our results provide important baseline information on the ecology of these federally protected salamanders and demonstrate the utility of a BCI based on width instead of mass.

AB  - Drought is one of the most damaging environmental hazards and a naturally occurring phenomenon in Central Asia that is accompanied by crucial consequences for the agriculture sector. This research aimed at understanding the nature and extent of drought over the cropland regions of Central Asia with the help of spatiotemporal information from the region. We assessed drought occurrence using the vegetation health index (VHI). An algorithm was developed to reduce the noise of heterogeneous land surfaces by adjusting the vegetation index and brightness temperature. The vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) were calculated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products for the growing season (April-September) from 2000 to 2015. The intense drought years were identified and a drought map (drought probability occurrence) was generated. The findings of this research indicated regional heterogeneity in the cropland areas having experienced droughts, observed through spatiotemporal variations. Some of the rain-fed and irrigated croplands of Kazakhstan demonstrated a higher vulnerability to annual drought occurrences and climate change impacts, while other cropland regions were found to be more resistant to such changes. The development of policy tools is required to support informed decision-making and planning processes to adapt to the occurrence of droughts. This could be achieved by the timely assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of the spatiotemporal distribution trends and variabilities of drought occurrences in this region. The results from this study focus on the spatiotemporal variations in drought to reveal the bigger picture in order to better understand the regional capacity for sustainable land management and agricultural activities within a changing environment.

AB  - Contamination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as DDT and its metabolites (Sigma DDs), gamma-HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane), HCB (hexachlorobenzene), aldrin, endrin, isodrin and trans-nonachlor were investigated in wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected from Galician Rias (Rias of Ferrol, A Coruna, Muros, Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo) during the period 1998-2012. Biological parameters, lipid content, shell length and condition index, were also studied. The OCPs levels in the wild mussel were in the order EDDs > gamma-HCH > HCB. The other pesticides, aldrin, endrin, isodrin and trans-nonachlor, were not detected or were below the analytical detection limit. All concentrations found in these samples were below the allowable limits for human consumption (Regulation (EC) no. 396/2005). Univariate analysis confirmed that levels of some compounds presented significant relation with biological parameters. Multivariate analysis of the OCPs levels revealed significantly differences between studied Was, samples from Ria of Ferrol had the highest levels of these compounds (values of Sigma DDs ranged from 3.9 to 4.2 ng g(-1) ww) and samples from Ria of Arousa, the lowest levels (values of Sigma DDs from 1.3 to 2.4 ng g(-1) ww). Temporal trends showed a decrease of OCPs levels along the studied period 1998-2012 in the Galician Rias. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to design a method able to forecast gonadal stages in Chamelea gallina based on the influence of environmental conditions. This tool could be used to improve its fishery management since natural beds have been extremely overexploited during the last few decades on the European coasts and populations have severely decreased. The natural population's reproductive cycle was studied from November 2013 to June 2016 (32 months). Gonadal and condition indexes (GI and CI) values were statistically related to environmental conditions: surface seawater temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chlo-a). Among all the correlations made, the highest R2 value (p < 0.001) was found between GI and the SST registered 60 days before bivalve sampling (SST-60). The regression equation derived from this correlation allows estimate the GI value if the SST-60 values are available. Each GI value is related with one gonadal stage (resting, maturation, ripe) and this allows for forecasting of the reproductive cycle. Therefore, the closed season can be established when most of the population is in the ripe stage and can be adjusted taking into account the possible temperature variations across the years. For ease of use, GI values estimated with this tool have also been converted using different colors onto a map of striped venus acute accent reproductive stages in its natural beds.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the ecological status of soils in the zone of influence of oil and gas industry enterprises by the complex of microbiological and biochemical parameters. Soil samples selected in the territory of LUKOIL-NVNP oil depot No. 5 located within the city of Astrakhan were chosen as the object of research. Soil samples were taken near the source of pollution, 20 and 100 m from the source of pollution, as well as outside the pollution zone. As a result, biological and enzymatic activity of the studied soil samples was studied. Using the most informative indicators, we calculated the integral indicator of the biological state of the studied soils. At the same time, it is established that microbiological indicators are most applicable in comparison with biochemical ones to determine ecological and biological state of soils in the conditions of chemical pollution by oil products. The obtained results show that the ecological status of soils in tank farm No. 5, OOO "LUKOIL-NWNP" Astrakhan by the values of integral indicators, can be characterized as high-threat.

AB  - Rivers are extensively regulated by damming, yet the effects of such interruption on bacterial communities have not been assessed quantitatively. To fill this gap, we proposed a bacteria-based index of biotic integrity (Ba-IBI) by using bacterial community dataset collected from the Three Gorges Reservoir and its upper reaches. Stability analysis based on bacterial resistance (RS) and resilience (RL) to external disturbance was conducted to improve the performance of the index. Four core metrics, i.e. the ratio of Bacilli, Bacteroidetes and Clostridia to Alphaproteobacteria (BBC/A), Oxalobacteraceae, Methanotrophs and Thermophiles were selected after range, responsive and redundancy tests. The improved Ba-IBI, ranging from 1.04 to 4.10, was better at distinguishing sites with or without direct dam effects compared with the unimproved one. The index values maintained high in the riverine sites while reducing in the reservoir, demonstrating the negative influence of dam construction on bacterial integrity. Based on the assessment results, 23.1%, 46.2% and 30.8% sampling sites were large, moderately and little affected by damming, respectively. A Random Forest (RF) regression model was trained and tested, offering a valid prediction of the input Ba-IBI and environmental parameters. Sensitivity analysis revealed the significant contributions of flow velocity towards the predicting process performance, indicating the importance of hydrodynamic conditions on determining the spatial variability of bacterial communities. This study provides not only a first quantitative insight for assessing bacterial response to damming, but also a guideline for applying the improved index in the dam regulation and ecological protection.

AB  - When male birds defend all-purpose breeding territories, females may select mates based on indicators of male or territory quality, or both. However, in non-experimental studies. it can be difficult to determine which traits females prefer because measures of male and territory quality frequently covary. We conducted a series of studies to investigate the traits female house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) use to select a social mate when each male is provided with nest sites of equal quality (i.e., nestboxes). We first compared the phenotypic and territory vegetation traits of males with the time it took them to secure a social mate after returning from the wintering grounds. Male arrival and pairing date were positively correlated and early-arriving males were in better condition and occupied territories in more preferred vegetation than late-arriving males. To test the hypothesis that early-arriving males possessed phenotypic or territory traits that led to their pairing more quickly than late-arriving males, we removed all females after pairs had been established and determined male success in attracting new mates. Male settlement and pairing date with replacement females were not correlated as had been male settlement and pairing date with original females, and male time-to-pairing was not correlated with male song rate, condition index, or territory vegetation. When we manipulated the abundance of nest sites on territories, after males settled but before females arrived, male time-to-pairing, independent of male condition index or territory vegetation, was negatively related to the number of nest sites on a male's territory. These results suggest that under natural conditions females rely on nest-site quantity and, likely, quality when selecting a social mate.

AB  - Spinefoot rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus, is an economically important species of herbivorous fish that is relatively easy to rear and thus considered to be suitable for aquaculture. Juveniles are generally reared in nursery systems before being stocked into growout cages or ponds. We report here our evaluation of the effects of stocking density on the survival, growth, feed efficiency and condition index of S. rivulatus juveniles in nursery tanks. The experiment was conducted in a recirculating system of twelve 52-l aquaria connected to a biological filter and a sand filter. Juvenile fish (average weight 6.5 g) were stocked into aquaria at four stocking densities (10, 20, 30, and 40 fish/aquarium) with three replicate aquaria per treatment. Diet was provided at 3% body weight daily divided into two feedings. Fish were weighed weekly for 8 weeks and the diet increased accordingly. Survival was greater than 95% in all treatments, with no significant differences observed among treatments. There were also no differences in specific growth rate (SGR 2.12-2.27) of the fish among treatments. Growth rate was linear during the 8 weeks in all treatments, and harvested biomass increased proportionally to stocking density (198, 401, 600 and 785 g per increasing stocking density, respectively). Feed efficiency (FE 0.67-0.71) of the fish did not vary significantly among treatments. The coefficient of variation was high (35-41%) among the harvested fish, but it also did not differ significantly among treatments. The final condition indices of the fish in all treatments were similar to each other but significantly greater than the initial values (P < 0.05). The results suggest that there is no apparent effect of stocking density at the levels tested on the survival and growth of juvenile rabbitfish.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips can improve steams damaged by continuous livestock grazing, but they involve farmer costs that limit their application. We evaluated riparian intensive rotational grazing (IRG) as an alternative stream rehabilitation practice. We compared bank erosion, fish habitat characteristics, trout abundance, and a fish-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) among stations with either riparian continuous grazing, IRG, grassy buffers, or woody buffers along 23 trout stream reaches in southwestern Wisconsin during 1996 and 1997. After statistically factoring out watershed effects, stations with IRG or grassy buffers had the least bank erosion and fine substrate in the channel. Continuous grazing stations had significantly more erosion and, with woody buffers, more fine substrate. Station riparian land use had no significant effect on width/depth ratio, cover, percent pools, habitat quality index, trout abundance, or IBI score, but overall watershed conditions influenced these parameters. Buffers and IRG appear similarly effective for rehabilitating Wisconsin streams.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the ecological state of the soil of a megalopolis (St. Petersburg) located in the North-West of the Russian Federation using bioassay in order to create a set of the most sensitive biotests. For this, 4-year monitoring studies of the soil quality in different functional zones of the city were carried out using the bioassay, physicochemical, and chemical analyses. A set of express biotests that allow for an integral ecotoxicological assessment of urban soils was developed and tested for the first time. The developed block of biotests consists of test organisms that are representatives of the main levels of the trophic chain: higher plants (Triticum vulgare L.) for producers, hydrobionts (Paramecium caudatum) for consumers, and natural soil microbiocenosis for decomposers. All the test cultures revealed the toxicity of urban soils; they were characterized by different sensitivities to toxicants. Our result showed that a correct assessment of the ecological state of urban soils is possible on the basis of the combined use of eluate (water extract) and contact bioassays. Biotests make it possible to record negative phenomena in urban soils, which occur even under low human-induced loads. The research data confirm the necessity and effectiveness of the study of the soils' state using a battery of bioassays for inclusion in the monitoring system of urban soils.

AB  - Increasing human activities have caused significant global ecosystem disturbances at various scales. There is an increasing need for effective techniques to quantify and detect ecological changes. Remote sensing can serve as a measurement surrogate of spatial changes in ecological conditions. This study has improved a newly-proposed remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) with a sharpened land surface temperature image and then used the improved index to produce the time series of ecological-status images. The Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen estimator were employed to evaluate the significance of the trend of the RSEI time series and the direction of change. The change vector analysis (CVA) was employed to detect ecological changes based on the image series. This RSEI-CVA approach was applied to Fujian province, China to quantify and detect the ecological changes of the province in a period from 2002 to 2017 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The result shows that the RSEI-CVA method can effectively quantify and detect spatiotemporal changes in ecological conditions of the province, which reveals an ecological improvement in the province during the study period. This is indicated by the rise of mean RSEI scores from 0.794 to 0.852 due to an increase in forest area by 7078 km(2). Nevertheless, CVA-based change detection has detected ecological declines in the eastern coastal areas of the province. This study shows that the RSEI-CVA approach would serve as a prototype method to quantify and detect ecological changes and hence promote ecological change detection at various scales.

AB  - The gametogenic cycle of rbe tuatua Paphies donacina is described from histological sections of clams collected monthly from November 1993 to April 1997. Trends in the dry weight condition index (CI) and gonad indices suggest an annual breeding cycle with continuous spawning over the summer and an inactive winter phase. There was considerable interannual variation with less than 50% of the population being reproductive during the 1994/5 season. There were significant correlations between seawater temperature. the population gonad index and gonosomatic indices of male and female tuatua. Food resources (chlorophyll a levels) fluctuated within and between seasons with values from 4 to 12 mu g L-1. These values showed a positive correlation with seawater temperature, but not with any of the bivalve indices. Throughout the study, the population sex ratio was biased toward females, and often there were individuals of indeterminate sex within the population. Dry weight values for standard 40-mm and 90-mm length tuatua varied seasonally, with the smaller length group showing a higher coefficient of variation, consistent with seasonal patterns of somatic and gonad development. Both male and female tuatua show greater reproductive activity early rather than late in the breeding period and the proportion of reproductive tissue was similar for males and females of various lengths. The Cl was not a good indicator of reproductive potential in male or female tuatua. The reproductive strategy of P. donacina is regarded as exploitive, closely determined by environmental seawater temperature. Somatic growth and gonad development occur simultaneously over the summer, but can extend into the winter if sufficient food resources are available.

AB  - Background Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and climate change can have impacts on ecological structures and functions, and thus on the integrity of ecosystems and their services. Operationalization of ecosystem integrity is still an important desideratum. Results A methodology for classifying the ecosystem integrity of forests in Germany under the influence of climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition is presented. The methodology was based on 14 indicators for six ecosystem functions: habitat function, net primary function, carbon sequestration, nutrient and water flux, resilience. It allows assessments of ecosystem integrity changes by comparing current or prospective ecosystem states with ecosystem-type-specific reference states as described by quantitative indicators for 61 forest ecosystem types based on data before 1990. Conclusion The method developed enables site-specific classifications of ecosystem integrity as well as classifications with complete coverage and determinations of temporal trends as shown using examples from the Thuringian Forest and the "Kellerwald-Edersee" National Park (Germany).

AB  - The Godavari is the largest river of peninsular India and receives a significant quantity of pollutants from diverse sources, including many industries, urban developments and agricultural fields. Such pollution is more prominent in the upper stretch of the river. This work aimed to assess the water and sediment contaminations of River Godavari for the presence of trace metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn. Samples were collected from 10 sampling stations covering the entire stretch of the river. Sediment pollution characteristics and potential ecological risks were evaluated by calculating contamination factor, degree of contamination, pollution load index, geo-accumulation, and the potential ecological risk index. Pearson's correlation analysis and principal component analysis were used to predict the probable sources of heavy metals.
   The concentrations of studied heavy metals in water were mostly observed below the detection limit using the flame mode of an Atomic Absorption Spectroscope and recorded safe for the biotic community. The mean concentrations of metals in the sediments were calculated and also recorded to be safe with respect to the guideline values of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1999). However, the sampling site-specific calculated contamination factors indicated moderate contamination of some of the stretches as: S1 for the presence of Cu, Mn, Zn; S2 for Cu, Zn; S3 and S4 for Cu; S5 for the dominance of Mn. The rest of the sites were free from sediment metal contaminations. The degree of contamination values specified S2 as moderately contaminated. Pollution load index indicated sites S1 and S2 as contaminated. Both geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk index designated lower levels of pollution in the river owing to sediment metal contaminations. Furthermore, a comparison of the heavy metal concentrations with sediment quality guidelines signified that the heavy metal pollutions (Cu, Cr, Mn and Zn) tend to pose occasional harmful effects on the ecosystem. From Pearson's correlation analysis and principal component analysis, two main sources of metal pollution were predicted. The Cu, Cr and Zn contaminants were mainly derived from human activities and Mn from natural sources as well as human activities.

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) supports biodiversity in the Great Lakes basin by providing an important source of food and habitat for breeding marsh birds and fish and it is desirable to have indices enabling reporting on the condition of SAV, to complement already available indices for the condition of fish, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and bird communities and water quality. We developed a SAV index of biotic integrity (SAV IBI) with 6 years of quadrat-based vegetation species composition data (2003, 2005-2009) collected across 46 coastal wetlands on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario. We evaluated the suitability of thirteen potential metrics that described species richness, floristic quality, and cover. Metrics with a significant linear or non-linear response to disturbance (as assessed by a water quality index; WQI) were retained for use in the SAV IBI. Retained metrics included turbidity-intolerant species richness, native species richness, coefficient of conservatism, and total cumulative coverage. Lower SAV IBI scores indicated poorer coastal wetland conditions. Coastal wetlands in poor condition were located in more urbanized watersheds (e.g., Durham Region) relative to wetlands in more natural watersheds. Fish and breeding bird community condition showed strong significant relationships with the SAV IBI, suggesting that SAV was an important component of fish and bird biodiversity. Our SAV assessment index and its relationship to faunal diversity can be used to inform conservation decisions.

AB  - Successful protection, enhancement and management of surface inland waters require bioassessment and monitoring of ecological quality, as recognized by the Water Framework Directive (WFD; EU/2000/60). In the present paper, we aimed at assessing the response to disturbance of structural and functional components of the riparian ecosystem in order to develop a plant-based index of biotic integrity (Riparian Vegetation index, RVI). Further, the implications of Mediterranean conditions and the spatial scale dependency in the index performance and its component metrics were investigated and discussed. Aquatic and bankside plant species were sampled at more than 400 sites of Portuguese rivers, ill Spring-Summer of 2004 and 2005. Over 300 plant attributes were pre-screened to select 32 candidate metrics. Both single stressors and composite stressor indices were used in this Study. Two spatial scale-approaches were evaluated: the Local River Type - LRT - which follows the Portuguese river typology, and the Regional River Type - RRT -, which Clusters the LRT into North and South types. Composition (e.g. cover and number of alien and endemic species) and functional metrics associated with life cycle and reproduction (e.g. numbers of perennial species), or with trophic status (e.g. proportion of nitrophyllous species) were the most responsive to disturbance across types. Overall, the RVI displayed a reliable response to disturbance; although the local approach has a higher discriminatory efficiency, the macro scale approach had a more consistent response to multifaceted human disturbances and a more robust performance, essential for environmental-decision making. Results substantiate the hypothesis that plant-based indices of integrity are scale-dependent, an important consideration in the development of typological-adapted methods either for the WFD implementation or for other assessment and monitoring purposes. Future work is required to calibrate the index for inter-annual variability in plant structure and composition, which is especially relevant in Mediterranean-type rivers.

AB  - Growth of the mussel, Mytilus edulis, was compared for the first time under three culture regimes, longline located in open sea, pole and on-bottom both situated on an intertidal flat, in the Pertuis Breton, on the Atlantic coastline of France. Mussel sampling was performed on a monthly basis over 1 year while monitoring of hydrobiological parameters was conducted on a biweekly basis. Fluctuation of environmental parameters showed a similar pattern on both sea and shore locations with generally higher concentration levels for the intertidal area compared with the open sea, i.e. 4.07 and 3.17 mg 1(-1) for particulate organic matter, 3.16 and 2 mug 1(-1) for chlorophyll-a, 58.43 and 38.72 mg 1(-1) for inorganic-N, respectively. A clear seasonal growth pattern was observed, being similar for all three cultural conditions. A gradient of length and weight growth appeared as a function of the culture type. Longline mussels exhibited the highest performance while Bottom-type culture showed the lowest. An emersion time of approximately 26% was estimated from the temperature record of the Pole station during the period of maximal growth. This could partly explain the reduced growth in length on Pole compared to Longline. While growth was faster in Longline culture and condition index were better for Pole culture, further data on the carrying capacity of the area are needed for the establishment of a mussel culture extension policy.

AB  - This paper introduces a method to optimize the environmental performance (EP) of agricultural activities, defined as the distance between the 'environmental' state of a system at a specific time or on a specific period and a 'high environmental performance' state to reach. Focus is on water management at the watershed level with three criteria: nitrogen, sediments (water quality) and water yields (water quantity). The purpose is to provide a new land-use plan. The originality of the method lies in the coupling between an agro-hydrological model, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), and the goal programming (GP) optimization method. Modeling is used to define the initial situation of the system and to generate data for the optimization. Goal programming is implemented to relocate farming systems in the watershed using a binary decision variable.
   The method is implemented on the La Boulouze watershed (South West of France). The results are an improvement of the EP, but the 'high environmental state' is not reached. The main land uses changes are the decrease of the sunflower-wheat farming system in favor of the meadows. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) has been a major focus in the study of the interaction between economic, social, biophysical, and ecological conditions. In this paper, an ecological risk index was developed by combining landscape disturbance index with landscape fragmentation to discuss the ecological risk due to LUCC in Jinghe County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China over the past 25 years. Based on the theory of landscape ecology, 116 ecological risk assessment units were established in the study area. A temporal and spatial model was established to assess the ecological risks based on the LUCC data. Results showed that LUCC in Jinghe County has posed significant ecological and environmental risk over the last 25 years. The ecological risk level demonstrated prominent spatial differences as Ebinur Lake and its oasis gradually expanded to surrounding areas. The size and significance of five ecological risk levels were in the order of highest risk > higher risk > moderate risk > lowest risk > lower risk. Therefore, countermeasures for spatial-temporal variation of regional ecological risk should be considered prioritized.

AB  - Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to examine the uptake of Cu, Cr, and As leached from southern yellow pine (SYP) treated with chromated copper arsenate type C (CCA-C), as well as effects on mortality and growth, in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Mussels were exposed to CCA-C-treated wood at a preservative retention of 40 kg/m(3) and control (nontreated) SYP in laboratory Bow-through sea table and field exposure experiments for 9 months in 1994 and 3 months in 1995. Mussels were sampled at regular intervals to evaluate possible short- and long-term exposure effects. Individual mussels were measured to determine the length, dry weight, and condition index. Mussel tissues were then analyzed for Cu, Cr, and As. Results showed few significant differences in condition index, dry weight, and length between CCA-C-exposed and control mussels. In addition, no statistically significant differences in mortality were found between the mussels exposed to CCA-C-treated and nontreated SYP in the laboratory flow-through sea table and field exposure experiments. Significant differences in Cu, As, and Cr contents in mussel tissues between treatments were few, and generally cannot be attributed to exposure to CCA-C-treated SYP. The lack of Cu, Cr, and As uptake from CCA-C-treated SYP was attributed to the low, although continuous, rate of release of these elements from CCA-C-treated wood and to the experimental design, which allowed continuous flushing, prohibiting the accumulation of these elements in the water surrounding the mussels.

AB  - Recently, a new environmental stress index (ESI), based on ambient temperature (T-a), relative humidity and solar radiation, was suggested. ESI was found to be highly correlated to the WBGT index. However, ESI was not correlated with any physiological variable that reflects strain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ESI for three different physiological variables (rectal temperature (T-re), heart rate (f(c)) and sweat rate (m(sw))), and with the physiological strain index (PSI). Twelve young men were exposed outdoors for 12 different experimental combinations consisting of three metabolic rates (rest, moderate and hard exercise intensity), two clothing ensembles (cotton clothing and protective overgarments), and two solar radiation levels (shade and sun). Each exposure lasted 120 min with T-re and f(c) being continuously monifored. High correlations (Rgreater than or equal to0.838) were found when statistical analysis was done between ESI and T-re, f(c), m(sw), or PSI, which have the potential to be widely accepted and used universally. However, further studies between physiological. variables and ESI obtained from other climatic conditions, different exercise intensities, and additional clothing ensembles need to be evaluated.

AB  - Ecophysiological research aiming at explaining the causes and consequences of variation in individual condition, health state, and allostasis is traditionally performed on captive animals under controlled laboratory conditions. The question about how captivity per se affects studied parameters is therefore of central importance for generalizing the information gained from such studies. We addressed this question by comparing various indexes of physiological condition of wintering greenfinches sampled in the wild and kept in captivity for different time periods. Bringing wild greenfinches into captivity did not result in systematic alteration in nine of 12 physiological parameters studied. Captive birds had consistently lower plasma carotenoid and uric acid levels than wild ones. Variation in differential leukocyte counts did not reveal any signs of elevated stress of birds kept in captivity. These results indicate that for a number of physiological parameters, information obtained from captive animals can be generalized to natural situations. Variance in traits most closely related to physical exercise capacity (body mass and hematocrit) were much lower in the wild than in captivity. These findings suggest that under harsh environmental conditions experienced by wild birds (i.e., predation threat, scarce resources), traits such as hematocrit and body mass are fine tuned by physiological trade-offs.

AB  - The soil fauna, for its diversity and magnitude of the tasks that it carries out in the soil environment, may reflect the state of the ecosystem functioning. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the activity, the structural composition and the diversity of soil fauna community in different successional stages of Atlantic forest, in Pinheiral, RJ state. Thus, three areas of lower montane semi-deciduous forest in different succession stages were studied: Forest in initial stage (FIS), Forest in intermediate stage (FINS) and Forest in advanced stage (FAS). In each area, it was demarcated a plot of 30 m x 30 m. To capture the epigean organisms, mesofauna and macrofauna, 'pitfall-traps' were used, being distributed, randomly, 10 traps in each area. The samples were taken in April and August 2009. The activity of organisms (arm ind(-1) day(-1)) and ecological index of the richness and evenness were calculated from the quantification and identification of individuals sampled. From the analysis of the results, it was noticed that August featured higher precipitation and directly influenced the activity, structural composition and diversity of soil fauna. The population structure was influenced by successional stages, and group activity Acari, Araneae, Diptera, Formicidae, Hymenoptera and Isopoda increased with advancing succession. Total activity and average wealth index also responded to the advancement of vegetation. The group Entomobryomorpha was the most abundant in all areas, being responsible for the variations of the index of evenness. In general, there were higher values of group activity, total activity and average wealth in FAS, and lower the FIS, thus confirming the potential use of these organisms as indicators of successional dynamics of secondary forests.

AB  - Urbanization represents a strong and increasingly more prevalent impact on stream quality worldwide. One of the characteristic effects of increased urbanization is a consistent decline in biological stream condition. The characterization of this biological degradation with increasing urbanization presents a number of advantages for the study and management of urban streams and catchments. In this paper, the limitation of biological condition with urbanization, called observed biological potential, is characterized. Using an urban intensity index and a biological index developed specifically for urban systems in the Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and San Jose, California regions, two principal techniques were compared (quantile regression and bin regression) to define observed biological potential along urban gradients. Quantile regression was selected as the preferable tool for describing observed biological potential given the consistency with which it can be applied and its statistical efficiency, however, bin quantile regression performed similarly. Having identified a numeric approximation of observed biological potential, two methods for identifying factors related to distance from potential as a way of identifying critical environmental factors affecting biological condition in urban areas were explored. The results of this work can be used for identifying benchmarks for urban stream biological condition, identifying limiting catchment characteristics, and prioritizing urban stream management efforts.

AB  - This study evaluated the status of native and stocked fish species in 13 prairie lakes in central Canada over eight years (2007-14) using three metrics: resource-use (benthic versus pelagic carbon via stable isotopes); body condition (relative weight indexW(r)); and parasite load (cestode gut enumerations). Analyses included game and non-game fishes, like naturally occurring northern pike,Esox luciusL., and yellow perch,Perca flavescensMitchill, but focused on stocked walleye,Sander vitreus(Mitchill) because it supports a robust recreational fishery. Walleye and northern pike were significantly more reliant on benthic carbon than yellow perch or forage fishes (p < 0.05), but this reliance was not associated with any measured environmental variables for any species. In lakes with game fishes, forage fishes exhibited higher reliance on benthic energy, possibly due to predator avoidance strategy, particularly yellow perch. Walleye body condition index was consistently lower (<95-105) than values exhibited by the other two game fishes (81-139), and parasites were only common in walleye and associated with lake-water salinity (r(2) = 0.93,p < 0.05) and sex (p < 0.05). Based on the results, the most desirable game fish, walleye, appears less resilient to environmental variability than northern pike and yellow perch, making this species more susceptible to impacts of future climate change.

AB  - The Soil Conditioning Index (SCI) is a relatively simple model that predicts the consequences of cropping systems and tillage practices on the status of soil organic matter in a field. The SCI is administered by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to predict a positive or negative trend in soil organic matter based oil knowledge of field operations, erosion loss,and organic Matter inputs but has not been adequately tested against long-term management conditions that Could affect soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. We calibrated the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model (EPIC v. 3060) for three major land resource areas in the southeastern United States using 5 to 10 years of measured SOC data to develop a predictive relationship of SOC for 50-year simulations with SCI values. Management systems included conventional tillage and no tillage in (1) a two-year rotation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench)-corn (Zea mays L.) with low and high fertilizer application oil a Blackland Prairie site in Texas. a two-year rotation of corn-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with and without dairy manure application oil a Coastal Plain site in Alabama,and (3) in monoculture cotton oil a Mississippi Upland site. Across sites and fertilizer conditions, SOC sequestration, during 50 years, of using EPIC was greater under no tillage (9.5 Mg ha(-1) [4.2 tn ac(-1])) than under conventional tillage (6.3 Mg ha(-1) [2.8 tn ac(-1)]) (p < 0.0 1). Although simulated SOC using EPIC was weakly related to SCI values, the relationship fit well within a larger dataset from the southeastern United States. The comprehensive EPIC model and the simpler SCI niodel could be useful tools to determine SOC storage among different management systems in the southeastern United States.

AB  - The relationship among economic growth, energy, and the environment is very complex and sensitive, demanding a comprehensive set of policies. This study examines the role of clean technological innovation in attaining win-win conditions for the involved sectors, along with some other macroeconomic variables. For this purpose, the five main indices used are the energy index, financial index, human index, fiscal index, and environmental index of vital macroeconomic indicators developed for G-7 countries. We employ the recently developed quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model to assess clean technological innovation?s impact on economic and environmental conditions along with other indicators for the 2008?2018 period. According to the results, the energy index, which consists of research and development (R&D) in clean technological innovation in energy and renewable energy, has a significant and negative impact on greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions and has a positive and significant impact on economic growth. This study is pioneering in its nature, finding that productive expenditures on R&D for clean technological innovation can simultaneously enhance economic growth and improve environmental conditions. Based on empirical outcomes, this study suggests advanced policies to enhance economic growth without compromising environmental conditions in G-7 countries.

AB  - Although benthic infaunal communities are commonly measured to assess the effectiveness of environmental management in protecting biological resources, the tools used to interpret the resulting data are often subjective or site specific. We present an objective, quantitative index for application throughout the southern California coastal shelf environment that measures the condition of a benthic assemblage, with defined thresholds for levels of environmental disturbance. The index was calculated using a two-step process in which ordination analysis was employed to quantify a pollution gradient within a 717-sample calibration data set. The pollution tolerance of each species was determined based upon its distribution of abundance along the gradient. The index is calculated as the abundance-weighted average pollution tolerance of species in a sample. Thresholds were established for reference condition as well as for four levels of biological response. Reference condition was established as the index value in samples taken distant from areas of anthropogenic activity and for which no contaminants exceeded the effects range low (ERL) screening levels. The four response levels were established as the index values at which key community attributes were lost. Independent data sets were used to validate the index in three ways. First, index sensitivity to a spatial gradient of exposure to a discharge from a point source was tested. Second, index response to a temporal gradient of exposure to a discharge from a point source was examined, testing index robustness to natural temporal variation. Third, the effect of changes in natural habitat (e.g., substrate, depth, and latitude) on index sensitivity was tested by evaluating the ability of the index to segregate samples taken in areas with high and low chemical exposure, across a gradient of physical habitats.

AB  - Empirical verification of multiple states in drylands is scarce, impeding the design of indicators to anticipate the onset of desertification. Remote sensing-derived indicators of ecosystem states are gaining new ground due to the possibilities they bring to be applied inexpensively over large areas. Remotely sensed albedo has been often used to monitor drylands due to its close relationship with ecosystem status and climate. Here, we used a space-for-time-substitution approach to evaluate whether albedo (averaged from 2000 to 2016) can identify multiple ecosystem states in African drylands spanning from the Saharan desert to tropical Africa. By using latent class analysis, we found that albedo showed two states (low and high; the cut-off level was 0.22 at the shortwave band). Potential analysis revealed that albedo exhibited an abrupt and discontinuous increase with increased aridity (1 - [precipitation/potential evapotranspiration]). The two albedo states co-occurred along aridity values ranging from 0.72 to 0.78, during which vegetation cover exhibited a rapid, continuous decrease from similar to 90% to similar to 50%. At aridity values of 0.75, the low albedo state started to exhibit less attraction than the high albedo state. Low albedo areas beyond this aridity value were considered as vulnerable regions where abrupt shifts in albedo may occur if aridity increases, as forecasted by current climate change models. Our findings indicate that remotely sensed albedo can identify two ecosystem states in African drylands. They support the suitability of albedo indices to inform us about discontinuous responses to aridity experienced by drylands, which can be linked to the onset of land degradation.

AB  - Arctic marine ecosystems are currently undergoing rapid environmental changes. Over the past 20 years, individual growth rates of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have declined, which may be a response to climate change; however, the scarcity of physiological data makes it difficult to gauge the adaptive capacity and resilience of the species. We explored relationships between body condition and physiological parameters pertaining to oxygen (O-2) storage capacity in 77 beluga whales in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Muscle myoglobin concentrations averaged 77.9 mg g(-1), one of the highest values reported among mammals. Importantly, blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and muscle myoglobin concentrations correlated positively to indices of body condition, including maximum half-girth to length ratios. Thus, a whale with the lowest body condition index would have similar to 27% lower blood (26.0 versus 35.7 ml kg(-1)) and 12% lower muscle (15.6 versus 17.7 ml kg(-1)) O-2 stores than a whale of equivalent mass with the highest body condition index; with the conservative assumption that underwater O-2 consumption rates are unaffected by body condition, this equates to a >3 min difference in maximal aerobic dive time between the two extremes (14.3 versus 17.4 min). Consequently, environmental changes that negatively impact body condition may hinder the ability of whales to reach preferred prey sources, evade predators and escape ice entrapments. The relationship between body condition and O(2 )storage capacity may represent a vicious cycle, in which environmental changes resulting in decreased body condition impair foraging, leading to further reductions in condition through diminished prey acquisition and/or increased foraging efforts.

AB  - Urban development is a principal driver of landscape change affecting the integrity of ecological systems and the capacity of the landscape to support species. We developed an urban growth model (SPRAWL), evaluated it with hindcasting, and used it to simulate urban growth across the northeastern United States between 2010 and 2080 under four alternative scenarios. In the model, urban growth is constrained by demand for new development for each time step at the subregional scale. Demand is subsequently allocated to local application panes (5 km on a side within 15 km window) using a unique landscape context matching algorithm, such that the more historical development that occurred in the matched training windows the higher the proportion of future demand assigned to the pane. Lastly, demand in each pane is allocated among development types and then allocated to individual patches based on suitability surfaces unique to that landscape context. SPRAWL has a multi-level, multi-scale structure that captures urban growth drivers operating at multiple scales and, when combined with the unique matching and suitability algorithms, induces non-stationarity in urban growth across time and space. Our evaluation indicated that SPRAWL was highly discriminatory, well-calibrated, and highly predictive of new development, but performed weakly for redevelopment transitions. We evaluated the ecological impacts of four alternative urban growth scenarios varying in total demand for new development and "sprawliness" of new development relative to historical patterns using an ecological integrity index. The results were consistent with expectations and demonstrated the potential of SPRAWL for scenario analysis.

AB  - Juvenile clams were distributed in four rearing sites selected for their varied ecological characteristics to assess the effects of environmental conditions on the physiological and immunological parameters, and Brown Ring Disease (BRD) status. Clams were sampled every 3 months for 15 months at each site. Brittany rearing sites, especially the Bay of Brest, showed the worst performances in terms of immunological and physiological indices and disease status, while the best were obtained in Marennes ponds. When the health of the clams was compared to assess seasonal effects, the winter clearly was a stressful period. A combination of bad rearing site and winter conditions led to major mortalities in the Bay of Brest in February. In other sites, winter mortalities were low. Condition index, total haemocyte count and haemocyte size were greatly affected by seasonal variation whereas haemocyte complexity and lysozyme content were more affected by the location of the site. Growth and haemolymph protein content were affected by both season and sites. Linear regressions between and within the physiological and immunological parameters indicated that large haemocyte size was related to low total haemocyte count (THC) and low haemocyte mortality. This relationship suggests a reduction in the cell division rate. Total haemocyte count and protein and lysozyme concentrations were positively correlated to the condition index. Seeded clams showed very low BRD prevalence in all sites and for all seasons; however, high prevalence was observed in natural stocks from one of the studied sites (Gulf of Morbihan), suggesting that hatchery-seeded clams may be more resistant to BRD and may be worthy of further studies.

AB  - Industrial effluents discharged into the environment may have ecotoxic effects even if they come up to regulatory standards. Chemical evaluation of treatment performance by end-of-pipe treatment systems is thus not sufficient, especially when mixtures of metallic and organic contaminants are concerned. Given that contamination may alter biological characteristics of the environment, biomonitoring studies may provide information on integrated ecotoxical effects. However, there is a need for bioassays purpose-designed for direct use at industrial sites. Many biomonitoring tools already exist and have been proved to be efficient for evaluating the ecotoxicity of contaminated waters, but most of them require laboratory equipment. In this study, an experiment in microcosms under controlled conditions of pollution was carried out to assess the morphological responses of five helophytes exposed to mixtures of organic and/or metallic pollutants. The criteria of plant growth and development, i.e. aerial elongation and leaf senescence, that were the most relevant for reflecting the ecotoxicity of contaminant mixtures and that could be monitored on-site with a user-friendly method, were then selected. Focusing on these selected criteria, a new bioindicator tool, named the Helophyte Development Index (HDI), was created. Our results suggest that the HDI is a promising tool to use on-site for assessing the ecological state of waters released in aquatic environment by industrial factories, following the recommendations of the European Water Agency.

AB  - Bioaccumulation and toxicity of Cd were investigated in a marine predatory whelk, Thais clavigera, after being fed with the rock oyster, Saccostrea cucullata, or the herbivorous snail, Monodonta labio, for up to four weeks. The oysters and snails had different subcellular Cd distributions and concentrations in their bodies given their different metal-handling strategies and were exposed to dissolved Cd for two weeks before being fed to the whelks. After four weeks of dietary exposure, the Cd body concentrations in T clavigera increased from 3.1 mu g/g to between 22.9 and 41.8 mu g/g and to between 22.7 and 24.1 mu g/g when they were fed with oyster and snail prey, respectively. An increasing proportion of Cd was found to be distributed in the metallothionein (MT)-like proteins and organelle fractions, whereas the relative distribution in the metal-rich granules fraction decreased when the whelks were fed Cd-exposed prey. At the highest Cd dosage, more Cd was distributed in the pool of metal-rich granules when the whelks were fed the oysters than when they were fed the snails. Among all the biomarkers measured (MT induction, condition index, lipid peroxidation, and total energy reserve including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein), only MT showed a significant difference from the control treatments, and MT was the most sensitive biomarker for dietary Cd exposure. No toxicity was found in the whelks fed different Cd-exposed prey as revealed by various biomarkers at the different biological levels. Our results imply that metal fractionation in prey can alter the subsequent subcellular metal distribution in predators and that dietary Cd toxicity to the whelks was low, even when the accumulated Cd body concentrations were high.

AB  - The energy budget or scope for growth in bivalves has been applied to economically important species, in studies on the limits of climactic adjustment for a particular ecological niche. This paper presents the physiological rates of respiration, clearance and absorption efficiency of the marine mussel Perna perna, determined during the years 1997-2001, for mussels collected on the Santa Catarina coast, southern Brazil. These physiological parameters were achieved under static, laboratory controlled conditions. A total of 153 experiments were carried out, grouped in 2-month periods, performed seasonally in order to estimate the scope for growth and its probable sources of variation, using biotic and abiotic environmental parameters. Temperature directly influences respiration. Absorption efficiency is directly related to the organic content of the seston. Clearance rates didn't show relationship with the environmental parameters, but a tendency of being low in high temperatures. The scope for growth is negative during the hot months (January-February) reflecting the high respiration and low clearance rates, and reaches its highest positive values during the winter months and early spring, due to the high organic content of the seston and its higher absorption efficiency. Scope for growth showing a strong relationship with the biological condition index of the organisms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focused on the spring-fed upper reaches of the economically important Great Fish River with the aim of determining if diatoms could be used for biomonitoring in semi-arid conditions in southern Africa. Five sites were monitored monthly from 2010 to 2012. Of the 269 diatom taxa belonging to 51 genera identified, the dominant taxa were mostly those considered to be pollution-tolerant: Amphora pediculus, Craticula buderi, Fragilaria biceps, Nitzschia frustulum, Nitzschia paleacea, Planothidium lanceolatum and Rhopalodia gibba. A number of diatom-based numerical indices were used to infer water quality, including the generic diatom index, the specific pollution sensitivity index, the biological diatom index, and percentage pollution-tolerant valves, which forms part of the UK trophic diatom index. All index scores showed the Great Fish River to be impacted, and showed significant correlations of diatom species abundance with pH, NO3-N, electrical conductivity, NH4-N and CaCO3. Analysis revealed EC and NO3-N as the main environmental drivers affecting diatom community composition, followed by pH and PO4-P. The percentage of diatom deformities at all sites was high, at 3.5%. Diatom indices showed the river to be impacted by decades of agricultural activity, which was confirmed by chemical water analysis. Thus diatom indices can be used for biomonitoring in semi-arid areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas has been increasing in the last decades, threating the saltmarshes and the ecosystem services they provide. Sarcocornia fruticosa can have an important role in sequestration of metals from human activities. This study evaluated the effect of metal toxicity in saltmarsh sediment (measured by Ecological Risk Index-ERI) on S. fruticosa ability to metal (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn) remediation (Enrichment Factor and metal translocation). The impact of urbanisation was studied through the metal loads on stormwaters during two main rainfall events, and the industrial impact was assessed through data analyses in a saltmarsh area influenced by a stream that receives industrial runoffs. The S. fruticosa response on metal remediation was affected by ERI. In more polluted locations, retained metals on roots and prevented the most toxic (Cd and Pb) from reaching the aerial organs, avoiding tissues death and metal remobilisation to the saltmarsh. Meanwhile, in rhizosediments with conditions to high metal bioavailability, S. fruticosa transported Cd and Pb to aerial organs, but used the Zn translocation to decrease their toxicity. This halophyte resilience is important to saltmarsh metal sequestration in high toxicity conditions, and allows the maintenance of other ecosystem services, contributing to the environmental protection and public health.

AB  - The study aimed to develop new and more specific thermal comfort indices for buffaloes reared in the Amazon region. Twenty female Murrah buffaloes were studied for a year. The animals were fed in pasture with drinking water and mineral supplementation ad libitum. The following parameters were measured twice a week in the morning (7 AM) and afternoon (1 PM): air temperature (AT), relative air humidity (RH), dew point temperature (DPT), wet bulb temperature (WBT), black globe temperature (BGT), rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), and body surface temperature (BST). The temperature and humidity index (THI), globe temperature and humidity index (GTHI), Benezra's comfort index (BTCI), and Iberia's heat tolerance index (IHTI) were calculated so they could be compared to the new indices. Multivariate regression analyses were carried out using the canonical correlation model, and all indices were correlated with the physiological and climatic variables. Three pairs of indices (general, effective, and practical) were determined comprising the buffalo comfort climatic condition index (BCCCI) and the buffalo environmental comfort index (BECI). The indices were validated and a great agreement was found among the BCCCIs (general, effective, and practical), with 98.3 % between general and effective a.nd 92.6 % between general and practical. A significant correlation (P < 0.01) was found between the new indices and the physiological and climatic variables, which indicated that these may be used in pairs to diagnose thermal stress in buffaloes reared in the Amazon.

AB  - The complementary relationship of economic and environmental risks is empirically demonstrated by using an emissions-to-jobs ratio (E/J). The ratio is derived from EPA's Toxic Release Inventory and Census Bureau employment data. Relationships among economic indicators, environmental indicators, energy use indicators and E/J ratio are found to be significant. Economic indicators include disposable income, unemployment rate and poverty level, while environmental indicators are Green's Total Index and Policy and Conditions Index. Energy indicators are per capita energy use and a state's total energy use per job. A multivariate analysis shows that poor environmental conditions, weak environmental policies and higher E/J ratios are all inversely related to indicators of economic welfare.

AB  - Soon after the appearance of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, a number of public health authorities designated the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) a sentinel for WNV detection. Although preliminary studies have suggested a positive association between American Crow mortality and increased risk of WNV infection ill humans, we still know little about dynamic variation in American Crow mortality, both baseline levels and mortality associated with WNV. hypothesized that the complex social behavior of American Crows, which is shaped by age and seasonal factors, influences both baseline mortality and WNV mortality in American Crew populations. We examined American Crow mortality data from Quebec for the 2005 WNV surveillance year, which lasted from 5 June to 17 September 2005. The variables of interest were age, gender, body condition index, time of year, and land cover. used a log-linear model to examine baseline mortality. Logistic regression and general linear regression models were constructed to examine variables associated with mortality due to WNV. We found that both age and time of year were key variables in explaining baseline mortality. These two variables were also risk factors for WNV mortality. The probability that a carcass tested positive for WNV increased with the age of the dead bird and as summer progressed. WNV-positive carcasses also had a lower body condition index than WNV-negative carcasses. We believe that the first major wave of American Crow mortality observed in the early summer of 2005 was the result of natural mortality among young American Crows. Because this mortality was not linked to WNV, it appears that American Crow may not be a good species for early detection of WNV activity. Our data also suggest that second-year American Crows play a major role in propagating WNV during their movements to urban land covers during midsummer.

AB  - The study of the structure and the dynamics of populations exposed to environmental pollutants can be a useful investigative tool for finding the connections between different levels of biological organization
   Population dynamics on wedge clam, Donax trunculus is still unknown in Morocco. FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) was used for calculating population parameters of this species. The specimens of D. trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected monthly in the Agadir Marine Bay (South of Morocco) for two years (January 2016-December 2017) from three stations (S1, S2 and S3), which are directly exposed to eventual pollutants owing to the developing tourism resort Taghazout Bay.
   The study of the population dynamics of D. trunculus shows that the annual mean of density, biomass and condition index, presents significant seasonal variations depending on the physicochemical parameters and the animal's life cycle. The monitoring of age-class frequency distributions of D. trunculus individuals revealed a slighter difference at the three study stations. Asymptotic length (L infinity) was 37.96 mm and growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 1.93 year(-1). Total mortality (Z) for D. trunculus was 3.30 year(-1). Natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.73 year(-1) and 1.57 year(-1) respectively. Exploitation level (E) was computed as 0.48, indicating an optimum level of exploitation of D. trunculus in the coastal waters of Taghazout. It is well demonstrated that bimodal recruitment takes place twice a year; one in late summer-early autumn and the other in spring. The results of this study provide information on the health status of this ecosystem receiving Taghazout Bay project. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Similar to vascular plants, non-vascular plant mosses have different periods of seasonal growth. There has been little research on the spectral variations of moss soil crust (MSC) over different growth periods. Few studies have paid attention to the difference in spectral characteristics between wet MSC that is photosynthesizing and dry MSC in suspended metabolism. The dissimilarity of MSC spectra in wet and dry conditions during different seasons needs further investigation. In this study, the spectral reflectance of wet MSC, dry MSC and the dominant vascular plant (Artemisia) were characterized in situ during the summer (July) and autumn (September). The variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), biological soil crust index (BSCI) and Cl (crust index) in different seasons and under different soil moisture conditions were also analyzed. It was found that (1) the spectral characteristics of both wet and dry MSCs varied seasonally; (2) the spectral features of wet MSC appear similar to those of the vascular plant, Artemisia, whether in summer or autumn; (3) both in summer and in autumn, much higher NDVI values were acquired for wet than for dry MSC (0.6 similar to 0.7 vs. 0.3 similar to 0.4 units), which may lead to misinterpretation of vegetation dynamics in the presence of MSC and with the variations in rainfall occurring in arid and semi-arid zones; and (4) the BSCI and Cl values of wet MSC were close to that of Artemisia in both summer and autumn, indicating that BSCI and Cl could barely differentiate between the wet MSC and Arternisia.

AB  - Shrimp Pandalus borealis larval abundance, early growth, and lipid composition were assessed at 3 sites in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, in May 1990. Physical characteristics (temperature, salinity, beam attenuation) of the water column, zooplankton biomass (80 to 250 mu m and 333 mu m to 2 mm size fractions) and its taxonomic composition (333 mu m to 2 mm size fraction) at each site, were also investigated. The 3 sampling sites were different environments with distinct water column characteristics and zooplankton community structures. Phospholipids were the most abundant (similar to 80%) lipid class in shrimp zoea I and zoea II larvae whereas the triacylglycerols (TAG) accounted for an average of 5% of the total lipids. The distribution of TAG wet-weight ratios of shrimp larvae captured in the field was similar to laboratory reared larvae, suggesting that the laboratory-derived TAG condition index can be used to infer the performance of shrimp larvae in different environments and to estimate relative survival expectations among the larval cohorts. In general, shrimp larvae were apparently not suffering from limited food resources in the sectors of the Gulf in 1990. Nevertheless, zoea II larvae were larger in size (weight) and length, and showed a higher TAG condition index at the sites where developmental stages of calanoid copepods were more abundant. This supports the proposition that secondary production in the water column influences growth, condition, and survival potential of shrimp larvae. It is proposed that survival of the first larval stage and recruitment to the shrimp stocks are influenced by the factors affecting stratification and mixing in the water column, i.e. buoyancy fluxes, through control of phytoplankton and copepod production in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence.

AB  - To investigate the soil heavymetal pollution characteristics and ecological risk factors, 42 samples and six typical soil profiles were collected from the Shenyang industrial district in northeast China and were analyzed for contents of titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As). Through statistical analysis, it was found that the mean concentrations were higher than their background values (Ti = 4.77>3.8g/kg, Cu = 33.75>22.6 mg/kg, Pb = 45.95>26 mg/kg, Zn = 81.54>74.2 mg/kg, Co = 12.91>12.7 mg/kg, Ni = 32.26>26.9 mg/kg, Cr = 83.36>61 mg/kg and As = 13.69>11.2 mg/kg) but did not exceed their corresponding pollution limits for the Chinese Environmental Quality Standard for Soils (State Environmental Protection Administration of China, 1995). There were contamination hotspots thatmay be caused by human activities such as smelting plants and sewage irrigation. The Enrichment Factor and Ecological Risk Index were used to identify the anthropogenic contamination and ecological risks of heavy metals. Soil in the study area could be considered lightly or partially polluted by heavy metals. According to clustering analysis, distinct groups of heavymetals were discriminated between natural or anthropogenic sources.

AB  - It is urgently needed to quantitatively assess ecological health of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) when considering its special environmental conditions and temporal variations caused by reservoir operation. This study developed a bacteria-based index of biotic integrity (Ba-IBI) based on sediment samples collected along the TGR in low water level period, impoundment period and sluicing period, respectively. Reference conditions were defined using 8 ecological variables describing the hydromorphology and anthropogenic disturbances around the sites. Five core metrics, including % Acidobacteria, % Gemmatimonadetes, % Geobacter, Methanotroph and Phototroph, were selected after the screening processes. The developed index could clearly discriminate reference and impaired conditions and exhibited significant relationship with environmental parameters according to the redundancy (p < 0.01) and multivariable linear regression analysis (R-2 = 0.76). By implementing Ba-IBI in the TGR, the ecological health of the sampling sites was defined as "Excellent" (25%), "Good" (50%) and "Fair" (25%) separately. The spatial variation of biotic integrity was closely associated with environmental and ecological changes, especially the increase of nutrient concentrations. This study revealed a significant tendency that the ecological health in the low water level and sluicing periods was better than that in the impoundment period, which could be attributed to the hydrodynamic changes due to water level fluctuation. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of ecological health of the TGR in different operation periods and the index offers a guideline for the reservoir regulation in the similar areas.

AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) based on fish health, population age-structure, abundance and community richness of native and alien fish, originally developed for the Akar basin (E Spain) (IBI-J), was adapted and validated here for another Mediterranean basin the Guadalquivir (IBI-G). Until now, no one fish-based IBI sensitive, useful in a large geographical context, simple and easily applied has been employed in species-poor Mediterranean basins. Various attempts to develop such an index have generally failed to achieve all these objectives. In this paper, the applicability of the index was enhanced through several modifications to the metrics used in the original IBI-J, and a new version of the index was also developed which included an additional metric recommended by the author of the IBI-J. In the IBI-G each of the five metrics that make up the IBI (percentage of individuals with anomalies, age structure of native fish population, relative native fish density, loss of native species and alien fish pressure) were validated and adjusted to the specificities of a typical Mediterranean fish community. Both, IBI-J and IBI-G, are robust and coherent assessment tools, highly sensitive to the main pressure gradients observed in the study area, as demonstrated by its correlation with many pressure indicators (biotic and habitat indexes, habitat variables and physico-chemical parameters). It points to the real possibility of extending the same methodology to similar basins for the purposes of monitoring, management and ecological assessment, especially in contexts relating to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, this new index does not need undisturbed reference sites, a completely unreal requisite in Mediterranean basins, where there is a general scarcity of pristine sites to be used as reference conditions. The results of this study highlight the usefulness of IBI-J/IBI-G as a powerful biomonitoring tool, especially in application of the WFD.

AB  - There is little information on the performance of oyster populations from Louisiana estuaries limiting the ability to choose stocks for hatchery seed production and field grow-out. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

AB  - The floristic composition of anthropogenic meadow communities undergoes transformations dependent on utilisation and habitat conditions. One of their consequences includes encroachment into and maintenance in the sward of some expansive plant species e.g. Taraxacum officinale. The objective of the study was to analyse the impact of the occurrence of Taraxacum officinale on the floristic diversity of meadow-pasture communities at varying levels of utilisation and habitat conditions. The effect of Taraxacum officinale presence on changes in the floristic composition of meadow communities was assessed on the basis of results of geobotanical studies carried out by Braun-Blanquet's method. The studies assumed evaluation of plant species proportions in the sward of meadow communities based on the share of Taraxacum officinale, floristic diversity and the natural value index of the sward. The highest share of analysed plant species was determined in extensively utilised meadows and pastures found on periodically dry habitats. Simultaneously, the high numbers of examined plant species exert a negative influence on the floristic diversity index and the natural value of plant communities.

AB  - Zooplankton are potentially powerful proxies for the assessments of biologic integrity. The paleolimnological perspective and use of fossil Cladocera also provide the means to reconstruct reference conditions and natural long-term community dynamics. Unfortunately, the use of zooplankton in lake quality assessments is currently underexploited. We studied a surface sediment dataset of 41 lakes in Finland to examine the relationship between Cladocera remains and environmental variables. Of the examined environmental variables, total phosphorus availability was found to be the most important variable in explaining the Cladocera community composition. Following the tests on species environment relations, we selected a lake trophic typology as the most suitable environmental variable for developing a new tool for limnoecological quality assessments. A test of the model on a modern and historic sample from a eutrophied lake showed that the test lake has proceeded from "mesotrophic/poor" to "eutrophic/bad" limnoecological state in agreement with previous independent evidence. The model developed here showed favorable performance that can be used to provide reliable estimates of ecological and environmental state of lakes.

AB  - Changes in biological indices (gonadosomatic index GSI, hepatosomatic index HSI and condition factor) and biochemical composition of body tissues and serum, associated with ovarian development were examined in Epinephelus diacanthus sampled for two years. GSI, HSI and Condition factor values increased with the maturation of gonads. Mobilisation of biochemical constituents from somatic tissues to the gonadal tissues with the maturation of the ovary was noticed. Highest protein percentage was in stage III (24.81%) ovary. The total lipid percentage of the ovary showed a gradual increase from Stage (6.56%) to Stage III (13.48%). Total cholesterol showed a steady declining trend and carotenoid levels of the ovary showed a positive relationship with ovarian maturation. Ash content of the ovary increased from stage 1(0.82%) to stage III (1.20%).

AB  - Assessments of wetland condition are generally based on measures of variables related to plants or large animals (birds, fish), and catchment or landscape features. This approach ignores the considerable biodiversity and functional values of small aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to assess the correspondence between landscape-based indices of wetland condition and the community composition of both aquatic invertebrates and diatoms across a broad range of wetlands in the West Coast region of New Zealand. Aquatic invertebrates and diatoms were sampled from 29 lowland wetlands subject to varying degrees of catchment modification. Wetland condition was assessed independently using two methods: a field-based method to give the Wetland Condition Index, and a GIS-based method that gave an Index of Ecological Integrity. Strong relationships existed between community composition and pH, so we partitioned the community data into groups according to wetland pH. We found only weak relationships between wetland condition scores and invertebrate and diatom communities within each pH group. In most cases, data describing the nutrient status of the water had the strongest influence on invertebrate and diatom communities. Lack of strong associations between measured wetland condition indices and either diatom or invertebrate community composition suggests that neither index was dominated by variables directly influencing the aquatic component of wetland biota. The challenges now are to identify the critical variables, and to develop complementary wetland scoring systems that better reflect the status of small aquatic organisms.

AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands are highly productive and biologically diverse ecosystems. Ongoing environmental degradation and wetland loss have resulted in a number of restoration and conservation programs. To facilitate reporting on the health and recovery of these wetlands, various indices of ecological integrity have been developed to distill complex biotic community data into results that are easy to interpret and understand. The Index of Ecological Condition (IEC) approach uses a probabilistic framework to derive an index by fitting the observed assemblage of species based on species occurrence along an a priori environmental gradient. This study refines the original IEC by Howe et al. (2007a) using updated methodologies and focusing on marsh bird communities in lower Great Lakes coastal wetlands. The a priori environmental gradient was redeveloped using finer-scale (minimum mapping unit = 50 m(2)) landscape data than Howe et al. (2007a), including Phragmites australis as an invasive stressor, and incorporating measures of water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation as watershed-level disturbances. The environmental gradient showed a good relationship with known anthropogenic disturbances. Marsh bird communities were surveyed in lakes Erie and Ontario and wetland species with clear responses to the environmental gradient were selected for inclusion in the IEC. Where detection was low, species were grouped into multispecies guilds. The resulting IEC was comprised of 15 biotic response functions: 12 individual species and 3 species guilds, and was highly correlated with the a priori environmental gradient (R-2 = 0.54). Species with strong positive responses included Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), Marsh Wren (Cistothorus palustris), Swamp Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), and American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) had a particularly strong response and was highly influential in the IEC. Great Egret (Ardea alba) was the only species with a negative relationship to the environmental gradient. The refined IEC performed well and provides easily understood output for coastal wetland practitioners in the lower Great Lakes, tasked with reporting on the ecological integrity of marsh bird communities.

AB  - Body fat stores may serve as an index of condition in mammals. Thus, techniques that measure fat content accurately are important for assessing the ecological correlates of condition in mammal populations. We compared the ability of two conductive techniques, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC), to predict body composition with that of morphometric methods in three small mammal species: red squirrels (n = 13), snowshoe hares (n = 30), and yellow-bellied marmots (n = 4). Animals were livetrapped in northern Idaho; BIA (all subjects) and TOBEC (squirrels only) measurements were taken following chemical immobilization in the field, and morphometric measurements were taken postmortem. Information provided by BIA and TOBEC failed to improve upon the predictive power of morphometric equations for total body water (TBW) and lean body mass (LBM) in squirrels and hares, which do not store substantial amounts of fat (<5% body mass comprised of fat). Although the same pattern held with respect to LBM in marmots, which accumulate substantial amounts of body fat (>10% body mass), a BIA-based model proved best at estimating TBW, suggesting that the usefulness of conductive techniques may be a function of fat deposition. However, regardless of the technique used to predict body composition, estimates of body fat furnished by our equations failed to approximate actual fat levels accurately in all three test species, probably because these techniques only provide indirect estimates of fat content. These results highlight the limitations inherent in contemporary methods of animal fat estimation and underscore the need for the development of direct and accurate measures of body fat in mammals.

AB  - We studied arthropods in shrub-steppe at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to identify scientifically sound indicators of ecological condition and to develop a terrestrial index of biological integrity (T-IBI), an analog of the multimetric indexes used to manage water resources. We sampled terrestrial arthropods with pitfall traps in late spring at nine sites selected to reflect little or no human disturbance and diverse histories of human activity (livestock grazing, chemical contamination, physical disturbance, restoration). Our evaluation of 56 assemblage attributes-measured as taxa richness or the relative abundance of key taxonomic, trophic, or ecological groups-sought measures that varied systematically with human influence. From 21 attributes that did vary significantly with disturbance, we selected 8 for a T-IBI. This Idaho T-IBI correlated significantly with human influence across the nine sites. We compared this index with an independently developed T-IBI, also comprising eight metrics, from three years' study at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. Six metrics were identical in both indexes. Combining our Idaho and Hanford results, we propose a nine-metric T-IBI for shrub-steppe lands. Concordance of metrics and the index in two widely separated shrub-steppe environments suggests that T-IBI offers an effective means of measuring biological condition. Parallels in this terrestrial system with the extensive aquatic work applying the same principles further suggest that this T-IBI could be effective in guiding conservation and restoration decisions in shrub-steppe landscapes.

AB  - The assessment of the ecosystem state is fundamental to understand the success of ecological rehabilitation, especially in the long term. We aim to evaluate the rehabilitation success of a unique Mediterranean dune system site along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy which underwent a dune consolidation intervention and species planting at the beginning of the twentieth century after the destruction of the natural ecosystem. We used three nearby non-rehabilitated protected coastal sites with different degrees of disturbance as reference sites encompassing different potential rehabilitation outcomes of the target site. To assess the overall result of the intervention, we used several plant characteristics and measured taxonomic and functional beta-diversity between all sites. We compared the proportions of typical and ruderal species of dune habitat types across sites. We further used the species-area relationship to examine if the number of observed species in our sites differed from the expected. Our analyses revealed that the rehabilitated site was taxonomically and functionally more similar to the least disturbed site. We suggest that plant characteristics arising from botanical inventories can be fruitfully used in rehabilitation assessment as they value the taxonomic and functional species diversity at the community scale. We conclude that plant characteristics compared across sites are useful tools in ecosystem state assessment if they reflect the ecological functions and conservation values of the natural ecosystems.

AB  - Animal condition typically reflects the accumulation of energy stores (e.g. fatty acids), which can influence an individual's decision to undertake challenging life-history events, such as migration and reproduction. Accordingly, researchers often use measures of animal body size and/or weight as an index of condition. However, values of condition, such as fatty acid levels, may not always reflect the physiological state of animals accurately. While the relationships between condition indices and energy stores have been explored in some species (e.g. birds), they have yet to be examined in top predatory fishes, which often undertake extensive and energetically expensive migrations. We used an apex predatory shark (Galeocerdo cuvier, the tiger shark) as a model species to evaluate the relationship between triglycerides (energy metabolite) and a metric of overall body condition. We captured, blood sampled, measured and released 28 sharks (size range 125-303 cm pre-caudal length). In the laboratory, we assayed each plasma sample for triglyceride values. We detected a positive and significant relationship between condition and triglyceride values (P < 0.02). This result may have conservation implications if the largest and highest-condition sharks are exploited in fisheries, because these individuals are likely to have the highest potential for successful reproduction. Our results suggest that researchers may use either plasma triglyceride values or an appropriate measure of body condition for assessing health in large sharks.

AB  - Little is known about the concerted influence of temperature and salinity on the fecundity of clupeid fishes. Due to a globally changing climate, both physical parameters might act as stressors, severely affecting the reproductive potential of clupeid fish populations inhabiting tropical estuaries. Differences in relative batch fecundities, the gonado-somatic index, and the condition index of bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata) were analysed in individual females sampled at the Senegalese coast and inside the inverse Sine Saloum estuary, where salinity increases upstream in all seasons. Multiple linear regression models on fecundity and gonadal energy storage show that clupeids can adapt towards increasing their reproductive investment at temperatures (26-30 degrees C) and salinities (42-51), which by far exceed marine conditions, in an effort to maximize recruitment success. This reproductive strategy, however, is accompanied by a trade-off between reproductive effort and somatic growth, which ultimately limits the species' reproductive potential inside the estuary. The observed high variability in batch fecundities might be a viable mechanism to adjust to fluctuating and rather extreme environmental conditions. Understanding the spawning biology of exploited clupeid fishes in drastically changing environments is crucial for evaluating the reproductive potential of stocks at the outer reach of their physiological performance curve.

AB  - Akodon azarae (J. Fischer, 1829) is a small omnivorous murid rodent that lives in environments with seasonal fluctuations of food. Seasonal variation in its body composition and gut length, in relation to reproductive status, was studied. Physical Condition Index (PCI) and body composition showed seasonal difterences, however, there were no differences in intestine length. The PCI was higher for both mature males and reproductive females compared to immature males and non-reproductive females. Lipid, protein and ash content showed differences in relation to reproductive status. The results suggest that A. azarae meets the additional costs of pregnancy and lactation by increasing energy intake, without relying on reserves.

AB  - Simple Summary Microplastic pollution is damaging ecosystems and marine organisms worldwide, and, as this problem is becoming greater, the fate of these marine organisms should be studied. In this study, the physical condition and the DNA integrity of gills of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) have been studied under four microplastic concentrations for 21 days. A worse physical status was shown at the end of the experiment when exposed to highest concentrations; however, DNA damage was higher when exposed to lower concentrations. These results prove that mussels can be affected by direct exposure even at a low microplastic concentration due to their filter-feeding behavior, making them more vulnerable to this type of pollution. The ever-growing concentration of microplastics in the marine environment is leading to a plethora of questions regarding marine organisms' present and future health status. In this article, the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), a commercial species distributed worldwide, has been exposed to 21 daily doses of polystyrene microparticles (10 mu m) at four different concentrations that are environmentally realistic (control: no microplastics, C1: 0.02 mg/L, C2: 0.2 mg/L, and C3: 2 mg/L). The physical status through the condition index, and damages in DNA integrity in gills, through DNA fragmentation, were determined. Results showed a minor effect on DNA integrity but a worse physical status at higher doses. Results could be interpreted as a decrease in mussel feeding activity/filtration rates when exposed to high microplastic concentrations, thus reducing the direct exposure to microplastics in gills. These effects could be happening currently and/or may happen in the near future, threatening populations inhabiting microplastics-polluted environments.

AB  - The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is a measure of fish assemblage 'health' that has been used to assess catchment and stream quality throughout North America.  It reflects human perturbations on natural environmental structures and processes.  While preserving the ecological foundation of the original North American metrics, we have modified and adapted the IBI to the mainstem Seine River and its major tributaries in France.  This successful modification of the IBI to a considerably different fish fauna on a different continent further supports its wider use outside the midwestern United States.  Using data collected in 1967, 1981, and 1988-1989 from a total of 46 sites, we show spatial and temporal variation in the Seine as indicated by IBI scores.  Statistically significant relationships were found between IBI and catchment area but insignificant relationships existed between IBI and an independent Water Quality Index (WQI) based on water chemistry.  Comparisons between the IBI and the WQI indicate that the former is a more sensitive and robust measure of water body quality.  Our results demonstrate that the IBI, combined with a statistically designed national monitoring program, would offer a reliable means of assessing spatial patterns and temporal trends in water body improvement or degradation in France.  The more primitive fish families in the Basin were affected first by perturbations.  These families include all the diadromous species found in the Seine and suggest serious disruption of their life histories.

AB  - The article considers the introduction of the state audit of environmental protection in the republic in connection with the reform of the financial control bodies in accordance with international best practice. The purpose of the article is to reveal the essence of the state audit of environmental protection. As a result of the study, the authors found that at present there is no single definition of an audit of environmental protection at both the international and national levels. On the basis of a comparative analysis of scientific and special literature, it has been revealed that three approaches have emerged in the formation of the concept of environmental audit. The features of the audit of environmental protection conducted by the state audit bodies are disclosed and, taking into account the results of a comparative analysis of the literature, its author's definition is given. To ensure efficiency, economy, productivity and effectiveness indicators of the use of natural resources and budget funds it has been identified the need for adoption of a regulatory document governing the conduct of an audit of environmental protection by state auditors and the use of its results.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of the population and the development of economies in the Guanzhong district, central China, the river ecosystem is gradually deteriorating, which makes it important to assess the aquatic ecosystem health and take measures to restore the damaged ecosystem. An index of catchment ecosystem health has been developed to assist large-scale management of watersheds by providing an integrated measure of ecosystem health, including aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. Most researches focus on aquatic ecosystem or terrestrial ecosystem, but little research integrates both of them to assess the catchment ecosystem health. In this paper, we combine these two aspects into catchment ecosystem health. Ecosystem indicators derived from field samples and modeling are identified to integrate into ecosystem health. These included indicators of ecological landscape pattern (based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation cover, dominance index, Shannon's diversity index, Shannon's evenness index, and fragmentation index), hydrology regime (based on 33 hydrological parameters), physical form condition (based on substrate, habitat complexity, velocity/depth regimes, bank stability, channel alteration), water quality (based on electrical conductivity (Cond), dissolved oxygen (DO), NH3_ N, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demandpermanganate (CODMn)), and biological quality (based on fish abundance). The index of ecosystem health is applied in the Guanzhong district, and the ecosystem health was fair. The ecosystem health in the upstream to Linjiacun (UL) and Linjiacun toWeijiabao (L-W) reaches was in good situation, while that in Weijiabao to Xianyang (W-X), Xianyang-Weijiabao (X-W), and Weijiabao to Tongguan (W-T) reaches was in fair situation. There is a trend that the ecosystem health in the upstreamwas better than that in the downstream. The ecosystem health assessment is expected to play a key role in future water and watershed management of the Wei River basin, or even the Yellow River basin.

AB  - Bio-indicators were measured on juvenile fish to assess the quality of eight coastal and estuarine nursery grounds in the Eastern English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay during 3 years. Growth (size and otolith daily increment width), body condition (morphometric index) and abundance of juvenile common soles were analysed together with xenobiotic concentrations (heavy metals and organic contaminants).
   Condition indices displayed important variations and did not allow relevant estimation of environmental quality. On the contrary, growth and density indicators showed good steadiness above years but varied among sites. In spite of difficulties of interpreting these indicators on such a meso-scale approach, analyses highlighted the estuaries of Seine and Gironde. In these nursery areas, the levels of contamination were especially high, and the combination of fish growth performances and density was significantly lower than in other sites. The combination of these variables appears to provide reliable indicators of habitat quality and anthropogenic pressure on nursery grounds, especially highlighting contaminated areas. Such indicators may thus contribute to improve assessment of environmental quality of essential fish habitats with the aim of a sustainable management of fisheries resources. A study at a different scale, from this meso-scale nursery approach with more precise analyses, on local habitats, will nevertheless be necessary to optimize the relevance of these indicators for the assessment of essential fish habitat quality.

AB  - Stress often induces metabolically expensive countermeasures. Bivalve shell production is costly and can thus be indirectly impacted by environmental stress. Suboptimal salinity and temperature may constitute stressors that allocate energy away from shell production to cellular processes such as osmoregulation or to the repair of cellular damage. In the course of climate change, water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are predicted to increase, and salinity is predicted to regionally decrease. These shifts may lead to increased stress for temperate marine species adapted to relatively cool water temperatures and high salinity conditions. To better understand the importance of climate change-related stress, we assessed the isolated and interactive effects of salinity and temperature on shell increment (cumulative growth: shell), cellular oxidative stress (accumulation of oxidized lipids and proteins: lipofuscin), instantaneous physiological condition (condition index: CI), and mortality of young Mytilus edulis and Arctica islandica from the western Baltic Sea. Temperature and salinity interactively affected shell increment, lipofuscin accumulation, and mortality of M. edulis as well as shell increment of A. islandica. Shell increment of M. edulis was less affected by hyposalinity than shell increment of A. islandica. In both species the CI decreased and lipofuscin accumulation increased with increasing temperature. Lipofuscin accumulation negatively correlated with shell increment in M. edulis. We conclude that Baltic Sea populations of ecologically relevant bivalve species may experience severe stress by the predicted regional scenario of warming and desalination if evolutionary adaptation does not happen at a similar rate.

AB  - The whiptail lizard Cnemidophorus vanzoi is a large-bodied teiid found only on two islands (Maria Major and Maria Minor), off St Lucia, West Indies. In May 1995, 42 lizards from Maria Major were introduced to the smaller uninhabited Praslin Island on the same coastline. Three years post-release, we studied abundance, demography and morphometrics of the translocated lizard population, during a 6-month period covering wet and dry seasons. Age, sex, snout-vent length (SVL), body mass (BM), tail length, tail regeneration, and overall condition (moulting, reproductive condition, cuts, external parasites) of 107 animals caught during the study are analysed in the present paper. Comparisons are also made with the source population. A body condition index (CI (BM/SVL)), sex ratio (adult males : adult females), age ratio (adults :juveniles), and sexual size dimorphism ratio (SVL adult male:SVL adult females) were calculated for the study population. Distance sampling and mark-re-sight surveys were used to estimate population size and lizard density. A total of 155 +/- 26 individuals were estimated. The lizard population was found to have a high growth rate (r = 0.97-3.95). There were significant seasonal changes in lizard abundance. Seasonal differences in lizard numbers, BM and CI suggest either severe resource limitation during the dry season, or selective aestivation. A high frequency of tail autotomy may point to intense intraspecific competition as the island is relatively free from main predators such as the black rat Rattus rattles. Sex ratio, sexual size dimorphism and sexual dichromatism all indicate a territorial species in a generally non-territorial family (Teiidae). Some adult males seem to maintain juvenile colours. It is suggested that the introduced population has successfully colonized its new environment and that no significant change in the animals condition or size has occurred during the 3 years since translocation.

AB  - Submerged macrophyte vegetation has been mapped in four calcareous groundwater-fed streams in Bavaria (southern Germany) in order to compare and assess two different methods of river bioindication. The first one, the trophic index of macrophytes (TIM), is a tool to assess the trophic status of running waters. In contrast, the reference index (RI) is an ecological index which evaluates the difference between a reference community and the actual submerged vegetation, depending on the river type, as required by the Water Framework Directive. Water nutrient concentrations were measured once at selected sites in all water courses.
   The TIM reflects water phosphorus concentrations, accounting also for nutrients enrichment in the sediment, and is not influenced by shading, depth, substrate and flow velocity of the water course. The TIM is very sensitive to small variations in P concentration when the P level is low, while the index tends to a maximum as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (Ptot) exceed a certain value.
   The RI indicates river ecological status which is not only influenced by trophic status but by every factor leading to a deviation of the actual macrophyte community from the reference community. In the investigated rivers the RI indicated reduced flow velocity caused by milldams and shading by riparian vegetation, in addition to trophic status.
   In rivers that are at the boundary between two different river types, classification of river type can play a crucial role for river status assessment. Incorrect classification of river type can lead to both, a "too good" and "too bad" assessment. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Manila clam(Ruditapes philippinarum), an invasive species in Northern Europe, can be used as a bioindicator of metal pollution. Seasonal effects on metallothionein (MT) production have not been considered in this species at the northernmost extent of its European distribution. This study assesses the annual seasonal effects on MT and metal concentrations in R. philippinarum from Poole Harbour, UK. R. philippinarum were collected in winter, spring, summer, and autumn throughout 2015, and MT and metal concentrations, as well as biotic and abiotic variables, were quantified. During winter, linear regression analysis showed significant positive relationships between tissue metal and MT concentrations. However, during spring and summer, these relationships were mostly insignificant. MT concentrations during spring had significant positive relationships with tissue and whole weight. Significant positive relationships were also observed between MT and condition index, during summer. During spring and summer, biotic factors seem to override the role of MT as a detoxification mechanism for metal exposure in this species. This is probably due to an increase in MT concentration in spring caused by gametogenesis, associated with increased tissue weight as the gonads expand. A depletion of energy resources, or physical stressors such as heat, may be attributed to the reduced MT production in clams of poor body condition in summer. The evidence from this study suggests that MT may only be a useful biomarker of metal pollution during winter in R. philippinarum in the UK. This verifies the natural variability of MT in this species at high latitudes, and highlights the potential and limits to a widely available bioindicator of metal pollution. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Aquaculture production plays an increasingly important role to meet the global demand for aquatic products and expands continuously. Most mariculture organisms are produced in coastal areas, where space is scarce and user conflicts exist. For extensive cultures farming off the coast at offshore sites could be a solution to eliminate these problems and facilitate further expansion of environmentally sustainable aquaculture. The aim of this study was to examine the biological adequacy of two candidate species for ostreiculture, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Growth rates, condition and mortality in offshore environments were investigated by transferring oyster spat of both species to 4 different sites in 2004 and 2007. Samples were taken every six to eight weeks from April to October and length, width, height and dry mass were measured as well as the Condition Index (CI = dry mass meat-100/ft mass shell) was calculated. Results show that both oyster species grow successfully in a high-energy environment. Mean growth rates are similar to those measured in individuals from coastal habitats (wild banks and cultures) and the CI shows seasonal variation in both species. The survival rate for both species was > 99% in 2007. However, in the previous trial in 2004 a high mortality rate was observed for O. edulis at one single site at the end of the experiment. Differences were observed in the increase of shell length and dry mass between sites and size classes. Taking these results into account site-selection criteria for different offshore locations are presented. We conclude that offshore cultivation of oysters will be successful if site-selection criteria are examined carefully when choosing a location for offshore aquaculture. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought is the most damaging environmental phenomenon. During 1967-91, droughts affected 50% of the 2.8 billion people who suffered from weather-related disasters. Since droughts cover large areas, it is difficult to monitor them using conventional systems. In recent years the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has designed a new Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer- (AVHRR) based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI), which have been useful in detecting and monitoring large area, drought-related vegetation stress. The VCI was derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is the ratio of the difference between AVHRR-measured near-infrared and visible reflectance to their sum. The TCI was derived from the 10.3-11.3-mu m AVHRR-measured radiances, converted to brightness temperature CBT). Algorithms were developed to reduce the noise and to adjust NDVI and BT for land surface nonhomogeneity. The VCI and TCI are used to determine the water- and temperature-related vegetation stress occuring during drought. This paper provides the principles of these indices, describes data processing, and gives examples of VCI-TCI applications in different ecological environments of the world. The results presented here are the first attempt to use both NDVI and thermal channels on a large area with very diversified ecological resources. The application of VCI and TCI are illustrated and validated by in situ measurements. These indices were also used for assessment of drought impact on regional agricultural production in South America, Africa, Asia, North America, and Europe. For this purpose, the average VCI-TCI values for a given region and for each week of the growing season were calculated and compared with yields of agricultural crops. The results showed a very strong correlation between these indices and yield, particularly during the critical periods of crop growth.

AB  - Seasonal changes in condition and biochemical composition of striated adductor muscle, digestive gland and female gonad of raft cultured Pecten maximus L. in the Ria de Arousa (Galicia, N.W. Spain) were studied over 16 months in relation to environmental conditions and reproductive events. Pecten maximus in the Ria de Arousa showed a clear cycle of energy storage and utilisation. Between March-April and October carbohydrates and proteins were accumulated in the striated adductor muscle and lipid in the digestive gland. From October to March of the following year there was a loss of such energy reserves. In the ovary there were two annual periods (winter and spring) of increase in the energy content owing to the gonad recovery, which were characterised mainly by the rise in the percentage of lipid. This correlated positively with the gonad condition index and with the mean diameter of the oocytes. The energy necessary for the gametogenesis in late autumn and winter (from October to March) was supplied by the reserves of the striated adductor muscle and the digestive gland; the energy provided by the adductor muscle was double that supplied by the digestive gland. Part of this energy was also used to support the basic metabolic maintenance requirements. The contribution to the energy loss (from October 1990 to March 1991) of the striated adductor muscle carbohydrate and protein and digestive gland lipid was similar (32.45, 27.06 and 29.15 kJ respectively). In spring the gametogenesis took place at the expense of the available food which was also sufficient to allow concurrent energy storage in the adductor muscle and the digestive gland, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - After unusually high mortalities of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were reported at commercial farms in Alabama during the summer of 2016, this study was conducted to determine whether the mortalities were reproducible, site-specific, and linked to ploidy. Seed of triploid and diploid oysters were deployed in November 2016 at four sites adjacent to commercial oyster farms in Alabama: Mobile Bay, Navy Cove, Grand Bay, and Dauphin Island. Mortality, growth, condition index, gametogenesis, and Perkinsus marinus infection intensity were monitored until October 2017. Mortalities were significantly greater in triploids by the end of the study, but the magnitude and timing of mortalities differed among sites. Triploids and diploids at Mobile Bay experienced severe mortalities in summer (100% in about two months), and the start of this mortality event was delayed in diploids. Elevated triploid mortalities were observed at Navy Cove (77%) and Dauphin Island (60%) in late spring through fall, while oysters at Grand Bay suffered the lowest triploid mortalities (34%). Possible causes of the high mortalities included environmental conditions, such as prolonged periods of low salinity and high temperature in summer at Mobile Bay, as well as, heavy P. marinus infection intensities in fall at Grand Bay. Despite elevated triploid mortalities, both triploids and diploids showed faster shell height growth at Navy Cove and Dauphin Island. Conversely, the site with minimal triploid mortality had the slowest shell height growth overall, but the greatest difference in shell height between triploids and diploids. Analysis of gametogenic stages and gonad-to-body ratios over the summer revealed diploids primarily in the spawning stage and triploids showing delayed and diminished gametogenesis, with lower gonad-to-body ratios than diploids.

AB  - 1,2,3-benzotriazole (BT) is used in large amounts around the world and is one of the substances derived from household chemicals that are of concern for risk when discharged to aquatic environments. Therefore, several studies have been conducted on the aquatic toxicity effects of BT, but the chronic impact assessment studies to evaluate the developmental effects on the early-life stage of fish are insufficient. In this study, the acute toxicity test and subchronic toxicity test (fish, early-life stage toxicity test, ELS test) using embryos of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were performed to evaluate the acute toxicity, developmental toxicity, growth (indicated by total length and weight at the end of the test), and histopathological effect of BT. In the short-term toxicity test on embryo and sac-fry stage, toxicity value was calculated to be 41 mg/L (NOEC). Based on this value, the exposure concentration of the ELS test was determined as 0.04, 0.4, 4 and 40 mg/L, and total exposure duration was 42 days. At the highest concentration group (40 mg/L), failure of swimbladder inflation and decrease of survival and size (total length and weight) were observed. Moreover, in the histopathological analysis, abnormal findings were detected in swim bladders from the 40 mg/L group such as inflammation and tumor changes. On the other hands, condition index (weight-length relationships, CI) was statistically significantly lower in all exposed groups compared to the control group. NOEC for the survival of BT was calculated to be 4 mg/L. LOEC for CI was 0.04 mg/L, which means BT inhibited weight gain relative to its length on larvae of medaka.

AB  - An experimental design for culturing Macrobrachium rosenbergii in four experimental ponds of size 25 m(2) was taken up in Koraput district of Odisha, India. The ponds were filled with water and Macrobrachium rosenbergii PL20 were released in the ponds with stocking density @ 4 m(-2). Ponds 1 and 2 were fed with Conventional Feed (fish meal) and ponds 3 and 4 were fed with Formulated Feed (Soybean + Cynodon dactylon thorn Ulva lactuca). Water quality parameters like surface water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, nitrate, phosphate and silicate, chlorophyll a and organic carbon were monitored for 195 days. Significant variation (p < 0.05) in the water quality parameters were observed during the culture period between ponds respectively. Growth parameters like daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and condition index (CI) were monitored simultaneously which showed a discrete growth during the first 90 days and then a stable growth form. Length and weight relationship of prawns were calculated for all the culture ponds which showed highly positive relationship (p < 0.01) proving unique contribution of feed towards the growth of prawns. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) values (Ranging from 2.74 +/- .05 to 2.95 +/- 0.04) also proved the greater acceptance of feed towards the growth of prawns. Biochemical analysis of the feed and prawn (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and astaxanthin) also proved the feed efficiency towards growth and coloration of prawn. Benefit cost analysis (BCA) computed for conventional feed (1.23) and formulated feed (1.62) yielded 637 kg ha(-1) and 865 kg ha(-1) respectively.

AB  - The haernolymph parameters for Octopus vulgaris and the condition index at molecular level were analysed using RNA/DNA and RNA/protein ratios on animals reared in floating cage systems and naturally infected by the coccidian Aggregata octopiana. Statistical analysis showed that as A. octopiana infection increased, there was a decrease in most inorganic elements and/or in haemocyte concentrations in cellular and/or plasma fractions. Also, the protein concentrations in the haemolymph plasma fraction dropped significantly as the coccidian infection increased. Results suggest that the severity of the infection by A. octopiana is a limiting factor during commercial ongrowing of the common octopus, at least in floating cage systems. Control measurements are needed in aquaculture to avoid this environmental stressor.

AB  - With the increasing human disturbance to urban rivers, the extinction and biodiversity losses of some macroorganism species decreased the accuracy of bioassessment. In this study, a novel index of biotic integrity based on bacteria (Ba-IBI) was first developed for Qinhuai River in Nanjing city, China. Thirty-two biofilm samples were collected along the river bank and the bacterial communities were identified by high-throughput sequencing. By the range, responsive, and redundancy tests, four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 78 candidate metrics, including Pielou's evenness index, proportion of Paenibacillus, proportion of OTUs tolerant to organic pollution and proportion of Nitrosomonas. The results showed that the Ba-IBI was able to effectively discriminate different impaired site groups, and had a good correlation with the index of water quality (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and the qualitative habitat evaluation index (r = 0.51, p < 0.01). Moreover, the Ba-IBI was negatively correlated with the number of population within a 1 km buffer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Application of the index showed that most of the sites were in the poor or bad class in the river. Our study revealed that the Ba-IBI is an effective and reliable approach for assessing the ecological status of Qinhuai River basin, which can complement the existing ecological assessment approaches for urban. rivers. Meanwhile, repeted surveys and field validations are still needed to further improve the applicability of the index in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study examines the influence that environmental variables exerted on changes in condition index (CI), shell height (SH-dorsal-ventral axis) and soft tissue mass increments (STM) of the winged oyster Pteria colymbus in suspended culture during periods of upwelling (December to April) and non-upwelling (August to November) in the Cariaco Gulf, northeastern Venezuela. Environmental variables recorded between April 2012 and May 2013 included seston, water transparency, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and the upwelling index (UI). Individuals were cultivated in lantern nets with an overall density of 56 individuals/0.123 m(2). From three randomly chosen baskets, five individuals were sampled each month and changes in CI, STM and SH were related to the environmental variables using Spearman correlation and PCA. Results show that during upwelling, both Chl a and UI presented a positive and significant relationship with the oyster condition and growth parameters. During non-upwelling (low UI), this relationship was inverse, demonstrating the important influence of upwelling and non-upwelling periods on the ecophysiology of the species. Furthermore, it was shown that the non-upwelling, characterized by high temperatures and low food availability, is a critical period for P. colymbus, judging by a decrease in growth and survival rate. Nonetheless, this species reached 50 mm in 5 months, a size considered as commercially viable, suggesting that the study area is favourable to the cultivation of the winged oyster despite a dramatic decrease in upwelling intensity in the last decade.

AB  - Mussel seeds (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk) of similar weight and length from two different origins (rocky shore and collector ropes) were cultivated on a raft in the Ria de Arousa (northwest Spain), from seeding to thinning out, for a total period of 208 days (November 1995 through July 1996). Weight increase rates for the seed from collector ropes were higher than those for the seed from rocky shore, and the growth rate variations during the cultivation period were associated with the environmental parameters measured (chlorophyll a and temperature). The origin of the seed was also found to be a significant factor. The condition index (CI) of the seed from collector rapes was significantly greater than that of the rocky shore seed at the beginning of The cultivation time. Both mussel seeds showed a similar CI after 70 days and during the rest of the cultivation time. Although allometric coefficient values for the relation total dry weight-length showed a similar range for both types of seed, no significant differences were observed for this coefficient in collector rope mussels throughout the cultivation period. Rocky shore mussels showed, on the contrary, a significant increase for this allometric coefficient value throughout the cultivation period. These preliminary results from the total dry weight length relationship obtained here and the change of CI differences serve to strengthen the hypothesis of a physiological basis for the differences in growth between both types of seed mussel. This finding could be related to the different features of the original habitats of the two types of seed, in terms of the cycles of availability of food and exposure to the air.

AB  - The ecological state assessment of the two areas in the Sea of Azov (Temryuk and Yasensky Bays) was carried out using morphophysiological (hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices) and biochemical parameters (activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase), aminotransferases, cholinesterase, level of oxidized proteins, and lipid peroxidation), as well as the toxicological parameters in the liver of round goby Neogobius melanostomus. The results of the biochemical analysis allowed to establish a shift of the prooxidant-antioxidant reactions towards the processes of protein oxidation, also an increase of aminotransferase activities in the fish liver from Temryuk Bay compared to similar indicators in fish from Yasensky Bay. At the same time, the average values of length and weight as well as the gonadosomatic index were found significantly lower, while the hepatosomatic index significantly higher in fish from Temryuk Bay as compared to similar indices of fish from Yasensky Bay. Analysis of the biochemical and morphophysiological parameters of round goby from the two locations demonstrates less favorable ecological state of the Temryuk Bay that fully agrees with the results of the elementary analysis in the fish liver. Studied parameters can be used in the ecological monitoring of the natural surroundings of this species and the areas beyond.

AB  - The development of microbial community-based biological indicators for assessing aquatic ecological status is urgently needed in heavily impaired regions, due to the local extinction of traditional indicator macro-organisms. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a microbial community-based index of biotic integrity (MC-IBI) to assess the health of wetlands in Suzhou, China. High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain information about microbial communities in wetlands and to investigate the health of the wetlands. When constructing the index, we selected what we considered were the most important environmental factors and biological parameters, and identified sensitive and tolerant species. We then used the index to evaluate the health of the inflows and outflows of 15 wetlands in Suzhou. The results showed that, of the 30 samples collected at the 10 impacted inflow sites, 2 were classified as poor, 5 were commonly, 18 were sub-healthy, and 5 were healthy; at the restored outflow sites, 24 were healthy and 6 were sub-healthy. The health was worst at the inflows of wetlands that received agricultural effluent, followed by those that received industrial effluent, and was best at those that received urban effluent. The results from our study show that this newly developed MC-IBI gave reasonable evaluations of the health of wetland ecosystems. This application demonstrates that the evaluation system was feasible and we suggest that evaluations that further MC-IBI evaluation approaches should be developed further in the future.

AB  - We evaluated the relative weight(CV,) condition index as a field assessment tool with pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus and golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas, focusing on sources of variability and potential of W-r as a predictor of growth, prey availability, and environmental conditions in 10 southern Quebec lakes over 2 years. To allow calculation of W-r, we developed standard weight (W-s) equations for both species, using the regression-line-percentile (RLP) technique. The proposed W-s equation in metric units (grams wet weight and millimeters total length, TL) for pumpkinseed is log(10)W(s) = -5.179 + 3.237 log(10)TL; for golden shiner it is log(10)W(s) -5.593 + 3.302 log(10)TL. Spatial and temporal variation in W,was highly significant and largely asynchronous in both species, although spring values were lowest in most lakes. The W-r index frequently varied with length, prompting us to examine relationships in stock and quality length fish separately. We found little evidence for a relationship between W-r and growth in either species. Pumpkinseed W(r)s were positively correlated with total benthic invertebrate biomass: stock length W-r was positively correlated with chironomid biomass, and quality length W-r was positively correlated with gastropod biomass. The relative weight of quality length golden shiners was positively correlated with chironomid biomass. Our results and those of other studies suggest that the common assumption of a relationship between W-r and growth in field populations should be reconsidered, but that W-r could be cautiously used as a working index of prey availability. We recommend empirical or experimental verification when W-r is used as an assessment tool in field populations.

AB  - Diatoms and macroinvertebrates have been extensively used as water quality indicators in Europe for the last two decades. In Portugal, the use of biological indicators to assess water quality in rivers has increased greatly. The aim of this work was to assess the water quality and ecological status of the Ul River in order to evaluate its ability for the establishment of a fluvial beach, using periphytic diatoms and macroinvertebrates as indicators. Four sites were selected along the Ul River. At each site, biological, physical, and chemical parameters were investigated. Epilithic diatoms and macroinvertebrates were sampled. The Specific Polluosensitivity Index and the Biological Diatom Index were applied to diatom data, while for macroinvertebrates, the Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party (IBMWP) was used. According to the results obtained, it was possible to conclude that up to now, this river does not possess the ideal conditions for the establishment of a fluvial beach. We concluded that epilithic diatoms and macroinvertebrates provided consistent information on water quality assessment and can be used as biological indicators of the water quality in Ul River.

AB  - The changes in land use caused by human activities have directly impacted aquatic ecosystems, making these environments some of the most threatened places on the planet. It is increasingly necessary and urgent to develop tools to identify and assess the effects of human impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. This study aimed to evaluate whether the Zygoptera/Anisoptera ratio can be an effective tool to measure ecological changes in Atlantic Forest streams. Adult Odonata were collected in 42 streams. An environmental integrity index was used as a measure of environmental change. The Zygoptera/Anisoptera ratio was efficient in classifying the state of preservation of streams; therefore, habitats with a proportion equal to or greater than 67 and 52% of richness and abundance of the suborder Anisoptera can be considered altered. Meanwhile, streams representing a proportion of 54 and 67% of richness and abundance of the suborder Zygoptera can be considered little altered or preserved. The proportions of responses were close to the proposals for streams in the Amazon rainforest region. The ease of identifying the specimens in the different suborders of Odonata is practical, enabling the implementation of participatory monitoring with quick responses for monitoring in the aquatic ecosystems assessed in the region. It is important to test the Zygoptera/Anisoptera ratio for a broader validation in biomes where this evaluation has not yet been carried out. In the future, this will enable the implementation of networks for monitoring the integrity of aquatic environments quickly, effectively and at a low cost.

AB  - The rivers and streams of west-central Mexico are becoming increasingly degraded and warrant expanded conservation efforts. We have developed an index of biotic integrity based on fish assemblage characteristics to aid in the preservation of the biological integrity and biodiversity of these waters Our version is an adaptation of previous versions of the index of biotic integrity, which have proven effective in environmental assessment and monitoring in the United States and elsewhere. It consists of 10 fish assemblage attributes, termed metrics, that are related to environmental quality, ecosystem integrity, and biodiversity in west-central Mexican streams and rivers: number of native species, percentage of benthic species, number of water column species, number of sensitive species, percentage of tolerant species, percentage of exotic species, percentage of omnivores, percentage of native livebearing species, relative abundance, and percentage of diseased or deformed. Data on fish communities from 27 sites on streams and small rivers in the vicinity of the Sierra de Manantlan, southwestern Jalisco, and in the upper Rio Duero basin northern Michoacan, were used to develop expectations and scoring criteria for each metric. The index value for a site was the sum of the scores for the 10 metrics. Index values and associated ratings of biotic integrity for the 27 sites corresponded closely with independent ratings based on habitat and water quality. However, additional tests of the index with independent data and refinement of metrics and scoring criteria are clearly warranted. The index shows promise for identifying key watersheds for the protection of intact native biotic communities and individual endangered and threatened species and for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in the streams and rivers of west-central Mexico. Our version could serve as a model for the development of similar indices for other regions and other types of aquatic ecosystems in Mesoamerica.

AB  - Terra MOD13Q1 satellite data were used to assess drought disaster events and its spatiotemporal patterns over the Free State Province, South Africa between 2001 and 2019. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and climate data downloaded from Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples? (AppEEARS) and NASA: Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource databases, respectively were used in the study area. After acquiring MODIS data with the area of interest extracted using field sample and the layers of interest: using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and pixel reliability and defining the output as GeoTIFF with geographic projection, R programming was used for the analysis. This study also evaluated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to further identify meteorological drought, computed at various time scales utilising information acquired from the Global Drought Observatory database. The results show and identify the years that are water-stressed in the study area, which indicated that low vegetation abundance and high temperature in the Free State Province occurred in 2000, 2008, and 2009. The result also shows that the summer season over large parts of the study region is characterized by moderate to extreme drought while winter seasons have light drought conditions during the same time. Seasonal and inter-annual comparisons of drought events outlined in the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) provided a useful tool for analysing the temporal and spatial evolution of regional drought and for estimating potential environmental impacts. Drought events occurrence in the study area is less frequent and milder in winter months while summer droughts of different years were more severe. The results of this study can also be used as a tool for monitoring droughts and support for decision making in the evaluation and management of regional drought, for disaster preparedness.

AB  - The profile research and the morphogenetic description of various subtypes of the natural and agrogene mountain chernozemic soils widespread in a belt of steppe meadows of the Elbrus option of zonation of Kabardino-Balkaria is conducted. Parameters of biological activity are set: content and a reserves of humus, rate of basal and substrate - induced respiration, content and reserves of carbon of microbial biomass, enzyme activity oxidoreductases (catalase, dehydrogenase) and hydrolase (invertase, urease, phosphatase) in profiles of virgin and arable mountain chernozemic soils ordinary, typical and leached. It is shown that the changes of parameters of biological activity which resulted from arable use have difficult and ambiguous character. Steady distinctions at the level of subtype, both in virgin, and in arable mountain chernozemic soils are not revealed. The main changes of indicators of biological activity are observed in the arable horizons. To establish the general level of biological activity and to estimate the extent of its change, the uniform estimated criterion - the integre index of an ecological and biological state of the soil (IIEBSS) is applied. High level of profile biological activity of natural and arable mountain chernozemic soils is established, and differences in IIEBSS values between profiles of agrogene and natural soils are practically absent. The IIEBSS values defined for the top horizons (0-20 cm) indicate noticeable easing of biological activity (for 16-43%) in the arable horizons of all subtypes of mountain chernozemic soils.

AB  - The impact of dispersed crude oil and dispersant on adult Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, was evaluated through an integrative biomarker approach including (1) biochemical (plasma catecholase- and laccase-type phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase), (2) histological (digestive cell lysosomal responses, digestive gland histopathology) and (3) physiological (flesh condition index) endpoints in the haemolymph and digestive gland. Adult oysters were exposed to non-contaminated water (control), chemically-dispersed oil (Brut Arabian Light), mechanically-dispersed oil and dispersant (FINASOL) alone for 2 days, and further depurated in non contaminated water for 4 weeks. After exposure to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil oysters exhibited induction of plasma laccase-type phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, enlargement of digestive cell lysosomes, lipofuscin accumulation, reduced neutral lipid content and atrophy of digestive gland diverticula; more markedly on exposure to chemically dispersed oil. From the studied biomarkers, only lysosomal biomarkers were significantly affected after exposure to the dispersant alone. This included lysosomal enlargement, neutral lipid depletion and lipofuscin accumulation in the digestive gland epithelium. A recovery of plasma enzyme activities was observed after 4 weeks of depuration. The integrative biological response index indicated that chemically dispersed oil caused significantly higher stress to C gigas than the mechanically-dispersed one or the dispersant alone; nevertheless, the response seems to be reversible after depuration.

AB  - The study of riparian plant communities along running streams offers information on the state of habitat and can help increase our knowledge on the use of bioindicators. We developed a riparian index of biotic integrity (RIBI) to evaluate the conditions of highland streams in response to anthropogenic disturbances in the southwest Ethiopian highland. To construct RIBI, we evaluated 22 potential plant metrics. Disturbance was quantified for each site using information on canopy openness, ground area without vegetation and exposed mineral soil. Five core metrics (floristic quality indexes, average C, native tree/shrub species, riparian status species and Shannon diversity index) were found to respond to anthropogenic disturbances. These metrics were significantly differentiated among sample sites categorized as low and high disturbance sites (p <.001). The core metrics and RIBI scores for this data set were also significantly correlated with environmental variables including riparian buffer width, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, turbidity, total suspended sediment, nitrate and orthophosphate. These findings provide support for the continued use of plants as indicators of highland stream condition in the East Africa, providing that the responses of plant based metrics to disturbances. Thus, the RIBI could be useful tool for the assessment and monitoring of stream ecosystems and evaluating the effect of stream restoration in the East African highland in the future.

The main objectives of this study is to diagnose the chemical and biological river health in the watershed of Geum River with regard to the chemical regimes (N, P) and fish community using multi-metric chemical pollution index (CPI), and the index of biotic integrity model (IBI), respectively. The empirical models of sestonic chlorophyll, nutrients (N, P), and nutrient ratios of N:P indicated that the watershed, including all sampling sites, was a phosphorus-limited system. Analysis of fish trophic and tolerance guilds showed that the omnivore fish species and tolerant fish species were dominant in the watershed, while the sensitive fish species decreased downstream because of nutrient enrichments (such as TN, TP) and organic matter pollutions (such as BOD, COD). The chemical model of CPI showed that 11 sampling sites were in the fair-good condition, and 8 sites were in poor-very poor condition. Species composition analysis indicated that Zacco platypus was most widely distributed in the watersheds and dominated the fish community. The biological health of the watershed, based on the multimetric IBI model, was in poor condition and was getting worse downstream. The degradation of the river health was matched with the chemical health and showed a decreased abundance of insectivores and sensitive fish species. The outcomes of the river health were supported by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) of fish model metrics and the physicochemical parameters. Overall, our study suggests that river health was directly influenced by the chemical pollutions of nutrients and organic matter inputs.

AB  - Assessments of ecological integrity have become commonplace for biological conservation, but their role for public health analysis remains largely unexplored. We tested the prediction that the ecological integrity of streams would provide an indicator of human cancer mortality rates in West Virginia, USA. We characterized ecological integrity using an index of benthic macroinvertebrate community structure (West Virginia Stream Condition Index, SCI) and quantified human cancer mortality rates using county-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regression and spatial analyses revealed significant associations between ecological integrity and public health. SCI was negatively related to age-adjusted total cancer mortality per 100,000 people. Respiratory, digestive, urinary, and breast cancer rates increased with ecological disintegrity, but genital and oral cancer rates did not. Smoking, poverty, and urbanization were significantly related to total cancer mortality, but did not explain the observed relationships between ecological integrity and cancer. Coal mining was significantly associated with ecological disintegrity and higher cancer mortality. Spatial analyses also revealed cancer clusters that corresponded to areas of high coal mining intensity. Our results demonstrated significant relationships between ecological integrity and human cancer mortality in West Virginia, and suggested important effects of coal mining on ecological communities and public health. Assessments of ecological integrity therefore may contribute not only to monitoring goals for aquatic life, but also may provide valuable insights for human health and safety.

AB  - We consider optimal policies for a production facility in which several (K) products are made to stock in order to satisfy exogenous demand for each. The single machine version of this problem in which the facility manufactures at most one product at a time to minimise inventory costs has been much studied. We achieve a major generalisation by formulating the production problem as one involving dynamic allocation of a key resource which drives the manufacture of all products under an assumption that each additional unit of resource allocated to a product achieves a diminishing return of increased production rate. A Lagrangian relaxation of the production problem induces a decomposition into K single product problems in which the production rate may be varied but is subject to charge. These reduced problems are of interest in their own right. Under mild conditions of full indexability the Lagrangian relaxation is solved by a production policy with simple index-like structure. This in turn suggests a natural index heuristic for the original production problem which performs strongly in a numerical study. The paper discusses the importance of full indexability and makes proposals for the construction of production policies involving resource idling when it fails.

AB  - The health effect of an aquatic ecosystem on habitat modifications were evaluated in the Keum river watershed, Korea during: 1977-1996 using the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) based on fish assemblages. Values of IBI, based on overall sites, averaged 35 (range: 26-45, n = 38) before dam construction, indicating a "fair health condition" based on the modified criteria of Karr and Chu (Karr, J.R.; Chu, E.W. Restoring. Life in Running Waters: Better Biological Monitoring; Inland Press: Washington, DC, 1999; 206pp.), while the values averaged 33 (range: 18-48, n = 15) after dam construction, indicating a similar ecosystem health condition in the IBI between the two periods. Marked modifications in the IBI, however, were partially observed along the longitudinal gradients from the headwaters to downstream along with variations of trophic compositions and habitat guilds. Annual mean of IBI showed significant decreases (p < 0.001, t = 10.03) in the mid-reach of 100-240 km location after the construction along with >20% decreases of insectivores and >25% increases of omnivores. Comparisons of habitat guilds indicated that the proportion of riffle benthic species declined linearly from 1977 to 1996 and had inverse relations (r = -0.78, p<0.01) with that of water column species. Such variations were explained by serial discontinuity concept that was developed by Ward and Stanford (Ward, J.V.; Stanford, J.A. The serial discontinuity concept of lotic ecosystems. In Dynamics of Lotic Ecosystems; Fontaine, J.V., Bartell, S.M., Eds.; Ann Arbor Science: Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, 1983; 29-42). Chemical data of long-term BOD5 and COD5 indicated that chemical impacts after the dam construction were minor compared to the condition before the construction. Overall variation of IBI was highly accounted (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.91, n = 38) by the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), suggesting that the ecosystem health was mainly affected by the habitat modifications.

AB  - Automated and reproducible methodology for assessing the ecological condition of lakes is essential for effective monitoring and facilitating the decision-making process aimed at achieving the stated environmental goals. At the same time, multidimensional measurement datasets are often an obstacle to drawing insightful conclusions, thus becoming an incentive for overly simplified analyzes. In this article, a set of measurements and ecological status assessment results for a collection of 499 lakes in Poland was used. Expert assessment process was recreated using the supervised kernel Support Vector Machine algorithm on dataset with reduced dimensionality, thus a model that automates the ecological assessment process was obtained. The use of the explanatory skill of latent variables made it possible to present the assessed objects along with their position in individual classes. The visualization of the results in reduced dimensionality increased, without interfering with the size of the classes, the informative evaluation potential, which should be considered as an acompanying assessment parameter in the future. The primary target of this paper is the ecological expert coping with automatization of assessment process and obtaining latent information for sense-making visual comprehension during consultations regarding ecosystem-oriented ecological decision making.

AB  - Modelling is an effective tool to investigate the ecological state of water resources. In developing countries, the impact of sanitation infrastructures (e.g. wastewater treatment plants) is typically assessed considering the achievement of legal physicochemical quality standards, but ignoring the ecological water quality (EWQ) of the receiving river. In this paper, we developed a generic integrated ecological modelling framework quantifying the impact of wastewater discharges on the EWQ of the Cauca river (Colombia). The framework is flexible enough to be used in conjunction with different approaches/models and integrates a hydraulic and physicochemical water quality model with aquatic ecological models. Two types of ecological models were developed, habitat suitability models for selected macroinvertebrate groups and ecological assessment models based on a macroinvertebrate biotic index. Four pollution control scenarios were tested. It was found that the foreseen investments in sanitation infrastructure will lead to modest improvements of the EWQ with an increase lower than six units of the ecological index BMWP-Colombia. Advanced investments, such as the collection and treatment of all wastewater produced by the cities of Cali, Yumbo and Palmira and upgrading of the treatment systems should be considered to achieve a good EWQ. The results show that the integration of ecological models in hydraulic and physicochemical water quality models (e.g. MIKE 11) has an added value for decision support in river management and water policy. The integration of models is a key aspect for the success in environmental decision making. The main limitation of this approach is the availability of physicochemical, hydraulic and biological data that are collected simultaneously. Therefore, a change in the river monitoring strategy towards collection of data which include simultaneous measurements of these variables is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invertebrate data from rivers in the Tennessee Valley were used to: (1) evaluate the utility of 18 characteristics of invertebrate assemblages (attributes) to assess the biological condition of streams and (2) develop a comprehensive benthic invertebrate index that reflects important aspects of stream biology and responds to the effects of human society in detectable ways. We used data from the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) fixed-station monitoring program established in 1986 to evaluate water resources in the Tennessee Valley. The streams covered sites with various types and levels of human disturbance. TVA biologists sampled riffles and pools using quantitative methods. To evaluate attributes we determined (1) the ability of each attribute to distinguish among sites (analyses of variance), (2) the associations among attributes (correlation coefficients), (3) the concordance of assessments of sites using each attribute with two independent site assessments (water quality and analysis of fish assemblages based on the index of biotic integrity), and (4) the variability of each attribute across habitats (riffles and pools) and ecoregions.
   Thirteen attributes (total taxa richness and taxa richnesses of intolerant snails and mussels, mayflies, caddisflies, and stoneflies; relative abundances of Corbicula, oligochaetes, omnivores, filterers, grazers, and predators; dominance; total abundance) were valuable in discriminating sites, exhibited concordance with other methods of assessment, and were relatively uncorrelated among themselves. Five attributes (sediment-surface taxa richness; relative abundances of shredders, gatherers, detritivores, and chironomids) were not acceptable for inclusion in the index because they either were not in concordance with other methods of assessment or were strongly correlated with other attributes.
   Based on the results of this evaluation, 13 attributes were included in a benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI). The B-IBI was evaluated using a more extensive fixed-station data set and was tested using an independent data set where samples were taken above and below the release of an industrial effluent to the North Fork Holston River. The fixed-station sites were correctly ranked, although rankings were not always consistent for pool and riffle habitats. B-IBI also distinguished the industrial impact. The B-IBI has potential as an assessment tool for streams, although more testing and evaluation of both the attributes and the index are warranted.

AB  - Currently, the available indices to measure mangrove health are not comprehensive. An integrative ecological-socio economic index could give a better picture of the mangrove ecosystem health. This method explored all key biological, hydrological, ecological and socio-economic variables to form a comprehensive mangrove quality index. A total of 10 out of 43 variables were selected based on principal component analysis (PCA). They are aboveground biomass, crab abundance, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, number of phytoplankton species, number of diatom species, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, education level and fishing time spent by fishers. Two types of indices were successfully developed to indicate the health status viz., (1) Mangrove quality index for a specific category (MQIS(i)) and, (2) Overall mangrove quality index (MQI) to reflect the overall health status of the ecosystem. The indices for the five different categories were mangrove biotic integrity index (MQIS(1)), mangrove soil index (MQIS(2)), marine-mangrove index (MQIS(3)), mangrove-hydrology index (MQIS(4)) and mangrove socio-economic index (MQIS(5)). The quality of the mangroves was classified from 1 to 5 viz. 1 (worst), 2 (bad), 3 (moderate), 4 (good), 5 (excellent). These MQI class could reflect the quality of mangrove forest which could be managed with the objective of improving its quality. Advantages of this method include:
   PCA to select metrics from ecological-socioeconomic variables

AB  - Flooding in streams may result in the removal of fish or reduction in standing stocks. However, floods may also permit colonization by fish from sources downstream. Two extreme floods occurred over a 10-year period in Gilmore Creek, a trout stream in southeastern Minnesota. Both events were followed by temporary increases in fish species richness resulting from rapid incursions in 2004 by green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) and in 2007 by green sunfish and pumpkinseeds (Lepomis gibbosus), which probably moved at least 1.5 km from a lentic area downstream. After each flood event, sunfish declined by the following spring. Changes in the Gilmore Creek fish fauna were reflected in assessments of ecological health returned by one index of biotic integrity (IBI), with ratings declining from 'good' to 'poor' after each flood. Another IBI was less sensitive to the temporary increases in sunfish, although scores returned by the two IBI procedures were positively correlated.

AB  - Thermal comfort indices (TCIs) have been developed to assess heat stress and model the relationship between thermal parameters (e.g. dry-bulb temperature) and animal responses (e.g. daily milk yield, DMY). The published models typically include temperature humidity index (THI), black globe humidity index, environmental stress index, equivalent temperature index, heat loadindex, respiration rate index and comprehensive climate index. This study was conducted to compare the performance of these published TCIs using data collected from a robotic farm situated in a subtropical climate region. The comparison also included models formulated between basic thermal parameters and animal responses (DMY and milk temperature (MT)). The statistical analyses found dry-bulb temperature can provide a similar level of performance to other TCIs in assessing heat stress. The spatial variability between on-farm measurements and the local weather station can be neglected when modelling with TCIs and MT. For cows with an average DMY of 31 kg cow(-1) d(-1), the threshold for significant decline of DMY was reported as THI >64 (P < 0.05). The daily minimum TCIs were found to be highly correlated with production loss, indicating that sufficient night-time cooling was important for preventing production losses. The potential of implementing a simplified assessment of heat stress using an on-line dataset was also demonstrated by this study.

AB  - Mussels Perna perna sampled from the pillars of Rio-Niteroi Bridge in four occasions were analyzed for the parental and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentration by using GC/MS. Condition index evaluation and neutral red assay were carried out in these mussels. PAH burden equivalent to 2-5 fold the average values prior to an oil spill in 2000 were found in the mussels collected after the oil spill. In these animals phenanthrenes, dibenzothiophenes and their respective alkylated homologs predominated. Perna perna appears as an excellent biomonitor for petroleum contamination in the water column. Mussels after the oil spill showed a pronounced decrease in the lysosomal membrane stability as well as in the previously observed natural variability of retention times.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - A reliable indication of pollen fertility is the number of seeds per fruit produced following artificial pollination, but this method is laborious, and very slow because sampling needs ripe fruits. To seek faster techniques to test the fertility of tomato pollen produced at low temperatures, we cultivated a large collection of tomato cultivars and lines of related wild species under cold conditions with minimum nocturnal temperatures below 10 degrees C. We compared numbers of seeds per fruit with: number of pollen tubes at the base of the style, index of natural fruit-set, percentage of pollen grains stained with acetocarmine, percentage of pollen grains giving fluorochromatic reaction with fluoresceine diacetate, and percentage of pollen grains which germinated in vitro. All these variates correlated positively and significantly between themselves. The number of pollen tubes at the base of the style most closely correlated with number of seeds. This technique is equally laborious, but is good for precise testing of small numbers of genotypes and results are quickly available. Both acetocarmine staining and fluorochromatic reaction were simple, fast techniques with potential for screening large collections to detect genotypes with highly fertile pollen at low temperature; acetocarmine was the best, but neither test would identify genotypes with low-fertile pollens. Index of natural fruit-set and germination in vitro did not effectively determine the fertility of pollen produced at low temperature.

AB  - A new instrument to measure the Wobbe index of natural gas has been developed and tested. The instrument detects the residual oxygen content of the flue gases after a known amount of gas is burned with a known amount of air. This residual oxygen content is a measure for the Wobbe index. The instrument has a fast response and a low noise level which makes it suitable for use in burner control systems. The measurement is hardly affected by external influences so an expensive conditioned room will not be required.

AB  - The blue mussel (Mytilus sp.) has been used to assess the potential biological effects of the discharge effluent from the Omya Hustadmarmor mine, which releases its tailings into the Fraenfjord near Molde, Norway. Chemical body burden and a suite of biological effects markers were measured in mussels positioned for 8 weeks at known distances from the discharge outlet. The biomarkers used included: condition index (CI); stress on stress (SoS); micronuclei formation (MN); acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and Neutral lipid (NL) accumulation. Methyl triethanol ammonium (MTA), a chemical marker for the esterquat based flotation chemical (FLOT2015), known to be used at the mine, was detected in mussels positioned 1500m and 2000m downstream from the discharge outlet. Overall the biological responses indicated an increased level of stress in mussels located closest to the discharge outlet. The same biomarkers (MN, SoS, NL) were responsible for the integrated biological response (IBR/n) of the two closest stations and indicates a response to a common point source. The integrated biological response index (IBR/n) reflected the expected level of exposure to the mine effluent, with the highest IBR/n calculated in mussels positioned closest to the discharge. Principal component analysis (PCA) also showed a clear separation between the mussel groups, with the most stressed mussels located closest to the mine tailing outlet. Although not one chemical factor could explain the increased stress on the mussels, highest metal (As, Co, Ni, Cd, Zn, Ag, Cu, Fe) and MTA concentrations were detected in the mussel group located closest to the mine discharge.

AB  - A pilot study was conducted to follow condition and swimming performances over two months using three samples of 50 juveniles of white sea bream, Diplodus vulgaris. The initial result indicated that the weight-length relationship followed the model; W=5.2x10(-3)L(3.49). According to this relationship, condition indices were estimated for each individual as the observed weight related to the computed weight. Measures of swimming velocities realized in an artificial flume show variations through time with an increase and decrease directly correlated to condition indices. Maximum speed of an individual was measured at 12.3 cm s(-1). Analysis of environmental conditions indicated that the decrease of condition index and swimming performances was related to bad weather which induced turbid water in juvenile habitats.

AB  - Ecological monitoring of streams has often focused on assessing the biotic integrity of individual benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities through local measures of diversity, such as taxonomic or functional richness. However, as individual BMI communities are frequently linked by a variety of ecological processes at a regional scale, there is a need to assess biotic integrity of groups of communities at the scale of watersheds. Using 4,619 sampled communities of streambed BMIs, we investigate this question using co-occurrence networks generated from groups of communities selected within California watersheds under different levels of stress due to upstream land use. Building on a number of arguments in theoretical ecology and network theory, we propose a framework for the assessment of the biotic integrity of watershed-scale groupings of BMI communities using measures of their co-occurrence network topology. We found significant correlations between stress, as described by a mean measure of upstream land use within a watershed, and topological measures of co-occurrence networks such as network size (r = -.81, p < 10(-4)), connectance (r = .31, p < 10(-4)), mean co-occurrence strength (r = .25, p < 10(-4)), degree heterogeneity (r = -.10, p < 10(-4)), and modularity (r = .11, p < 10(-4)). Using these five topological measures, we constructed a linear model of biotic integrity, here a composite of taxonomic and functional diversity known as the California Stream Condition Index, of groups of BMI communities within a watershed. This model can account for 66% of among-watershed variation in the mean biotic integrity of communities. These observations imply a role for co-occurrence networks in assessing the current status of biotic integrity for BMI communities, as well as their potential use in assessing other ecological communities.

AB  - Body condition is an important concept in behaviour, evolution and conservation, commonly used as a proxy of an individual's performance, for example in the assessment of environmental impacts. Although body condition potentially encompasses a wide range of health state dimensions (nutritional, immune or hormonal status), in practice most studies operationalize body condition using a single (univariate) measure, such as fat storage. One reason for excluding additional axes of variation may be that multivariate descriptors of body condition impose statistical and analytical challenges. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used in many fields to study questions relating multidimensional concepts, and we here explain how SEM is a useful analytical tool to describe the multivariate nature of body condition. In this 'Research Methods Guide' paper, we show how SEM can be used to resolve different challenges in analysing the multivariate nature of body condition, such as (a) variable reduction and conceptualization, (b) specifying the relationship of condition to performance metrics, (c) comparing competing causal hypothesis and (d) including many pathways in a single model to avoid stepwise modelling approaches. We illustrated the use of SEM on a real-world case study and provided R-code of worked examples as a learning tool. We compared the predictive power of SEM with conventional statistical approaches that integrate multiple variables into one condition variable: multiple regression and principal component analyses. We show that model performance on our dataset is higher when using SEM and led to more accurate and precise estimates compared to conventional approaches. We encourage researchers to consider SEM as a flexible framework to describe the multivariate nature of body condition and thus understand how it affects biological processes, thereby improving the value of body condition proxies for predicting organismal performance. Finally, we highlight that it can be useful for other multidimensional ecological concepts as well, such as immunocompetence, oxidative stress and environmental conditions.

AB  - We estimated the performance of river fish habitat evaluation using width-to-depth ratio (WDR) in comparison with eco-environmental diversity (EED) to propose an inexpensive and easy-to-use habitat evaluation procedure, which is applicable to small river construction works. WDR calculation costs less than that of EED. For verification, 25 stations in eight rivers were selected and fish were captured using electrofishing. pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, fraction of forest, farmland, and residential area in each basin were measured to examine possible influence of water quality. Results show that there is no major water quality issue in the target rivers. Although fish habitat is classified as good when WDR is higher than 6, it cannot be evaluated by WDR when it is lower than 6. EED has positive relationship with fish habitat for any WDR value. Thus, if a river geometry design in a river work results in WDR higher than 6, no measures need to be taken regarding fish habitat condition; however, if it is less than 6, it is necessary to examine whether the construction work lowers the EED or not.

AB  - Indoor Environmental Quality is an important issue in educational buildings since it is directly related to students' well-being and learning activities. Indoor Environmental Quality parameters have been assessed in three representative campus building typologies (old, new, and retrofitted), in Tehran, Iran, by measurements and questionnaire (n = 842) from July 2016 to April 2017. Results have been compared to the students' overall satisfaction level and recommended standards. According to results, minimum attention to local standards with regard to Indoor Air Quality, acoustic, and lighting, especially in the old and retrofitted buildings, seems the main reason of low environmental quality in the studied cases. Fitting a multiple regression model to the questionnaire data, a mathematical model is developed to predict the overall comfort (Indoor Environmental Quality index). Studied buildings have been ranked based on the Indoor Environmental Quality index from high quality: I (building C) to out of the comfort range: IV (building A). Moreover, results reveal that the acceptable range of each Indoor Environmental Quality parameters, especially with regard to thermal and acoustic comfort, is broader in real condition in comparison with the standards. Finally, the buildings' annual energy consumption is used to propose a Retrofit Potential Index in order to assess the impact of comfort parameters on energy consumption by integrated analyses.

AB  - Benthic algae were collected from 272 eastern United States streams and rivers and analyzed for diatom species richness and dominance, the relative abundance of acidobiontic, eutraphentic, and motile diatoms, standing crops of chlorophyll and biomass, and alkaline phosphatase activity. These data were used to calculate a periphyton index of biotic integrity (NB!), and values of the index were compared among reference, moderately impacted, and disturbed streams. The level of disturbance was based on stream chemistry, riparian disturbance, or a, combined classification. Analyses of variance showed that PIBI was significantly higher in reference streams for all classifications. The PIBI and its metrics were correlated with many of the chemistry and habitat variables, and canonical correlation analysis revealed three significant environmental gradients which extracted 84% of the variance in the PIBI and its metrics. We used the mean 75th, 25th, and 5th percentile scores from the reference sites to set thresholds for excellent, good, fair, or poor condition. Applying these criteria to the cumulative distribution of total stream length in the region, we found that 4.3% of the stream length was in excellent condition; 20.8% in good condition; 56.4% in fair condition; and 18.5% in poor condition. The sensitivity of the PIBI and its component metrics to environmental stressors supports the use of this index for monitoring ecological conditions in streams in the eastern United States and as a tool to aid in diagnosing the causes of their impairment.

AB  - Spatial and seasonal variations in somatic index (ST), condition (K), and environmental factors were investigated for Barbus plebejus escherichi from the upper Coruh-River basin from March 2000 to March 2001. Differences among values of juveniles, males, and females were not statisticaly different for K and SI. The maximum values of K and SI for adults occurred at the end of spring, whereas minimum values were observed in early summer and winter. Both K and SI of juveniles showed more stable pattern than those of adults. Condition and nutrition changed based on both gonad development and environmental factors.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems face a variety of anthropogenic pressures, urging the development of efficient biological indicators. In addition to local environmental conditions, the community structure of indicator organisms is affected by spatial processes, such as high and limited dispersal rates. Understanding the relative roles of environmental factors and spatial processes for ecological communities should thus be associated with bioassessment practices. We examined the main drivers, both environmental and spatial, influencing community structure and several indices derived from diatom communities. We sampled 81 stony littoral sites in a large boreal lake system (305 km(2)), where relatively large gradients in water chemistry (35 variables measured) exist, but no dispersal limitation can be expected. Instead, high dispersal rates should interfere with species sorting. Our response variables, including commonly-used diatom indices, diversity indices and taxonomic distinctness indices, were better explained by pure effects of spatial variables and shared effects of spatial and environmental variables than by pure effects of environmental variables. Thus, high dispersal rates between sites are likely to interfere with environmental filtering and can result in clear spatial structures in index values used in bioassessment. Bioassessment should thus acknowledge the importance of spatial processes and not take it for granted that only local environmental conditions determine index values. Failure to consider high dispersal rates may lead to biased information about the state of freshwater ecosystems. The same idea should also be considered in systems with similarly highly-connected sets of bioassessment sites, such as marine coastal systems and stream networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.

AB  - Agricultural production must respond to high-quality and improved environmental requirements. To choose adequate pest control strategies, it is necessary that there is knowledge to enable management of many agrochemicals parameters that offer sufficient information to take correct decisions. However, information about leaching, persistence, chronic and acute toxicology parameters, bioconcentration and others are hard to perform and analyze for persons without knowledge related with agrochemicals. The Environmental Risk Index (ERI) reported here permits the usage of available parameters of each different agrochemical. These include persistence (DT50), leaching, volatility, octanol-water coefficient (K-ow), reference dose (Rfd), lethal dose (LD50) for non-target organism (mammals, birds, aquatic animals and insects). These can be compared in a simple way for many agrochemicals and ranked according to environmental risk. To assess the use of this index, ERI values were calculated for several agrochemicals used in USA and Europe and related to their detection in ground and surface water. These showed good correlations. This result allows consideration of the ERI as a useful screening tool to incorporate the environment into local or regional regulations and change criteria for individual agrochemical use according to soil, weather or crop management condition.

AB  - Traffic congestion has significant adverse implications for the environment and economy. Many state and local transportation agencies have implemented traffic congestion management practices to alleviate the negative implications of urban traffic. One of the major drawbacks of traffic congestion management practices is that they do not account for socio-demographic and economic factors, which have a significant impact on traffic congestion. Understanding the influence of these factors is very crucial because they can help to communicate the system's performance management and target setting. Only a few studies analyzed the relationship between traffic conditions (e.g., traffic demand and vehicular traveling speed) with a limited number of socio-economic factors. Moreover, most of the existing models ignore the temporal and spatial autocorrelations of traffic congestion, which may significantly limit their reliability and effectiveness. This study is developed with the purpose of identifying the most relevant external factors that affect traffic congestion performance measures. To conduct the research, we have used three urban congestion performance measures collected from 51 metropolitan areas across the U.S. over a four-year period, 2013-2016: travel time index, planning time index, and congested hours. We have used multivariate time series models to account for the complex inter-relationships among the performance measures and socioeconomic factors to identify the most influential factors affecting system performance. We have finally developed predictive models to estimate the traffic congestion measures using these factors. The results of rigorous modeling show that the factors influencing the traffic congestion measures are monthly average daily traffic (MADT), the number of employed, rental vacancy rate, building permits, fuel price index, and Economic Conditions Index (ECI). The prediction models indicated that the effects of these factors are statistically significant and could be used to forecast future trends in three performance measures accurately.

AB  - Good policy can only be built and implemented using sound advice, and a clear understanding of risk. Scientific advice will often be qualified by the extent of research and knowledge, and uncertainties about the current and future state of the environment. Bodies tasked with protecting the Antarctic environment are required to make decisions based on the best available advice. To not take decisions in the absence of certainty is contrary to clear obligations to protect the Antarctic environment contained in the instruments of the Antarctic Treaty System. The risk of foreclosing future options to protect the environment by indecision is as great, if not greater, than making decisions with incomplete advice, and then actively managing that decision into the future. This "Perspective" explores the relationship between science and policy in the context of the Conference on Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean held in 2018-it is a perspective from the view of a policy-maker and end user of scientific assessment and advice.

AB  - The Vallona lagoon is a transitional area located in the Po River delta (NE, ITALY) traditionally exploited for Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) farming. During 2007-2008, a pipeline was buried in the middle of the lagoon to connect an off-shore structure to facilities on land. PAH levels were monitored in Manila clams and sediments before, during and after the pipeline construction to assess the impact of the activities through the pattern of distribution of the PAH compounds.
   PAH bioaccumulation in clams displayed seasonal fluctuations with higher levels in autumnal and wintry surveys than in spring-summer. Principal component analysis applied to PAHs in clams highlighted a petrogenic input during ante operam period and a pyrolytic origin during the burying activities. On the contrary, sediment PAH concentrations resulted quite similar both among sites and periods. Biota-Sediment-Accumulation-Factor values also confirmed that sediments were not the major source of PAH pollution for clams in this study.
   The welfare of clams was examined through two physiological indices (condition index and survival in air) to check the effects of the activities on a commercial resource. Both physiological indices exhibited seasonal variations connected to natural endogenous and exogenous factors; however survival in air was the most sensitive index in highlighting the effects of the pipeline burying activities.
   Finally, to ensure that PAH bioavailability assessment was not affected by seasonal variation of soft tissues of molluscs, PAHs/shell weight index was applied. Higher levels of this index were observed before and during the burying activities, whilst, after that, values significantly lowered. Moreover, the normalization enabled us to highlight the PAH uptake from clams in some particular periods and to compare different populations in a long-term biomonitoring program with data obtained from different periods of the year.

AB  - Whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests and ecosystem health assessments, based on test guidelines of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and index of biological integrity (IBI), were conducted on various streams located in Youngsan River watershed, Korea. The WET tests showed that about 33 and 82% of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) exhibited significant toxicity to Daphnia magna and Selenastrum capricornutum, respectively. Small WWTPs with low discharge volumes contributed less than 1% to the total stream toxicity. Fish community compositions and trophic guild analysis showed that the diversity index was greater in the control than in impacted streams, and the proportion of omnivore species was less in the control. Also, ecosystem health assessments, based on the IBI, showed distinct differences between the control and impacted sites of WWTPs. Model values of the IBI, based on 12 stream data sets, averaged 28, which is judged as a fair to poor condition according to the U.S. EPA criteria. The mean IBI in the control sites was 42, indicating good stream condition, whereas the impacted sites was scored 21, indicating poor condition. Overall, WET tests and ecosystem health assessments suggested the WWTP effluents had evident toxic effects on the biota, and impacted the species compositions and trophic guilds, resulting in degradation of the stream ecosystem health.

AB  - This study compares biodiversity indicators based on plant and bird communities in eight mosaic landscapes in Hungary, dominated by a mixture of agro-ecosystems and grasslands. The eight landscapes were selected to represent the diversity of the mixed agricultural landscapes of South-East Europe, where a mosaic pattern of intensively managed farmlands and high nature value semi natural grasslands is still relatively prevalent. Bird communities were described using several assemblage-level (species number, total abundance, and Shannon diversity of the assemblage, based on 15 pre-selected key farmland bird species), as well as species-level (presence/absence of the 15 bird species) indicators, which were checked against a synthetic landscape quality indicator describing the degradation of the local plant communities with respect to an ideal baseline (vegetation-based natural capital index, NCI). The authors were interested if and how the assemblage- and species-level bird indicators can describe landscape quality in South-East European agricultural mosaic landscapes.
   It was found that assemblage-level bird indicators were poorly associated to the landscape quality measured in terms of NCI: only total abundance correlated significantly with NCI. On the other hand, species-level indicators were much more successful in predicting landscape quality. Six (Alauda arvensis, Emberiza calandra, Falco tinnunculus, Motacilla flava, Limosa limosa, Vanellus vanellus) of the 15 farmland bird species studied showed significant positive correlation with NCI, while three species (Emberiza citrinella, Galerida cristata, Sylvia communis) exhibited negative correlations. We also found that it was possible to draw conclusions about the landscape quality in an agricultural landscape based on the bird communities better, than to predict the bird assemblages from vegetation condition.
   The negative correlations for species that indicate good quality habitats in Western Europe, underline the context specificity of biodiversity indicators: whereas the conditions preferred by these species can be considered relatively natural in Western Europe, they correspond to relatively degraded habitats in South-East Europe.

AB  - In the last decade a growing number of efforts have been made to insure the weather-related production risks of rural agricultural households in the Global South via microinsurance contracts linked to environmental indices. Such index insurance products are increasingly championed for their ostensible capacity to decrease vulnerability, 'crowd in' rural credit, and increase productive risk taking. This paper presents an empirical and theoretical framework for understanding the explosion of these projects, demonstrating that the formation of financial consumer subjects who are themselves agricultural producers is an emerging and consequential process within the dynamics of (dis)articulation. Rather than being hindered by the absence of the real subsumption of land or labor to capital, the derivative nature of the index insurance form offering only the possibility of remuneration instead of indemnification of loss makes it especially well suited to operating in precisely such conditions on the edges of (non)market relations.

AB  - Ecological security is the state when an ecosystem maintains its stability under external stress. Due to climate change and the increase in human activities since the 20th century, the rapid decline in global ecological security has threatened sustainable human development. The evaluation and projection of global ecological security is important for forming adaptation strategies to maintain sustainable development in sensitive areas. However, the current assessments of ecological security mainly focus on regional scales, and the interactions among different factors have not been considered, resulting in future projections having substantial uncertainty. Here, a new index of ecological security was developed by including biological, oxygen, carbon, thermal and hydrological cycles and the impacts to ecosystem stability from climate change and human activities at a global scale. A global distribution map of ecological security has been established that covers the past 60 years and includes projections for the future 100 years. A severe decline in ecological security has occurred in drylands that has expanded into surrounding regions over the past 60 years. The response of ecological security to global warming and human activities is projected to be stronger. By similar to 2100, under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the amount of globally insecure land would cover more than 57% of the land in the world.

AB  - In rangelands, monitoring spatial regime boundaries (i.e., boundaries between ecological states) could provide early warnings of state transitions, elucidate the spatial nature of state transitions, and quantify management outcomes. Here, we test the ability of established regime shift detection methods and traditional, local-scale rangeland monitoring data to identify spatial regime boundaries in a complex rangeland system. We collected plant community composition data via point-intercept sampling at 400 evenly-spaced locations along a 4000m transect. We then applied three statistical regime shift detection methods to identify spatial regimes and compared outcomes of each statistical method. Statistical detection of spatial regimes held up to traditional field monitoring practices. Spatial regime locations matched historic plant communities in the study site going back 130 years, but we also detected a localized wildfire-driven state transition: a relict ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) spatial regime transitioned to a bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) - annual grass regime. The spatial regimes monitoring approach capitalizes on the existence of spatial boundaries between states to track ecological states as they move, expand, contract, or disappear. This is an advancement over traditional time series approaches to regime shift/state transition detection which only detect state transitions if enough sites transition. Existing local-scale rangeland monitoring, used strategically, can complement current coarse, broad-scale applications of spatial regimes monitoring by detecting subtle, fine-scale boundaries that broad-scale monitoring cannot capture.

AB  - From 1994 to 2000, 154 sites belonging to the grayling and trout zones were used to develop a fish-based multimetric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) as a tool to assess upstream brooks in Flanders (Belgium). All sites had a slope of at least 3% and a maximum width of 4.5 m. Fish assemblages were surveyed by electrofishing. From 28 candidate metrics 9 metrics were selected using ecological criteria and statistical analyses. The IBI was defined as the average of these 9 metrics after scoring them as 1, 3 or 5 by a modified trisection method and five integrity classes were defined to comply with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The IBI was tested internally by comparison with habitat quality scores at sites. A similar comparison was done using an independent set of data from sites of known ecological quality. Our IBI clearly distinguished good sites from disturbed sites and heavily disturbed sites from moderately disturbed sites, thereby meeting the criteria imposed by the WFD.

AB  - Population growth and rapid economic development have led to serious and widespread negative ecological impacts, so the world is faced with the task of ecological recovery. China, in particular, is carrying out a nationwide land improvement and ecological restoration campaign. The spatial distribution of ecological resilience needs to be fully considered in the planning of these projects. However, most current ecological assessments lack a focus on resilience. Based on selected resilience principles, this paper constructs an assessment indicator system for national-scale ecological resilience, evaluates the level of ecological resilience of 1,434 ecological function areas in China and discusses the layout of ecological restoration projects throughout the country. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) In China, the level of ecological resilience varies widely based on location. Generally, it shows high levels of ecological resilience occur in the south and low in the north. The resilience index ranged from 0 to 0.585. The natural condition index is the most important indicator affecting resilience. (2) China's existing ecological restoration projects are mostly distributed in areas with low levels of resilience. Restorative ecological engineering is not directly related to the distribution of resilience but is affected by the level of resilience. (3) The levels of China's resilience has a negative relationship with ecological sensitivity and ecological vulnerability level. Constructing a national-scale resilience assessment index system based on resilience criteria can effectively reveal the overall pattern of national-scale resilience. This study can provide reference for the ecological restoration planning, assessment, and adaptive management on a national level.

AB  - This work proposes a water quality model based on the pooled effects of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and orthophosphate concentration as the main causatives of environmental water quality changes. One of the main characteristics of the model is assigning an environmental weight for each variable (zeta(i)) according to threshold concentrations of nutrients capable of inducing water changes condition. The model validation demonstrated adequate sensitivity to different data arrangements; as observed in an and climate bay, showing annual stratification resulting in a variable content in nitrogen-forms and phosphorous. The model can be continuously calibrated over time by adding more N and P data to specific nutrient functions, and tested on sites with high NO3, NO2 or NH4 concentrations. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The diversity and abundance of information available for vulnerability assessments can present a challenge to decision-makers. Here we propose a framework to aggregate and present socioeconomic and environmental data in a visual vulnerability assessment that will help prioritize management options for communities vulnerable to environmental change. Socioeconomic and environmental data are aggregated into distinct categorical indices across three dimensions and arranged in a cube, so that individual communities can be plotted in a three-dimensional space to assess the type and relative magnitude of the communities' vulnerabilities based on their position in the cube. We present an example assessment using a subset of the USEPA National Estuary Program (NEP) estuaries: coastal communities vulnerable to the effects of environmental change on ecosystem health and water quality. Using three categorical indices created from a pool of publicly available data (socioeconomic index, land use index, estuary condition index), the estuaries were ranked based on their normalized averaged scores and then plotted along the three axes to form a vulnerability cube. The position of each community within the three-dimensional space communicates both the types of vulnerability endemic to each estuary and allows for the clustering of estuaries with like-vulnerabilities to be classified into typologies. The typologies highlight specific vulnerability descriptions that may be helpful in creating specific management strategies. The data used to create the categorical indices are flexible depending on the goals of the decision makers, as different data should be chosen based on availability or importance to the system. Therefore, the analysis can be tailored to specific types of communities, allowing a data rich process to inform decision-making.

AB  - From 1995 to 1997, the larval habitats, seasonal abundance and behaviour of Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) were studied in five western suburbs of Brisbane, south-east Queensland. At one suburb, Ae. notoscriptus immatures were found in 61.1% and 47.3% of premises, during winter and summer, respectively. Natural habitats, mainly bromeliad axils, garden accoutrements and discarded items accounted for 86% and 81% of infested containers in summer and winter, respectively. However, when larval productivity was accounted for, discarded household items and garden accoutrements were the most important container types. The Premise Condition Index (house condition, garden condition, shade cover) did not positively relate to the presence of Ae. notoscriptus larvae, nor to numbers of infested containers per premise. Similarly, the presence of inbuilt garden sprinkler systems could not be used as an indicator to predict premises that would be positive for Ae. notoscriptus immatures. The number of adult Ae. notoscriptus (21.3% of total) collected using light traps was second to the number of Culex annulirostris (Skuse) (48.9%) collected. These traps were unsuitable for monitoring Ae. notoscriptus during autumn and winter when Ae. notoscriptis activity shifted to the afternoon, and when traps were not operating. In terms of targeted approaches to control Ae. notoscriptus immatures, rubbish collection campaigns undertaken before the wet season should be focused on the removal of discarded household items, rubbish and tyres. Specific health education messages should be used to inform householders of the need to regularly clean or remove pot plant bases and bird baths. If effective, these methods could reduce Ae. notoscriptus larval densities by 70% and 80% during summer and winter months, respectively.

AB  - The Ecological Evaluation Index continuous formula (EEI-c) was designed to estimate the habitat-based ecological status of rocky coastal and sedimentary transitional waters using shallow benthic macrophyte communities as bioindicators. This study aimed to remedy the weaknesses of the currently used EEI methodology in: (1) ecological status groups (ESG), (2) the formula, and (3) reference condition values.
   A cluster analysis of twelve species traits was used to delineate ESGs. Two main clusters (ESG I, late-successional; ESG II, opportunistic) were identified that were hierarchically divided into three and two sub-clusters, respectively: ESG I comprised thick perennial (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) coastal water species, and angiosperm plastic (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) transitional water species. ESG II comprised fleshy opportunistic (IIB) and filamentous sheet-like opportunistic (I IA) species both in coastal and transitional waters.
   To avoid discrete jumps at the boundaries between predefined ecological categories, a hyperbolic model that approximates the index values and expresses the ecosystem status in continuous numbers was developed. Seventy-four quantitative and destructive samples of the upper infralittoral Cystoseira crinita and coastal lagoon Ruppia cirrhosa communities from tentative pristine to less impacted sites in Greece verified 10 as an 'ideal' EEI-c reference condition value.

AB  - European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are crucial species for the marine ecosystem of the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. They account for a high percentage of fish landings and they represent an important economic income for the fishery sector. Concerns over their stock status are rising in recent years as biomass, growth, reproductive capacity, and body condition of both species are declining, with latitudinal variations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a body condition monitoring scheme. Energy storage variability has important implications for both fish recruitment and population structure. Direct condition indices, such as energy density (ED) with bomb calorimetry, are highly reliable for measuring the energy content, but time-consuming. Alternatively, fatmeter analysis and relative condition index (Kn) have been proposed as effective indirect methods. The aim of this study is to test the application of fatmeter as a surrogate of bomb calorimetry to infer the energy content of sardine and anchovy. To validate its use, fatmeter values were compared with both ED and Kn values. Individuals of both species were sampled monthly for a year in order to assess seasonal variations in energy content. Our results highlight that fatmeter measurements are strongly correlated with calorimetry ED for sardine, while a weaker but significant correlation was found for anchovy. The observed differences between the two species are related to their breeding strategies. Based on this study, Kn cannot be considered a good proxy of the energy density of sardine, in particular during the resting period. By contrast, fatmeter analysis appears to be a faster and suitable method to evaluate the energy content of both species routinely. In addition, we provide a linear model to infer ED from fatmeter values for both small pelagic fish. Eventually, these findings could be used to implement body condition monitoring protocols and boost continuous large-scale monitoring.

AB  - Largehead cutlassfish caught by traditional and commercial fishers along the Arabian Sea coast of Oman between January 2001 and December 2002 were studied to determine size composition, size at first maturity (L(50)), reproductive season, age and growth. The total length (TL) of cutlassfishes sampled ranged from 16 to 126 cm and the average size of specimens caught by trawlers (92.6 +/- 15.3 cm) was smaller than those caught by traditional fishers (98.8 +/- 10.4 cm), suggesting gear selectivity. Females dominated samples (1F:0.12M), matured at an average TL of 79 cm and females with ripe ovaries occurred almost throughout the year. The gonado-somatic index of females (GSI) peaked in May and declined sharply in June and a spawning season at the onset of the SW monsoon winds is also supported by the hepato-somatic index (HSI) and condition index (CI) trends. The length-weight relationship was TW=3x10(-4)TL(3.3155) and the conversion factor from TL to preanal length was 0.55. Growth rings were counted on the otoliths of 378 cutlassfish and an age-length relationship was estimated with von Bertalanffy growth (VBG) parameters of L(infinity) (127.4cm TL), K (0.399 yr(-1)) and to (-0.9815 yr). Length frequency data analyzed with ELEFAN software estimated the VBG parameter of L(infinity), K and t(0) as 129cm, 0.459 yr(-1) and -0.69 yr respectively.

KW  - TEMPORAL VARIABILITY

KW  - ASSEMBLAGE
AB  - The index of biotic integrity (IBI) has become a widely used tool for assessing the condition of stream fish communities and the overall biological status of streams. Because the location of a stream in a drainage network can influence the species richness of fish communities and because species richness is an important component of the IBI, we examined the influence of stream spatial location on the IBI. We found that IBI scores for headwater streams in three Illinois drainage basins were significantly lower than those calculated for tributary streams of similar size connecting directly to larger streams. This difference in IBI was related to the increased species richness and to a greater number of sucker and darter species in tributaries that drain into larger, main-channel streams. Because of the influence of tributary location on the IBI, expected values for headwater tributary streams should be developed independently from those developed for main-channel tributary streams. Failure to do so can result in a substantial underestimation of the IBI of headwater tributary streams or an overestimation of main-channel tributaries.

AB  - Models are being developed and utilized by scientists and government agencies to quantify the potential for carbon storage in soil. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) v. 3060 model is a process-based model requiring detailed inputs. The soil conditioning index (SCI) is a sunpler tool to predict relative change it] soil organic carbon (SOC) using table values for three management components (i.e., organic matter, field operations, and erosion) within the framework of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 2 model. Our objective was to determine whether SOC sequestration front no-tillage cropping systems in the southeastern USA could be simply predicted with SCI compared with detailed simulations using EPIC. Four management systems were evaluated: (1) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with conventional tillage, (2) cotton with no tillage, (3) corn (Zea mays L.)cotton rotation with no tillage, and (4) bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.)-corn-cotton rotation with no tillage. All no-tillage systems used wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a cover crop. Sirnulated SOC sequestration with EPIC was 0.46 +/- 0.06 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (410 +/- 51 lb ac(-1) yr(-1)) under the three no-tillage management systems and -0.03 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (-30 lb ac(-1) yr(-1)) under conventional tillage. The SCI also predicted a strong difference in SOC between converttional and no tillage. Differences in SOC sequestration aniong crop rotations were not readily apparent with EPIC but were with SCI. Predictions of SOC sequestration with SCI were comparable to those with EPIC but not necessarily in a linear manner as previously suggested. The SCI appears to be a valuable method for rnaking reasonable, cost-effective estimates of potential changes in SOC with adoption of conservation management in the southeastern USA, although validations under actual field conditions are still needed.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the fundamental economic activities in most countries; however, this sector suffers from various natural hazards including flood and drought. The determination of drought-prone areas is essential to select drought-tolerant crops in climate sensitive vulnerable areas. This study aims to enhance the detection of agricultural areas with vulnerability to drought conditions in a heterogeneous environment, taking Bangladesh as a case study. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images have been incorporated to compute the vegetation index. In this study, a modified vegetation condition index (mVCI) is proposed to enhance the estimation of agricultural drought. The NDVI values ranging between 0.44 to 0.66 for croplands are utilized for the mVCI. The outcomes of the mVCI are compared with the traditional vegetation condition index (VCI). Precipitation and crop yield data are used for the evaluation. The mVCI maps from multiple years (2006-2018) have been produced to compute the drought hazard index (DHI) using a weighted sum overlay method. The results show that the proposed mVCI enhances the detection of agricultural drought compared to the traditional VCI in a heterogeneous environment. The "Aus" rice-growing season (sown in mid-March to mid-April and harvested in mid-July to early August) receives the highest average precipitation (>400 mm), and thereby this season is less vulnerable to drought. A comparison of crop yields reveals the lowest productivity in the drought year (2006) compared to the non-drought year (2018), and the DHI map presents that the north-west region of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to agricultural drought. This study has undertaken a large-scale analysis that is important to prioritize agricultural zones and initiate development projects based on the associated level of vulnerability.

AB  - Environmental capacity paves the foundation for sustainable economic development. As the vital growth pole in the Rise Strategy of Central China, the environmental and economic construction of Hunan province proves to have enormous demonstration effect. In order to better understand the environmental condition in Hunan province, this study combines the information entropy theory and ecological comprehensive index to measure the environmental capacity of 14 administration divisions in Hunan province and 30 provinces across China in 2013. The results indicate that, first of all, the average environmental capacity of 14 administration divisions in Hunan province is relatively lower, i.e., 0.39. Second, Chang-Zhu-Tan city cluster in Hunan province exerts limited radiative and guiding effect on its surroundings; in particular, Xiangtan possesses a notably lower environmental capacity than other two cities, which hampers the integration process. Third, among the four types of environmental capacities concerned, i.e., population capacity, land capacity, resource capacity and waste assimilative capacity, waste assimilative capacity takes up the biggest weight, i.e., 0.31, indicating the most important role in environmental improvement. Finally, the environmental capacity of Hunan province ranks the 24th among the 30 provinces in China and the last in central China. Hunan should pay special attention to the expansion of waste assimilate capacity, so as to promote the overall environmental capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the recently developed environmental stress index (ESI) for different climatic conditions and terrestrial elevations below and above sea level and to evaluate a new and relatively small (5 mm) infra-red (IR) light sensor for reliability and for measuring global radiation (GR). Meteorological measurements were taken in 3 different climatic zones (hot/wet, hot/dry and extremely hot/dry) at 6 different terrestrial elevations (-386, -200, 35, 375, 960 and 1640m) for 9 days between 09:00 and 17:00. Meteorological data included ambient temperature, relative humidity, wet bulb temperature, black globe temperature and GR from two instruments: an IR light sensor and a pyranometer. In general, ESI successfully evaluated the impact of climate from the various locations at different terrestrial elevations. Global radiation measurements revealed no significant (P < 0.05) differences between measurements by the pyranometer or the IR light sensor. High correlation was found between ESI and the wet bulb globe temperature index when GR was calculated from both the pyranometer (R-2 = 0.933) and the light sensor (R-2 = 0.939). In conclusion, ESI is a valid measure for different terrestrial elevations, and the IR sensors have the potential to measure GR for use in heat stress assessment incorporated in the index.

AB  - Soundscape research has acquired a paramount role in biodiversity conservation as it may provide timely and reliable information about the ecological integrity. The relationship between soundscape complexity and ecological integrity in highly biodiverse environments, as well as the factors affecting this relationship require a thorough understanding. We determined how the soundscape relates to the landscape ecological integrity at different spatial and temporal scales in a montane forest in the northern Andes of Colombia. Between May-July 2018 we obtained acoustic recordings from 31 sampling sites in the protected area of a hydropower plant, and estimated nine acoustic indices and an ecological integrity index (EII) derived from fragmentation, connectivity, and habitat quality. Five of the acoustic indices, linked to the evenness of the acoustic signals and levels of the biophonic signals, were associated with changes in the EII and indicated the presence of more even, saturated, and acoustically rich soundscapes in sites with higher integrity. Relationships between acoustic indices and the EII were stronger at a smaller spatial scale (100 m) and responded to daily variation of the soundscape, with the strongest associations occurring mainly from sunrise to noon. We show that acoustic indices measuring the evenness of the acoustic activity distribution and the number of frequency peaks reliably reflect the changes in the ecological integrity, and can be integrated with remote sensing as a tool for landscape management. Our results highlight the soundscape analysis as a feasible approach for the monitoring and conservation planning of acoustically unknown and threatened Andean landscapes.

AB  - It is often difficult to evaluate the level of contamination in small urban rivers because pollution is mainly diffuse, with low levels of numerous substances The use of a coupled approach using both chemical and biological measurements may provide an integrated evaluation of the impact of micro-pollution on the river Zebra mussels were transplanted along a metal and organic pollution gradient in spring 2008. For two months, mussels and water samples were collected from two sites every two weeks and analyzed for metal and PAH content as well as water physicochemical parameters Diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) were also used to assess levels of labile metals. Exposure of mussels to contaminants and potential impact were evaluated using physiological indices and various biomarkers including condition index (CI), defense mechanisms (glutathione-S-transferase: GST), digestive enzymes (amylase and cellulase) and genotoxicity (micronucleus test MN and comet assay CA). For most contaminants, the water contamination was significantly higher downstream. Bio-accumulation in zebra mussels was related to water contamination in the framework of the biodynamic model, which allowed us to take into account the biological dilution that was caused by the growth of soft tissue downstream Thus, metal influxes were on average two times higher downstream than upstream in particular for Zn, Cr, Cu and Cd. Significant differences in condition index were observed (final Cl was 0.42 +/- 0 03 downstream and 0 31 +/- 0.03 upstream) reflecting a better food availability downstream. Moreover a significant decrease of GST activity and digestive enzymes activity in the cristalline style was observed downstream Interpreting this decrease requires considering not only micro-pollution but also the trophic status related to the water's physicochemistry The MN test and the CA on gill cells highlighted genotoxicity in mussels transplanted downstream compared to upstream (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc Environ Toxicol 25 468-478, 2010

AB  - When biological metrics are combined into a multimetric index for bioassessment purposes, individual metrics must be scored as unitless numbers to be combined into a single index value. Among different multimetric indices, methods of scoring metrics may vary widely in the type of scaling used and the way in which metric expectations are established. These differences among scoring methods may influence the performance characteristics of the final index that is created by summing individual metric scores. The Macroinvertebrate Biotic Integrity Index (MBII), a multimetric index, was developed previously for first through third order streams in the Mid-Atlantic highlands of the United States. In this study, six metric scoring methods were evaluated for the MBII using measures related to site condition and index variability, including the degree of overlap between impaired and reference distributions, relationships to a stressor gradient, within-sample index variability, temporal variability, and the minimum detectable difference. Measures of index variability were affected to a greater degree than those of index responsiveness by both the type of scaling (discrete or continuous) and the method of setting expectations. A scoring method using continuous scaling and setting metric expectations using the 95th percentile of the entire distribution of sites performed the best overall for the MBII. These results showed that the method of scoring metrics affects the properties of the final index, particularly variability, and should be examined in developing a multimetric index because these properties can affect the number of condition classes (e.g., unimpaired, impaired) an index can distinguish.

AB  - Convective environments are known to be heterogeneous in both time and space, yet idealized models use fixed base-state environments to simulate storm evolution. Recently, the base-state substitution (BSS) technique was devised to account for environmental variability in a controlled manner while maintaining horizontal homogeneity; BSS involves updating the background environment to reflect a new storm-relative proximity sounding at a prescribed time interval. The study herein sought to assess the ability of BSS to more realistically represent the structure and evolution of an observed supercell thunderstorm in comparison to simulations with fixed base-state environments. An extended dual-Doppler dataset of an intensifying supercell thunderstorm in a varying inflow environment was compared to idealized simulations of the same storm; simulations included those with fixed background environments, as well as a BSS simulation that incorporated environmental variability continuously via tendencies to the base-state variables based on changes in a series of observed soundings. While the simulated supercells were generally more intense than what was measured in the observations, broad trends in reflectivity, vertical velocity, and vertical vorticity were more similar between the observed and BSS-simulated supercell; with a fixed environment, the supercell either shrunk in size and weakened over time, or grew upscale into a larger convective system. Quantitative comparisons examining distributions, areas, and volumes of vertical velocity and vorticity further confirm these differences. Overall, BSS provides a more realistic result, supporting the idea that a series of proximity soundings can sufficiently represent the effects of environmental variability, enhancing accuracy over fixed environments.

AB  - The ecological state of the Kiev Reservoir affected by intensive contamination as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in 1986 was assessed in terms of the species-indicators of epiphytic algae occurring in the fouling of higher aquatic plants. It has been found that inhabitants of slowly flowing and moderately warm waters, alkaliphiles, indifferent organisms in relation to water salinity, nitrogen-autotrophic taxa tolerating elevated concentrations of organically bound nitrogen, beta-mesosaprobionts and eurysaprobes (in relation to organic contamination) and eutraphentic organisms (indicators of the trophic state) prevailed in phytoepiphyton of the Kiev Reservoir. As a result of comparison of the original results with literature data obtained prior to the accident, it has been found that over a span of about 30 years (from the 1970s-1980s to 2010-2013), the taxonomic structure of phytoepiphyton remained almost unchanged. At the same time, the intensity of eutrophication, alkalization, and thermofication processes increased.

AB  - Limited information is available on trace element-water contamination and health risk assessment of small-scale intensive fish farming in low-income settings. Such information creates awareness among fish consumers, policy makers and the scientific community, regarding dietary exposure and health risks for not well-reported settings. The concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements in water, sediment and fish (T. rendalli, O. nitloticus and M. salmoides) were determined by spectrometry. The ecological and potential human health risks were assessed for Magobo dam, NE Zimbabwe, using the Hakanson ecological approach and the United States Environmental Protection Agency risk-assessment model, respectively. Concentrations in water and sediment appeared to increase in the order: cadmium<arsenic<lead. They restricted water use for irrigation and human consumption. The potential ecological risk factors for individual trace elements were below the index range for low risk. The potential ecological risk index for the dam (7.20) did not constitute ecological risk. The concentrations of trace elements in fish significantly varied with species, length and tissue (p<0.05). The concentrations of arsenic and lead in gills, liver and muscle for O. niloticus and arsenic in M. salmoides were greater than international maximum permissible limits for fish. The target cancer risk due to dietary exposure to arsenic in the three fish species was in the range 10(-6). There is no obvious cancer risk to the exposed population.

AB  - Two sites in North Wales, UK, were compared for growth, survival, immunocompetence and gonad development of Crassostrea gigas. Juvenile C. gigas spat were purchased as a cohort and placed in bags on trestles at the Menai Strait (MS, two heights on the shore) and the Inland Sea (IS) in the summer of 2003. Performance was examined as a function of several environmental parameters; temperature, coloured dissolved organic material absorption coefficient (cDOM), organic and inorganic nutrient levels, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton community composition. Both sites produced variations in growth, as assessed by dry weight indices and condition index, which were found to be lower at IS, where the animals were permanently immersed, than at MS, where they were emersed for at least 1 h/tide (at the low shore height) and 4 h/tide (at the high shore height) during spring tides. Condition index was also significantly higher at MS high shore than at MS low shore. Mortality was low at all sites, though an increase at IS at the end of the trial led to a significantly greater final percentage mortality of 15.6%. Gonad development was limited, particularly at IS where most animals remained undifferentiated. Gonad development was significantly higher at MS high shore than at MS low shore. cDOM, organic and inorganic nutrients were similar at the two areas. At IS the temperature and chlorophyll a levels were higher than MS. The phytoplankton communities were significantly different, with a bloom of Prorocentrum micans dominating at the Inland Sea for much of the experimental period. Differences in the hydrodynamics, as well as Phytoplankton community appeared to be the only parameters that might cause a lower growth rate in the Inland Sea. The possibilities of P. micans having a sub-lethal effect on C. gigas are discussed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to use an integrative approach to assess the ecological status of a small river impacted by multiple sources of disturbance. The River Febros (NW Portugal) is a small and highly impacted non-regulated river; approximately 44% of the watershed area is dedicated to agriculture, but there is also some urbanization. Environmental status was evaluated using a new multi-index approach, combining quality indices for water (Water Quality Index (WQI)), benthic macroinvertebrates (Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party Index (IBMWP)), and human modification (Riparian Forest Quality Index (QBR)); Ecological Status River Mediterranean Index (ECOSTRIMED); River Habitat Survey (RHS)). Surveys were carried out between October 2002 and 2003, along four stretches of the main course of the river for physicochemical characteristics, as well as water microbiology and macroinvertebrates. Water quality was poor at all sites (WQI averaged 30.4%) and decreased downstream. The RHS (assessment of instream habitats and the river corridor) and the QBR quantification displayed the same trend. Macroinvertebrates diversity was permanently low with only the most tolerant insects taxa present; oligochaetes dominated. The ecological status of River Febros was well represented using the experimental assessment system, where a downstream decrease in condition was noticeable (in spite of a lower water quality upstream). Our results emphasize the importance of assessing several components of disturbed ecosystems in order to ascertain overall quality and the importance of promoting improvement of the riparian gallery as a buffer against multiple agents of disturbance.

AB  - A multiple biomarker approach was adopted in a seasonal study carried out in the Lagoon of Venice, with the double aim of evaluating the natural and anthropic stresses influencing the biological responses of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and of assessing the effects due to spatial rather than temporal variations.
   Biochemical (aldehyde dehydrogenase and catalase activities), cellular (neutral red retention time) and physiological (survival in air and condition index) biomarkers were determined in mussels collected in four differently impacted lagoon areas.
   Multivariate analysis showed that samples were distributed mainly according to temperature and four seasonal groups were identified. The combination of spatial and temporal information enabled us to distinguish physiological variations due to natural causes from those due to anthropic stress, and to identify the sampling period when several biomarkers are less influenced by both natural and endogenous factors.

AB  - We developed a rapid multimetric index using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of ecological conditions for the Bolivian Altiplano streams. A total of 64 taxa and 30 environmental variables were collected from 29 sampled sites. After identifying redundant metrics through Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and considering practical application criteria, four biological attributes were selected to compose the Altiplano Integrity Benthic Index (AIBI): Genus richness, Filter-Collector, Gatherer-Collector, and Swimmer groups. The sensitivity of the index was tested in 17 rivers using a Co-Inertia Analysis (CoIA), and its first axis of analysis was strongly correlated to the new AIBI scores (r = 0.8, p < 0.001). At Pacajes Rivers, the macroinvertebrate Gatherers-Collector group was common in organic pollution sites and the Swimmer group with hydraulic disturbance sites. In contrast, the Scraper group becomes a specific group for the reference conditions. The AIBI responded to environmental variables associated with a gradient of human disturbance affecting the running freshwater's ecological condition. The proposed index could allow the structuration a biomonitoring program.

AB  - Asari (=Manila) clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is the second bivalve mollusc in terms of production in the world and, in many coastal areas, can beget important socio-economic issues. In Europe, this species was introduced after 1973. In Arcachon Bay, after a decade of aquaculture attempt, Asari clam rapidly constituted neo-naturalized population which is now fished. However, recent studies emphasized the decline of population and individual performances. In the framework of a national project (REPAMEP), some elements of fitness, stressors and responses in Arcachon Bay were measured and compared to international data (41 publications, 9 countries). The condition index (CI = flesh weight/shell weight) was the lowest among all compared sites. Variation in average Chla concentration explained 30% of variation of CI among different areas. Among potential diseases, perkinsosis was particularly prevalent in Arcachon Bay, with high abundance, and Asari clams underwent Brown Muscle Disease, a pathology strictly restricted to this lagoon. Overall element contamination was relatively low, although arsenic, cobalt, nickel and chromium displayed higher values than in other ecosystems where Asari clam is exploited. Finally, total hemocyte count (THC) of Asari clam in Arcachon Bay, related to the immune system activity, exhibited values that were also under what is generally observed elsewhere. In conclusion, this study, with all reserves due to heterogeneity of available data, suggest that the particularly low fitness of Asari clam in Arcachon Bay is due to poor trophic condition, high prevalence and intensity of a disease (perkinsosis), moderate inorganic contamination, and poor efficiency of the immune system.

AB  - Widespread and long-lasting drought disasters can aggravate environmental degradation. They can lead to significant economic losses and even affect social stability. The existing drought index mostly chose arid and semi-arid regions as study areas, because cloudy weather in humid and semi-humid regions hindered the satellite in its attempts to obtain the surface reflectivity. In order to solve this problem, a cloudy region drought index (CRDI) is proposed to estimate the drought of the clouded pixels. Due to the cumulative effect of drought, the antecedent drought index (ADI) has a certain impact on the calculation of the current drought. Furthermore, cloud is the only source of natural precipitation, and it also affects the evaporation and emission process on the ground. Therefore, based on the remote sensing drought index, ADI and cloud optical thickness (COT) are used to estimate the drought of pixels with missing data due to cloud occlusion. In this paper, a case study of the cloudy Guangdong, which is located in a humid area, is presented. First, we calculated the CRDI using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2003 to 2017, and then discussed the effect of CRDI with the data from 2016 as examples. Through the analysis of the parameters of regression equation, filling efficiency, rationality of the estimated value, the continuity of CRDI and the rationality of CRDI spatial distribution results, it is concluded that CRDI can effectively estimate the drought severity of the cloud-covered pixels, and more comprehensive drought data can be obtained by using CRDI. The successful application of CRDI in Guangdong shows it is robust and flexible, suggesting high efficiency and great potential for further utilization.

AB  - Body condition of animals influences the likelihood of surviving harsh environmental conditions, successfully reproducing, and resisting disease. The sum of these individual components of fitness, in turn, have consequences for the growth and persistence of wildlife populations. Here we compared the body mass and condition of adult female arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii plesius (Osgood, 1900)), an obligate hibernator, in source and sink habitats. We tested the hypothesis that adult females would be in poorer condition in the boreal forest than in adjacent meadows. We found that, during spring, postpartum females in forests weighed less (405 +/- 7 vs. 437 +/- 11 g; mean +/- SE) and were in poorer condition (mean (+/- SE) residual of mass over structural size = -11.0 +/- 10.2 vs. 20.5 +/- 6.1 g) compared with females in meadow-source habitat. However, by the onset of entrance into hibernation in August, forest squirrels had reached parity with meadow squirrels and no difference was found in mass (519 +/- 13 vs. 520 +/- 15 g; mean +/- SE) or condition (residual index = -0.01 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.01; mean +/- SE). We suggest that for squirrels in formerly occupied boreal forests, (i) poor spring body condition decreased reproductive success and (ii) achieving compensatory growth, via increased foraging, comes at the costs of higher predation risk. These costs likely contributed to the recent local extinction of arctic ground squirrels in boreal forest habitat.

AB  - The filtration activity of cultured mussels may exert a strong control on phytoplankton populations. Given that phytoplankton constitutes the base of marine food webs, carrying capacity in shellfish aquaculture sites has been commonly studied in terms of phytoplankton depletion. However, spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton concentration in coastal areas present a methodological constraint for using phytoplankton depletion as an indicator in monitoring programs, and necessitates intensive field campaigns. The main goal of this study is to explore the potential of different bivalve performance indices for use as alternatives to phytoplankton depletion as cost-effective indicators of carrying capacity. For that, a fully spatial hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model of Tracadie Bay, an intensive mussel culture embayment located in Prince of Edward Island (Canada), has been constructed and scenario building has been used to explore the relationship between phytoplankton depletion and bivalve performance. Our underlying premise is that overstocking of bivalves leads to increased competition for food resources, i.e. phytoplankton, which may ultimately have a significant effect on bivalve growth rate and performance. Following this working hypothesis, the relationships among bay-scale phytoplankton depletion and three bivalve physiological indices, one static, condition index, and two dynamic, tissue mass and shell length growth rates, have been simulated. These three metrics present methodological advantages compared to phytoplankton depletion for incorporation into monitoring programs. Although significant correlations among phytoplankton depletion and the three physiological indices have been observed, shell length growth rate is shown as the most sensitive indicator of carrying capacity, followed by tissue mass growth rate and then by condition index. These results demonstrate the potentiality of using bivalve physiological measurements in monitoring programs as indicators of ecosystem status. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We utilized landscape and breeding bird assemblage data from three Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes sampled from 1965-1995 to develop and test a grassland integrity index (GII) in a mixed-grass prairie area of Oklahoma. The overall study region is extensively fragmented from long-term agricultural activity, and native habitat remnants have been degraded by recent encroachment of woody vegetation, namely eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.). The 50 individual bird survey points along the BBS routes, known as stops, were used as sample sites. Our process first focused on developing a grassland disturbance index (GDI) as a measure of cumulative landscape disturbances for these sites. The GDI was based on five key landscape variables identified in an earlier species-level study of long-term avian community dynamics: total tree, shrub, and herbaceous vegetation cover indices, overall mean landscape patch size, and grassland patch core size. The GII was then developed based on breeding bird assemblage data. Assemblages were based on commonly used response guilds reflective of five avian life history parameters: foraging mode/location, nesting location, habitat specificity, migratory pattern, and dietary guild. We tested the response of 78 candidate assemblage metrics to the GDI, and eliminated those with no or poor response or with high correlations (redundant), resulting in 13 metrics for use in the final index. Individual metric scores were scaled to fall between 0 and 10, and the cumulative index to range from 0 to 100. Although broader application and refinement are possible, the avian-based GII has an advantage over labor-intensive, habitat-based monitoring in that the GII is derived from readily available long-term BBS data. Therefore, the GII shows promise as an inexpensive tool that could easily be applied over other areas to monitor changes in regional grassland conditions.

AB  - An existing version of a fish assemblage-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the streams and rivers of west central Mexico was tested with independent data to validate its usefulness as a measure of ecosystem quality and to determine the geographic area where it is effective. Fish assemblages from 63 upland sites in 10 basins in central Mexico ( Armeria, Ameca, Coahuayana, Marabasco, Purificacion, Grande de Morelia, Grande de Santiago, Lerma, Balsas and Panuco) were assessed using the metrics and scoring criteria from the existing IBI and then compared with independent evaluations of habitat and water quality. IBI scores were congruent with habitat and water quality values in the Armeria, Purificacion and Marabasco basins, where the IBI was first developed, as well as in the adjacent Ameca and Coahuayana basins. We conclude that the IBI can be used without modification to assess environmental quality in non-coastal streams and rivers within these five basins. Further data are needed from the Grande de Morelia, Grande de Santiago and middle Lerma basins, but our results suggest that the existing IBI may also be effective here. However, the existing IBI does not consistently reflect habitat and water quality conditions in the Balsas and Panuco basins and must be modified before it can be applied there. Necessary modifications in the Balsas basin appear to be small and related primarily to changes in the scoring criteria for metrics. However, in the Panuco basin more substantive changes in the nature of the metrics are required. Changes in the IBI for these basins are proposed. The IBI is now validated for use in river monitoring, conservation and restoration efforts in 5 basins in west central Mexico and suggestions for its application in other basins are available here.
