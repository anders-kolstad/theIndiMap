AB  - The Haihe River Basin is a semiarid water resources area of China. River ecosystem was degraded for high population density and intensive water resources development activities. To assist in the improvement of the ecological integrity of this river ecosystem, an environmental flow assessment model was developed that consider both spatial structure and dominant eco-function parameters. River ecosystem was divided into three sub-ecosystems which including river reach, wetland and estuary based on the spatial structure of river ecosystem. River reach was divided into three types which including habitat restoration type (HR), water quality restoration type (WQR) and vegetation restoration substitute water quantity restoration type (VRSWQR) according to their dominant eco-function. The spatio-temporal distribution of environmental flow (EF) for the river ecosystem in the Haihe River Basin was assessed based on the model. The results indicate that the EF for the river reach, wetland, and estuary are 2.267, 1.532, and 0.972 billion m(3), respectively. The EF for HR type of river reach, the WQR type of river reach and VRSWQR type of river reach are 1.140, 1.138, and 0.154 billion m(3), which are equal to 4.320, 4.312, and 0.584 % of the average annual flow of 26.39 billion m(3), respectively. EF for river ecosystem in wet period (June-September), normal period (October-January) and dry period (February-May) are 2.999, 0.951, and 0.821 billion m(3), respectively. Annual EF for river ecosystem of the Basin are 4.771 billion m(3), which accounts for 18 % of the average annual flows of 26.39 billion m(3).

AB  - In this paper, a risk-based optimization methodology for a maintenance schedule considering Process Variables (PVs), is developed within the framework of asset integrity assessment. To this end, an integration of Dynamic Bayesian Network, Damage Modelling and sensitivity analysis are implemented to clarify the behaviour of failure probability, considering the exogenous undisciplinable perturbations. Discrete time case is considered through measuring or observing the PVs. Decision configurations and utility nodes are defined inside the network to represent maintenance activities and their associated costs. The regression analysis is considered to model the impact of perturbations on PVs for future applications. The developed methodology is applied to a case study of Chemical Plant (Natural Gas Regulating and Metering Stations). To demonstrate the applicability of the methodology, three cases of seasonal observations of specific PV (pressure) are considered. The proposed methodology could either analyse the failure based on precursor data of PVs or obtain the optimum maintenance schedule based on actual condition of the systems.

AB  - Large European floodplain rivers have a great diversity in habitats and fish fauna, but tend to be heavily modified. The complexity of these river systems and their multiple human impacts pose considerable challenges for assessment of their ecological status. This paper discusses: (1) the application of historical information on fish fauna and habitat availability to describe reference conditions; (2) responses of fish assemblages to human disturbance by comparing various rivers and river segments with different impacts and/or time series within rivers; (3) the role of floodplain water bodies in ecological assessment; and (4) monitoring of large rivers using different gears and sampling designs for main channels and floodplain habitats. The challenge for the future is to standardise and calibrate sampling methods and data to enhance the potential for ecological assessment of large rivers.

AB  - The impact of agricultural land use on the composition and structure of aquatic insect assemblages (i.e., taxa of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera (EPTC)) was investigated in tributary streams of the Garonne river basin, southern France. The self-organizing map (SOM) method was applied to compare both instream environmental conditions and EPTC assemblages between forest and agricultural streams. According to the SOM model, the study sites were classified into three main clusters corresponding to distinct EPTC assemblages. The SOM cluster associated with most of the agricultural sites had lower EPTC species richness and diversity. This cluster was also characterized by high levels of total dissolved solids, nitrate (NO3), and chemical oxygen demand. Overall, our study shows that agricultural streams when compared with forest streams had lower biological integrity. In accordance with the European Water Framework Directive, our results indicate that the sites most impacted by agricultural land use should be restored and that the least-impacted forest sites could serve as reference conditions.

TI  - Design of Independent Type-B LNG Fuel Tank: Comparative Study between Finite Element Analysis and International Guidance
T2  - ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - In 2012, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulated the emissions of SOx and NOx by setting the emission control area and strengthened the regulations on ship building and operation. Because the environmental regulations have been reinforced, there has been a drastic increase in LNG-fueled ships. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out systematic research on the design of the LNG fuel tank, which is one of the important components of LNG fuel supply systems. In this study, aiming to design a type-B LNG fuel tank used in the real structure, a procedure for structural integrity assessment considering the International Gas Carrier (IGC) Code was proposed. A 10,000 TEU containership was chosen as an operating vessel, and independent type-B tank was selected as an LNG fuel tank. Structural integrity was evaluated by applying a systematic procedure based on the IGC Code. A series of finite element analysis was conducted under the various design loads and operating conditions. Fatigue life and fatigue damage were calculated using the numerical results obtained from transient thermal-structural analysis and fatigue analysis to provide the safety level of the design scheme.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) has been recognized as a useful tool for evaluating wetland condition and guiding conservation and management efforts. However, FQA validation to confirm that results represent actual wetland condition is limited. Moreover, FQA has been applied across large regions without consideration for the high environmental variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and topography) within application areas, which may limit the effectiveness of FQA as an assessment tool. Because Oklahoma contains diverse ecoregions and extreme environmental gradients, this provides an opportunity to examine the influence of spatial and environmental variability on FQA results. We sampled 68 depressional wetlands dispersed across the state to (1) validate an FQA metric, Floristic Quality Index (FQI), with two established condition assessment methods (i.e., Landscape Development Intensity Index [LDI] and Oklahoma Rapid Assessment Method [OKRAM]) and (2) evaluate the influence of environmental variation (e.g., high and low precipitation) on FQI scores. In our validation analysis, we found a strong positive relationship between FQI and OKRAM, indicating the FQI was able to detect changes in wetland condition in depressional wetlands along a disturbance gradient. Additionally, strong negative relationships between FQI and LDI suggest that FQI is responsive to stressors within the surrounding landscape. When evaluating environmental influence on FQI scores, we found substantial variation between reference wetlands based on location, with higher scores occurring in eastern sites (high precipitation) and lower scores occurring in western sites (low precipitation). We used Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to assess the relationship between plant communities and environmental variables, and found that precipitation was more indicative of plant species distribution than wetland condition (i.e., disturbed or reference condition). Thus, C-values of plant species (i.e., predetermined values assigned to individual plant species) and corresponding FQI scores differed significantly across ecoregions based on high and low precipitation, regardless of wetland condition. This phenomenon highlights the importance of considering regional environmental differences when developing FQI thresholds for wetland assessments, especially across diverse states or ecoregions. To reduce the influence of regional differences on FQIs, as well as other vegetation-based methods, condition class thresholds and reference criteria should be established based on ecoregions to more accurately capture wetland condition using FQI.

AB  - 1. Management of running waters and assessment of water quality trends require the use of biological methods. Among potential indicators, fish assemblages are of particular interest because of their ability to integrate environmental variability at different spatial scales.
   2. The French Water Agencies and the Ministry of the Environment initiated a research programme to develop a fish-based index that would be applicable nation-wide. Such an index should encompass the relative importance of geographic, ecoregional and local factors influencing the distribution of riverine fishes.
   3. An effective way of using the information available from fish assemblages to establish such an index is through the use of the 'reference condition approach' which involves testing a fish assemblage exposed to a potential stress against a reference condition that is unexposed to such a stress.
   4. Logistic regression procedures were applied, using a fish data set of 650 reference sites fairly evenly distributed across French rivers and defined by some easily measured regional and local characteristics, to elaborate the simplest possible response model that adequately explains the observed patterns of occurrence for each species of a fish assemblage at a given site of any given river. This allows us to predict a 'theoretical' assemblage at a site.
   5. The models were validated using a second independent data set of 88 reference sites. Using a third data set of 88 disturbed sites, the observed assemblages were then compared against the reference condition as defined by the 'theoretical' assemblages. The amount of deviation between the expected and observed assemblages within these sites is used as a measure of degradation.
   6. This approach could be used as a framework for adapting and calibrating a multi-metric index, thereby serving as a practical technical reference for conducting cost-effective biological assessments of lotic systems.

AB  - Although different organisms and metrics are used in aquatic ecosystem assessment, deciding which organism group(s) or community level to apply tends to be based on the local level of taxonomic expertise, rather than the discriminatory power or precision of a given response to specific stressors. We compare the response of two different organism groups (fish and invertebrates) and ecological traits (fish guilds and invertebrate traits) to putative stress gradients, using northern Portuguese rivers as a case study. The rivers covered a quality gradient ranging from reference conditions to high levels of disturbance across classes of ecological status within designated Water Framework Directive monitoring networks. We tested three hypotheses: 1) Ecological traits respond better to regional level human impacts (e.g. land use), while taxa better respond to local factors (e.g. habitat changes or water quality); 2) Invertebrate traits or fish guilds respond to a wider range of anthropogenic disturbances compared to taxa and are not as strongly affected by temporal variation; 3) these two communities respond differently along the studied gradients.
   We used canonical correspondence analyses, including partial correspondence analysis and principal response curves to analyze change in composition and metrics and the relative contribution of environmental variables for each biological data set. We carried out analyses between sites and along a temporal gradient, complemented by linkage trees and logistic regressions. Conclusions are more complex than the formulated hypotheses. Although both invertebrate and fish communities revealed a similar ability to assess impairment, invertebrates responded more strongly to local disturbances, whereas the fish composition or traits/guilds were more sensitive to larger scale variation. Results for temporal variation analyses suggested that invertebrate traits more accurately detected change in environmental factors but variation in the taxonomic composition of fish species also followed a temporal gradient. Differences on community response reinforce the importance of a combined approach, using types of community data, to detect environmental impacts.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the natural flow regime of most rivers has been significantly altered influencing the ecological integrity and functioning of river ecosystems. Especially in the Mediterranean region, irrigated agriculture is Considered one of the most important drivers of hydro-morphological modifications in river systems. In this study we employ the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) methodology for the Pinios River and its tributaries, located in a Mediterranean catchment in central Greece, with the purpose to assess the natural flow regime under a simulated no-agriculture scenario and compare with the current situation. The work is based on the use of the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model for the-simulation of long time series of daily stream flows, which were analyzed under the actual conditions (baseline), and the hypothetical scenario. The key characteristics of the flow regime projected under each model run were assessed through the implementation of the IHA methodology that utilizes a number of indicators to characterize the intra- and inter-annual variability in the hydrologic conditions. The results of this study revealed that without agricultural activities in the catchment, annual and monthly flows would increase, with significant alterations in the flow characteristics of the winter months, and much smaller in summer. However, the analysis showed that the frequency of droughts and low flow summer events would be smaller. The article provides a comprehensive and easy-to-implement methodology that can facilitate the impact assessment of agricultural human activities on river flow variability under the typical Mediterranean conditions, allowing experimentation on setting river flow thresholds required for a good ecological status within the context of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - A range of biodiversity metrics are available to assess the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. However, performance varies considerably among different types of metrics and provides different information regarding ecosystem conditions, thus making difficult the selection of appropriate metrics for biomonitoring. The present study evaluated the robustness of six biodiversity metrics to assess environmental change and determine their utility as relevant indicators of ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. Traditional metrics such as species richness and Shannon diversity were considered along with alternative metrics such as functional diversity, size diversity and taxonomic distinctness. To that end, invertebrate assemblages in a river floodplain were used as a case study to evaluate the performance of metrics using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). GAM explained between eight and 49% of the variability in biodiversity. The regression models exhibited differences in the response of biodiversity indicators to environmental factors, suggesting that intermediate levels of turbidity and low salinity are conditions favouring increased biodiversity in the study area. Based on correlations among metrics and responses to primary environmental factors, it is concluded that Shannon and functional diversity, and rarefied species richness generated similar information regarding ecosystem conditions (i.e., the metrics were redundant): while size diversity and distinctness provided useful additional data characterizing ecosystem quality (i.e., the metrics were complementary). Functional diversity indicated riot only number and dominance of species, but also each species functional role in the community, and was therefore the most informative biodiversity metric. Nevertheless, the use of a combination of metrics, for example functional and size diversity, and variation in taxonomic distinctness, provides complementary data that will serve to achieve a more thorough understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and response to primary environmental influences.

AB  - The Oconee River in middle Georgia, U.S.A., has been regulated by the Sinclair Dam since 1953. Since then, the habitat of the lower Oconee River has been altered and the river has become more incised. The altered environmental conditions of the Oconee River may limit the success of various fish populations. Some obligate riverine fishes may be good indicator species for assessing river system integrity because they are intolerant to unfavourable conditions. For example, many sucker species require clean gravel for feeding, and reproduction. Further, age-0 fishes are more vulnerable than adults to flow alterations because of their limited ability to react to such conditions. In this study, we investigated the relationship between abundance and growth of age-0 carpsuckers to river discharge in the Oconee River. A beach seine was used to collect age-0 carpsuckers (Carpiodes spp.) from littoral zones of the lower Oconee River from May through July of 1995 to 2001. Regression models were used to assess whether 12 river discharge categories (e.g. peak, low, seasonal flows) influenced age-0 carpsucker abundance or instantaneous growth. Our analysis indicated that abundance of age-0 carpsuckers was significantly negatively related to number of days river discharge was >85 M-3 s(-1)(r(2) = 0.61, p = 0.04). Estimates of instantaneous growth ranged from 0.10 to 0.90. Instantaneous growth rates were significantly positively related to summer river discharge (r(2) = 0.95, p <0.0 1). These results suggest that (1) moderate flows during spawning and rearing are important for producing strong-year classes of carpsuckers, and (2) river discharge is variable among years, with suitable flows for strong year-classes of carpsuckers occurring every few years. River management should attempt to regulate river discharge to simulate historic flows typical for the region when possible. Such an approach is best achieved when regional climatic conditions are considered. Published in 2007 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Grey cast iron water pipe networks have been installed around the world, often 100-180 years ago. Cohorts (which can be defined by age, size, casting technology and geographical location, to specify but a few groups) degrade at different rates due to environmental and in-service issues, which can lead to a significant loss in mechanical performance. Hence, the management of these assets can be extremely problematic in terms of identifying priorities. The current paper considers the causes of such degradation, the consequences for defining accurate and up-to-date condition assessment protocols and hence the type and urgency of rehabilitation strategies. It follows that understanding the integrity/life expectancy of water networks requires non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of large-diameter cast iron trunk mains, with particular reference to the kinds of defects that are likely to be present and the issues that make assessment difficult. From this, recommendations are outlined for asset managers required to specify NDE protocols, based on an understanding of the nature of the material and conditions in the field.

AB  - There is an increasing need globally to establish relationships among flow, ecology, and livelihoods to make informed decisions about environmental flows. This paper aimed to establish the ecological foundation for a holistic environmental flow assessment method in the Gumara River that flows into Lake Tana in Ethiopia and the Blue Nile River. First, the ecological conditions (fish, macro-invertebrate, riparian vegetation, and physicochemical) of the river system were characterized, followed by determining the hydrological condition and finally linking the ecological and hydrological components. The ecological data were collected at 30 sites along the Gumara River on March 2016 and 2020. River hydrology was estimated using the SWAT model and showed that the low flow decreased over time. Both physico-chemical and macroinvertebrate scores showed that water quality was moderate in most locations. The highest fish diversity index was in the lower reach at Wanzaye. Macroinvertebrate diversity was observed to decrease downstream. Both the fish and macroinvertebrate diversity indices were less than the expected maximum, being 3.29 and 4.5, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 30 m and 60 m buffer distances from the river decreased during the dry season (March-May). Hence, flow conditions, water quality, and land-use change substantially influenced the abundance and diversity of fish, vegetation, and macroinvertebrate species. The pressure on the ecology is expected to increase because the construction of the proposed dam is expected to alter the flow regime. Thus, as demand for human water consumption grows, measures are needed, including quantification of environmental flow requirements and regulating river water uses to conserve the ecological status of the Gumara River and Lake Tana sub-basin.

AB  - Marine zooplankton are central components of holistic ecosystem assessments due to their intermediary role in the food chain, linking the base of the food chain with higher trophic levels. As a result, these organisms incorporate the inherent properties and changes occurring atall levels of the marine ecosystem, temporally integrating signatures of physical and chemical conditions. For this reason, zooplankton-based biometrics are widely accepted as useful tools for assessing and monitoring the ecological health and integrity of aquatic systems. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU-MSFD) requires the use of different types of biomonitors, including zooplankton, to monitor progress towards achieving specific environmental and water quality targets in EU. However, there is currently no comprehensive synthesis of zooplankton indices development, use, and associated challenges. We addressed this issue with a two-step approach. First, we formulated the indicator-metrics-indices cycle (IMIC) to redefine the closely related but often ambiguously utilized terms - indicator, metric and index, highlighting the convergence between them and the iterative nature of their interaction. Secondly, we formulated frameworks for synthesizing, presenting and systematically applying zooplankton indices based on the IMIC framework. The main benefits of the IMIC are twofold: 1). to disambiguate the key elements: indicators, metrics, and indices, revealing their links to an operational ecological indicator system, and 2) to serve as an organizing tool for the coherent classification of indices according to the MSFD descriptors. Using the IMIC framework, we identified and described two broad categories of indices namely the core biodiversity indices already in use in the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic regions, including the 'Zooplankton Mean Size and Total Stock (zooplankton MSTS)' and 'Plankton Lifeforms index (PLI)', and stressorresponse indices retrieved from the existing literature, elucidating their applicability to different MSFD descriptors. Finally, major challenges of developing new indices and applying existing ones in the context of the MSFD were critically addressed and some solutions were proposed.

AB  - Effective assessment of ecological quality in aquatic ecosystems has become an important issue for researchers and environmental managers worldwide. The potential of thermodynamic oriented ecological indicators in environmental assessment and management was tested and compared with diversity measures in three tropical reservoirs located in the basin of the Paraopeba River, Minas Gerais State-Brazil. We computed Eco-Exergy based indices (Eco-Exergy and Specific Eco-Exergy) and the Margalef and Shannon-Wiener indices and tested differences in their responses to change in benthic communities across reservoirs characterised by different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. Indices were estimated based on biotic descriptors (macrofauna biomass, composition, and abundance) and their values analysed against abiotic descriptors (pH, conductivity, transparency, turbidity, nutrients concentration, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and total dissolved solids). The Margalef index showed significant differences between reference and impacted sites, with the highest values in the former type of sites, (Pseudo F-2.719 = 24.506, p = 0.001), while the Shannon-Wiener index values showed no significant differences between reference and impacted sites. Eco-Exergy values were significantly higher at stations located in more disturbed sites (Pseudo F-2.719 = 80.319, p = 0.001), but Specific Eco-Exergy did not show really significant differences between disturbed and non-disturbed sites, although values were higher in the non-disturbed sites type. This might be explained by the fact that opportunistic tolerant species present high biomass values in polluted sites, since Eco-Exergy values may vary due to changes in biomass or information. On the other hand, differences in information between disturbed and non-disturbed sites were more subtle (although the number of species was higher in the less disturbed sites, it was not clearly reflected in Specific Eco-Exergy values). Our results suggest that thermodynamic oriented indicators can capture coherent structural changes in biological communities, highlighting its indicator potential for assessing the ecological condition/integrity of highly modified water bodies, such as reservoirs.

AB  - The first major offshore oil and gas production facility went into service in the North Sea over two decades ago. Offshore structures in hostile environments like the North Sea are subjected to time-dependent local damage such as corrosion and fatigue. To ensure safe operations, the integrity of these components needs to be maintained in service. This is achieved by carrying out planned nondestructive inspection coupled with structural integrity assessments. The inspections are not an entirely reliable process, however. There are also many uncertainties involved in the fatigue integrity calculations. In order to take these uncertainties into account, reliability-based assessment can be used. This paper summarizes the recent development of reliability-based fatigue initiation and fracture mechanics (crack growth) analyses for the in-service assessment of the integrity of offshore structural components. The techniques are illustrated with two specific forms of structural connection: welded tubular joints and threaded (screw type) joints. Related practical issues, including the reliability of non-destructive inspection (NDI) and the considerations of targeting maintenance resources, are also discussed.

AB  - Over the past two decades of refinement and application of instream flow evaluations, we have examined the hydraulic habitat of aquatic macroinvertebrates in a variety of conditions, along with the role of these macroinvertebrates in sustaining ecosystem integrity. Instream flow analyses assume that predictable changes in channel flow characteristics can, in turn, be used to predict the change in the density or distribution of lotic species or, more appropriately, the availability of useable habitat for those species. Five major hydraulic conditions most affect the distribution and ecological success of lotic biota: suspended load, bedload movement, and water column effects, such as turbulence, velocity profile, and substratum interactions (near-bed hydraulics). The interactions of these hydraulic conditions upon the morphology and behavior of the individual organisms govern the distribution of aquatic biota. Historically, management decisions employing the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) have focused upon prediction of available habitat for life stages of target fish species. Regulatory agencies have rarely included evaluation of benthos for flow reservations. Although 'taxonomic discomfort' may be cited for the reluctant use or creation of benthic criteria, we suggest that a basic misunderstanding of the links between benthic macroinvertebrate and the fish communities is still a problem. This is derived from the lack of a perceived 'value' that can be assigned to macroinvertebrate species. With the exception of endangered mussel species (for which PHABSIM analysis is probably inappropriate), this is understandable. However, it appears that there is a greater ability to predict macroinvertebrate distribution (that is, a response to the change in habitat quality or location) and diversity without complex population models. Also, habitat suitability criteria for water quality indicator taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera; the so-called 'EPTs') may also provide additional management options to stream regulators. The greatest application for macroinvertebrate criteria will be in low-order streams where a more immediate link to fish communities can be established. We present an example from Queens Creek, in North Carolina, USA, in which monthly allocations required to preserve the integrity of the benthic macroinvertebrate community were significantly higher than for the target benthic fish species, Cottus bairdi. In the months when both Cottus and community diversity of macroinvertebrates were the 'bottleneck' life stages, preservation of only fish species could result in an additional 5-25% loss in macroinvertebrate habitat. We suggest that, as there becomes an increased emphasis on maintaining macroinvertebrates as monitors of stream health, there will be a concurrent emphasis on incorporating hydraulic habitat conditions as a part of bioassessment.

AB  - Information on both structure and functions is essential to evaluate the ecological integrity of stream ecosystems and their response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Leaf-bags have been widely employed to assess stream ecosystem processes and the degree of leaf mass consumption has been proposed as one of the most useful functional descriptor in aquatic environments. However, the breakdown rate of leaves has been compared with structural indicators of macroinvertebrate assemblages derived from leaf-bags or from benthic samples, without any direct comparison on the characteristics of communities sampled with the two methods. The main objective of the paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of the structure, functional organization and biological traits of macroinvertebrate assemblages from artificial leaf packs and from benthic samples of a third-order stream in the Central Apennines (Italy).
   Of the 43 macroinvertebrate taxa globally found in our survey, 9 showed low ability or scarce attitude to colonize leaf-bags, while 6 rare taxa were exclusively sampled in artificial leaf packs. Both assemblages were characterized by the dominance of Chironomidae, though they were more abundant in leaf-bags (71% of total individuals collected) than in benthic samples (44%). Conversely, the mayfly Baetis sp. comprised more than 17% of total individuals collected with Surber nets and only 5% of leaf-bag assemblages. We found that compared to benthic assemblages, leaf-bag communities were less diversified with a lower richness and a lower number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera (EPT) taxa; significant differences also emerged in assemblage composition.
   Contrary to what expected, artificial leaf packs resulted not particularly attractive for shredder organisms and were mainly colonized by collectors. Also the biological trait profiles of the leaf-bag community were significantly different from those shared by resident benthic taxa.
   Our findings could have profound implications in the assessment of the structural and functional integrity of stream ecosystems and in studies on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In these studies, the two methods (leaf-bags and Surber nets) should be regarded as complementary and not alternative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Membrane damage is a hallmark of both biotic and abiotic stress responses. The membrane determines the ability of a cell to sustain altered environmental conditions and hence can be used as a biomarker to assess stress-induced cell damage or death. We present an easy, quick, cost-effective, staining and spectrophotometric method to assess membrane stability of plant cells. In this method, Evan's blue, an azo dye, is used to assay for cell viability. More specifically, Evan's blue dye can penetrate through ruptured or destabilized membranes and stain cells. Thus, when plant cells are subjected to stress that compromises membrane integrity, the number of cells that are permeated by Evan's blue dye will be increased compared to control cells that are not stressed. In contrast, live, healthy cells that are capable of maintaining membrane integrity do not take up Evan's blue dye. Cells that have taken up Evan's blue dye will have an accumulation of a blue protoplasmic stain and these stained cells can be qualitatively documented under bright field microscopy with or without the use of a camera. Furthermore, the dye can be extracted from cells that are stained by Evan's blue dye and can be quantified spectrophotometrically. Using this analysis, the accumulation of dye in positively-stained cells correlates with the extent of cell membrane damage and thus the amount of cells that are stained with Evan's blue dye under various conditions can be used as an indicator of cellular stress.

AB  - In a field study carried out in 2011 and 2014 adult dragonflies were identified as a rapid and easy-to-use means of assessing habitat quality and biological integrity of Mediterranean streams and rivers in the province of Barcelona (Region Catalonia, Iberian Peninsula). The study included sampling sites from five different river catchments: Bess, Foix, Llobregat, Ter and Tordera. Multivariate statistical procedures and indicator species analysis were used to investigate the relationship between river ecological status, study sites and dragonfly species or species assemblages' occurrence. The dragonfly association identified with western Mediterranean permanent streams, i.e. Cordulegaster boltonii, Boyeria irene, Onychogomphus uncatus and Calopteryx virgo meridionalis, was found only at the sites with the highest status. All these taxa were identified as indicator species of sites with the best scores for the macroinvertebrate based IBMWP index and for the combined IASPT index, which reflects the sensitivity of the macroinvertebrate families present to environmental changes; besides, B. irene and C. virgo meridionalis also proved to be indicator species of the riparian forest quality index and C. boltonii of the more inclusive ECOSTRIMED, which assesses the overall conservation status of the riverine habitats. The information obtained on habitat preferences and indicator value showed that adults of these taxa may constitute a valuable tool for preliminary or complementary cost-effective monitoring of river status and restoration practices as part of a broader set of indices reflecting biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The impact of acid mine drainage (AMD) on a regional stream was evaluated using chemical analysis, biotic/ecological integrity (IBI), and habitat assessments along with the necropsy-based tissue analysis. In situ remediation tests were conducted for wastewater treatment using waste oyster shells. Monsoon rains caused the sloughing of AMD sediments, resulting in high acidity and turbidity. Friedman's two-way ANOVA showed that IBI values were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the AMD-impactecl sites than in the control and had an inverse relationship with pH. Tissue analysis revealed that all of the treatments, T1-T3, caused significant tissue damage (ANOVA; F = 11.949, p < 0.008), compared to the control. The in situ water treatment plant neutralized acid and removed 85-99% of Fe, Al, and Zn ions (chi(2) = 4.0-11.1, p < 0.05). Together, these approaches may be used as a key methodology for the integrative assessment and treatment of AMD-impacted water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since early studies about aquatic ecology, it has been found that changes in environmental conditions alter aquatic insect communities. Based on this, the combined study of environmental conditions and aquatic insect communities has become an important tool to monitor and manage freshwater systems. However, there is no consensus about which environmental predictors and facets of diversity are more useful for environmental monitoring. The objective of this work was to conduct a scientometric analysis to identify the main environmental predictors and biological groups used to monitor and manage lotic freshwater systems. We conducted a scientometric study on the Web of Science platform using the following words: stream, river, aquatic insect, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Heteroptera, Chironomidae, bioindicator, environmental change, anthropic, and land use. Although most of the environmental predictors employed are local, intrinsic of freshwater systems using local environmental and associated landscape variables is a better strategy to predict aquatic insect communities. The facets of diversity most used are composition and richness of species and genera, which are not efficient at measuring the loss of ecosystem services and extinction of phylogenetic lineages. Although very important, these functional and phylogenetic facets are poorly explored for this purpose. Even though tropical regions are the most diverse globally and are experiencing major losses of native vegetation, these ecosystems are the least studied, a knowledge gap that needs addressing to better understand the effect of anthropogenic activities on the diversity of aquatic insects.

AB  - The lack of specificity of pesticides used for control of various organisms, even if efforts have been made to design formulations more species-specific, produce harmful effects on non-target organisms. Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are amongst the main known effects induced by pesticide exposure, besides eventual lethal toxicity, endangering organisms' biomembranes integrity or compromising their activity through long-term exposure. Due to the general persistency of pesticides in the environment, these can easily be transported by water runoff. Pesticides used in agricultural fields are frequently transported to nearby freshwater systems, potentially affecting non-target organisms. Organophosphorus pesticides and carbamates are amongst the widely used classes of pesticides, and, despite being considered of rapid biodegradation, present a broad-spectrum of action, and the frequent transport of these contaminants to other systems may be harmful to non-intended species. Others, such as organochlorine pesticides, are highly persistent in the environment, posing a threat to non-target species for long periods. This is a matter of utter importance given that pesticides are known to impair numerous biological processes and inhibit the action of key enzymes in the response to xenobiotic-induced stress, potentiating oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, with potential irreversible effects. The study of the effect of pesticides has for long assessed exposure responses in a set of antioxidant and esterase enzymes, along trophic levels. The information is, however, more vast concerning photosynthetic organisms, macroinvertebrates and fish, with zooplankton appearing to be the group least studied. Given the ecological importance of zooplankton, further information regarding the response of this group to pesticide exposure could help detect early warning signs of potential threats to an ecosystem's integrity and search for alternatives and solutions to prevent the harmful action of pesticides in non-target individuals, that escalate food chains. Nonetheless, the use of enzymes as biomarkers to assess the response of freshwater communities to stress induced by pesticides has for long proven to be an effective tool. Some constraints related to the consistency of organisms' sensitivity and responses to pollutants may, however, lead to results not always straightforward, as a same pesticide may produce different enzymatic responses depending on the organism affected or to the environmental conditions. Thus, further studies using enzymes as biomarkers of pesticide exposure could provide more information and understanding to overcome the existing limitations and strengthen the applicability of enzymes in this context.

AB  - Assessing the ecological outcomes of wetland rehabilitation activities is an important need recognised by the Working for Wetlands' programme in South Africa. An assessment of ecological response was conducted in the Killarney and Kruisfontein wetlands, KwaZulu-Natal, in 2005 prior to rehabilitation in 2006, and again in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following rehabilitation. The assessment criteria included an evaluation of changes in ecological integrity, the supply of ecosystem services, and vegetation composition. Improvements in hydrological and geomorphic integrity were recorded in both wetlands, resulting in improved ecosystem delivery. However, investigation of vegetation composition using the wetland index value and floristic quality assessment index indices showed that, seven years after rehabilitation, Killarney's vegetation composition had improved, but Kruisfontein's vegetation was still largely dominated by pioneer species and appeared to be stable, but in a severely transformed state. The response of these wetlands has shown that sites for rehabilitation should be screened before work begins, and wetlands requiring intensive management of vegetation recovery should be assessed in terms of the objectives and the anticipated benefits of the project.

AB  - Time-weighted exposure limits to ammonia are established for humans; however similar guidelines have not been defined for laboratory rodents. The Guide recommends maintaining air pollutants at concentrations below levels irritating to mucous membranes but does not provide specific values. Numerous studies have examined ammonia and its effects on animal health, yet none have assessed the effects of naturally occurring intracage ammonia on the lower pulmonary tree and pulmonary endothelial and epithelial integrity in mice. We performed several assays commonly used in mouse acute lung-injury studies (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BAL] cell counts and protein concentration, excess lung water content [ELW], Evans blue permeability assay [EBA], lung tissue myeloperoxidase assay [MPO], and lung histopathology) to evaluate the effects of exposure to cyclical, naturally occurring ammonia levels on pulmonary integrity and inflammation. C57BL/6 mice were maintained in static microisolation or open-top cages. Cages were changed weekly, and ammonia levels were measured for 6 wk on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 of each cage-change cycle. Ammonia levels in static microisolation cages began to increase on day 3 and peaked at a mean of 141.3 ppm on day 7. Ammonia levels in open-top cages never exceeded 5 ppm. Neither BAL cell counts, protein concentration, ELW, EBA, nor MPO differed significantly between groups. Lung histopathology showed minimal, incidental changes in all mice. Our findings indicate that the ammonia concentrations in the static microisolation cages we used did not alter the integrity of the lower pulmonary tract nor influence key indicators used to assess acute lung injury.

AB  - Part of the reason for rejecting aquatic environments as possible vectors for the transmission of Helicobacter pylori has been the preference of this microorganism to inhabit the human stomach and hence use a direct oral-oral route for transmission. On the other hand, most enteric bacterial pathogens are well known for being able to use water as an environmental reservoir. In this work, we have exposed 13 strains of seven different Helicobacter spp. (both gastric and enterohepatic) to water and tracked their survival by standard plating methods and membrane integrity assessment. The influence of different plating media and temperatures and the presence of light on recovery was also assessed. There was good correlation between cultivability and membrane integrity results (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.916), confirming that the culture method could reliably estimate differences in survival among different Helicobacter spp. The species that survived the longest in water was H. pylori (> 96 It in the dark at 25 degrees C), whereas H. felis appeared to be the most sensitive to water (<6 h). A hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated that there was no relationship between the enterohepatic nature of Helicobacter spp. and an increased time of survival in water. This work assesses for the first time the survival of multiple Helicobacter spp., such has H. mustelae, H. muridarum, H. felis, H. canadensis, H. pullorum, and H. canis, in water under several conditions and concludes that the roles of water in transmission between hosts are likely to be similar for all these species, whether enterohepatic or not.

AB  - Fish species richness is one of the most common descriptors of aquatic biodiversity and an important indicator of the ecological condition of stream reaches and regional biological diversity. However, inadequate sampling effort underestimates the true number of species and, consequently, might provide erroneous information about the ecological conditions of, and trends in, aquatic environments. We sampled 24 to 39 stream reaches (each 150 m long) in seven megadiverse hydrologic units in the Brazilian states of Para (Amazonia biome) and Minas Gerais (Cerrado biome) to estimate the sampling effort needed to reach asymptotes at hydrologic unit spatial extents. We also estimated how much of the local richness would have been captured if the sampled reach was 50 or 100-m-long. Our results indicate that up to 53 reaches must be sampled per hydrologic unit for attaining an estimated 90% of the fish species richness, depending on the relative number of rare species. In most units, 100-m-long reaches suffice for collecting about 90% of the local sampled richness. We conclude that the effort frequently used in neotropical streams is adequate to capture most of the local fish fauna. However, complete inventories of hydrographic regions would only be feasible with efforts and resources far greater than those commonly employed. Before sampling programs are implemented for estimating true species richness, adequate levels of sampling effort should be assessed wherever that richness is expected to be high.

AB  - As stakeholders continue to increasingly hold firms accountable for environmental and social performance in their supply chains, the importance of understanding how firms can be more sustainable becomes more prescient. Based on the underlying premise of stakeholder theory that business and ethics decisions are intertwined, the current research introduces the concept of supply chain integrity (SCI) to explore how the interdependence of business and ethics decisions can lead to improvements in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. Exploratory analysis employing secondary data sources in an elastic net (EN) logistic regression provides support for the proposed construct, by providing preliminary empirical evidence that SCI, measured through two subdimensions of structural and moral SCI, can be linked to firm sustainability. The research contributes to the supply chain management literature by: (1) introducing the concept of SCI; (2) performing an exploratory econometric analysis to provide initial validity of the SCI construct; and (3) providing a research agenda to guide further research on the concept of SCI and its role in SSCM.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to describe the development and implementation of an integrated framework for landscape sensitivity assessment in Cyprus, a biodiversity hotspot with high landscape diversity. Akamas peninsula, the western tip of the island covering an area of 230 km(2), is under great pressure for development, notwithstanding it hosts 21 terrestrial habitats, four of which are priority at European level, in addition to 48 endangered plant species.
   Following previous coarse scale landscape mapping on the island, a more detailed landscape map at 1:10,000 scale (Level III) was produced, appropriate for local planning purposes. Overall landscape sensitivity was evaluated as a function of ecological, cultural and visual sensitivity of the study area. 66 Land Description Units (LDUs) were mapped and 38 Landscape Types (LCTs) were identified for the Akamas peninsula. Ecological sensitivity assessment for Akamas determined that 85 % of the LDUs have high to very high sensitivity with those within Natura 2000 sites having the highest. Out of 66 LDUs, 35 % were of high or moderate cultural sensitivity and there were 32 LDUs with high overall landscape sensitivity i.e. when visual sensitivity was also considered. Based on the various degrees of sensitivity identified in this study, the task of policy makers is to establish a policy response for each landscape type based on the principles and practice of sustainability. In the Mediterranean, the development of an integrated assessment for landscape sensitivity is critically important at a time of rapid change.

AB  - Decisions about biodiversity conservation depend on how different taxonomic groups respond to human-influenced environmental change. Here, we ask whether richness and composition of terrestrial (frugivorous butterflies and dung beetles) and aquatic insects (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Coleoptera) change in a congruent manner across a gradient of riparian habitat degradation in a karst tropical dry forest region of Brazil, the Bodoquena Plateau. Our results showed incongruent ordination patterns based on the different taxa analysed. We found no correlation between richness and composition of the groups and environmental integrity. Incongruent responses among the taxonomic groups may be a consequence of high variability in ecological requirements among different taxa. Additionally, the effect of human disturbance on these taxonomic groups can be masked by the predominant presence of generalist species in tropical dry forests and by historical factors related to the adaptability of several species to changing ecosystems.

AB  - Wetland soils contain a reservoir of dormant plant seeds and invertebrate eggs, collectively termed the seed or propagule bank, which integrate spatiotemporal variation at various levels of biology (genetic, phenotypic, species, and community). Several recent studies suggest that anthropogenic physical or chemical stressors may disrupt the process of emergence from propagule banks. This process is often the single most important colonization process in wetlands isolated geographically from other water bodies. The potential for disruption of emergence can be exploited as a useful indicator of anthropogenic stress. The aim of our paper is to provide a conceptual framework that shows the advantages and limitations of wetland propagule banks as indicators of anthropogenic stress or ecological integrity. This framework describes mechanistic responses of propagule banks to stressors and makes recommendations on experimental approaches for the evaluation of cause-effect relationships between stressors and propagule bank responses. This indicator could help bridge the current gap between basic and applied wetland ecology and could find application in future wetland management and restoration strategies.

AB  - Assessment of stream health is a function of the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the water body. While monitoring of all three indicator types is common, combining them into a unified assessment of stream quality is rare. In this study, a unified index was developed that compares biological response to physical and chemical stressors for southern California wadeable streams using a scientifically rigorous, easy-to-understand tool intended to facilitate stream management. The Stream Quality Index (SQI) is based on a stressor-response empirical model that quantifies the expected likelihood that chemical and physical stressors will impact multiple components of biological condition. While the individual stressor and response components are quantitative and have similar meaning across a variety of environmental settings, the final SQI narrative assessment is categorical and designed to be directly actionable within a management context. The four narrative assessment categories are: (1) "healthy and unstressed" (i.e., unimpacted biology, no stressors); (2) "healthy and resilient" (i.e., stressed, but biological communities are healthy); (3) "impacted and stressed" (i.e., impacted biology from observed stressors); and (4) "impacted by unknown stress" (i.e., biology is impacted, but stressors are low). To facilitate adoption by managers, a web-based application was developed that not only maps overall SQI results, but also enables users to readily access underlying quantitative information for stressors and biological responses. This transparent design was intended; high-level output and foundational components of the SQI are relevant for different audiences and details are not sacrificed for accessibility.

AB  - Chesapeake Bay has long been recognized as a biologically rich ecosystem, one whose wide expanse of shallow estuarine waters is unique in the world. When the biological bounty of the Bay declined dramatically, federal, state, and local governments began restoration efforts on a mammoth scale. While the successes have been many, the lesson of the last few decades has been that this great estuary cannot be restored without addressing the multitude of human activities in the watershed that cumulatively distort its ecological processes and degrade its resources. Today governments, industry, and the public are focusing on three major restoration efforts: reducing nutrient inputs, reducing toxic pollutant loads, and restoring living resources. Recognizing that power generation is an important component of the activities affecting the Bay, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Power Plant Research Program (PPRP) is working in partnership with electric utilities to avoid, minimize, and mitigate adverse impacts on both local and regional scales. Historically, PPRP has participated in cooperative state and industry efforts at Conowingo Dam and other upstream dams on the Susquehanna River (the Bay's largest freshwater tributary) that have helped quantify impacts to migratory fish, resulting in modifications to dam operations and installation of fish lifts to restore populations of American shad and other anadromous fish. Other restoration projects include mitigation of acid mine drainage in the upper reaches of the watershed, installation of lime dosers in affected streams, investigation of the beneficial uses of coal combustion products for mine reclamation, and operation of a successful hatchery and release program. Currently, PPRP recognizes that its research efforts need to look up the watershed at cumulative effects on a regional scale. Recent research on the regional level undertaken by DNR includes a statewide biological stream survey to provide comprehensive baseline information on the health of freshwater systems in Maryland, and development of reference-based ecological indicators. These indicators are critical for assessing the effects of different degrading activities and measuring progress towards environmental goals. A related cumulative impact model, currently under development, will couple indicators of biological integrity with spatial data on land uses, power-related impacts, and other anthropogenic stressors to evaluate watershed impacts on aquatic systems. As part of model development, the role of vegetated riparian corridors is being evaluated to support watershed-wide initiatives to restore riparian forest buffers on Chesapeake Bay tributaries. These biological survey data and other information are being used to identify biodiversity hotspots in the State and construct maps of ecologically sensitive areas for the evaluation of cumulative effects and targeting of conservation and restoration priorities.

AB  - Baseline data on the distribution, condition and extent of coralligenous and cave bioconcretions is one of the main requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) necessary to assess the achievement of a Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020. In this study the potential of remote sensing and distribution modelling techniques to map, measure descriptors and choose indicators were tested, that could provide standard methods for the assessment of the health status and assist in monitoring activities. It is demonstrated how, by combining different methodologies, it is possible to map the distribution of the bioconcretions with acceptable accuracy and to discriminate the main habitat types and fades. In addition, zonal statistical analysis revealed that fishing activities primarily coincide with areas of high coverage of the bioconcretions. Results demonstrate that the presented methodology is a valuable simple tool to assess several MSFD descriptors and indicators, and could strengthen management efficiency when making informed, ecologically relevant decisions.

AB  - Predictive models for benthic macroinvertebrates based on changes in environmental variables can assess the biological integrity of streams by comparing observed biotic communities with those expected at reference sites. To develop a predictive model of the abiotic community, we used benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables collected from 2,700 sites from 2010 to 2019. First, we selected 357 reference sites by using the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, and coarse particle percentage. Then, we used Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis to classify the reference sites into six groups based on benthic macroinvertebrates. Reference sites classified by biological characteristics were linked to environmental variables by multi-discriminant analysis. The relative influences environmental variables on the classified groups were in decreasing order of catchment area, latitude, velocity, water depth, altitude, and longitude. To develop the predictive model, we combined (1) identification level, (2) grouping method, and (3) probability of capture, and then used the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to check the fit of each model. The higher the probability of capture was at the family level compared to the species level, the lower was the NRMSE. The grouping method was not as consistent as the identification level and probability of capture because the NRMSE for the number of taxa was low when used as a weighted average. The NRMSE was also low for the Benthic Macroinvertebrates Index and the Benthic Macroinvertebrates Family-level Biotic Index (BMFI) when used for assignment to the group with the highest probability. We selected the predictive model which used family level, weighted average, and BMFI-proposed indicator taxa as the final assessment model due to its sensitivity and fit. This model was the most reasonable choice, but we had to reduce the error of the model and revise it elaborately by securing additional environmental variables.

AB  - Despite spending $115 billion per year on environmental actions in the United States, we have only a limited ability to describe the effectiveness of these expenditures. Moreover, after decades of such investments, we cannot accurately describe status and trends in the nation's aquatic ecosystems or even those in specific regions. Why? This situation has arisen in part because we have excluded the fundamental principles of probability designs that are widely used in other fields and we have often ignored direct measures of biota, the subjects of greatest concern. To demonstrate the results of ignoring these powerful statistical and biological tools, we present four case studies. These studies compare estimates of aquatic resource status derived from using (1) a probability-based study design, often with biological measures of condition; and (2) a nonstatistical study design, often using chemical surrogates. In three of the four cases, the results derived from the nonstatistical perspective underestimate the degree of biological degradation.

AB  - Ecosystem activation system (EAS) was developed to create beneficial conditions for microbiome recovery and then restore and maintain the ecological integrity ( microbial community, phytoplankton, zooplankton) for eutrophic freshwater rehabilitation. A 30 day's filed test of EAS indicated that over 50% of contaminant was removed and the algae visibly disappeared. EAS treatment 2.5-fold increased the diversity of microbial community and changed the microbial community structure (e.g., two and three-fold decrease in the amount of Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas, typical abundant species of eutrophic freshwater, respectively). Further, the diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton of treated water suggested that these species were diverse. Representative phytoplankton of eutrophic freshwater, Chlorella and Chlamydomonas were undetectable. The possible mechanism of EAS is restoring the trophic levels of the water body via bottom-up approach by microbial community.

AB  - The main objectives of this work were to examine the performance of a holistic stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) in predicting the trends of the vertebrate species richness (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) in response to changes induced by the ongoing wind farm installation in mountain areas of northwest Portugal. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to estimate the ecological status of changed ecosystems that have been damaged by anthropogenic disturbances. The performance of two complementary temporal approaches was tested, taking into account either annual or seasonal influences. The data used in the dynamic model construction included true gradients of environmental changes and was sampled from 2004 to 2006. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected ecological components, such as the species richness of each vertebrate group and the structural changes in habitat conditions. The results show the capacity of the model in capturing the dynamics of the studied system by predicting consistent trends for the global vertebrate species richness under complex and variable environmental scenarios. The average annual approach is considered sufficient for the aims of the most Environmental Impact Assessments while the seasonal approach is recommended for more detailed studies, namely regarding specific population, guilds or community dynamics.

AB  - Tropical rivers display profound temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of environmental conditions. This aspect needs to be considered when designing a monitoring program for water quality in rivers. Therefore, the physico-chemical composition and the nutrient loading of the Upper Mara River and its two main tributaries, the Amala and Nyangores were monitored. Initial daily, and later a weekly monitoring schedule for 4 months spanning through the wet and dry seasons was adopted. Benthic macro-invertebrates were also collected during the initial sampling to be used as indicators of water quality. The aim of the current study was to investigate the physico-chemical status and biological integrity of the Upper Mara River basin. This was achieved by examining trends in nutrient concentrations and analyzing the structure, diversity and abundance of benthic macro-invertebrates in relation to varying land use patterns. Sampling sites were selected based on catchment land use and the level of human disturbance, and using historical records of previous water quality studies. River water pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, and turbidity were determined in situ. All investigated parameters except iron and manganese had concentration values within allowable limits according to Kenyan and international standards for drinking water. The Amala tributary is more mineralized and also shows higher levels of pH and EC than water from the Nyangores tributary. The latter, however, has a higher variability in both the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. The variability in TP and TN concentrations increases downstream for both tributaries and is more pronounced for TN than for TP. Macro-invertebrate assemblages responded to the changes in land use and water quality in terms of community composition and diversity. The study recommends detailed continuous monitoring of the water quality at shorter time intervals and to identify key macro-invertebrate taxa that can be used to monitor changes of the water quality in rivers of the Mara basin as a result of anthropogenic changes.

AB  - Sampling methods and functionally related landscape met rics were developed for characterizing riparian-stream networks using aerial photography and Gls. A sample area was empirically derived by using morphological characteristics of increasing portions of the stream network surrounding points selected on streams, GIS functions were used to band stream networks in 10-m increments to a distance of 300 m, within which land cover was interpreted from aerial photographs and digitized. Incremental banding is an effective approach for characterizing the composition and pattern of land cover as a function of distance from the stream network. Structural attributes that capture the linear nature of riparian-stream networks, such as the composition, width, longitudinal extent, and connectivity of woody vegetation, were characterized. The methods developed provide a flexible framework for deriving landscape metrics of functionally important structural attributes of riparian-stream networks for exploring relationships at varying spatial scales with indicators of stream ecological condition.

AB  - The order Odonata has been regularly used as an indicator of the ecosystem's condition. The objective of this review was to analyze the importance of Odonata for environmental assessments (assessment types, statistical approach, life stages, and sampling method, or particular metric), summarizing the current state, the trends, and identifying related research issues in the Neotropical region. Therefore, we selected 62 articles from 2007 to 2018 based on published research to monitor Odonata assessments in the Neotropical region. We compiled a database and ran statistical analyses for the observed frequencies. We found that ecosystem health was the most frequent assessment type and quality the most used objective. In the case of statistical tests and metrics, multivariate analyses and species richness were most used in these papers. However, because there is a great diversity of habitats in this region, there is no unique monitoring protocol to assess the quality of ecosystem health and it is needed to create a proposal for a standard evaluation protocol. Consequently, guidelines for monitoring are presented, and we suggest three stages to establish a specific protocol for each site, which records the set of species most sensitive to the exchange rate evaluated, as well as the use of rarefaction methods, the index of diversity based on the area under the curve, and multivariate analysis, among other recommendations.

AB  - During the storage of wheat grains and flours, a natural deterioration occurs due to aging over time, which is accelerated by adverse conditions of temperature and humidity that cause the growth of fungi. The local climates and infrastructure available for storage affect the preservation and duration of the safe storage time. Wheat lipids are a minor component, whose level and composition are decisive in the quality properties of wheat final products. Lipids are easily degraded, which is the main cause of quality loss. The enzymatic degradation of lipids is carried out by the activation of endogenous and/or fungal enzymatic activities, which produces hydrolytic and oxidative rancidity. Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria are the most frequent genera found in infected grains. Wheat infection by Fusarium spp. is associated with considerable economic losses in crops throughout the world. The volatile compounds produced by oxidative rancidity are the main indicators of deterioration. Lipid rancidity must be monitored periodically using a combination of different analytical methods, ranging from traditional to modern alternative techniques of varied scope. Sensitivity to lipid deterioration varies with the wheat cultivar genotype, thus the selection of cultivars with better stability allows to obtain better quality products. In addition, a large proportion of the harvested wheat is usually stored for a long time until use, so achieving suitable environmental conditions and applying control measures prevent quality loss. This review updates the knowledge about wheat lipids, the importance of preserving their integrity during storage, presenting different monitoring alternatives to detect their rancidity, which would allow better decisionmaking.

AB  - Biologically treated wastewater (WW) from the Hammerfest LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant is discharged to the sea. A study using biomarkers in mussels and Atlantic cod was performed to examine whether this discharge meets a zero harmful emission requirement. Caging of mussels close to the outfall and exposure of mussels and fish to WW in the laboratory were conducted, and a suite of contaminant responsive markers was assessed in exposed animals. In mussels the markers included chemical contaminant levels, haemocyte lysosomal instability and nucleus integrity, cellular energy allocation, digestive gland and gonad histopathology and shell-opening behaviour. In fish, biliary PAH metabolites and gill histopathology biomarkers were measured. A consistent cause-effect relationship between WW treatments and markers measured in test animals was not found. The results therefore indicate that the WW emission is unlikely to represent a significant stress factor for the local marine environment under the conditions studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With regards to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive various assessment thresholds exist for morphological, biochemical and hydro-morphological parameters for sustainable water management. Besides the knowledge about the importance of hydrology for habitat conditions and biota respectively, there exists still a lack in consideration of changes of flow dynamics due to human impacts in current water protection. Natural flow variability maintains the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. In general alteration of flow dynamics result in changes of duration, magnitude and frequency of flows. Especially urban rivers can be crucial impacted by a rapid and short-term runoff response, mainly due to the impact of combined sewer and storm water overflows. The variability in flow dynamics makes the definition of fixed hydrological assessment indices difficult. There is the need of further knowledge in which ways flow dynamic is changed by human impacts and which hydrological parameters are suitable to capture these changes.
   In this study the hydrological assessment criteria flow acceleration, peak discharge and discharge dosage are determined with the focus to assess the quantitative impact on urban rivers. Dependencies of these hydrological parameters are studied within comprehensive statistical analyses with long-term data sets. The hydrological parameters were compared on impacted and un-impacted sites. The influence of land use, influences of discharge data resolution and scale dependencies respectively were investigated. Additionally, probability analyses and calculations of recurrence intervals were conducted for all three parameters. Using those three, sensitive hydrological parameters a hydrological approach is given, which considers the natural hydrograph as target value for a hydrological assessment and captures the whole spectrum of possible changes of the flood hydrograph. Furthermore, the suggested parameters are easily to determine from discharge time series and hence, widely available for management decisions. The study is a contribution for an improved implementation of hydrological assessment indices and capturing flow dynamic variability additionally to qualitative aspects within an ecologically meaningful assessment according to the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB  - In large European rivers the chemical water quality has improved markedly in recent decades, yet the recovery of the fish fauna is not proceeding accordingly. Important causes are the loss of habitats in the main river channels and their floodplains, and the diminished hydrological connectivity between them.
   In this study we investigate how river regulation has affected fish community structure in floodplain waterbodies of the rivers Rhone (France), Danube (Austria), Rhine and Meuse (The Netherlands). A typology of natural and man-made aquatic habitats was constructed based on geomorphology, inundation frequency and ecological connectivity, along the transversal river-floodplain gradient, i.e. perpendicular to the main stream of the river. Fish species were classified in ecological guilds based on their flow preference, reproduction ecology and diet, and their status on national red lists was used to analyse the present state of the guilds and habitats.
   Ecological fish guilds appear to be good indicators of ecological integrity and functioning of river-floodplain systems. A transversal successional gradient in fish community structure that bears some resemblance to the gradient found in natural rivers can still be discerned in heavily regulated rivers. It resembles the longitudinal river gradient; even some predictions of the River Continuum Concept are applicable. Overall, richness and diversity of species and ecological guilds decrease with decreasing hydrological connectivity of floodplain waterbodies.
   Anthropogenic disturbances have affected fish species unevenly: guilds of specialized species that are highly adapted to specifically riverine conditions have declined far more than generalist species. Fish habitats in the main and secondary channels have suffered most from regulation and contain the highest percentage of threatened species. Rheophilic fishes have become rare because their lotic reproductive habitats are severely degraded, fragmented, absent or unreachable. Limnophilic fishes have become rare too, mainly as a result of eutrophication. Eurytopic fishes have become dominant everywhere. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted the National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) as part of the National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) program to determine the condition of wetlands across the 48 contiguous states of the United States (US). Sites were selected using a generalized random tessellated stratified (GRTS) probability design. We quantified the types, extent, and magnitude of human activities as indicators of potential stress on a sample of 1138 wetland sites representing a target population of 251,546km(2) of wetlands in the US. We used field observations of the presence and proximity of more than 50 pre-determined types of human activity to define two types of indices that quantify human influences on wetlands. We grouped these observations into five types of human activity (classes) and summed them within and across these classes to define five metrics and an overall Human Disturbance Activity Index (HDAI). We calculated six Anthropogenic Stress Indices (ASIs) by summing human disturbance activity observations within stressor categories according to their expected effect on each of six aspects of wetland condition. Based on repeat-visit data, the precision of these metrics and indices was sufficient for regional and national assessments. Among the six categories of stress assessed nationally, the percentage of wetland area having ASI levels indicating high stress levels ranged from 10% due to filling/erosional activities to 27% due to vegetation removal activities. The proportion of wetland area with no signs of human disturbance activity (HDAI=0) within a 140-m diameter area varied widely among the different wetland ecoregions/types we assessed. No visible human disturbance activity was evident in 70% of estuarine wetlands, but among non-estuarine wetlands, only 8% of the wetland area in the West, 15% of the Interior Plains, 22% of the Coastal Plains, and 36% of the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest lacked visible evidence of disturbance. The woody wetlands of the West were the most highly stressed reporting group, with more than 75% of their wetland area subject to high levels of ditching, hardening, and vegetation removal. The NWCA offers a unique opportunity to quantify the type, intensity, and extent of human activities in and around wetlands and to assess their likely stress on wetland ecological functions, physical integrity, and overall condition at regional and continental scales.

AB  - Riparian areas link aquatic and terrestrial habitats, supporting species-rich bird communities, which integrate both terrestrial and aquatic processes. For this reason, inclusion of riparian birds in stream bioassessment could add to the information currently provided by existing programs that monitor aquatic organisms. To assess if bird community metrics could indicate stream conditions, we sampled breeding birds in the riparian zone of 37 reaches in 5 streams draining watersheds representing a gradient of agricultural intensity in central Italy. As a more direct indicator of water quality, stream macroinvertebrates were also sampled for computation of the Italian Extended Biotic Index (IBE). An anthropogenic index was calculated within 1 km of sampled reaches based on satellite-derived land-use classifications. Predictive models of macroinvertebrate integrity based on land-use and avian metrics were compared using an information-theoretic approach (AIC). We also determined if stream quality related to the detection of riverine species. Apparent bird species diversity and richness peaked at intermediate levels of land-use modification, but increased with IBE values. Water quality did not relate to the detection of riverine species as a guild, but two species, the dipper Cinclus cinclus and the grey wagtail Motacilla cinerea, were only observed in reaches with the highest IBE values. Small-bodied insectivorous birds and arboreal species were detected more often in reaches with better water quality and in less modified landscapes. In contrast, larger and granivorous species were more common in disturbed reaches. According to the information-theoretic approach, the best model for predicting water quality included the anthropogenic index, bird species diversity, and an index summarizing the trophic structure of the bird community. We conclude that, in combination with landscape-level information, the diversity and trophic structure of riparian bird communities could serve as a rapid indicator of stream-dwelling macroinvertebrates and, therefore, degradation of in-stream biotic integrity.

AB  - Monitoring of rangelands in the western USA formally began in the U.S. Forest Service in the 1930s. Other federal land management and advisory agencies did not usually monitor their clients' public or private rangelands until after World War II. The initial focus was on the portion of vegetation that was livestock forage. Attention to soils generally came after World War II. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 changed the formerly independent role of the action agencies and gave the interested public means of input to and oversight on the actions of the managerial agencies. NEPA also gave the interested public leverage through the courts if a decision was not of their liking. The result has been near grid, lock on proactive management on public rangelands and diversion of a large portion of operating funds to planning. Availability of monitoring data for some locales is largely due to the foresight and persistence of particularly dedicated individuals. Lack of consistent and comparable monitoring procedures within and between the federal management, advisory, and regulatory agencies has made it impossible to conclude reliably what the overall condition and trends in conditions of our public rangelands are. There are currently many competing proposals before Congress to fund efforts at rangeland monitoring standardization. Many additional federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations are getting involved in this debate. By carefully reviewing the history of development of rangeland monitoring, it is possible to identify fatal flaws in previous approaches and suggest actions to avoid previous pitfalls during the forthcoming development of more defendable monitoring approaches at both local and national scales.

AB  - The assessment of the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems based on benthic macroinvertebrate communities has progressed in recent years, due to the implementation of water quality regulations worldwide, including the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Several biotic indices have been developed in order to evaluate the ecological status of freshwater and marine ecosystems but the assessment of estuarine condition is much less developed because of its transitional characteristics. Some adaptations of marine indices have been proposed for estuarine areas, but very few include specific thresholds to be used in low salinity areas, where freshwater species can also be found. This study focused on the tidal freshwater and brackishwater sections of the Mira estuary, where salinities lower than 0.5 were registered at least during a certain period. Since no reference conditions are defined for benthic macroinvertebrate communities of Portuguese transitional waters, physicochemical variables recognized as indicative of human stress (organic and nutrient enrichment and oxygen levels) were used to classify the study area. Metrics commonly used to assess benthic condition in marine and freshwater systems were calculated and a modification of the AMBI and IBMWP indices was proposed. Two different ecotopes based on salinity were defined across the tidal freshwater-estuarine interface of the Mira estuary, a tidal freshwater and a brackish water ecotope. Only AMBI, IBMWP and the proposed modified versions of those indices responded predictably to human pressure indicative variables, but the ecological quality status classifications indicated that ecotope specific reference conditions need to be defined in order to improve the performance of those indices.

AB  - Ultrafiltration and nanofiltration have become common methods to treat surface water for drinking water purposes. Common aims of a membrane step are removal of natural organic matter (NOM), softening or adding an extra microbiological or chemical barrier. In most cases, the membrane is considered a good disinfection step; commonly the viral removal is at least 4-log. To ensure a working disinfection, reliable integrity tests are required. In the present pilot study with a hollow fiber nanofilter, the membrane achieved a high NOM reduction, and the difference in parameters related to NOM quality before and after treatment proved to be useful indicators of integrity breaches. Changes in total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, UV-absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) and fluorescence derived parameters in the permeate flow were related to leaking fibers. On average, UVA(254) in the permeate was 3 times higher for a membrane with compromised fibers (0.041 cm(-1)) compared to an intact membrane (0.013 cm(-1)), while TOC was less than 2 times as high on average. Thus, this membrane had a higher reduction of UVA(254) than TOC and the sensitivity for changes from leakage was higher. Therefore, it is suggested that UVA(254) could be used as an indicator for membrane integrity. Additionally, there is a significant (P < 0.01) difference in fluorescence derived parameters between a leaking and an intact fiber, showing that fluorescence also has potential to be applied for online monitoring of membrane processes. During fiber failure, around 2% of the permeate flow passes through one single leaking fiber. The transport depends on the distance between the inflow and the leak, which in most cases are similar and most likely close to the middle of the fiber. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We created and evaluated indices of plant performance using plant morphological and physiological attributes and assessed their potential as wetland condition indicators by studying their consistency along a stress gradient. Based on Spearman coefficients, we selected promising morphological and physiological metrics that showed consistent responses along a physico-chemical stress gradient. Metrics consistently associated with wetland condition were ranked and combined into morphological (mPPI) or physiological Plant Performance Indices (phPPI). Six morphological metrics were able to discern between good and poor wetland conditions along the impact gradient and were thereafter combined into the mPPI. The resulting mPPI was found to be a strong indicator of stress and accurately identified degraded wetlands (r (s) = -0.52; P = 0.030). In contrast, most of the physiologic metrics showed lower correlations to the stress gradient. Consequently, the resulted phPPI had a lack of association with the stress gradient and failed to identify even heavily-impacted wetlands (r (s) = -0.30; P = 0.194). We conclude that the morphological characteristics of plants, the reliability of the mPPI, and its ability to simply and easily convey habitat information makes it worthy of further refinement and validation as a tool for evaluating mitigation and restoration efforts in wetlands.

AB  - Asset Health Management (AHM), supported by condition monitoring (CM) and performance measuring technologies, together with trending, modelling and diagnostic frameworks, is not only critical to the reliability of high-value machines, but also to a companies Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE), system safety and profitability. In addition these protocols are also critical to the global concern of the environment. industries involved with monitoring key performances indicators (KPI) to improve OEE would benefit from a standardised qualification and certification scheme for their personnel, particularly if it is based on internationally accepted procedures for the various CM technologies that also share the same objectives as AH and CM. Furthermore, the development of 'models' for implementation of a Carbon tax is intrinsically dependent on the integrity and accuracy of measurements contributing to these indicators. This paper reviews the global picture of condition monitoring, the environment and related international standards and then considers their relationship and equivalent global objectives. In addition, it presents the methods behind the development of such standards for certification of competence in personnel involved with data collection, modelling and measurements of KPIs. Two case studies are presented that highlight the integrated strategy in practise. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic influence on lotic environments as a result of civilisation has captured public interest because of the consequent problems associated with deterioration of water quality. Various biological monitoring methods that provide a direct measure of ecological integrity by using the response of biota to environmental changes have been developed to monitor the ecological status of lotic environments. Diatoms have been used extensively in this regard and this review attempts to summarise the basic concepts associated with biological monitoring using benthic diatoms. Where possible, examples from work carried out in Brazil are used.

AB  - In this study, we take an ecosystem approach to examine the degree of biological self-organization at the ecosystem level. An integrated set of indicators is derived from a theoretical framework and tested by field data from an ecosystem research project focusing on the Bornhoved Lake district in northern Germany. This field test is based on a comparison of the self-organized phenomena that comprise the carbon, water, and energy budgets of two adjacent edaphically and climatically similar ecosystems, that have vastly different levels of human interference-a crop field and a beech forest. fn terms of biomass storage, biologically incorporated nitrogen and phosphorus, species number, total ecosystem respiration per total biomass (qCO(2)), total ecosystem assimilation per available nutrients, and transpiration per total evapotranspiration, we found clear differences between the systems. Ecosystem surface temperature and R-n/K* were found to be of limited utility in characterizing the two systems. The study is rooted in the concept of ecological integrity, an influential idea at the interface of ecological and environmental debate that has acquired a number of different meanings. Among other interpretations, it can be viewed as a guiding principle for sustainable land use that aims at long-term protection of ecological life-support systems. Effective use of any interpretation of this concept requires a theoretically consistent and applicable set of indicators. Therefore, we also discuss the integration of the indicator set and its potential use in monitoring programs.

AB  - A common concern regarding the popular Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) method is whether the site floristic quality scores change with natural temporal and site-specific variability. The more ignored question is whether this background variability will confound the index of human disturbance. Using non-forested seasonal wetlands in the northeastern United States, we tested if two common indices of site floristic quality (FQAI, Mean CoC) provide clear signals of site condition relative to gradients of wetland area and surface water depth, and consistent signals across time of year (early vs. late growing season), geomorphic setting (connected vs. isolated), and vegetation community type (pine barrens vernal pond, wet sedge meadow, shrub swamp). Mean CoC is the coefficient of conservatism (a qualitative estimate of species' sensitivity to human disturbance) averaged across the native and exotic taxa observed at a given site, and FQAI is the traditional Floristic Quality Assessment Index where Mean CoC is multiplied by square root of taxa richness. The FQAI did not linearly correspond to the site condition gradient and thus it could not be evaluated. Mean CoC was clearly associated with site condition, with no interference from wetland area or water level (based on computer-intensive resampling of linear model fit). Mean CoC also varied consistently with site condition between the surveys, geomorphic settings, and community types (based on computer-intensive resampling of linear model slope). However, connected wetlands showed inherently greater Mean CoC than isolated wetlands, suggesting a comparison of floristic quality between these categories would not be prudent. Overall this study suggests that FQA in the form of Mean CoC may withstand natural variability in certain non-forested wetland systems. Instead of assuming FQA is overly sensitive to natural variability, we recommend further efforts to identify situations in which FQA is robust. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of biological indicators for assessing ecological conditions in streams and rivers is urgently needed in China, particularly in heavily impacted regions. The aim of this study was to develop and apply benthic macroinvertebrate-based multimetric indices (MMIs) for the assessment of streams and rivers in the western hill and eastern plain aquatic ecoregions of the Taihu Basin. MMIs were based on samples collected from October 16 to November 8 2012 at 120 sites in streams and rivers. Least disturbed sites defined the reference conditions. Chemical water quality, physical habitat, and land use were used as criteria to identify reference sites in the basin. Metrics related to benthic macroinvertebrate richness, composition, diversity and evenness, pollution tolerance, and functional feeding groups were screened by range, sensitivity, responsiveness, and redundancy tests. Total number of taxa; percentage of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (% ETO); Berger-Parker's index (BP); Biotic index (BI); and percentage of filterers-collectors (% FC) were used to construct the MMI for the western hill aquatic ecoregion (MMIw). Total number of taxa, percentage of Crustacea and Odonata (% CO), BP, BI, and % FC were used to construct the MMI for the eastern plain aquatic ecoregion (MMIE). The MMI scores were obtained by combining the rating categories (excellent, good, fair, poor, and very poor). The MMIs were tested using a separate subset of the data, and the results indicated that the newly developed MMIs were robust in terms of percentage of sites correctly classified, coefficient of variation, box-separation ratios, and separation powers. The ecological status was then evaluated based on the MMI scores. The results indicated that the general ecological status of streams and rivers in the Taihu Basin was rated lower than "good", the western hill aquatic ecoregion was rated "fair" and the eastern plain aquatic ecoregion was rated "poor". Moreover, the MMIs showed a significant negative response to an increasing gradient of disturbance. Therefore, these preliminary MMIs can be used as assessment tools in ecological biomonitoring and management of the Taihu Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of restoring connectivity for fish by the construction of 11 fish ladders in the Pielach and Melk rivers, both tributaries to the Danube in Austria, was monitored using electric fishing and fish traps between 1999 and 2004. In order to assess the efficiency of connectivity rehabilitation measures pre- and post-project data combining electric fishing and trap catch data were analyzed by means of three fish-based assessment methods: a MUlti-Level concept for a Fish-based, river-type-specific Assessment of ecological integrity (MULFA), the Fish Index Austria (FIA) and the European Fish Index (EFI). The effect of adding qualitative trap catch data to electric fishing data on metrics and indices was also tested and the magnitude of the effect was related to the distance of the sites from the river mouth. The results clearly demonstrated the significant contribution of connectivity rehabilitation measures to the ecological integrity of rivers like the River Pielach where morphological conditions are good, whereas remaining channelization still limits the success of connectivity measures in the River Melk. Trap catch data were found to represent an essential source of additional information to assess the efficiency of connectivity measures shortly after their implementation. The negative correlations of the magnitude of the effect of different indices and metrics with the distance of assessment sites from river mouths obviously underline the importance of the river Danube as a source for the re-colonization process. While the indices tested were found to have limited ability to reflect short-term response of fish assemblages to continuum rehabilitation, guild metrics were able to detect improvements of the ecological status shortly after the implementation of connectivity measures. Six metrics showed significant differences between pre and post-project data reflecting the expected increase of the ecological integrity: (1) Fish Region Index (FRI; FIA, MULFA), (2) number of subdominant species and (3) number of flow-guilds (FIA), (4) number of type specific species (MULFA), (5) number of benthic species and (6) number of potamodromous species (EFI); the FRI differences were only significant when trap catch data were added. The EFI indicated a decline of ecological integrity through increases in the density of omnivorous species and the relative number of tolerant species as well as a decrease in the relative number of intolerant species. Significantly decreasing responses with the distance from the river mouth were documented by the EFI and MULFA-index, the FRI (FIA, MULFA), total biomass and for the number of type specific species (MULFA).

AB  - Stream indicators used to make assessments of biological condition are influenced by many possible sources of variability. To examine this issue, we used multiple-year and multiple-reach diatom, fish, and invertebrate data collected from 20 least-disturbed and 46 developed stream segments between 1993 and 2004 as part of the US Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment Program. We used a variance-component model to summarize the relative and absolute magnitude of 4 variance components (among-site, among-year, site 3 year interaction, and residual) in indicator values (observed/expected ratio [O/E] and regional multimetric indices [MMI]) among assemblages and between basin types (least-disturbed and developed). We used multiple-reach samples to evaluate discordance in site assessments of biological condition caused by sampling variability. Overall, patterns in variance partitioning were similar among assemblages and basin types with one exception. Among-site variance dominated the relative contribution to the total variance (64-80% of total variance), residual variance (sampling variance) accounted for more variability (8-26%) than interaction variance (5-12%), and among-year variance was always negligible (0-0.2%). The exception to this general pattern was for invertebrates at least-disturbed sites where variability in O/E indicators was partitioned between among-site and residual (sampling) variance (among-site = 36%, residual = 64%). This pattern was not observed for fish and diatom indicators (O/E and regional MMI). We suspect that unexplained sampling variability is what largely remained after the invertebrate indicators (O/E predictive models) had accounted for environmental differences among least-disturbed sites. The influence of sampling variability on discordance of within-site assessments was assemblage or basin-type specific. Discordance among assessments was nearly 2x greater in developed basins (29-31%) than in least-disturbed sites (15-16%) for invertebrates and diatoms, whereas discordance among assessments based on fish did not differ between basin types (least-disturbed = 16%, developed = 17%). Assessments made using invertebrate and diatom indicators from a single reach disagreed with other samples collected within the same stream segment nearly 1/3 of the time in developed basins, compared to 1/6 for all other cases.

AB  - Several biotic indices have been proposed for the assessment of the ecological status of benthic macroinvertebrates in marine waters, although none have been generally accepted. When it comes to assessing highly stressed natural environments, such as estuaries, the controversy and uncertainty is much higher than for any given normal index. In this article, we test the behavior and suitability of different biotic indices proposed under the perspective of the Water Framework Directive (S, H, AMBI, M-AMBI, BQI, W-statistic, Taxonomic distinctness) for the assessment of estuaries in northern Spain. The low species richness and dominance of a few tolerant species in the characteristic community of these estuaries presented a challenge to the application of the biotic indices tested. Combined approaches that integrate different aspects of water quality and ecosystem functionality could increase the reliability of the ecological assessment of these transitional waters.

AB  - Assessment of lake impairment status and identification of threats' type and source is essential for protection of intact, enhancement of modified, and restoration of impaired lakes. For regions in which large numbers of lakes occur, such assessment has usually been done for only small fractions of lakes due to resource and time limitation. This study describes a process for assessing lake impairment status and identifying which human disturbances have the greatest impact on each lake for all lakes that are 2 ha or larger in the state of Michigan using readily available, georeferenced natural and human disturbance databases. In-lake indicators of impairment are available for only a small subset of lakes in Michigan. Using statistical relationships between the in-lake indicators and landscape natural and human-induced measures from the subset lakes, we assessed the likely human impairment condition of lakes for which in-lake indicator data were unavailable using landscape natural and human disturbance measures. Approximately 92% of lakes in Michigan were identified as being least to marginally impacted and about 8% were moderately to heavily impacted by landscape human disturbances. Among lakes that were heavily impacted, more inline lakes (92%) were impacted by human disturbances than disconnected (6%) or headwater lakes (2%). More small lakes were impacted than medium to large lakes. For inline lakes, 90% of the heavily impacted lakes were less than 40 ha, 10% were between 40 and 405 ha, and 1% was greater than 405 ha. For disconnected and headwater lakes, all of the heavily impacted lakes were less than 40 ha. Among the anthropogenic disturbances that contributed the most to lake disturbance index scores, nutrient yields and farm animal density affected the highest number of lakes, agricultural land use affected a moderate number of lakes, and point-source pollution and road measures affected least number of lakes. Our process for assessing lake condition represents a significant advantage over other routinely used methods. It permits the evaluation of lake condition across large regions and yields an overall disturbance index that is a physicochemical and biological indicator weighted sum of multiple disturbance factors.

AB  - Fish species have been often used as indicators of environmental quality in aquatic ecosystems, while biotic indices based on fish have become common tools in ecological monitoring. Nevertheless, such indices are far from perfect, mainly because they are based on assumptions that sometimes are not met and because they cannot be optimized from a computational point of view. As any other method, they rely upon expert judgments for selecting relevant metrics, combining metrics into a score and defining thresholds between ecological status classes in the scoring scale. Provided that no procedure can be entirely objective in evaluating ecological status, as this very concept is inherently subjective, we propose a novel approach in which the unavoidable subjective elements only play a role in the earliest steps, while the subsequent optimization of the evaluation procedure is as objective as possible. An expert system, designed after this concept for Latium (Central Italy) river basins and based on a multilayer perceptron neural network, was developed and implemented into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in order to make it easily accessible to non-technical users. The neural network reconstructs experts' judgments on the basis of a set of abiotic descriptors and fish assemblage composition, thus providing consensus estimates of ecological status for any river stretch. This approach allows easily the incorporation into the expert system of new data and new expert judgments as soon as they become available. However, the very first version of the expert system is already able to correctly classify 2 out of 3 cases, while the worst classification error does not exceed a single class of ecological status.

AB  - Wetlands along the St. Lawrence River were severely impacted by habitat alteration and contamination as a consequence of construction of the St Lawrence Seaway and the Moses-Saunders power dam, and associated industrial development. Due to environmental degradation, the St. Lawrence River at Massena, New York has been designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Within this AOC, there is an information gap on the current status of two Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs): (1) loss of fish and wildlife habitat and (2) degradation of fish and wildlife populations. Both BUIs have the same evaluation endpoint: no difference between the AOC and comparable reference areas outside of the AOC. We evaluated coastal and palustrine wetlands by surveying biological, water quality, and landscape indicators within a sample of 17 wetlands in the AOC and 10 reference wetlands outside the AOC to establish georeferenced indices of biotic integrity and water quality. We did not detect a difference between the AOC and reference wetlands in any of the 14 biotic and 16 water quality metrics, but did find a difference in landscape setting. AOC wetlands were smaller and fewer, especially for woody wetlands. These results suggest that wildlife habitat quality and communities are not impaired in AOC wetlands yet it would be beneficial for additional key fish and wildlife assemblages and habitat types to be surveyed, multi-year monitoring of key biotic indicators implemented, and more specific redesignation criteria for wetland habitat and matrix landscape composition defined and met.

AB  - Due to ubiquitous distribution of taxa, relatively low-cost and efficient sampling procedure, and known responses to environmental gradients, macroinvertebrate indicators are often a central component of biological monitoring of freshwater resources. This study examined establishing a baseline reference of benthic macroinvertebrate indicators in a biomonitoring approach as a means for monitoring the freshwater ponds of Sable Island National Park Reserve (SINPR), Canada. We compared water quality parameters monitored from 2015 to 2019 to a biomonitoring approach deployed in May, June, and August of 2019. A total of 27 taxa were recorded from the 30,226 specimens collected, with highest abundances of Corixidae, Amphipoda, Oligochaeta, and chironomid species Polypedilum bicrenatum. We found significant variability of community structure between different months of sampling (p = 0.001) and between ponds (p < 0.0001). A high correlation was found between dissolved organic carbon, sulfate, and the diversity of macroinvertebrate indicators, while conductivity, ammonia, and calcium were found to be correlated with species richness. While we found that water chemistry parameters exhibited spatial and temporal differences, the diversity of macroinvertebrate indicators is likely to be a more resilient metric for comparison between ponds. Further, our findings demonstrate that biomonitoring can be effective in systems with a low number of small, shallow, freshwater pond ecosystems. As our study deployed a high-resolution identification of biological indicators, we were able to establish a baseline reference for future monitoring as well as identify specific associations between pond water quality and biological assemblages that can be used as a context for the management of SINPR's freshwater resources. Continued monitoring of these ecosystems in future years will help to understand long-term environmental changes on the island.

AB  - Purpose Biotic and abiotic properties of soils can hinder or facilitate ecological restoration, and management practices that impact edaphic factors can strongly influence plant growth and restoration outcomes. Salvaged topsoil is an invaluable resource for mine-site restoration, and a common practice is topsoil transfer from mined areas to restoration sites. However, direct transfer is often not feasible, necessitating storage in stockpiles. We evaluated the effects of topsoil stockpiling on plant performance across diverse ecosystems impacted by mining throughout Western Australia. Methods We conducted a bioassay experiment using a widespread native Acacia species to assess how topsoil storage might impact plant growth, physiology, and nodulation by N-fixing bacteria using soils from native reference vegetation and stockpiled soils from six mine sites across Western Australia. Results Plant responses varied across mine sites, but overall plants performed better in soils collected from native vegetation, exhibiting greater biomass, more root nodules, and higher water-use efficiency compared to those grown in stockpiled soils. Soil physiochemistry showed few and minor differences between native soils and stockpiles. Conclusion Results strongly suggest observed differences in plant performance were biotic in nature. This study highlights the negative effects of topsoil storage on the biological integrity of soil across diverse ecosystems, with important implications for mine-site restoration; our results show that topsoil management can strongly influence plant performance, and stockpiled soils are likely inferior to recently disturbed topsoil for restoration purposes. We also use this study to illustrate the utility of bioassays for assessing soil quality for ecological restoration.

AB  - In this study we determined the taxonomic diversity of larval Chironomidae upstream and downstream to discharges of the sewage treatment plant (STP) from Agro-industrial District of Anapolis, State of Goias, Brazil. Additionally, we evaluated the use of the lognormal distribution as a measure of biotic integrity of this system. The Chironomidae communities were sampled in three sites, upstream and downstream of the discharge of the sewage treatment plant (STP). We fitted the truncate lognormal distribution based on a nonlinear regression of the datasets using least squares as loss function in an iterative quasi-Newton procedure. The total of 21,498 individuals were sampled, from 24 Chironomidae genera, Chironomus, Polypedilum, Rheotanytarsus e Thienemanniella, with 73.9%, 14.4%, 7.1% and 4.5%, respectively, of all analyzed community; they are generally considered resistant to organic Pollution. The assemblage of the site upstream was described for a truncate lognormal distribution. The extreme increase in abundance of some genera in the first site downstream produced a distribution not fitted to lognormal. The second site downstream however, permits a good fit to lognormal, probably due to the decrease in abundance of the dominant groups. These data substantiate the hypothesis that Chironomidae community is not Suitably characterized by lognormal distribution at disturbed environments. Consequently, these aquatic communities were ecological disordered by organic pollution which caused the lost of sensible species and the dominance of those tolerants to this sort of impact. Additionally, the study highlighted the distribution lognormal approach as a valuable method to assess environmental impacts.

AB  - Studies of the Slovakian Danube have indicated profound changes in the structures of several invertebrate assemblages in the section of the river bypassed by the Gabikovo hydroelectric project in 1992 and in adjacent floodplain water bodies. The present study investigates the relationship between hydrological connectivity and species diversity in the old main channel and adjacent left-bank water bodies, using resident cladocerans as indicators of the ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system. The work aimed to quantify cladoceran habitat preferences using habitat values (HV) and indication weights (IW) calculated from data accumulated during long-term monitoring of planktonic communities of the Danube floodplain (1,840.5-1,804 rkm) and supplemented with data from the literature. Although not listed as an indicator group in the European Union Water Framework Directive, cladocerans are shown to be highly apposite in the ecological assessment of river-floodplain systems. Of 71 recorded cladoceran species, 19 taxa showed a preference for eupotamal habitats, 24 species preferred eupotamal B/parapotamal waters, and 28 cladocerans were found to prefer the plesiopotamal/paleopotamal habitat type. Identified habitat types follow a gradient of hydrological connectivity with the main river channel, ranging from the eupotamal to more or less isolated floodplain water bodies. A secondary aim was to use the calculated values to assess the ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system. The key element of this procedure is the calculation of the Floodplain Index (FI) (Chovanec et al. Large Rivers, 15(1-4), 169-185 2005) from the summation of the habitat values and indication weights of all species present at the sampling sites. Calculated index values indicate the extent of disruption to lateral connectivity in the floodplain area.

AB  - Dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata) use both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and the abundance and diversity of odonates should be good indicators of habitat integrity. To determine which environmental variables affect odonates, we sampled adult dragonflies three times at 12 sites in Pickens and Greenville Counties, SC, USA, in different habitats, at different spatial scales, across a landscape gradient from intact forest to urban locations. At each site, we established two 2 m x 20 m plots along the shoreline of each aquatic habitat. We sampled dragonflies in ten 2 m x 2 m subplots/plot, described the vegetation and substrate in these subplots and adjacent aquatic subplots, and measured the percent cover of different landforms within 500 m of each plot center. Using nested ANOVA and Akaike information criteria models, habitat type and correlating environmental variables (substrate type and bank vegetation) were the best predictors of community structure at all spatial scales. Streams and rivers had fewer individuals and species than lakes, and had a nested subset of species found in lake communities. Landscape elements were also important, with indices declining as barren land and grasslands increased. At the largest scale, anthropogenic changes to the landscape had mixed effects. Small habitats isolated in urban areas had a significantly depauperate, nested subset of species found in communities inhabiting larger natural areas. However, odonate abundance and diversity was highest at human-made lakes and ponds, suggesting that these anthropogenic features help maintain odonate communities.

AB  - 1. In Europe, water policy is currently undergoing considerable change as emphasised by the recent European Water Framework Directive (WFD), which requires the restoration and maintenance of 'healthy' aquatic ecosystems by the assessment of their hydromorphological, chemical and biological characteristics. If the requirements of the WFD are to be met, effective biological tools are needed to measure the 'health' of rivers at scales large enough to be useful for management. These tools need to be ecologically based, efficient, rapid and applicable in different ecological regions. Among potential indicators, fish assemblages are of particular interest because of their ability to integrate environmental variability at different spatial scales. To meet the goals of the WFD, the French Water Agencies and the Ministry of the Environment initiated a research programme to develop a fish-based index that would be applicable nationwide.
   2. A variety of metrics based on occurrence and abundance data and reflecting different aspects of the fish assemblage structure and function were selected from available literature and for their potential to indicate degradation.
   3. Logistic and multiple linear regression procedures were applied, using an initial data set of 650 reference sites fairly evenly distributed across French rivers and defined by some easily measured regional and local characteristics, to elaborate the simplest possible response model that adequately explained the observed patterns of each metric for a given site.
   4. Models obtained for each metric were validated using two independent data sets of 88 reference sites and 88 disturbed sites. These procedures allowed us to select the most effective metrics in discriminating between reference and disturbed sites.

AB  - Soils are the nexus ofwater, energy and food, which illustrates the need for a holistic approach in sustainable soil management. The present study therefore aimed at identifying a bioindicator for the evaluation of soil management sustainability in a cross-disciplinary approach between soil science and multi-omics research. For this purpose we first discuss the remaining problems and challenges of evaluating sustainability and consequently suggest one measurable bioindicator for soil management sustainability. In this concept, we define soil sustainability as the maintenance of soil functional integrity. The potential to recover functional and structural integrity after a disturbance is generally defined as resilience. This potential is a product of the past and the present soil management, and at the same time prospect of possible soil responses to future disturbances. Additionally, it is correlated with the multiple soil functions and hence reflecting the multifunctionality of the soil system. Consequently, resilience can serve as a bioindicator for soil sustainability. The measurable part of soil resilience is the response diversity, calculated from the systematic contrasting of multi-omic markers for genetic potential and functional activity, and referred to as potential Maximum Ecological Performance (MEPpot) in this study. Calculating MEPpotwill allowto determine the thresholds of resistance and resilience and potential tipping points for a regime shift towards irreversible or permanent unfavorable soil states for each individual soil considered. The calculation of such ecosystem thresholds is to our opinion the current global cross-disciplinary challenge. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent interest in biological monitoring as an ecosystem assessment tool has stimulated the development of a number of biotic indices designed to aid in the evaluation of ecosystem integrity however,zooplankton have rarely been included in biomonitoring schemes. We developed a wetland zooplankton index (WZI) based oil water quality and zooplankton associations with aquatic vegetation (emergent, submergent, and floating-leaf) that could be used to assess wetland quality, in particular in marshes of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Seventy coastal and inland marshes were sampled during 1995-2000 these ranged from pristine, macrophyte-dominated systems, to highly degraded systems containing only a fringe of emergent vegetation. The index was developed based on the results of a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA), which indicated that plant-associated taxa such as chydorid and macrothricid eladocerans were common in high-quality wetlands while more open-water, pollution-tolerant taxa (e.g., Brachionus, Moina) dominated degraded wetlands. The WZI was found to be more useful than indices of diversity H', species richness) and measures of community structure (mean cladoceran Size, total abundance) for indicating wetland quality. Furthermore, an independent test of the WZI in a coastal wetland of the Great Lakes, Cootes Paradise Marsh, correctly detected moderate improvements in water quality following carp exclusion. Since wetlands used in this study covered a wide environmental and geographic range, the index should be broadly applicable to wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, while further research is required to confirm its suitability in other regions and other vegetated habitats.

AB  - Region-specific species are important as a target indicator to diagnose the ecological health or degree of impairment at various levels in aquatic ecosystems. An issue related to the selection of the target species, however, is that, if preliminary tests are not carried out, the species selected may not be an appropriate or representative candidate for biomarker or bioindicator analysis. This contribution outlines the screening process that culminated in the selection of pale chub (Zacco platypus) as the target species for evaluating ecological stream health in South Korea. Biochemical/blood chemistry response biomarkers and fish population and community model bioindicators were tested on the target species, and biomarker and bioindicator relationships with physical habitat health and water chemistry data were evaluated. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to test the relevance of the target species. Overall, the results confirmed that the target species was suitable key indicator for regional ecological health assessments.

AB  - Current ecological theories and concepts describe running waters as four-dimensional systems, their longitudinal, lateral and vertical linkages, interactions and exchange processes varying over time and over different scales. According to Ward & Stanford's (1983) extended serial discontinuity concept (ESDC), along a three-reach river, model the relative strength of the longitudinal pathways is highest in the constrained headwaters, vertical interactions reach their maximum in the braided middle course and lateral connectivity plays the major role in alluvial floodplain rivers. The present paper examines the general tenets of the ESDC from a fundamental fish ecology perspective. Specifically, it focuses on the degree to which the spatial/temporal connectivity requirements of fish communities or key fish species along a schematic longitudinal river course are compatible with the underlying principles of the ESDC and whether these requirements provide basic criteria for assessing the ecological integrity of running waters. From the fish ecological perspective, the examples provided here demonstrate a principle agreement with the concept of the four-dimensional nature of running waters, whose key functional and structural elements are spatial/temporal fluvial dynamics, disturbances, connectivity, succession and ecotones. Fish are particularly useful indicators of the temporally variable connectivities on the full range of scales at the three spatial dimensions. As far as the habitat requirements of typical species/developmental stages are concerned, two major modifications of the ESDC are needed. In constrained headwaters, in addition to longitudinal connectivity, the crucial importance of the vertical pathway river/bed sediments for reproduction must be emphasized. Also, in addition to lateral connectivity, longitudinal connectivity remains a vital basis for potamal fish communities in alluvial braided and meandering zones.

AB  - The implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC, aimed at achieving a "Good" Ecological Status of surface water bodies by 2015, indicates the adoption of a River Basin Management approach by using a model which works as a support for decision making. This work has applied the suggestions put forward by the WFD by means of a mathematical model called the Integrity Model. This represents valid support when assessing the efficiency of planned interventions which may directly or indirectly play a role in enhancing the quality of surface waters at the basin scale. Herein the results of a preliminary application limited to just two indexes on the Bacchiglione river basin, located in Northern Italy, are both presented and compared with the results of institutional monitoring activities in compliance with set technical regulations. The proposed model appears to be useful when carrying out Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) procedures in accordance with Directive 2001/42/EC concerning water management and protection plans as well as for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure to be carried out on the interventions identified.

AB  - This review summarises the most significant findings related to the issue of the quantitative and qualitative indicators of stallion ejaculates, its processing when producing chilled insemination doses and the possibility of influencing the individual steps of the entire process. Artificial insemination, with cooled-storage semen, is increasingly used in horse breeding because it offers many advantages over natural breeding. The parameters of sperm quality and, above all, the standardization of conditions in the production of cool-stored insemination doses are still not clearly specified. There is considerable scope for further development and research in this area.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the applicability of using landscape variables in conjunction with water quality and benthic data to efficiently estimate stream condition of select headwater streams in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plains. Eighty-two streams with riffle sites were selected from eight-two independent watersheds across the region for sampling and analyses. Clustering of the watersheds by landscape resulted in three distinct groups (forest, crop, and urban) which coincided with watersheds dominant land cover or use. We used non-parametric analyses to test differences in benthos and water chemistry between groups, and used regression analyses to evaluate responses of benthic communities to water chemistry within each of the landscape groups. We found that typical water chemistry measures associated with urban runoff such as specific conductance and dissolved chloride were significantly higher in the urban group. In the crop group, we found variables commonly associated with farming such as nutrients and pesticides significantly greater than in the other two groups. Regression analyses demonstrated that the numbers of tolerant and facultative macroinvertebrates increased significantly in forested watersheds with small shifts in pollutants, while in human use dominated watersheds the intolerant macroinvertebrates were more sensitive to shifts in chemicals present at lower concentrations. The results from this study suggest that landscape based clustering can be used to link upstream landscape characteristics, water chemistry and biotic integrity in order to assess stream condition and likely cause of degradation without the use of reference sites.

AB  - The ecological status classification of aquatic ecosystems using biological indices requires a number of steps, including the description and standardisation of the indices' natural variability. Here, we address this point with reference to selected Mediterranean and Black Sea lagoons, using benthic macroinvertebrates in order to: (i) explore the drivers and extent of the indices' natural variability; (ii) evaluate lagoon type-specific reference conditions and related classification boundaries; (iii) test the classification strength of the derived boundaries; and, (iv) propose recommendations for optimising ecological status classification. The considered indices showed large variation between and within the reference lagoons on both spatial and temporal scales. Among the tested descriptors of the proposed lagoon typologies, surface area, confinement and water salinity were found to be significant sources of index variability. Type-specific reference conditions and classification boundaries were then defined, improving the accuracy of ecological status assessment. At the lagoon level, classification strength increased up to 100 % in reference (least disturbed) lagoons and up to 83 % in an independent validation set of highly disturbed sites. Nevertheless, a certain degree of uncertainty was still found to affect classification at the study site level. Recommendations concerning the application of the various approaches to type-specific reference conditions and classification boundaries are given.

AB  - Hydrological conditions is a driving factor in wetland ecosystems, and excessive changes in hydrological conditions will lead to severe degradation of wetlands. Assessment of ecosystem status is essential for wetland protection and restoration. We analyze the effect of hydrological conditions on food webs from the perspective of eco-exergy. The results showed that the wet environment with low water depth (0 similar to 50cm) is conducive to the growth of aquatic plants. The suitable water depth for benthic and phytoplankton was 40 similar to 100cm, for periphyton, zooplankton and fish was 40 similar to 120cm, 80 similar to 120cm, and 80 similar to 100cm, respectively. With the increase of water depth, the trend of the eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy of plankton was basically the same, while the eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy of other aquatic organisms change in the opposite direction. The results demonstrated that water depth have a significant impact on the structure and function of the food web, the contributors of eco-exergy were producers and consumers within the water depth of 20 similar to 60cm. and the contributors of eco-exergy was the consumers within the water depth of 80 similar to 120cm. The results showed that this approach can serve as a useful tool for assessing ecosystem status by determining ecological water levels.

AB  - Accurately evaluating ecosystem status is vital for effective conservation. The Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the global standard for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse. Such tools are particularly needed for large, dynamic ecosystem complexes, such as the Indian Sundarbans mangrove forest. This ecosystem supports unique biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions, but like many mangrove forests around the world is facing substantial pressure from a range of human activities. Holistic, standardised and quantitative environment risk assessment frameworks are essential here, because previous assessments have either been qualitative in nature, or have generally considered single threats in isolation. We review these threats and utilise the RLE framework to quantitatively assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Historical clearing and diminishing fish populations drove a status of Endangered (range: Vulnerable to Endangered), and ongoing threats including climate change and reduced freshwater supply may further impact this ecosystem. However, considering recent change, the outlook is more optimistic. Mangrove extent has stabilised, and analysis of mangrove condition highlights that only a small proportion of the forest is degraded. Using the RLE provides an authoritative avenue for further protection and recognition of the issues facing this UNESCO World Heritage Site. We also identify knowledge and data gaps in the Sundarbans that are likely common to coastal systems globally. By articulating these and presenting opportunities and recommendations, we aim to further the conservation goals of the IUCN and the implementation of its new assessment framework.

AB  - A In view of the rapid proliferation of water infrastructures worldwide, balancing human and ecosystem needs for water resources is a critical environmental challenge of global significance. While there is abundant literature on the environmental impacts of individual water infrastructures, little attention has been paid to their cumulative effects in river networks, which may have basin-to-global impacts on freshwater ecology. Here we developed a methodological framework based on Pareto frontier analysis for optimizing trade-offs between water withdrawal and ecological indicators. We applied this framework to a mountainous Ecuadorian headwater river network that is part of a continental water transfer for supply and demand management to optimize ecological conditions and the operation of 11 water intake structures used to provide potable water to the city of Quito. We found that the current water intake configuration has an important effect on the total length of fifth-order stream sections (65% reduction compared to premanaged condition) and isolates 70.9% of the headwater stream length. The Pareto frontier analysis identified water intake portfolios (i.e., different combinations of intake sites) that decreased ecological impacts by 7.8% points (pp) and 13.0 pp for connectivity and stream order change, respectively, while meeting Quito's water demands. Additional portfolios accounting for monthly variability in water demand and resources further decrease the ecological impact up to 9.6 pp in connectivity and 13.4 pp in stream order. These eco-friendly portfolios suggest that adaptive management at basin level may help optimize water withdrawal to fulfill urban demands while preserving ecological integrity.

AB  - Within the CRENODAT project (Biodiversity assessment and integrity evaluation of springs of Trentino - Italian Alps - and long-term ecological research, 2004-2008) we studied a total of 90 springs in Trentino (south-eastern Alps, Italy), 75 of which were used for statistical analysis. The springs were grouped into seven different types and represented all the available lithologies in the study area. Macrozoobenthos (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera; EPT) was collected from stones, bryophytes and sediments. We investigated which physical, chemical or environmental features were important in determining EPT assemblage metrics at sites, by calculating the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and applying a one-way ANOVA test, ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses. Statistical results highlighted the island character of the springs, each spring having its specific history and abiotic characteristics, which select for unique community patterns. For the faunistic analyses, we considered all springs where EPT taxa were recorded; a total of 88 taxa. Highest species richness was recorded among the Trichoptera, followed by the Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera, with 52, 30 and 6 taxa respectively. Fifteen Trichoptera and three Plecoptera species were recorded as new for the Autonomous Province of Trento. Our results confirm that, in the harsh environment of the Alps, the mild and stable ecological conditions that characterize spring-fed brooks contribute to maintaining and enhancing the regional biodiversity. Springs act as refuge areas for stream biota, providing more favourable conditions during spates or droughts (common in Alpine headwaters), or for particular stages of the insect life cycles. Springs also provide specific habitats for strictly crenobiontic species.

AB  - The sustainability of energy supplies depends highly on the integrity of natural gas pipelines that often compromised by corrosion deleterious effects. The integrity commitment to safety is intuitively achieved by establishing robust protection systems, such as coating and cathodic protection (CP). The objective of this study is to predict failure indicators by identifying parameters that may adversely impact the pipeline protection. In this study, an in-house CP system and pipes network were designed to track the corrosion evolution. Pipe-to soil potential (P/S) measurement was proposed in this research as a monitoring strategy for judging whether a pipe is adequately protected. One of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) International acceptance criteria recommending -0.850 V as a minimum instant-off potential for a pipeline to be considered protected was chosen as a baseline. The parameters evaluated in this study were the effect of the coating and the number of anodes of the ground bed. P/S of coated and bare pipes that have been installed since 1995 were measured at different conditions. Surprisingly, the comparative analysis conducted to assess the protection level of coated and uncoated pipes revealed that P/S potentials for both pipes were close and above -0.850 V. This indicates that the pipes were cathodically protected. The similarities in potential readings could be referred to the rust layer that accumulated on the bare pipes' surfaces and acts as a passive barrier similar to coating. Another interesting observation is that the P/S potentials increase gradually as the numbers of the anodes decreases. The results showed that decreasing the anodes numbers by 25-50% has little to no impact on the P/S potentials change, as the reading in the range of -1.473 to -1.666 V. However the P/S potentials reading abrupt to the range of -2.217 to -2.695 V when the number of anodes reduced by 75%. Although the increase in the P/S potentials appears to be beneficial, in fact, this increase can be considered as a negative indicator since the elevated potential implies that the anode discharges a high electrons influx which in turn shortens its lifetime.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD) on selected parameters of equine gametes under controlled in vitro conditions. Assessments covered maturation of oocytes as well as sperm-cell function and structure. In the first part of the experiment, the influence of different concentrations of TCDD (0.32 ng, 3.2 ng, and 32 ng/mL) on in vitro maturation (IVM) of equine oocytes was evaluated. During IVM, 28.38% of the oocytes reached the metaphase II (matured) stage at a TCDD concentration of 0.32 ng/mL and only 5.14% at a concentration of 3.2 ng/mL. In group, with the highest concentration of TCDD in the medium (32 ng), matured oocytes were not observed. In the second part of experiment, the influence of TCDD (0.32 ng, 3.2 ng, and 32 ng/mL) on sperm parameters, such as motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), apoptosis, and chromatin status, was evaluated. The present study demonstrates that moderate concentrations of TCDD may activate population of motile sperm cells under in vitro conditions with no influence on sperm-cell structure or LPO. Moreover, the modulation of motility function of sperm was confirmed by the detection of the evident increase of cell number with high mitochondrial potential. Dioxins exert negative impact on both female and male reproductive systems. Thus, an overall analysis of both systems will advance scientific knowledge on the impact of toxic agents on the reproductive system. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic habitat condition assessments are a requirement under various environmental directives. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), for example, challenges member states in a European sea region to perform comparable assessments of good environmental status and improve coherence of their monitoring programmes by 2020. Currently, North Sea countries operate independent monitoring programmes using nationally defined assessment areas. Lack of an agreed OSPAR or EU scale monitoring method and programme has been identified as a priority science need. This paper proposes a method for the development of a coherent and efficient spatial sampling design for benthic habitats on regional level and gives advice on optimal monitoring effort to get more accurate assessments. We use ecologically relevant assessment areas (strata) across national borders and test spatial sample allocation methods. Furthermore, we investigate the number of samples needed in each stratum to reduce the variance for estimating mean number of taxa and abundance. The stratification needs to take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the entire ecosystem. The total sample effort is optimal when sample allocation takes into account the size and benthic variability within those strata. Change point analysis helps to find a balance between sampling effort and precision of the benthic parameter estimate. A joint sampling design for the North Sea could be generated by combining current efforts, and where needed adapting existing national programmes. This serves a coordinated, region-wide, benthic condition status assessment and strengthens regional cooperation to fulfil multiple monitoring tasks, with a scientifically underpinned common approach.

AB  - Management for the future sustainability and integrity of our nation's ecological resources requires concepts and tools for measuring status and trends in these resources at multiple spatial and temporal scales and at multiple levels of biological organization. Key elements of this process are ecologically meaningful indicators and cost-effective monitoring designs. The Environ mental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) advances the science needed for measuring ecosystem condition and trends. Most recently the EMAP approach has been successfully used by participants in the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA), including EPA's Office of Research and Development, EPA's Region III, and the States of the Mid-Atlantic. The participants in MAIA have produced a regional landscape atlas, state of the estuaries report, and state of the streams report. The work in MAIA is currently moving from monitoring into the assessment phase. The Western EMAP Pilot (Western Pilot), will be a test of our current MAIA indicators and technology for applicability in western ecosystems. New indicators and designs may be needed in the Western Pilot for assessments at the level of EPA's Regions, of the states, and of the Tribes; these assessments will be done so that they can be combined to provide regional assessments. Our coastal monitoring program in the Western estuaries will also be initiated shortly. Subsequently, this will be expanded to the Gulf and Atlantic coasts to provide the current condition of our national estuaries. By continuing to improve the science of monitoring, EMAP researchers will remove data gaps and allow the unequivocal assessment of the health of the nation's resources.

AB  - There are increasing concerns for the ecological health of rivers, and their ability to provide important ecosystem services. Frameworks describing the character and condition of rivers have been developed in many parts of the world but rarely include river ecosystem services. South East Asia is a region with some of the world's great rivers-Mekong, Salween and Ayeyarwady-running through six different countries, but data on river ecological character and condition is patchy and inconsistent. Development pressures on these rivers has never been higher, and ecosystem services may be lost before being described and valued. The development of a framework of ecological importance is envisaged, which maps out the relative contributions of river reaches to a wide range of ecosystem services. This could be a tool for river basin planning and water resource management, baseline information for impact assessment of infrastructure (for example, hydropower and irrigation), and for protecting ecologically important areas. We asked a diverse group of 109 river basin planners, and water and natural resource management professionals in the region whether a framework of ecological importance would support their activities, and which river ecosystem services are most important to be assessed. Our findings allow prioritisation of river ecosystem services to be assessed and mapped according to importance in different river reaches and sub-basins within the region. The locations of ranked threats and pressures on the river systems allow indication of river health and integrity in these sub-basins. We consider the feasibility of measuring ecosystem services and pressures through the identification of appropriate indicators, methods, and availability of global, regional, and national data.

AB  - Changes in land use have manifold effects on stream ecosystems. Consequently, the degradation of watersheds can cause extreme responses if the resilience of the stream is exceeded, triggering changes in fish communities and a reorganization of the ecosystem. Fish community surveys are frequently used to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic pressures on freshwater streams. Dynamic indices such as individual growth are also interesting because they integrate the effects of environmental conditions through time, providing an assessment in the long term. In this study we have investigated the ecological implications of watershed land use cover on fish diversity and growth of the generalist species Umbra limi (central mud-minnow) in six streams in Southern Ontario (Canada). In detail, the growth of U. limi has been explored using a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model, which pursues a mechanistic explanation of the bioenergetics of an individual under different environmental conditions. Given the mechanistic approach, the outcomes of the DEB model can provide a solid foundation for extrapolating the conclusions of this study to a broader spatial scale. The results of this study reveal that the proportion of modified land use of the watershed (agricultural and urban land) can reach a tipping point beyond which the functioning of the stream abruptly changes. Consequently, land use cover may be used as a precautionary indicator for watershed management. The results also demonstrate that U. limi could be used as a sentinel species to identify potential impacts on fish diversity and size-at-age as a cost-effective indicator for stream monitoring programs.

AB  - The landscape surrounding Sudbury, Ontario, has been severely affected by 100 years of mining and forestry and a recent, large-scale ecological risk assessment found that terrestrial plant communities continue to be impaired by remnant metals and poor soil conditions. We investigated the risks of these adverse landscape conditions on a small headwater stream by digitizing land cover at a fine scale and relating it to benthic invertebrate diversity and metal concentrations at 13 sites in the system. The combination of historically barren landscape and modern impervious surfaces such as asphalt, roofs, and hard gravel was associated with decreased benthic invertebrate community diversity at all four watershed spatial scales measured. The same combination of barren bedrock and impervious surface was associated with increased levels of potentially toxic Ni, whereas increased Cu was most strongly associated with bedrock alone. Our results highlight previously undocumented relationships in this historically impacted area between unrestored landscapes, modern impervious surfaces, and their potential risks to aquatic life. We suggest regreening at different watershed scales as a risk mitigation tactic worthy of consideration and further study.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon is under threat from more frequent and intense forest fires, with a few studies showing negative consequences for forest integrity and the biodiversity. However, the impacts of this disturbance on tropical forests remain mostly unknown. We investigate the impacts of forest fires on community parameters and biomass of dung beetles, a cost-effective indicator of disturbance and overall biodiversity, in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results indicate that burned forests harbor a modified dung beetle community, with altered abundance, community composition, and structure. Burned forest samples had lower total biomass and were dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. Large-bodied tunneler species were negatively impacted, responding to changes in environmental characteristics such as soil compaction. Lower biomass and higher predominance of smaller species in burned forest is likely to impact dung beetle-mediated ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. Our results support that forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon pose a serious threat to local biodiversity and habitat integrity.

AB  - The water flea Daphnia pulex, a small crustacean that lives in freshwater ponds, undergoes parthenogenesis and gamogenesis according to environmental conditions. In D. pulex, different morphological characteristics can be observed using a microscope during aging. In this study, we recorded the growth, reproduction, and survival indicators of parthenogenetic D. pulex females to analyze the morphological changes that occur during senescence. We observed the growth and development of the parthenogenetic females on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days by using scanning electron microscopy and ultrastructure of the gonads on the 7th, 14th and 21st days with transmission electron microscopy. We found that body length and reproductive capacity in the parthenogenetic individuals first increased and then decreased with aging, and the survival rate decreased gradually. The depression of the brood pouch on the back of the parthenogenetic females implied a decline in gonadal function and gradual aging. During senescence, the number of lipid droplets in the gonads of the parthenogenetic females decreased, and the integrity of the mitochondria and peroxisome was destroyed. The results of our study revealed the morphological characteristics of senescence in D. pulex.

AB  - Osmotic stress represents one of the major environmental challenges experienced by yeast during industrial fermentations. This stress is particularly associated with high-gravity processes, which utilize concentrated substrates to yield products with elevated concentrations of ethanol. The aims of this work were to quantitatively measure factors affecting extracellular osmotic pressure (osmolality) during brewing fermentations and to determine their effects on yeast at the physiological and molecular level. Osmolality was observed to increase during fermentation owing predominantly to ethanol production, indicating a strong relationship between these environmental parameters. High osmolality was shown to have a negative impact on yeast physiology, viability, and vitality, and although genome integrity was unaffected, cell membrane fluidity became altered. These data not only demonstrate the occurrence of an increase in osmotic pressure during fermentation but also provide an explanation for the decrease in yeast quality typically observed under high-gravity conditions. The results presented here are directly relevant to all brewery fermentations worldwide and have applications within associated industries in which microorganisms are used for ethanol production, including food products, alcoholic beverages, and biofuels.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine if metrics for ant species assemblages can be used as indicators of rangeland condition, and to determine the influence of vegetation and ground cover variables, factors often influenced by livestock grazing, on ant communities. The study was conducted in two areas in the Great Basin: a sagebrush-steppe in southeastern Idaho (n = 30 sites), and a salt-desert shrub in western Utah (n = 27 sites). Sites were selected based on known rangeland condition (i.e. good, fair, poor) associated with livestock grazing. Ant communities differed considerably between the two study areas. Collectively, more ant species occurred at the Idaho sites (30) than at the Utah sites (21), relatively few species (eight) occurred in both areas, species richness was significantly greater at the Idaho sites (mean = 12(.)0 species) than the Utah sites (mean = 6(.)9 species), and Formica spp. were diverse (total of 15 species) at the Idaho sites but rare (one species) at the Utah sites. In Idaho, all species collectively, generalists, and Formica spp. were significantly less abundant on sites in poor condition than that on sites in good or fair condition, whereas in Utah, seed harvesters and Pheidole spp. were significantly more abundant on sites in poor condition than that on sites in good or fair condition. In Idaho, species richness was significantly lower on sites in poor condition. In Idaho, species richness and relative abundances of several ant groups were significantly related to bare patch size and parameters for cover or species richness of several vegetation groups. In contrast to the comparisons involving sites in poor condition, no differences in ant communities in either Idaho or Utah were evident between sites in good and fair condition. Thus, the ant communities responded only to large changes in rangeland condition and to large differences in climatic/edaphic conditions between the two areas. Hence, ant community metrics appear to have limited utility as indicators of rangeland condition in the Great Basin. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Flow variability is a potential indicator of land use impacts on aquatic ecosystems and a dominating factor for lotic habitats. Vegetation management effects on the stream habitat conditions must be better understood to propose forest management activities that are compatible with general ecosystem management objectives (integrity, diversity, sustainability, etc.). In our study, we used long term flow data (1936-2004) from four gauged experimental watersheds (W1, W2, W17, W18) of Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in US to assess the impacts of pine conversion on flow characteristics by using paired watershed experimentation. In W1, all trees and shrubs were cut and burned in 1956-57 and white pine (Pinus strobus) was planted in 1957. In W17, white pine was planted in 1956. W2 and W18 have been kept untreated as reference watersheds for W1 and W17, respectively. After analyzing long-term daily flow series with flow duration curves and frequency analyzes, we found that the timing and magnitude of 7Q flows were changed significantly due to conversion but flow variability was not affected. Overall findings revealed that pine conversion has significantly influenced some flow characteristics but stream habitat conditions were not affected potentially.

AB  - Definition of ecological integrity based on community analysis has long been a critical issue in risk assessment for sustainable ecosystem management. In this work, two indices (i.e., Shannon index and exergy) were selected for the analysis of community properties of benthic macroinvertebrate community in streams in Korea. For this purpose, the means and variances of both indices were analyzed. The results found an extra scope of structural and functional properties in communities in response to environmental variabilities and anthropogenic disturbances. The combination of these two parameters (four indices) was feasible in identification of disturbance agents (e.g., industrial pollution or organic pollution) and specifying states of communities. The four-aforementioned parameters (means and variances of Shannon index and exergy) were further used as input data in a self-organizing map for the characterization of water quality. Our results suggested that Shannon index and exergy in combination could be utilized as a suitable reference system and would be an efficient tool for assessment of the health of aquatic ecosystems exposed to environmental disturbances.

AB  - We consider the theoretical and methodological aspects and the experience of using methods for characterizing the ecological status (ES) of fluvial systems. The problems of development of multilevel and multi-criteria classifications of ES; stages and results of assessment research are discussed. Evaluation of ES can be performed on the basis of biocentrism in the study of fluvial systems or with an anthropocentric approach that takes into account the planning of fluvial systems use for various purposes with special attention to environment conservation and resource reproduction. Such an approach determines the axiological base and the choice of necessary and sufficient criteria and evaluation priorities. The assessment scales were developed in consideration of each component evaluation and indicator approach and can use incomplete, inaccurate, non-numerical assessments data. It was concluded that ES is an example of a system emergent property that combines its ability to produce organic substances in accordance with the natural history of fluvial systems, to maintain high quality of the habitat and biota, high biodiversity, resistance to changes in natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts; high velocity in the system of natural purification and low velocity of pollution and acidification; and maintenance of outlined system properties over a long time period. This research is focused on the development of models for quantitative integral assessment of the state of fluvial systems, their systemic properties that are characterized by the emergence of new functional units (integral indicators of different groups, summarizing indicators) that reflect the system integrity, serve as the base for taxonomy, and allow comparison of the state of systems in space and time. Integral assessment assumes the implementation of assessment with some uncertainty, taking into consideration different phases of the unification of multicriterial preliminary assessments with evaluation of their significance for overall assessment. This may take into account the significance of various indicators and their input to consolidated value. The development of integral indicators of ES is discussed in hypothetical examples of river drainage basin systems and on the base of assessment of ES of the river itself (Msta River) and its drainage basin (landscape).

AB  - Surveys of southern Irish rivers and streams confirmed the presence of five sponge species: Ephydatia Racekiela ryderi, Spongilla lacustris, Ephydatia muelleri and Eunapius fragilis, in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence. The putative 'amphiatlantic' species R. ryderi, which is largely absent from Europe, was found to be of relatively common occurrence in south-western rivers, at unpolluted sites (Ecological Quality Ratio >= 0.7) with soft water, where it largely replaces Ephydatia fluviatilis, the most common species found throughout the whole study area in a wide range of water-quality conditions. Spongilla lacustris, the commonest species in Irish lakes, was found at 16% of Spongillidae river sites, while the uncommon but relatively widely distributed E. muelleri was identified from some 10% of these sites. Identification, by analysis of spicule morphology, was carried out using optical microscopy with SEM performed on some samples, and the identity of the very rare Irish species E. fragilis confirmed by DNA gene sequencing. The findings signify that while freshwater sponges could, because of their large filtration rate, have a role as sentinel bioaccumulators in monitoring toxic pollution of aquatic ecosystems, the wide tolerances of Spongillidae to water-quality conditions may militate against their use as indicator species to measure ecological integrity.

AB  - Multivariate predictive models are widely used tools for assessment of aquatic ecosystem health and models have been successfully developed for the prediction and assessment of aquatic macroinvertebrates, diatoms, local stream habitat features and fish. We evaluated the ability of a modelling method based on the River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) to accurately predict freshwater fish assemblage composition and assess aquatic ecosystem health in rivers and streams of south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The predictive model was developed, validated and tested in a region of comparatively high environmental variability due to the unpredictable nature of rainfall and river discharge. The model was concluded to provide sufficiently accurate and precise predictions of species composition and was sensitive enough to distinguish test sites impacted by several common types of human disturbance (particularly impacts associated with catchment land use and associated local riparian, in-stream habitat and water quality degradation). The total number of fish species available for prediction was low in comparison to similar applications of multivariate predictive models based on other indicator groups, yet the accuracy and precision of our model was comparable to outcomes from such studies. In addition, our model developed for sites sampled on one occasion and in one season only (winter), was able to accurately predict fish assemblage composition at sites sampled during other seasons and years, provided that they were not subject to unusually extreme environmental conditions (e.g. extended periods of low flow that restricted fish movement or resulted in habitat desiccation and local fish extinctions).

AB  - The intent of long-term ecological monitoring is to document changes in important properties of biological communities. At the least, a long-term monitoring system should be designed to detect long-term trends in three key attributes: soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and the biotic integrity of the system. There are four basic guidelines for developing integrated soil-vegetation monitoring systems for rangelands. These are: (1) identifying a suite of indicators which are consistently correlated with the functional status of one or more critical ecosystem processes and/or properties; (2) selecting base indicators on site specific objectives and resource concerns, and inherent soil and site characteristics; (3) using spatial variability in developing and interpreting indicators to make them more representative of ecological processes; and (4) interpreting indicators in the context of an understanding of dynamic, nonlinear ecological processes. To the extent possible, indicators should reflect early changes in ecological processes and indicate that a more significant change is likely to occur. In addition to these guidelines, measurements included in long-term monitoring systems should be rapidly applied, simple to understand, inexpensive to use, and quantitatively repeatable.

AB  - The expansion of agriculture is particularly worrying in tropical regions of the world, where native forests are being replaced by crops at alarming rates, with severe consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems. However, there is little information about the potential effects of agriculture on the functioning of tropical streams, which is essential if we are to assess the condition and ecological integrity of these ecosystems. We conducted a litter decomposition experiment in streams within a tropical catchment, which were subjected to different degrees of agricultural influence: low (protected area, PA), medium (buffer area, BA) and high (agricultural area, AA). We quantified decomposition rates of litter enclosed within coarse-mesh and fine-mesh bags, which allowed the distinction of microbial and detritivore-mediated decomposition pathways. We used litter of three riparian species representing a gradient in litter quality (Alnus acuminate > Ficus irtsipida > Querns burnelioides), and examined detritivore assemblages through the contents of litterbags and benthic samples. We found that the increasing agricultural influence promoted microbial decomposition, probably due to nutrient-mediated stimulation; and inhibited detritivore-mediated and total decomposition because of reduced detritivore numbers, most likely caused by pesticides and sedimentation. Effects were evident for Alnus and Ficus, but not for Querns, which was barely decomposed across the gradient. Our study provides key evidence about the impact of agriculture on topical stream ecosystem functioning, which is associated to changes in stream assemblages and may have far-reaching repercussions for global biochemical cycles.

AB  - The river ecosystem in the Hai River Basin (HRB), an important economic region in China, is seriously degraded. With the aim of river restoration in the HRB, we developed a method to assess the river's ecological status and conducted a preliminary application of the method. The established method was a predictive model, which used macroinvertebrates as indicator organisms. The river's ecological status was determined by calculating the ratio of observed to expected values (O/E). The method included ecoregionalization according to natural factors, and the selection of reference sites based on combinations of habitat quality and macroinvertebrate community. Macroinvertebrate taxa included Insecta, Crustacea, Gastropoda, and Oligochaeta, with 39 families and 95 genera identified in the HRB. The HRB communities were dominated by pollution tolerant taxa, such as Lymnaeidae, Chironomus, Limnodrilus, Glyptotendipes, and Tubifex. The average Shannon-Wiener index was 1.40 +/- 0.5, indicating a low biodiversity. In the river length of 3.31 x 10(4) km, 55% of the sites were designated poor, with a bad ecological status. Among nine secondary river systems, Luan and Zi-ya had the best and worst river conditions, respectively. Only 17 reference site groups were selected for river management in the 41 ecoregions examined. This study lays the foundation for river restoration and related research in the HRB, and we anticipate further developments of this novel method.

AB  - Aquatic plants in agricultural landscapes play a vital role in maintaining the ecological integrity within the aquatic systems while facing an array of disturbances. Among them, information on herbicide exposure on non-target aquatic plants is scarce. The present study was designed to fill this information gap by detecting the impacts of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) on Hydrilla verticillata using morpho-anatomical and physiological biomarkers and assessing the environmental risk of MCPA to the non-target environment. H. verticillata was exposed to different MCPA concentrations (10, 100, 500, 1000g/L) and control (0g/L) for 7days. At the end of the experiment, plant growth, pigments, H2O2 content, peroxidase activity (POD) and plant anatomy were compared. The environmental risk was assessed using predicted environmental concentration/predicted no effect concentration (PEC:PNEC) ratio, hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). Control plants exhibited the highest growth, and a growth decline was noted in parallel to MCPA exposure, where a similar trend was detected for the plant pigment contents. MCPA induced chlorosis and oxidative stress in H. verticillata. Risk analysis detected high values for PEC:PNEC ratios (3-9), HQ (1.92-5.79) and HI (28.15). MCPA-exposed H. verticillata could recover once those plants received natural conditions. Overall, present findings showed the negative impacts of MCPA on non-target aquatic plant H. verticillata. These findings will be useful to clarify the interaction between agrochemicals and non-target aquatic plants. Such information would benefit to decide the criteria in aquatic ecosystem management.

AB  - The influence of spatial differences, which are caused by different anthropogenic disturbances, and temporal changes, which are caused by natural conditions, on macroinvertebrates with periphyton communities in Baiyangdian Lake was compared. Periphyton and macrobenthos assemblage samples were simultaneously collected on four occasions during 2009 and 2010. Based on the physical and chemical attributes in the water and sediment, the 8 sampling sites can be divided into 5 habitat types by using cluster analysis. According to coefficients variation analysis (CV), three primary conclusions can be drawn: (1) the metrics of Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Percent Tolerant Taxa (PTT), Percent dominant taxon (PDT), and community loss index (CLI), based on macroinvertebrates, and the metrics of algal density (AD), the proportion of chlorophyta (CHL), and the proportion of cyanophyta (CYA), based on periphytons, were mostly constant throughout our study; (2) in terms of spatial variation, the CV values in the macroinvertebratebased metrics were lower than the CV values in the periphyton-based metrics, and these findings may be caused by the effects of changes in environmental factors; whereas, the CV values in the macroinvertebrate-based metrics were higher than those in the periphyton-based metrics, and these results may be linked to the influences of phenology and life history patterns of the macroinvertebrate individuals; and (3) the CV values for the functionalbased metrics were higher than those for the structuralbased metrics. Therefore, spatial and temporal variation for metrics should be considered when assessing applying the biometrics.

AB  - Oil and gas wells are engineered with barriers to prevent fluid movement along the wellbore. If the integrity of one or more of these barriers fails, it may result in subsurface leakage of natural gas outside the well casing, a process termed fugitive gas migration (GM). Knowledge of the occurrence and causes of GM is essential for effective management of associated potential risks. In the province of British Columbia, Canada (BC), oil and gas producers are required to report well drilling, completion, production, and abandonment records for all oil and gas wells to the provincial regulator. This well data provides a unique opportunity to identify well characteristics with higher likelihoods for GM to develop. Here we employ Bayesian multilevel logistic regression to understand the associations between various well attributes and reported occurrences of GM in 0.6% of the 25,000 oil and gas wells in BC. Our results indicate that there is no association between the occurrence of GM and hydraulic fracturing. Overall, there appears to be no well construction or operation attribute in the study database that is conclusively associated with GM. Wells with GM more frequently exhibit indicators of well integrity loss (i.e., surface casing vent flow, remedial treatments, and blowouts) and geographic location appears to be important. We ascribe the spatial dustering of GM cases to the local geologic environment, and we speculate that there are links between particular intermediate gas-bearing formations and GM occurrence in the Fort Nelson Plains Area. The results of this study suggest that oil and gas wells in high GM occurrence areas and those showing any attribute associated with integrity failure (e.g., surface casing vent flow) should be prioritized for monitoring to improve the detection of GM.

AB  - The Appalachian Trail (AT) traverses the Appalachian Mountains across 11 degrees of latitude from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Maine's Mt. Katahdin. The 3,524 km (2,190-mile) long trail is buffered within a conserved corridor that is at least similar to 305 m wide and covers approximately 101,000 hectacres (250,000 acres) overseen by the National Park Service (NPS), making it one of the largest NPS units in the East. Although a continuous marked trail has been established since 1937, protection of the corridor was not complete until the last couple of decades. Additional conservation designations exist adjacent to much of the trail corridor, but significant gaps in protection remain. A variety of land trusts and other non-profit conservation organizations, federal and state land management agencies, and regional trail clubs overseen by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) actively seek to add to the local, regional, and national conservation significance of this landscape or to improve the management of lands already protected. Here, we assess biodiversity and ecological integrity along the entire AT among 2,123 trail sampling segments and four planning regions. We evaluated gradients of biodiversity and ecological integrity in relation to the existing management status of trail sampling segments to identify gaps in protection of high value areas. The AT possesses high species diversity at the southern end, where much of it exists in federal multiple-use management, and high ecological integrity in the north on private timberlands. Inadequately protected areas of such high biological diversity and ecological integrity occur throughout the trail. Our data are analyzed at the scale of the entire AT with summaries and comparisons among broad sections, regions, states, and some specific locations. We include our spatial data so that it may be used for analyses and prioritization at multiple scales from the local maintenance club to the ATC.

AB  - Economic cost-benefit appraisal (and its sub-set cost-effectiveness) of ecosystem conservation and/or pollution abatement strategies have proved to be powerful decision-making aids. But the monetary economic valuation of ecosystem goods and services (gains and losses) can only provide a good indication of social welfare impacts under certain conditions and in selective contexts. The values derived through this appraisal process will, for a number of measures, be underestimates of the full total system value [Turner, R.K., Paavola, J., Cooper, P. Farber, S., Jessamy, V., Georgiou, S., 2003. Valuing nature: lessons learned and future research directions. Ecol. Econ. 46, 493-510]. The economic analysis is best suited to assessing the value of 'marginal' gains and losses in ecosystem goods/services and not the total destruction of whole systems (including life support systems, the value of which is not commensurate with monetary values and/or is infinitely high). In this study economic costs and what we call 'ecological risk' analysis are used to appraise the implementation costs and ecological benefits of selected measures for combating eutrophication. Ecological risk is expressed in terms of ecosystem integrity and resilience. The paper presents three regional case studies dealing with the issue of nutrient emission reduction to the southern North Sea, namely the catchments/estuaries of the Humber (UK), the Rhine (Germany and The Netherlands) and the Elbe (Czech Republic and Germany). On the basis of these comparative regional examples, wider implications in the light of international management of the North Sea are presented. A range of nutrient reduction scenarios have been deployed within the overall OSPAR target agreement of 50% nitrogen and phosphorous reduction compared with 1985 levels. Each scenario assumes pollution reduction measures, characterised in terms of their overall implementation costs and nutrient-reduction effects. Specific policy instruments analysed were: the creation of more intertidal habitat via managed coastal realignment in the Humber area, farm-based land cover changes in the Rhine catchment and a mix of agricultural regime and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) improvements in the Elbe area. The ecological consequences associated with each reduction scenario have been modelled [using the ERSEM model, see Baretta, J.W., Ebenhoh, W., Ruardij, P., 1995. An overview over the European Regional Sea Ecosystem Model, a complex marine ecosystem model. Neth. J. Sea Res. 33 (3/4), 233-2461 for the coastal zones supplied from the rivers Elbe, Humber and Rhine. The modelled ecological quality indicators, which describe scenario effects on the coastal zone ecosystem, are then aggregated in terms of ecosystem integrity and ecological risk. The results are presented in terms of two selected key-indicators: implementation costs of the abatement measures and changes in ecological risk status, across the different catchments and assuming different scenarios. They thus provide a possible basis for international agreement negotiations at the North Sea scale. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are widely used indicators of human impacts on stream ecosystems because they are very responsive to changing environmental conditions. However, little research has explicitly focused on their reliability with regards to temporal variation in assemblage structure and environmental conditions. We examined variability in diatom-environment relationships at bi-weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales from 7 reference, 7 agricultural, and 2 acid mine drainage (AMD)-impacted streams, and how nutrient and pH fluctuations may affect the interpretation of diatom metrics and the Diatom Model Affinity (DMA) index. Reference streams had less bi-weekly variability in NO3-N concentrations than non-reference streams. The % eutraphentic diatoms and DMA scores were more strongly correlated with seasonal means of NO3-N and PO4-P concentrations than with same day concentrations. Most nutrient indicator metrics had strong correlations with watershed land use. All 14 non-AMD streams experienced substantial increases in NO3-N and decreases in temperature from November to May, which were associated with high species turnover, substantial changes in community structure, reduced diversity and richness, increased relative abundances of high nutrient diatoms, and decreases in low nutrient diatoms and DMA scores. The % acidophilic diatoms and DMA scores were significantly correlated with increased pH associated with greater precipitation at AMD sites from December to April (r=-0.77, r=0.62, respectively; P<0.01). Yearly, DMA scores for all reference streams were consistently in the minimally impaired category, whereas scores for non-reference streams varied among impairment categories. Reference sites serve as reliable benchmarks for diatom ecological integrity during the summer. In this region, June to October is a recommended time period for diatom sampling in monitoring programs because subsequent shifts in hydrologic regimes, nutrients, and diatom assemblages occurred, affecting all sites and masking among stream differences attributable to agricultural land uses.

AB  - Most studies dealing with the use of ecological indicators and other applied ecological research rely on some definition or concept of what constitutes least-, intermediate- and most-disturbed condition. Currently, most rigorous methodologies designed to define those conditions are suited to large spatial extents (nations, ecoregions) and many sites (hundreds to thousands). The objective of this study was to describe a methodology to quantitatively define a disturbance gradient for 40 sites in each of two small southeastern Brazil river basins. The assessment of anthropogenic disturbance experienced by each site was based solely on measurements strictly related to the intensity and extent of anthropogenic pressures. We calculated two indices: one concerned site-scale pressures and the other catchment-scale pressures. We combined those two indices into a single integrated disturbance index (IDI) because disturbances operating at both scales affect stream biota. The local- and catchment-scale disturbance indices were weakly correlated in the two basins (r= 0.21 and 0.35) and both significantly (p < 0.05) reduced site EPT (insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) richness. The IDI also performed well in explaining EPT richness in the basin that presented the stronger disturbance gradient (R-2 = 0.39, p < 0.001). Natural habitat variability was assessed as a second source of variation in EPT richness. Stream size and microhabitats were the key habitat characteristics not related to disturbances that enhanced the explanation of EPT richness over that attributed to the IDI. In both basins the IDI plus habitat metrics together explained around 50% of EPT richness variation. In the basin with the weaker disturbance gradient, natural habitat explained more variation in EFT richness than did the IDI, a result that has implications for biomonitoring studies. We conclude that quantitatively defined disturbance gradients offer a reliable and comprehensive characterization of anthropogenic pressure that integrates data from different spatial scales.

AB  - Ecological studies on phenotypic plasticity illustrate the relevance of this phenomenon in nature. Conditions of biota reflect environmental changes, highlighting the adaptability of resident species that can be used as bioindicators of such changes. We report the morpho-anatomical plasticity of leaves of Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leechm. ex Moldenke, Laguncularia racemosa (L) C.F.Gaertn. and Rhizophora mangle L, evaluated in three estuaries (Vitoria bay, Santa Cruz and Itaunas River; state of Espirito Santo, Brazil), considering five areas of mangrove ecosystems with diverse environmental issues. Two sampling sites are part of the Ecological Station Lameirao Island in Vitoria bay, close to a harbor. A third sampling site in Cariacica (Vitoria bay) is inside the Vitoria harbor and also is influenced by domestic sewage. The fourth studied area (Santa Cruz) is part of Piraque Mangrove Ecological Reservation, while the fifth (Itaunas River) is a small mangrove, with sandy sediment and greater photosynthetically active radiation, also not strongly influenced by anthropic activity. Results pointed out the morpho-anatomical plasticity in studied species, showing that A. schaueriana and L. racemosa might be considered the most appropriate bioindicators to indicate different settings and environmental conditions. Particularly, the dry mass per leaf area (LMA) of A. schaueriana was the main biomarker measured. In our study, LMA of A. schaueriana was positively correlated with salinity (Spearman 0.71), Mn content (0.81) and pH (0.82) but negatively correlated with phosphorus content (-0.63). Thus, the evaluation of modification in LMA of A. schaueriana pointed out changes among five studied sites, suggesting its use to reflect changes in the environment, which could be also useful in the future to evaluate the climate change.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) are appealing scalar-valued tools for policy makers when rating ecosystems with respect to biological conditions that are not directly measurable. For conventional assessment of ecological health using MMIs, the quantitative calibration of health qualities can be specific to the investigator, and to the geographical region and time frame of interest. We propose a statistical-model-based approach that provides a systematic mechanism to construct MMIs; our approach aims to address some common issues of conventional practices, including the loss of information from data, spatio-temporal restrictions, and concerns over arbitrariness and costs. Our latent health factor index (LHFI) is obtained via statistical inference for an unobservable health factor term in a mixed-effects analysis-of-covariance regression that directly models the relationship among metrics, a very general notion of health, and factors that can influence health. We illustrate the approach by constructing an LHFI for a freshwater system using benthic taxonomic data in various Bayesian hierarchical formulations of generalized linear mixed models, implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The concept of the LHFI is also applicable to medical and other contexts. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - It has been recognized and discussed in the literature that values associated with forest integrity, i.e., sustainability and diversity, are relevant to the three aspects of self-organisation: resilience, health, and evolvability. However, evolvability has not yet been studied and also there is still no relevant notion of forest health. This calls for a biodynamic approach to forests and clearly addresses questions relating to scaling and self-organisation since the different levels of detail must be compatible to ensure the consistency of sustainability and diversity assessments. To support the development of a biodynamic approach to forests we review the concepts of self-organisation, criticality and resilience, and their relationship to forest integrity in the light of fractal organisation theory. An exploration of fractal connectivity behind key bioindicators and biomonitors in the avoidance of a biodiversity threshold can be suggested thus far. Forest integrity refers to empirical scaling relationships that are emergent features of biodiversity. In a forest, species as different as fungi, plants, animals and insects, and processes as disparate as disturbance, dispersal, facilitation/competition and nutrient cycling, are related through ecological interaction networks; a 'fractal' is the 'collective phenomenon' of these networks.

AB  - Ecological (biological and hydrochemical assessment) and hydrogeological (vulnerability and pollution risk mapping) tools have been combined to assess the ecological quality and hydrogeological vulnerability of an agricultural river basin. In addition, the applicability of the recently developed vulnerability assessment approach (COP method) in the particular environmental conditions was tested by comparing its results with hydroecological assessment tools (i.e., pollution metrics). Five sampling sites were selected and sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates and physicochemical variables during summer and spring. Overall, sites ranged from moderate to poor ecological quality. The results illustrated that 26% of the study area was of moderate pollution risk, while 65% was classified as of low and very low risk zones. However, the higher elevation zones where calcareous rock formations are encountered presented moderate to high pollution risk that was accredited by the ecological quality assessment. Pollution metrics facilitated from hydrochemical analysis indicated a significant association with groundwater vulnerability, thus validating vulnerability and risk estimations. This study indicated that the particular groundwater pollution risk mapping methodology and the water quality assessment indices can be well combined to provide an integrated evaluation tool at a catchment scale.

AB  - Insects of the Chironomidae family are characterized by a wide ecological diversity in freshwater ecosystems. The larvae have the physiological potential to tolerate environmental stress even when there is a low concentration of oxygen, the presence of toxic substances or when there are changes in temperature and salinity. On the other hand, it is important to consider that at a cellular level, when individual insects are exposed to environmental changes, it induces responses of groups of genes that govern the molecular mechanisms related to such tolerance. In this review, using fourth instar larvae of Chironomus spp. in natural conditions and of Chironomus columbiensis under controlled conditions, we will discuss the genetic expression of a group of genes that respond to detoxification and also the biological functions involved and impacted on by mining stressors. The study of macroinvertebrate bioindicator species and their gene expression as a result of mining activity opens a window on the search for genetic biomarkers that could be used in environmental pollution assessments in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Increased pollution and degradation of water resources and their associated ecosystems has stimulated the development of tools and methodologies to characterize, estimate, predict, and reverse the environmental impact of anthropic effects on water bodies. The Secondary Water Quality Standards (NSCA) adopted in Chile have incorporated the use of bioindicators complementary to physicochemical analyses, in order to determine the ecological condition of lotic and lentic environments. Our research used the "Lake Biotic Index" (LBI) to establish the ecological condition of Lake Rupanco using benthic macroinvertebrates. The results indicated an Oligo-Eubiotic condition for this lake given the high concentration of oxygen and low organic matter content in sediments, in addition to low biogenic potential and good taxa preservation in both the autumn and spring surveys. Features of the ecological condition obtained through the application of the LBI (benthic subsystem) conform to the results of physicochemical and microalgae analyses undertaken previously in Lake Rupanco (pelagic subsystem). Based on these results, we support application of the LBI index as a complementary tool for the integrated management of lentic ecosystems.

AB  - This article tests the association between streamflow alteration and the alteration of ecologically significant hydraulic environments. There has been a recent shift in environmental flow assessments to develop rapid desktop-based approaches that are applicable in a regional context. Streamflow statistics (e.g. minimum monthly flow) are often chosen to predict the impact of streamflow alteration on aquatic ecosystems. The assumption that the flow-biota relationship will be obscured by the effect of how streamflow interacts with channel morphology is often acknowledged, but not quantified. In this study, streamflow statistics are derived for 19 reaches in four river systems in Victoria, Australia. Hydraulic metrics were used to quantify ecologically significant surface flow conditions (Froude number) and the area of bench inundation, shallow and deep water. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the correlation between streamflow statistics altered with regulation and the hydraulic metrics. It was found that streamflow statistics have a weak correlation to surface flow condition and the area of shallow water under natural streamflow conditions. The results show that hydrologic statistics have limited utility in quantifying changes in hydraulic environments. A similar magnitude of flow alteration can produce diverse hydraulic results. The confounding influence of channel morphology prevents streamflow statistics being an adequate surrogate for the assessment of hydraulic alteration. Modelling flow-biota relationships in a regional context is limited by the inadequacy of streamflow statistics to model ecologically significant hydraulic function. Improving knowledge of ecohydraulically significant hydrologic statistics will improve the effectiveness of environmental flow planning to sustain instream habitat conditions. A probabilistic approach is required to enable a risk-based approach to desktop generalization of flow-biota relations.

AB  - In this work, the structural integrity of the critical components of the fast breeder reactor (FBR) that are subjected thermal striping is assessed using a fracture mechanics approach based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The structural integrity is assessed in terms of the actual life of the component for a particular difference between the hot and cold liquid temperatures at the critical mixing velocities. A generalized procedure is attempted for the computation of fatigue life. It is demonstrated in this work that the analysis procedure adopted is computationally very efficient. Green's function method is used for transient mode I crack propagation analysis. An inherent parallelism in the method is exploited for computational efficiency. A distributed computing environment is, therefore, used to demonstrate the effectiveness of Green's function method for crack propagation analysis for the kind of problem solved in this work. A simple idealization in the form of flat plate geometry is used in a numerical example to show the computational efficiency. The method shows a good scale-up justifying the benefit of using a distributed computing environment given a large amount of input data for the thermal striping problem.

AB  - In the last years, systems broadcasting mobility data underwent a rise in cyberthreats, jeopardising their normal use and putting both users and their environment at risk. In this respect, anomaly detection methods are needed to ensure an assessment of such systems. In this article, we propose a rule-based method for data integrity assessment, with rules built from the system technical specifications and by domain experts, and formalised by a logic-based framework, resulting in the triggering of situation-specific alerts. A use case is proposed on the Automatic Identification System, a worldwide localisation system for vessels, based on its poor level of security which allows errors, falsifications and spoofing scenarios. The discovery of abnormal reporting cases aims to assist marine traffic surveillance, preserve the human life at sea and mitigate hazardous behaviours against ports, off-shore structures and the environment.

AB  - The study of urban space as a structural element in cities has attracted growing attention in recent years. Certainly, public spaces serve as an essential factor that can increase urban arrangement, create and maintain a strong local center and enhance the quality of superior environment and the sense of citizenship. Moreover, integrity has been treated as the most basic structural quality and one of the essential principles and concepts of cities. Integrated urban spaces demonstrate the integrated structure of spatial organization in a city where not only the connection between forms and functions of spaces, but also the identity and its place in the complex urban system are taken into account. Therefore, the processes of planning, designing and construction of urban spaces can contribute to the resolution of structural problems in urban models such as inconsistency, which is related to spatial analysis. The main purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model for an integrated network of urban spaces to help the decision-making process. Certainly, these networks strengthen urban structure and integrity, and contribute to the socio-economic growth and prosperity for city dwellers. Accordingly, the study seeks to explore the factors influencing the interconnected urban spaces network and to propose a conceptual model for its development. The research was exploratory-explanatory and a comparative analysis was adopted for the decision-making process. The main research method was content analysis and inductive reasoning. The results revealed that urban spaces were located in a network logic and to achieve spatial integrity, socialization, physical form, sense and functional indicators of each space were united with other spaces via integrity indicators including consistency, continuity, hierarchy, etc.

AB  - Membrane filtration processes have been widely applied in water and wastewater treatment for many decades. Concerns related to membrane treatment effectiveness, membrane lifespan, and membrane fouling control have been paid great attention. To achieve sustainable membrane operation with regards to low energy and maintenance cost, monitoring membrane performance and applying suitable membrane control strategies are required. As the most abundant species in water and wastewater, bacteriophages have shown great potential to be employed in membrane processes as (1) indicators to assess membrane performance considering their similar properties to human pathogenic waterborne viruses; (2) surrogate particles to monitor membrane integrity due to their nano-sized nature; and (3) biological agents to alleviate membrane fouling because of their antimicrobial properties. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review on the roles of bacteriophages in membrane-based water and wastewater treatment processes, with focuses on their uses for membrane performance examination, membrane integrity monitoring, and membrane biofouling control. The advantages, limitations, and influencing factors for bacteriophage-based applications are reported. Finally, the challenges and prospects of bacteriophage-based applications in membrane processes for water treatment are highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent studies, several benthic biological indices were developed or used to assess the ecological quality status of marine environments. In the present study the seasonal variability of several univariate and multimetric indices was studied on a monthly scale (September 2000 until May 2002) in different areas of the North Sea such as the German Bight, the Oyster Ground and the Dogger Bank. The stations were chosen to reflect a gradient in the hydrographic regime, temperature and organic matter supply. The seasonal variability was highest for the univariate indices such as the Shannon-Wiener Index and the Hurlbert Index. Thus, due to sensitivity to recruitment the corresponding ecological status ranged from 'good' to 'poor' depending on the season. For the multimetric indices such as the AMBI or the BQI the seasonal variability and the corresponding ecological status were low. The results are discussed concerning possible consequences for ecological quality assessment especially related to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the quantity of hazardous industrial wastes increases significantly owing to rapid industrialization, its appropriate management is required to reduce adverse impacts on humans and ecosystems. This work evaluated the integrity and retention of heavy metals in materials stabilized by solidification. It was adopted a completely randomized design with a single factor, that is, the averages of four treatments were compared (A, B, C and D) with 0, 40, 50 and 60% respectively contaminants and three repetitions. Portland cement, bentonita and lime-fly ash binders were used to solidify a synthetic heavy metal sludge containing oxides of Cd2+, Pb2+ e Cu2+. It can be concluded that the treatment influenced the result of leaching of cadmium, lead and copper. The treatments showed that the concentrations of solubilized and leachate extract increase with the amount of cadmium, lead and copper added. The highest price was found in the material from the treatment D, that presented leaching equal to 32.815 mg. kg(-1) for cadmium and 29.769 mg. kg(-1) for the lead. For the tests of integrity/durability, it was found that increasing the absorption of water has caused resistance to compression decreased. The use of cement, calcium hydroxide and sodium bentonite were ideal for retention of heavy metals, avoiding leaching and solubilization for it's the environment.

AB  - Although considerable effort has been made to identify the appropriate climatic conditions for bird surveys, considered as standard conditions, in many occasions these conditions are not fulfilled. These are for instance the case of environmental impact assessments (EIA), where the field work is, recurrently, carried out in variable and non-standard weather conditions or in the scope of general ecological monitoring (GEM) programs, where different taxa (birds and other animal groups) are sampled simultaneously with district methodological requirements. The present work examined the applicability of a stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) for predicting the richness and diversity of passerine surveys in mountain habitats characterized by variable and, predominantly, non-standard weather conditions. The relative variations of these metrics are the underlying database of our StDM model, providing some basis to analyse the accuracy of bird surveys. This model focuses on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as the passerine richness and diversity, and the influence of the prevailing climatic conditions. The proposed model was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected metrics versus climatic variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of weather conditions (ranging from standard to extreme conditions). The results of the StDM simulations revealed significant variations in the performance of passerine surveys in response to several combinations of non-standard weather conditions, which enable us to calculate the appropriated correction factors for discrete climatic scenarios. This could be used, in the future, to improve the quality of passerine diversity and richness estimates, namely in the scope of EIA studies when the climatic conditions are inevitably adverse for rigorous passerine surveys.

AB  - As ecosystems become increasingly affected by human activity, the need to monitor, evaluate, manage, and remediate ecological change will increase. Because of the complexity of ecosystems, it is likely that the use of biological indicators (bioindicators) will similarly increase. This paper reviews the potential utility of using aspects of colonial waterbird biology as indicators of environmental change in their supporting ecosystems. Characteristics of colonial waterbirds that support their use in bioindication include aspects of their basic biology, the extent of biological understanding of that biology, human interest, and historical precedent.
   The justification for using biological indicators to understand ecosystem level human impacts has theoretical underpinnings in systems theory, ecosystem theory, and hierarchy theory. Bioindicators may be derived from any level of biological organization. Two levels of indicators, suborganismal bioindicators (biomarkers, biochemical indicators) and population/community/ecosystem indicators, each have distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Traditionally, bioindicators derived from colonial waterbirds have included contaminant burden and population numbers. However, certain suborganismal bioindicators also seem appropriate for development within this group of birds. Difficulties in using colonial waterbirds as indicators include their large size, wide ranging habits, difficulty of approach and capture, and migratory patterns.
   Potentially appropriate colonial waterbird bioindicators include genotoxicity, mixed function oxidases, metallothionein induction, tissue concentration of contaminants, egg shell quality, other physiological responses, histopathology and teratology, growth, behavior, reproductive performance, mortality, presence/absence, distribution, and population indices. Several of these potential bioindicators may be used during the nesting period when the adults, eggs, and young are concentrated at specific colony sites. At this time, chicks and eggs can be effectively sampled and adults are often concentrated at foraging sites. The use of multiple indicators during nesting, especially those related to population indices, hematology, contaminant burdens, and reproductive competency, have special promise.

AB  - Damming is one of the most widespread impairments of river systems around the world. The formulation of scientifically justified guidelines for restoration and remediation of impairments requires better understanding of the relationships between alteration and stream condition. The present study examines relationships between the presence and density of dams and biological metrics of river health in the context of a variety of environmental drivers over the Loire river basin. We hypothesized that dam density measured at supra-reach level would show more significant influence on river health than the local level density, and further that the impact of dams is best estimated with measures for the functional traits of biotic assemblages. An extensive dataset of fish (169 sites) and invertebrate (211 sites) communities in the Loire river basin, described with metrics of density of ecological guilds, taxonomic richness and life history traits, and coupled with reach hydromorphology and catchment characteristics was constructed. Generalized linear modeling was performed in order to quantify dam impact and investigate the importance of regional- and local-scale measures of dam density to the structure of biotic communities. The analysis showed that community structure at the basin scale responded significant to dam presence and confirmed that the strongest relationships were observed for specific functional trait-based metrics. For the macroinvertebrates the observed impact counts up to 25% of the variance in the trait-based quality indices, whereas for fish communities the dam density only explains up to 12%. Macroinvertebrate responses were stronger at higher scale level, and especially the upstream context explained on its own 70% of the observed impairment. For fish communities, the local context prevails and explained up to 70% of the dam impact. These results can be explained by the biotic processes ruling community assembly in the specific groups, passive dispersal for the invertebrates and migrations between habitats for fish. The geographic context furthermore explains the differentiation in these responses, reflecting the metacommunity structure of invertebrate assembly over the river basin. We conclude that for upstream parts of the river basin, locally based management actions can be successful in restoring biotic integrity, whereas more downstream, dam removal actions require more integrated measures at regional rather than local scale.

AB  - We present an evaluation system and framework for determining the relations between processes that generate physical features and how these features are used by fish. This information is essential for long-term management of fish habitat within watersheds. The model is hierarchical at three scales: watershed, reach, and site. Physical characteristics at these scales are separated into attributes, features, or variables that provide information on cause-response relationships. An evaluative framework is proposed along with a logical framework to guide analysis. The framework includes a functional analysis of physical characteristics and processes that generate physical habitat and a functional analysis of habitat requirements related to life cycle of an indicator species. An example of a life stage - state analysis is presented. Concepts of ''health,'' ''integrity,'' and ''fit'' are used to assess the physical states and conditions of the environment to determine the potential fit for a species based on its life-cycle requirements.

AB  - The mechanics of materials and structures plays an important role in majority of life prediction and structural integrity evaluations. In many industrial systems this role gets integrated with effects of service environment and material aging; corrosion, oxidation, and irradiation are examples of such effects which require an interdisciplinary approach. Degradation mechanisms related to these effects have been identified as potentially significant to plant life extension (PLEX). In-service inspection and component monitoring are some of the cost effective steps emphasized in the life extension works; usefulness of the results of these steps can be enhanced through the methods needed for the component condition assessment. These methods, therefore, demand an ever increasing accuracy and improvements requiring a better appreciation and integration of the mechanics.

AB  - The ecological condition of the Danube section in Vienna (Austria) has been greatly impaired by urban development, regulation, channel straightening and the construction of a hydroelectric power plant. In 1997, the shoreline of the Danube in this area was restructured by artificial side channels, coves, gravel banks, pools and temporary waters. A monitoring programme has been established focusing on the investigation of the functional integrity of these inshore structures: first results show that the sites isolated from the Danube serve as stepping stone biotopes for dragonflies and amphibians. Particularly amphibians are suitable indicators of the ecological functioning of riparian migration linkages on a (macro-) habitat scale. Rheophilic fish species (e.g. Chondrostoina nasus) colonise side channels connected with the Danube and indicate a longitudinal connectivity on a landscape scale. The role of these structures within an urban greenway is discussed.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) deals with ecologically sound practices that maintain the forest ecosystem integrity, productivity, resilience and biodiversity. Ecological sustainability ensures continuing function of ecosystems which are considered as ecological life support system. Several attempts have been made world over to develop criteria and indicators, which are specific to various forestry conditions and recognized as appropriate tools for assessing and monitoring progress towards sustainable forest management. In India, the process for measuring forest sustainability has started by evolving national level set of Criteria and indicators in the form of Bhopal-India process. The Bhopal-India process specifies 8 criteria and 43 indicators. The first 4 criteria pertain exclusively to ecology with 21 related indicators. Thus, nearly half of the criteria and indicators pertain to ecological dimensions that largely govern sustainability of forests. Rest of the criteria of the base set pertains to economic and social aspects with related indicators. This provides holistic approach of monitoring the forest resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This review presents the state-of-the-art of benthic soft-bodied algae as biondicators of stream and river water quality, with emphasis on bioassessments set by the legislation (e. g., European Water Framework Directive, USA Clean Water Act) to promote the restoration and ensure ecological sustainability of water resources. The advantages and shortcomings of a variety of bioassessment field and laboratory methods for algae are discussed. The increasing use of soft-bodied algae in biotic indices to assess individual anthropogenic stressors, and in multimetric indices of biotic integrity to evaluate ecological condition in streams is summarized. Rapid microscopic and molecular approaches for inferring nutrient supply with heterocystous cyanobacteria and other sensitive algae are proposed. The need of better understanding of soft-bodied algae as bioindicators is discussed and suggestions are made for obtaining meaningful bioassessment information with cost-efficient efforts.

AB  - In common with most of Borneo, the Bakun region of Sarawak is currently subject to heavy deforestation mainly due to logging and, to a lesser extent, traditional slash-and-bum farming practices. This has the potential to affect stream ecosystems, which are integrators of environmental change in the surrounding terrestrial landscape. This study evaluated the effects of both types of deforestation by using functional and structural indicators (leaf litter decomposition rates and associated detritivores or 'shredders', respectively) to compare a fundamental ecosystem process, leaf litter decomposition, within logged, farmed and pristine streams. Slash-and-bum agricultural practices increased the overall rate of decomposition despite a decrease in shredder species richness (but not shredder abundance) due to increased microbial decomposition. In contrast, decomposition by microbes and invertebrates was slowed down in the logged streams, where shredders were less abundant and less species rich. This study suggests that shredder communities are less affected by traditional agricultural farming practices, while modem mechanized deforestation has an adverse effect on both shredder communities and leaf breakdown.

AB  - The key role of paralic environments as providers of ecosystem services, associated with their increasingly threatened state, led to the definition of international water management policies aimed to improve ecological quality status (EcoQs). Restoration actions rely on the definition of reference conditions, which is a particularly challenging task in naturally stressed transitional environments. In the present work, we apply the diversity index Exp(H'(bc)) on benthic foraminifer assemblages from two anthropogenically unimpacted transitional to coastal Holocene sediment successions of the Po coastal plain, in order to assess past EcoQs (PaleoEcoQs). Ostracod ecological groups provided detailed insights on naturally stressful paleoenvironmental conditions. We show that "poor" to "moderate" PaleoEcoQs are recorded by biological indicators at reference conditions under fluctuations of chemical-physical parameters and organic matter enrichment. We emphasize the importance of a site-specific paleobiological approach, as significant differences in diversity occur even on a short spatial scale. This study illustrates that early to mid-Holocene sediment successions resulted to be appropriate for conservation paleobiological purposes, providing a high-resolution paleoecological record under the influence of the Holocene sea-level rise in analogy with the present-day global change.

AB  - We assessed the ability of an artificial clay (Ca-aminoclay) to suppress harmful algal bloom species (HABs) such as Cochlodinium polykrikoides and Chattonella marina and investigated the ecological responses in the closed and open microcosm systems. The Ca-aminoclay induced rapidly and selectively cell lysis in the HABs. However, applying Ca-aminoclay could cause adverse impacts in terms of biological and environmental changes. The bacterioplankton abundance increased and then, the abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates increased rapidly. Extremely poor environmental conditions such as increase in nutrients and development of anoxic conditions were sustained continuously in a closed system, while the environmental conditions in open systems deteriorated before recovering to the initial conditions. We evaluated the potential for the occurrence of a bloom of another phytoplankton after HABs had been controlled using the Ca-aminoclay. The Ca-aminoclay controlled blooms of Chattonella marina in mixed cell cultures containing a Tetraselmis chui. However, T. chui increased over time and then bloomed. Therefore, caution should be taken when considering the direct application of Ca-aminoclay in natural environments even though it offers the rapid removal of HABs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The decomposition rates of Phragmites australis and Fucus vesiculosus were experimentally determined in an estuarine system using the leaf-bag technique. The study was conducted in fifteen sites arranged in five areas, extending from freshwater, outside the tidal range, to the marine environment, near the mouth of the estuary. The leaf-bags (5 mm mesh), were set up with 3.0 g of dried substrate, submerged in the experimental sites at day 0 and collected at days 3, 7, 15, 30 and 60, to follow biomass loss. The biomass loss through the leaching phase (day 3) was about 16% for Phragmites australis and 33% for Fucus vesiculosus and was independent of salinity for both substrates. The difference in the remaining biomass between the two species increased with time and the decomposition rates differed along the sa inity gradient. For F. vesiculosus, the decomposition rate was highest near the mouth of the estuary, corresponding to the preferential distribution area of the algae, and decreased towards freshwater. For Phragmites australis, the fastest decay was observed in the mid estuary, where Phragmites australis occurs naturally, confirming previous studies. The decomposition rates measured at different time intervals (0 -15, 0-30 and 0-60 days) were always higher for the algae and decreased with time for both species. These results indicate that the use of decomposition rates as a measure of ecosystem integrity or quality status in transitional waters will not be straightforward and must take into account, among others, the test species, the study area positioning along the estuarine gradient, and the time interval for the calculation of the decomposition rate.

AB  - Many tropical landscapes are changing rapidly, with uncertain outcomes for biodiversity, landscape function, and the corresponding landscape services. Therefore, monitoring and adaptively managing the drivers and consequences of landscape change while sustaining the production of essential resources have become research and policy priorities. In this perspective, we have applied a recent framework, the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), with the purpose of understanding the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on caves' integrity using cave beetle communities (Coleoptera) as ecological indicators. The proposed method was preceeded by a generalized linear model for discriminating significant relationships between the selected indicators, the structural changes in the caves, and the epigean habitats associated. The obtained results showed different ecological trends in response to the environmental changes. Overall, the simulation results seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in determining the effects of habitat dynamics, that is, the expansion of agricultural activities, in areas near the caves in the structure of cave beetle communities. The applied method, based on universal information-theoretic principles, can be easily implemented and interpreted by environmental managers and decision makers, enabling anticipating impacts and supporting the development of measures aimed at minimizing the identified problems.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment report is the primary document required to assess sustainable issues of any business/commercial activity, but it is most often overlooked for serious anomalies in its presentation to the public. It is most often incomplete and there is a need to review the standards of impact assessment procedures that help preserve environmental integrity among developing nations. The absence of sanctions for improper assessment of environmental, social and economic impacts of commercial activities, including extraction of natural resources by domestic and multinational corporations undermines sustainable development across the globe. The procedures in place to study various impacts of a business activity that enable access to genuine, verifiable and actionable information by the public require review and oversight by a third-party institution. The standardization of procedures and universal harmonization of enforcement and compliance regulations by nations has to become a topic for debate at various academic levels to gain importance. Essentially, EIA reports in large infrastructure projects serve as a blueprint for low carbon economies. Developing nations ignore vital provisions relating to the listing and analysis of alternatives in their attempt to meet developmental goals. Environmental protection is to maintain the ecological integrity of habitats and ecosystems. EIA reports, ultimately, aim at conserving and replenishing the reserves of natural resources. Judicial law has played an important role in highlighting the importance of alternatives in EIA. It is therefore important as how developing nations use the provision for the alternative analysis within their environmental laws. This paper will discuss EIA under the auspices of International law relating it to Sustainable Development. It shall emphasize the significance of providing alternatives in large infrastructure projects that have envirosocial impacts including transboundary effects and how the use of "no-action" alternative helps preserve and conserve a nation's resources, reducing negative impacts

AB  - After decades of efforts by the agricultural and scientific communities to manage the impacts of farming through Best Management Practice (BMP) implementation, there is a need to communicate to program managers and policy makers how effective these practices actually are via their expected effects on aquatic ecosystems. Land managers, biologists, funders, and policy makers could all greatly benefit from how to account for factors that influence reductions in compounds accomplished by BMP projects, to set expectations for physiochemical and biological community responses. To date there have been a great deal of studies on how BMPs may relate to nutrients and sediment in streams, and there is some professional consensus on expected outcomes on water chemistry. Studies based on observational and/or modelled data have yielded very broad ranges of 0-92% reductions in nitrogen compounds, 0-91% in phosphorus compounds, and 0-90% in total suspended sediments; these ranges make it difficult to choose values for reliable models and predictions. Uncertainty in expected abiotic responses to BMP implementation also implies a potentially broad range of biotic responses. In this review, we synthesize results from studies investigating how the application of agricultural BMPs affect the water quality and ecological integrity of nearby water bodies and provide suggestions for monitoring BMP projects to better understand the effects of these practices. The objective of this review is to compare study results on BMP effectiveness as well as to contribute information for decision-making on BMP implementation. Our synthesis highlights the high variability in reported BMP impacts and, subsequently, the need for single studies to be interpreted with caution. We conclude with recommendations for land management and further studies of BMP effectiveness.

AB  - Reservoirs are artificial ecosystems with multiple functions having direct and indirect benefits to humans; however, they also cause ecological changes and influence the composition and structure of aquatic biota. Our objectives were to: (1) assess the environmental condition of Nova Ponte Reservoir, Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil; and (2) determine how the aquatic biota respond to disturbances. A total of 40 sites in the littoral zone of the reservoir were sampled to characterize physical and chemical habitat, land use, and benthic macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages. The predominant type of land cover near the reservoir was natural vegetation. A total of 29 fish species and 39 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected, including eight alien species. Most sites had intermediate levels of human disturbance, however, high levels of degradation were associated with high proportions of alien species. Disturbances at multiple scales may alter natural patterns and processes, leading to environmental changes and damaging biological communities. Our results reinforce the importance of assessing reservoir ecological conditions at several scales. The study of land use, littoral zone physical habitat characteristics, water quality, and assemblage structure set the ground for proposing actions to rehabilitate and conserve aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Human demands on the world's available freshwater supplies continue to grow as the global population increases. In the endeavor to manage water to meet human needs, the needs of freshwater species and ecosystems have largely been neglected, and the ecological consequences have been tragic. Healthy freshwater ecosystems provide a wealth of goods and services for society, but our appropriation of freshwater flows must be better managed if we hope to sustain these benefits. and freshwater biodiversity. We offer a framework for developing an ecologically sustainable water management program, in which human needs for water are met by storing and diverting water in a manner that can sustain or restore the ecological integrity of affected river ecosystems. Our six-step process includes: (1) developing initial numerical estimates of key aspects. of river flow necessary to sustain native species and natural ecosystem functions; (2) accounting for human uses of water, both current and future, through development of a computerized hydrologic simulation model that facilitates examination of human-induced alterations to river flow regimes; (3) assessing incompatibilities between human and ecosystem needs with particular attention to their spatial and temporal character; (4) collaboratively searching for solutions to resolve incompatibilities; (5) conducting water management experiments to resolve critical uncertainties that frustrate efforts to integrate human and ecosystem needs; and (6) designing and implementing an adaptive management program to facilitate ecologically sustainable water management for the long term. Drawing from case studies around the world to illustrate our framework, we suggest that ecologically sustainable water management is attainable in the vast majority of the world's river basins. However, this quest will become far less feasible if we wait until water supplies are further over-appropriated.

AB  - Sustainability is widely recognized as the capacity of an area to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Humans ultimately depend on natural ecosystems to meet most of their basic needs. However, compelling scientific evidence indicates that ecological and societal health is threatened worldwide, especially aquatic ecosystems. Our population densities, consumption, and technology are among the pervasive pressures connecting and affecting sustainability at every level. These complexities are also overwhelming most local decision-makers capacity to assess such problems or respond with effective solutions. To address these challenges, many agencies and organizations are pursuing the goal of sustainability through more ecologically and socially inclusive "ecosystem-based managment" approaches. These approaches generally encompass the broad domains of environment, society, and related institutions. Numerous conceptual frameworks and hundreds of indicators are being proposed to quantify and simplify these more comprehensive methods. However, none of the frameworks bring together a universal, but relatively small, set of components needed to ensure the integrity of all ecosystems, societies, and decision-making processes-at all levels. This paper attempts to provide such a framework. To do this, widely accepted principles from ecology, human health, and management science were identified and integrated into a single, operational framework to help manage for sustainability. The flexible framework includes 13 core components believed necessary for "integrity": ecosystem diversity, productivity, chemical cycling, and disturbance; societies that provide for physiological needs, safety 'security, love and belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization; and decision-making processes and institutions that are results-oriented, truth-seeking, consent-based, and adaptable. Also presented are: (1) candidate indicators from global, national, and local efforts, (2) important indicator selection criteria, (3) "amoeba plots" to diagnose and illustrate sustainability; (4) an adaptive management cycle using indicators; and (5) recommendations to expedite sustainability indicator development and use The consummate role of human conscience in achieving sustainability is emphasized.

AB  - Increased global demand for groundwater has resulted in the need to measure and monitor this resource. Rather than monitoring groundwater simply though water chemistry and levels, which provides a 'snapshot' of the conditions at any given time, a more holistic approach to managing groundwater resources and their changes over time is needed. Korbel & Hose (2011) introduced the first structured framework for measuring groundwater health - the Groundwater Health Index (GHI). This multimetric, two-tiered framework uses biotic and abiotic components of the groundwater ecosystem to measure and identify ecosystem health. The framework can be used to classify impacted from non-impacted groundwaters, however it has certain limitations. With increased research and associated knowledge of groundwater ecosystems in recent times, it is now timely to attempt to build on the GHI framework. This paper refines and improves the GHI by incorporating a weighting system to account for natural factors contributing to variations in biotic distribution and is tested on data within four geologically similar alluvial aquifers in intensively irrigated agricultural areas of New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Using a combination of microbial, stygofaunal, water chemistry and environmental indicators, the 'weighted GHI' framework was able to discriminate three distinct ecosystem health classifications; that of 'similar to reference'(displaying reference-like condition) 'mild deviation from reference' (sites failing to meet between 2 and 3 benchmarks) and 'major deviation from reference' (sites with more than four benchmarks exceeded). The framework indicated that groundwater health deviated from reference condition in all four catchments studied, with irrigated sites consistently displaying deviations from reference ecosystem health. Tier 2 benchmarks were set using results from the Gwydir River, and were tested on the adjacent Namoi River catchment, the Condamine and Lower Macquarie catchments. Results indicated that ecosystem health benchmarks may be associate with aquifer typology, rather than being applicable only for local areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was designed to compare plant biodiversity and community indicators among urban residential areas and more-natural habitats in the vicinity of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Six house lots were examined in each of three age-categories of residential neighborhoods (>80 years, 30-50 years, and <10 years), and these were compared to four forested plots in semi-natural urban parks and four in a natural forest. The residential areas represented broad stages of successional development of "urban forest," while the stands of semi-natural and natural forest are representative of the original habitats that have been converted into residential land-use. In general, the observed plant species richness was much higher in the residential areas, but these habitats were strongly dominated by non-indigenous species whereas the natural and semi-natural habitats supported native taxa. This obvious difference between residential areas and semi-natural/natural habitats was confirmed by cluster analysis and principal components analysis, both of which separated the sample sites into two groups of plant communities. Neighborhood age and proximity of the residential sites had little influence on these multivariate analyses, suggesting that site-specific management practices (such as horticultural choices of landowners) had a strong influence on plant-community structure. Woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) in the semi-natural and natural forest had a higher basal area and stored more biomass and carbon than in residential habitats. However, there was a successional progression in the urban forest, in that older habitats stored much more woody carbon than younger ones. Although well-vegetated residential neighborhoods provide important environmental services, their striking dominance by exotic species, as well as their lower carbon Storage in vegetation, contribute to an impoverishment of ecological integrity. This circumstance could be partially mitigated by changing horticultural management to encourage naturalization, particularly through the planting of indigenous species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effective evidence-based nature conservation and habitat management relies on developing and refining our methodological toolbox for detecting critical ecological changes at an early stage. This requires not only optimizing the use and integration of evidence from available data, but also optimizing methods for dealing with imperfect knowledge and data deficiencies. For policy and management relevance, ecological data are often synthesized into indicators, which are assessed against reference levels and limit values. Here we explore challenges and opportunities in defining ecological condition in relation to a reference condition reflecting intact ecosystems, as well as setting limit values for good ecological condition, linked to critical ecological thresholds in doseresponse relationships between pressures and condition variables. These two concepts have been widely studied and implemented in aquatic sciences, but rarely in terrestrial systems. In this paper, we address practical considerations, theoretical challenges and possible solutions using different approaches to determine reference and limit values for good ecological condition in terrestrial ecosystems, based on empirical experiences from a case study in central Norway. We present five approaches for setting indicator reference values for intact ecosystems: absolute biophysical boundaries, reference areas, reference communities, ecosystem dynamics based models, and habitat availability based models. We further present four approaches for identifying indicator limit values for good ecological condition: empirically estimated values, statistical distributions, assumed linear relationships, and expert judgement-based limits. This exercise highlights the versatile and robust nature of ecological condition assessments based on reference and limit values for different management purposes, for situations where knowledge of the underlying relationships is lacking, and for situations limited by data availability.

AB  - The management of streams and rivers can be aided by knowledge of reference conditions. Data from > 1000 sites across New Zealand was used to develop a technique to estimate median ammoniacal-N, clarity, Escherichia coli, filterable reactive phosphorus, nitrate-N, suspended solids, and total nitrogen and phosphorus values under reference conditions for streams and rivers as classified by the River Environment Classification (REC). The REC enabled us to account for natural variation in climate, topography and geology when estimating reference conditions. Values for minimally disturbed sites (i.e. <5% in intensive agriculture) were generally within the confidence limits for estimated reference values. Metrics that described: (1) the percentage of anthropogenic contribution to analyte values; and (2) the degree of enrichment beyond the reference conditions, showed that lowland sites classified as warm-wet, warm-dry or cool-dry exhibited the greatest anthropogenic input and enrichment. The consideration of natural variation by REC class informs the setting of water quality objectives through avoiding water quality limits or targets that are either too restrictive, and impossible to meet (e. g. below reference conditions), or too high, such that they have little ecological benefit. We recommend reference conditions be considered by regulatory authorities when assessing water quality impacts, objectives and limits.

AB  - A central objective of environmental management is to maintain biodiversity, including populations of threatened species. Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly assessed by their biotic properties, but whether the resulting classifications of biotic condition are sufficient to protect species with conservation status has received very little consideration. We used data from 225 reference and impacted river sites from Finland to examine whether the occurrence and abundance of threatened macroinvertebrate species (TS) are associated with a commonly used estimate of biological condition (Observed-to-Expected number of predicted taxa of macroinvertebrates or O/E-ratio of taxonomic completeness, based on a predictive model). We suggest that a minimal acceptable condition below which restoration is needed, equivalent to, e.g. 'good' ecological status described by the European Union Water Framework Directive, should also ensure the occurrence of TS populations. We therefore followed conventional procedures for condition assessment, and examined two classifications by using the 10th or 25th percentiles of a reference O/E-distribution as alternative upper boundaries for the acceptable condition. The number and abundance of TS, and occurrence of individual TS showed positive relationships with the O/E. However, particularly if the 10th percentile threshold was used, there were only few occurrences and low abundance of TS in the suggested 'good' condition. The results imply that conventional criteria for satisfactory condition may not be sufficient for preservation of threatened river macroinvertebrates. However, our approach could bring an objective, meaningful, and societally acceptable means for setting site quality criteria in freshwater assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developing effective indicators of ecological condition requires calibration to determine the geographic range and ecosystem type appropriate for each indicator. Here, we demonstrate an approach for evaluating the relative influence of geography, geomorphology and human disturbance on patterns of variation in biotic indicators derived from multiple assemblages for ecosystems that span broad spatial scales. To accomplish this, we collected abundance information on six biotic assemblages (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wetland vegetation., and diatoms) from over 450 locations along U.S. shorelines throughout each of the Great Lakes during 2002-2004. Sixty-six candidate taxon- and function-based indicators analyzed using hierarchical variance partitioning revealed that geographic (lake) rather than geomorphic factors (wetland type) had the greatest influence on the proportion of variance explained across all indicators, and that a significant portion of the variance was also related to response to human disturbance. Wetland vegetation, fish and bird indicators were the most, and macroinvertebrates the least, responsive to human disturbance. Proportion of rock bass, Carex lasiocarpa, and stephanodiscoid diatoms, as well as the presence of spring peepers and the number of insectivorous birds were among the indicators that responded most strongly to a human disturbance index, suggesting they have good potential as indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition. Ecoprovince, wetland type, and indicator type (taxa vs function based) explained relatively little variance. Variance patterns for macroinvertebrates and birds were least concordant with those of other assemblages, while diatoms and amphibians, and fish and wetland vegetation were the most concordant assemblage pairs. Our results strongly suggest it will not be possible to develop effective indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition without accounting for differences among lakes and their important interactions. This is one of the first attempts to show how ecological indicators of human disturbance vary over a broad spatial scale in wetlands. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In bone cutting, the tissue is exposed to necrosis due to temperature elevation, which can significantly influence postoperative results in orthopaedic surgeries. This damage is usually revealed through histological analysis to show the necrotic extent; however, this technique does not capture mechanical damage, which is essential for a full material integrity assessment. Here, with micro-mechanics, it is demonstrated that machining-induced damage in bone extends beyond the necrotic region. Drilling with different conditions was performed on ex vivo bovine cortical bone, inducing different damage degrees. Micro-pillar compression tests were performed in the machined sub-surface to identify changes in properties and failure modes caused by drilling. It was revealed that at high cutting temperatures, the bone near the machined surface suffers from lower modulus (-42%), strength (-41%) and brittle behaviour, whereas the bulk bone remains undamaged with pristine properties and ductile behaviour. Histology was also performed to evaluate necrosis and, surprisingly, it was found that the brittle and weaker bone layer is more than three times larger when compared to the necrotic layer, clearly showing that the drilling thermo-mechanical effect could affect not only biologically, but also micromechanically. Consequently, these results reveal another kind of bone damage that has so far been neglected. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although frequently suggested as a goal for ecosystem-based fisheries management, incorporating ecosystem information into fisheries stock assessments has proven challenging. The uncertainty of input data, coupled with the structural uncertainty of complex multi-species models, currently makes the use of absolute values from such models contentious for short-term single-species fisheries management advice. Here, we propose a different approach where the standard assessment methodologies can be enhanced using ecosystem model derived information. Using a case study of the Irish Sea, we illustrate how stock-specific ecosystem indicators can be used to set an ecosystem-based fishing mortality reference point (FECO) within the ?Pretty Good Yield? ranges for fishing mortality which form the present precautionary approach adopted in Europe by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). We propose that this new target, FECO, can be used to scale fishing mortality down when the ecosystem conditions for the stock are poor and up when conditions are good. This approach provides a streamlined quantitative way of incorporating ecosystem information into catch advice and provides an opportunity to operationalize ecosystem models and empirical indicators, while retaining the integrity of current assessment models and the FMSY-based advice process.

AB  - Maintaining the integrity of riparian ecosystems whilst continuing to reserve and extract water for other purposes necessitates a greater understanding of relationships between riparian vegetation and water availability. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a good indicator for identifying long-term changes in vegetated areas and their condition. In this study, we use regression tree analysis to investigate long term NDVI data (23 years) at semi-arid riparian areas in the Namoi catchment, Australia. Climatic factors (temperature and rainfall), surface water (flow and flooding) and groundwater levels are analysed collectively. We find that in general maximum temperature is the variable that primarily splits NDVI values, followed by antecedent 28-day rainfall and then inter-flood dry period and groundwater levels. More rain is required in the warmer months compared to cooler months to achieve similar mean NDVI values in tree patches or areas of high NDVI in riparian zones, presumably because of higher evaporation. Inter-flood dry period is shown to be important for maintenance of NDVI levels, particularly when rainfall is limited. Shallower groundwater levels sustain the NDVI and hence vegetation greenness when conditions are cooler and wetter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of forest harvesting on headwaters are quite well understood, yet our understanding of whether impacts accumulate or dissipate downstream is limited. To address this, we investigated whether several biotic indicators changed from smaller to larger downstream sites (n = 6) within three basins that had intensive, extensive or minimal forest management in New Brunswick (Canada). Biofilm biomass and grazer abundance significantly increased from upstream to downstream, whereas organic matter decomposition and the autotrophic index of biofilms decreased. However, some spatial trends differed among basins and indicated either cumulative (macroinvertebrate abundance, predator density, sculpin GSI) or dissipative (autotrophic index, cotton decomposition) effects downstream, potentially explained by sediment and nutrient dynamics related to harvesting. No such among-basin differences were observed for leaf decomposition, biofilm biomass, macroinvertebrate richness or sculpin condition. Additionally, results suggest that some of the same biological impacts of forestry observed in small headwaters also occurred in larger systems. Although the intensive and extensive basins had lower macroinvertebrate diversity, there were no other signs of biological impairment, suggesting that, overall, current best management practices protect biological integrity downstream despite abiotic effects.

AB  - The maintenance of the integrity of cellular membranes, among other events, is a strong indicator that the quality of the coffee was preserved in the post-harvesting process. Therefore, this work aimed to analyze the effect of different drying methods on the maintenance of the integrity of cell walls and plasma membrane of natural and de-pulped coffee in order to determine the conditions and the moment that microscopic ruptures take place. The coffee was submitted to a pre-drying period on a concrete patio. After this, a sample of each type of coffee was dehydrated outdoors and another, with heated air at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C in fixed-layer dryers, controlling the grain temperature and the moisture content to 11% (bu). During the drying process the coffee grains were randomly sampled and fragments of the endosperm were prepared for scanning electron microscopy and eletromicrographs were taken. Measurements of the cells were taken for evaluating changes in the plasma membrane of the endosperm cells in relation to the moisture content and drying period. The cell cytoplasm of the coffee grains with 11% moisture content was not affected when dried under sun light and at the temperature of 40 degrees C. When dried at 60 degrees C, changes in the cellular structures of the cytoplasm were observed for coffees with moisture content of 20%.

AB  - Genetic diversity and species diversity are expected to covary according to area and isolation, but may not always covary with environmental heterogeneity. In this study, we examined how patterns of genetic and species diversity in stream fishes correspond to local and regional environmental conditions. To do so, we compared population size, genetic diversity and divergence in central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) to measures of species diversity and turnover in stream fish assemblages among similarly sized watersheds across an agriculture-forest land-use gradient in the Little Miami River basin (Ohio, USA). Significant correlations were found in many, but not all, pair-wise comparisons. Allelic richness and species richness were strongly correlated, for example, but diversity measures based on allele frequencies and assemblage structure were not. In-stream conditions related to agricultural land use were identified as significant predictors of genetic diversity and species diversity. Comparisons to population size indicate, however, that genetic diversity and species diversity are not necessarily independent and that variation also corresponds to watershed location and glaciation history in the drainage basin. Our findings demonstrate that genetic diversity and species diversity can covary in stream fish assemblages, and illustrate the potential importance of scaling observations to capture responses to hierarchical environmental variation. More comparisons according to life history variation could further improve understanding of conditions that give rise to parallel variation in genetic diversity and species diversity, which in turn could improve diagnosis of anthropogenic influences on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Faunal indicators of old-growth forests in heavily-disturbed regions are virtually non-existent. However, land snails, in particular micro-snails, could reflect the impact of land-use on ecosystem integrity. Because of their size, limited mobility, and propensity to spend their entire lives at one locality due to lack of migratory behavior, micro-snails are susceptible to changes in land-use within forested ecosystems. Therefore, we proposed the hypothesis that micro-snails would reflect land-use in forested ecosystems. We sampled snail communities in paired old-growth and second-growth forests in three distinct ecoregions. Species diversity, richness, and abundance were greater in two of the three old-growth sites compared to paired second-growth sites. Across all of the ecoregions, 21 out of 70 species had an affinity for old-growth. Eighteen of which were statistically significant. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance plays a key role in shaping species diversity and community structure of land snail fauna. However, site specific factors also appear to be important moderators of the response, and the mechanisms of the process remain to be studied. Snails appear to be a promising group of organisms to use as indicators of historic forest disturbance. In order to maintain ecological integrity, forest managers should consider management strategies that are low impact and protect existing patches of old-growth forests.

AB  - Advancements in remote sensing and computational tools have increased our awareness of large-scale environmental problems, thereby creating a need for monitoring, assessment, and management at these scales. Over the last decade, several watershed and regional multi-metric indices have been developed to assist decision-makers with planning actions of these scales. However, these tools use remote-sensing products that are subject to land-cover misclassification, and these errors are rarely incorporated in the assessment results. Here, we examined the sensitivity of a landscape-scale multi-metric index (MMI) to error from thematic land-cover misclassification and the implications of this uncertainty for resource management decisions. Through a case study, we used a simplified flood-plain MMI assessment tool, whose metrics were derived from Landsat thematic maps, to initially provide results that were naive to thematic misclassification error. Using a Monte Carlo simulation model, we then incorporated map misclassification error into our MMI, resulting in four important conclusions: (1) each metric had a different sensitivity to error; (2) within each metric, the bias between the error-naive metric scores and simulated scores that incorporate potential error varied in magnitude and direction depending on the underlying land cover at each assessment site; (3) collectively, when the metrics were combined into amulti-metric index, the effects were attenuated; and (4) the index bias indicated that our naive assessment model may overestimate floodplain condition of sites with limited human impacts and, to a lesser extent, either over-or underestimated floodplain condition of sites with mixed land use.

AB  - A method for assessing anthropogenic river disturbance is described. The grid-based spatial modeling procedure computes indices of disturbance for individual stream sections. These indices rank streams along a continuum from near-pristine to severely disturbed. The method couples geographical data, recording the extent and intensity of human activities known to impact on river condition, with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for drainage analysis. It was developed to produce the first nation-wide assessment of river disturbance from which Australia's least disturbed or 'wild' rivers were identified. A national summary of the extent and the potential impact of human activities is presented, calculated from the disturbance index values computed for more than 1.5 x 10(6) stream sections with a total length of over 3 x 10(6) km. Index values close to the undisturbed end of the continuum are rare, especially among large rivers. Most of the least disturbed streams are predicted to lie within the monsoonal tropical north or the arid/semi-arid center of the continent.
   The disturbance indices generated provide a comprehensive and consistent characterization of river and catchment disturbance that has applications beyond the identification of wild rivers. These include identification of priorities for rehabilitation and restoration; development of systematic survey strategies for aquatic, riparian and estuarine biota and identification of reserve networks for river systems. However, these applications depend on validating the correlation between river disturbance indices and intensively sampled physical and biological indicators of river condition.

AB  - Both environmental indicators and multi-metric indices are useful for describing baseline conditions and qualitatively predicting the cumulative consequences of multiple actions. Several examples and case studies associated with indicators and/or indices are presented herein. They can be easily modified for usage in CEAM. Habitat suitability models reflect special indices related to habitat needs and quality for specific species or broad habitat types. Such models have been used to address direct and indirect effects, and with some modification, they can be also used to address cumulative effects of multiple actions. This review has indicated that there are numerous examples of such tools which have been or could be used in both EIA and CEAM. Some key lessons are: (1) in conducting CEAM studies, it is useful to think from the mindset that "I am the VEC or indicator, and what is my historical and current condition and how have I, or will I, be affected by multiple past, present, and future actions?": (2) due to the likely absence of detailed information on future actions, the described tools can still be used to "predict" future conditions by focusing on qualitative up-or-down changes in individual indicators or indices with their aggregated displays: and (3) numerous regional and site-specific tools are currently available, with one example being indices of biological integrity for specific watersheds and water bodies. Such tools, even though they may not have been developed for CEAM usage, can certainly benefit CEAM studies and practice. Finally, usage of selected and appropriate tools as described herein can aid in conducting science-based, systematic, and documentable CEAM studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally, ecosystem monitoring, conservation, and restoration have been conducted in a piecemeal manner at the local scale without regional landscape context. However, scientifically driven conservation and restoration decisions benefit greatly when they are based on regionally determined benchmarks and goals. Unfortunately, required data sets rarely exist for regionally important ecosystems. Because of early recognition of the extreme ecological importance of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands, and the extensive degradation that had already occurred, significant investments in coastal wetland research, protection, and restoration have been made in recent decades and continue today. Continued and refined assessment of wetland condition and trends, and the evaluation of restoration practices are all essential to ensuring the success of these investments. To provide wetland managers and decision makers throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes basin with the optimal tools and data needed to make scientifically-based decisions, our regional team of Great Lakes wetland scientists developed standardized methods and indicators used for assessing wetland condition. Froma landscape perspective, at the Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystem scale, we established a stratified random-site-selection process to monitor birds, anurans, fish, macroinvertebrates, vegetation, and physicochemical conditions of coastal wetlands in the US and Canada. Monitoring of approximately 200 wetlands per year began in 2011 as the Great Lakes CoastalWetlandMonitoring Program. In this paper, we describe the development, delivery, and expected results of this ongoing international, multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder, landscape-scale monitoring programas a case example of successful application of landscape conservation design.

AB  - In the Orinoco River Basin of eastern Colombia large scale and rapid conversion of natural savannas into commercial agriculture exists as a critical threat for the ecological integrity of this fragile region. The highly acidic and compacted soils inherent to this region require thorough physical and chemical conditioning in order for intensive cropping systems to be established. Assessing the impact of this dramatic soil perturbation on biodiversity, ecosystem services and other elements of the natural capital is an urgent task for designing sustainable management options in the region. To address this need, we evaluated soil macro invertebrate communities and soil-based ecosystem services (climate regulation, hydrologic functions, soil stability provided by macro aggregation and nutrient provision potential) in four major production systems: improved pastures, annual crops (rice, corn and soy bean), oil palm and rubber plantations, and compared them to the original savanna. Fifteen plots of each system were sampled along a 200 km natural gradient of soil and climatic conditions. In each plot, we assessed climate regulation by measuring green house gas emissions (N2O, CH4 and CO2) and C storage in aboveground plant biomass and soil (0-20 cm). Soil biodiversity (macro invertebrate communities) and three other soil-based ecosystem services, were assessed using sets of 12-20 relevant variables associated with each service and synthesized via multivariate analyses into a single indicator for each ecosystem function, adjusted in a range of 0.1-1.0. Savannas yielded intermediate values for most indicators, while each production system appeared to improve at least one ecosystem service. For example, nutrient provision (chemical fertility) was highest in annual cropping systems (0.78 +/- 0.03) due to relatively high concentrations of Ca, Mg, N, K, and available P and low Al saturation. Hydrological functions and climate regulation (C storage and GHG emissions) were generally improved by perennial crops (oil palm and rubber), while indicators for macro invertebrate biodiversity and activity (0.73 +/- 0.05) and soil macro aggregation (0.76 +/- 0.02) were highest within improved pastures. High variability within each system indicates the potential to make improvements in fields with lowest indicator values, while differences among systems suggest the potential to mitigate negative impacts by combining plots with contrasted functions in a strategically designed landscape mosaic.

AB  - Protected areas constitute a key foundation for national and international strategies of effective biodiversity and ecosystems conservation. Yet, they are not islands; they are components of their surrounding social and ecological contexts. Reconciling biodiversity conservation, people, protected areas and sustainable livelihoods requires a focused strategic planning for conservation and development. The designation of new reserves must be thus based on sound indicators within ecological, socioeconomic, institutional, and financial contexts. Many of the ecological and socioeconomic indicators have been designed for this purpose by practitioners and conservation planners around the world. Although these indicators are crucial to orient conservation priorities and protected areas' designation patterns, their identification remains a big challenge, largely due to the fact that an indicator is a simplification of a system (whether natural or social) which is characterized by high structural complexity, considerable spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations. This paper presents a review of ecological and socioeconomic indicators globally used to orient conservation planning on the global and national levels. It also suggests a set of suitable, relevant, and practical set of indicators, adapted to Mediterranean-type continental environments.

AB  - Ensuring the health of aquatic ecosystems and identifying species at risk from the detrimental effects of environmental contaminants can be facilitated by integrating analytical chemical analysis with carefully selected biological endpoints measured in tissues of species of concern. These biological endpoints include molecular, biochemical, and physiological markers (i.e., biomarkers) that when integrated, can clarify issues of contaminant bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and ecological effects while enabling a better understanding of the effects of nonchemical stressors. In the case of contaminant stressors, an understanding of chemical modes of toxicity can be incorporated with diagnostic markers of aquatic animal physiology to help understand the health status of aquatic organisms in the field. Furthermore, new approaches in functional genomics and bioinformatics can help discriminate individual chemicals, or groups of chemicals among complex mixtures that may contribute to adverse biological effects. Although the use of biomarkers is not a new paradigm, such approaches have been underused in the context of ecological risk assessment and natural resource damage assessment. From a regulatory standpoint, these approaches can help better assess the complex effects from coastal development activities to assessing ecosystem integrity pre-and post development or site remediation.

AB  - A new method based on photographic sampling coupled with in situ observations was applied to 53 stations along the French Mediterranean coast, to assess the integrity of coralligenous reefs affected by different levels of anthropogenic pressure. The conservation state of the assemblages characterizing these habitats was then assessed by an index - the INDEX-COR - that integrates three metrics: (i) the sensitivity of the taxa to organic matter and sediment deposition, (ii) the observable taxonomic richness, and (iii) the structural complexity of the assemblages. The sensitivity of INDEX-COR was tested and showed good correlation with the Level of Pressure calculated for each station according to expert judgment and field observations.

AB  - 1. Conservation and management of transitional waters require monitoring activities that integrate traditional chemical and physical evaluations with biological assessment.
   2. Macrobenthic biotic indices have been proposed as an ecologically based, cost-effective tool for environmental quality assessment.
   3. Different approaches applicable to the biological assessment of transitional water are discussed.
   4. A biotic coefficient (a biotic index developed for European estuaries), different metrics, multivariate ordination plots and chemico-physical measures have been applied to the environmental quality assessment of a northern Adriatic coastal lagoon.
   5. Results of the biotic coefficient were positively correlated with values of evenness index (Hill's N10) and with the abundance of the opportunistic polychaete Capitella capitata, and they were negatively correlated with the abundance of the isopod Idotea balthica.
   6. Results of the biotic indices are dependent on knowledge of the sensitivity of the species and on the assumptions made. Therefore, their development and validation require a better understanding of population distribution and of assemblage dynamics in response to different natural or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - 1. Current budgets for environmental management are high, tend to increase, and are used to support policy and legislation which is standardized for large geographic units. Therefore, the search for tools to monitor the effects of this investment is a major issue in applied ecology. Ideally, such a biomonitoring tool should: (1) be as general as possible with respect to its geographic application; (2) be as specific as possible by separating different types of human impact on a given ecosystem; (3) reliably indicate changes in human impact of a particular type; and (4) be derived from a sound theoretical concept in ecology.
   2. We developed an approach to biomonitoring which matches these 'ideal' characteristics by focusing on numerous, general biological species traits (e.g. size, number of descendants per reproductive cycle, parental care, mobility) and on the habitat templet concept, which relates trends in these general species traits to disturbance patterns. Using the French Rhone River and benthic macroinvertebrates as an example, we have used the data to demonstrate a general framework and the potential of our approach rather than to produce a ready-made tool. Our data covered a large river and its major tributaries, which has a catchment that crosses ecoregions, and known gradients and discontinuities in human impact.
   3. We applied multivariate analyses to evaluate how the distribution of species traits in invertebrate communities could discriminate environmental differences along the Rhone in comparison to traditionally used approaches (e.g. community structure, based on species abundances, or ecological species traits, such as velocity preferences and pollution tolerance). Invertebrate community structure expressed in terms either of the abundance or the traits of species reliably indicated differences in overall human impact. The community structure based on biological traits was less confounded by natural spatial gradients and reliably indicated human impact, while community structure based on ecological traits was the most confounded by natural spatial gradients and was the poorest indicator of human impact. Community structure based on species abundances was an intermediate indicator of human impact.
   4. These results indicate that a revision of biomonitoring approaches which have been based on a single aspect of the biological responses may be warranted. The biological traits of species could separate the different types of human impact. Therefore, the use of these traits in biomonitoring could improve existing multi-metric approaches. Future research has to show if the general applicability of species traits allows the development of a unique biomonitoring tool for running waters of the European Union, for running waters in temperate climates on several continents, for freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems, and/or for global biodiversity assessment.

AB  - The objectives of this study were twofold: (i) assess the bioaccumulation characteristics of a suite of metals associated with several different species of O-donata and (ii) examine Odonata species richness as a reflection of ecosystem health in two ecologically important wetlands of southwestern Iran, the Shadegan and Hawr Al Azim wetlands. Levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) in nine different Odonata larva species. Based on these data, biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) were calculated and generally, it was found that Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn were being taken up by the Odonata (BSAFs > 1). Because of its prevalence in the wetland and its observed ability to take up metals, it is suggested that Ischnura ramburii is an appropriate indicator of ecosystem health for these wetlands with respect to metal contamination. Odonata species richness across all sites was 49, while for the individual sites, the greatest species richness was 26 and the lowest species

AB  - 'Appropriate assessment' of plans and projects is required under the European Habitats Directive. It assesses whether a plan or project, 'in combination', Could affect the 'integrity' of sites of international nature conservation importance in Europe. It is very precautionary: plans or projects that could affect site integrity may not be adopted unless a series of stringent requirements-testing of alternatives, proof of overriding need, and provision of compensation-are met.
   Appropriate assessment of plans began to be carried Out in England in early 2006. Since then, various guidance documents have been published, but there is still considerable debate about just What methodology should be used. how to test impacts on site 'integrity', what avoidance and mitigation measures are adequate, who should be responsible for these measures etc., and even about what the process should be called. The first legal challenges based oil appropriate assessment of plans are emerging.
   Appropriate assessments are showing that many English plans could affect European sites, either directly through land take, or indirectly by, for instance, reducing water levels or increasing recreational disturbance. The question now is how to respond to the clash between people's aspirations for new homes and economic growth, and wildlife conservation. This article discusses the legal requirements and emerging guidance oil appropriate assessment of plans in England, how it relates to strategic environmental assessment. the Current Status of these assessments. and emerging issues.

AB  - Triggered by the adoption of the Water Framework Directive, a variety of fish-based systems were developed throughout Europe to assess the ecological status of lakes. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of all existing systems and summarizes sampling methods, fish community traits (metrics) and the relevant anthropogenic pressures assessed by them. Twenty-one European countries developed fish-based assessment systems. Three countries each developed two distinct systems to approach different ecoregions, either to use different data, or to assess different lake types leading to a total number of 24 systems. The most common approach for the setting of reference conditions, used in seventeen systems, was the utilisation of fish communities in comparably undisturbed natural lakes as reference. Eleven used expert judgment, nine historical data and eight modelled relationships. Fourteen systems combined at least two approaches. The most common fish sampling method was a standardized fishing procedure with multimesh-gillnets. Many countries applied combinations of fishing methods, e.g. non-standard gillnets, fyke nets and electrofishing. Altogether 177 metrics were used for index development and each system combined 2-13 metrics. The most common ones were total standardized catches of number and biomass, relative abundance of Perca fluviatilis,

AB  - Native vegetation around the world is under threat from historical and ongoing clearance, overgrazing, invasive species, increasing soil and water salinity, altered fire regimes, poor land management and other factors, resulting in a degradation of natural ecosystem services. Consequently, maintaining and improving native vegetation condition is a target frequently adopted by natural resource managers and government agencies world-wide. Adequate monitoring of vegetation condition remains a prerequisite for environmental decision-making and for tracking progress towards management goals. Throughout we consider vegetation condition to include the compositional, structural and functional attributes of vegetation relative to undisturbed vegetation of the same type.
   Site-based methods have long been used to assess compositional, structural and functional attributes as indicators of vegetation condition, and these methods continue to be used widely today. With developing technologies, remote sensing methods are being employed increasingly for monitoring a range of remotely detectable properties of vegetation, and there is now a growing demand to explicitly integrate the two approaches for mapping and monitoring vegetation condition across a range of scales.
   Here we review the attributes of vegetation identified as important for monitoring vegetation condition, those indicators that are best measured using traditional site-based methods and those that are more readily detectable using remote sensing methods, including their application in operational programmes within Australia. Further to this we review recent literature on the integration of the two approaches for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition.
   We find that remote sensing methods have the advantage of offering broad scale automated and repeatable methods for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition, but when combined with detailed ecological site-based data, together can improve monitoring for answering ecological questions across a range of scales. Further work, however, is required to effectively integrate the two approaches for mapping and monitoring vegetation condition. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Frogs and toads (anurans) are sensitive to a variety of anthropogenic stressors and are widely suggested as indicators of ecological condition. We surveyed 220 coastal wetlands along the U.S. shores of the Laurentian Great Lakes and quantified relationships between presence of anuran species and degree of anthropogenic disturbance. Results were used to derive explicit, functional relationships between environmental condition and anuran occurrences. These functions were subsequently used to calculate a multi-species indicator of ecological condition at other (novel) wetlands. Of 14 anuran species observed, spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) exhibited the strongest and most consistent relationship with environmental condition across the entire study area. Other species exhibited significant relationships with the environmental gradient, but the direction of association varied geographically or the overall species abundance was very low (e.g., mink frog, Rana septentrionalis). Even if applied to separate ecological provinces (Laurentian Mixed Forest or Eastern Deciduous Forest), multi-species estimates of wetland condition based on anurans are not much better indicators of environmental condition based on human disturbance than are indices based solely on occurrence of spring peeper. Nevertheless, indicators grounded in explicit relationships with environmental stress are superior to traditional measures (e.g., species richness) that combine species with different responses to the stress gradient. At least one anuran species (spring peeper) can contribute meaningfully to the assessment of ecological condition in Great Lakes coastal wetlands; its value as an indicator will be improved if it can be combined with information from other wetland species such as birds, fishes, and vascular plants.

AB  - Odonata have proven to be good indicators of freshwater as well as terrestrial habitat conditions. Several studies have shown changes in odonate species richness and/or community composition in response to deforestation, suggesting their potential as bioassessment tools in the tropics. However, former approaches using Odonata as an indicator group required comparative samples from differently disturbed sites and/or knowledge of the focal species environmental specificity. Here, we tested a robust, adult-based bioassessment method assuming that the level of tropical forest degradation reflects the proportional representation of the taxa above species. Based on Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases, we used data from previously published studies linking odonate assemblages to human-mediated disturbances in tropical forests. We hypothesized that along a disturbance gradient (from primary forest to non-forest), (i) the proportion of the suborder Zygoptera (mostly habitat specialists sensitive to deforestation) will decrease in favor of the suborder Anisoptera (high proportion of generalists); and (ii) the proportions of largely generalist families Coenagrionidae and Libellulidae will increase at the expense of other Zygoptera and Anisoptera, respectively. Our results revealed that a ratio of Zygoptera/Anisoptera is a poor indicator of tropical forest conditions, probably because of ecological diversity within these groups. However, the proportions of Coenagrionidae/other Zygoptera and Libellulidae/other Anisoptera significantly increased along a disturbance gradient, suggesting their potential to be a good indicator of well-preserved, altered, and heavily degraded forest habitats. Therefore, our results are in line with studies presenting the usefulness of adult Odonata as versatile indicators for assessing human-mediated changes in tropical forest environments, supporting the practical use of this group in biological monitoring.

AB  - Barquet, K. 2015. Building a bioregion through transboundary conservation in Central America. Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift-Norwegian Journal of Geography. Vol. 69, 265-276. ISSN 0029-1951.Proponents of transboundary conservation argue for the formation of a bioregional scale of governance. How such rescaling should be done remains an undiscussed issue. Through a study of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Central America and Si-A-Paz, a transboundary protected area in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the author investigates how a transboundary scale of conservation is enacted. The study shows that in order to meet the conditions of a bioregion, actors involved in transboundary conservation in Central America produced accounts of social and ecological integrity that did not entirely match local narratives. Moreover, transboundary conservation provided actors with increased mobility across governance scales and sources of funding. In turn, this scalar mobility enhanced the power of already powerful actors in the area, helped states to attract international sources of funding, and empowered previously marginalized local groups at the expense of others. The author concludes that actors involved in transboundary conservation attempt to create new meanings of nature and understandings of society in order to produce a new scale of conservation. However, the study highlights the problems of matching discourses of nature to accounts of social unity, and underlines the political nature of scalar projects.

AB  - Three data sources (physico-chemistry, bio-monitoring and eco-toxicology) are currently used in South Africa to establish environmental water quality conditions. Environmental water quality in turn is key information required for the "ecological reserve determination" of river reaches. Bio-monitoring in South Africa has been limited in recent times mostly to the use of the SASS procedure which relies on invertebrates only. This paper describes the re-introduction of a diatom-based water quality assessment as an added-value bio-monitoring tool. A specific example is discussed citing the response of diatom assemblages to diffuse pollution from acid mine drainage and how effective diatoms are as indicators of ecological integrity and river recovery measured downstream of the area of impact. The advantages of applying this bio-monitoring technique over other biological measures are presented in the context of technological advances in rapid image processing, species identification and software applications of diatom-based water quality indices. The valuable records of the diatom assemblages of the past, held in the South African Diatom Collection at the CSIR (KwaZulu-Natal), can now be accessed and interpreted as historical environmental water quality reference points for several rivers in South Africa.

AB  - The biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems in developing countries faces several limitations, especially related to gathering resources. The present study aimed at comparing the responses of fish and benthic macroinvertebrates to environmental change, to identify which group best indicates the differences between reference and impacted streams in southern Brazil. We determined reference and impacted sites based on physical and chemical variables of the water. For the analysis and comparison of biological responses, we calculated 22 metrics and submitted them to a discriminant analysis. We selected from this analysis only six metrics, which showed that the two studied assemblages respond differently to environmental change. A larger number of metrics were selected for macroinvertebrates than for fish in the separate analysis. The metrics selected for macroinvertebrates in the pooled analysis (i.e., fish and macroinvertebrates together) were different from those selected in the separate analysis for macroinvertebrates alone. However, the metrics selected for fish in the pooled analysis were the same selected in the separate analysis for fish alone. The macroinvertebrate assemblage was more effective for distinguishing reference from impacted sites. We suggest the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of Neotropical streams, especially in situations in which time and money are short.

AB  - Arthropods are valuable biological indicators owing to strong relationships with primary producers. The supposition that arthropod-plant interactions are constant over seasons was tested using Mantel tests on correlations between these groups. A total of 78 plant species and 108 arthropod families were sampled monthly from the endangered Bloemfontein Dry Grassland at the Free State National Botanical Gardens between April 2009 and March 2010. Interaction strengths between plants and arthropods varied within a calendar year; being strongest in winter months (July and August), initiation of the growth season (November) and peak growth season (February and March). It was hypothesised that variation was caused by changing primary productivity. The trophic composition of the arthropod community supported this hypothesis as the ratio between primary consumers (herbivores) and secondary consumers (predators and parasitoids) showed patterns that coincided with periods of strong arthropod-plant interactions. Patterns were explained by multiple theories linking plant and arthropod diversity. It was concluded that arthropod assemblages are closely linked to primary producers, the abiotic environment and top-down trophic forces at different times of the year. Future arthropod-based studies should be performed with clear objectives and seasonal benchmark conditions to overcome these variations.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates have a successful history of use as indicators of human impact in lotic environments. More recently, macroinvertebrate indices have been recommended for use in certain wetland types. Yet some authors do not recommend macroinvertebrates indices of wetland condition in areas with pronounced natural environmental heterogeneity. Our study provides a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of using macroinvertebrates for bioassessment of temporary isolated depression wetlands in the south-western Cape region of South Africa. We expected natural environmental heterogeneity among wetlands to exert a stronger influence on macroinvertebrates than human disturbance factors. Partitioning of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition that could be attributed to human disturbance factors (within and adjacent to wetlands), environmental variables and spatio-temporal factors indicated that environmental and spatio-temporal factors independent of human disturbances largely determined assemblage composition, whilst human disturbance played a relatively minor role. Linear regressions of taxon richness/diversity measures, individual families and a collation of metrics against measures of habitat transformation around wetlands and scores from a rapid assessment index of human disturbance revealed poor relationships. The univariate and multivariate patterns observed in this study do not lend themselves to the creation of a macroinvertebrate index of human disturbance for temporary wetlands in the region.

AB  - Wetland restoration is globally important for offsetting effects of wetland loss and degradation but is not consistently successful. Vegetation studies provide insight into the effectiveness of restoring wetland ecosystem functions. We compared plant community composition in 47 non-tidal wetlands under different management (natural, restored, and former wetlands that had been converted to cropland) in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. As expected, drained cropland sites were dominated by conventional upland row crops, had low species richness and evenness, and were highly disturbed. Plant communities in restored sites were more like natural sites based on the percentage of species that were native and hydrophytic, plant community evenness, and floristic quality. However, natural sites were forested, while restored and drained cropland sites were primarily herbaceous. Restored sites continued to be impacted by anthropogenic disturbance compared to natural sites. Our findings demonstrate that restored wetlands in agricultural settings can develop diverse native wetland plant communities within a decade but they remain very different from natural wetlands, raising questions about restoration goals, ecosystem service tradeoffs, and our ability to restore wetlands to ecological conditions found in reference sites.

AB  - Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.

AB  - Florida legislation requires determining and implementing an appropriate range and frequency of freshwater inflows that will sustain a fully functional estuary. Changes in inflow dynamics to the Caloosahatchee Estuary, Florida have altered salinity regimes that, in turn, have altered the ecological integrity of the estuary. The purpose of this current project is to determine how changes in freshwater inflows affect water quality, and in turn, benthic macrofauna, spatially within the Caloosahatchee Estuary and between multiyear wet and dry periods. Thirty-four benthic species were identified as being indicator species for salinity zones, and the estuary was divided into 4 zones based on differences in community structure within the estuary. Community structure had the highest correlations with water quality parameters that were common indicators of freshwater conditions resulting from inflows. A significant relationship between salinity and diversity occurs both spatially and temporally because of increased numbers of marine species as salinities increase. A salinity-based model was used to estimate inflow during wet and dry periods for each of the macrofauna community zones. The approach used here (identifying bioindicators and community zones with corresponding inflow ranges) is generic and will be useful for developing targets for managing inflow in estuaries worldwide.

AB  - In this paper, we report on the identification of batches of analgesic paracetamol (acetaminophen) tablets using nitrogen-14 nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy (N-14 NQR). The high sensitivity of NQR to the electron charge distribution surrounding the quadrupolar nucleus enables the unique characterization of the crystal structure of the material. Two hypothesis were tested on batches of the same brand: the within the same batch variability and the difference between batches that varied in terms of their batch number and expiry date. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) did not provide any within-batches variations, indicating the natural deviation of a medicine manufactured under the same conditions. Alternatively, the statistical analysis revealed a significant discrimination between the different batches of paracetamol tablets. Therefore, the NQR signal is an indicator of factors that influence the physical and chemical integrity of the material. Those factors might be the aging of the medicine, the manufacturing, or storage conditions. The results of this study illustrate the potential of NQR as promising technique in applications such as detection and authentication of counterfeit medicines.

AB  - The implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires the classification of the ecological quality status of benthic macroinvertebrates in costal and transitional waters. The uncertainty and complexity of this task have lead to the creation of specific Geographical intercalibration Groups (GIGs) for the different ecoregions and types of water bodies established. In this framework, several metrics are under study in the United Kingdom, Spain and Denmark for North East Atlantic coastal waters (NEA-GIG). All of them include in their formulations the AMBI index. Nevertheless, few advances have been made in relation to transitional waters. This paper aims to test the suitability of those methodological procedures for their application in Northern Spanish estuaries. The results show evident divergences in classification of ecological status among methods, although the correlations of corresponding ecological quality ratios (EQRs) are good. Thus, we think that it may be necessary to modify the boundaries between each ecological status category and adjust the reference conditions for the variety of community-types existing in estuarine water bodies. However, some problems arise in the assessment of some naturally stressed communities. In this situation, we found an overall dominance of species tolerant to organic enrichment in all status categories and low range of variation of AMBI index. This aspect introduces some uncertainty in relation to the ability of this index to detect a deleterious effect in these estuarine communities naturally stressed. On the other hand, we found some sites that achieve good status according to the metrics used, even though the number of opportunistic species was high. The use of combined approaches that incorporate physicochemical condition of sediments would be a straightforward approach to reduce the risk of failing in the assignation of ecological status category.

AB  - Rotifers are cyclical parthenogens that produce sexual diapausing eggs at some stage in their life cycle. These eggs are encysted embryos that remain viable for extended periods in lake and pond sediments, thus acting as an egg bank with many ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite its importance to rotifer evolution, there are no studies on resting egg deterioration and associated processes in natural environments. In this study, more than 4000 diapausing eggs of species from the Brachionus plicatilis complex, which includes several closely related cryptic species, were collected from different sediment depths in 15 ponds in eastern Spain and were classified according to three features thought to be related to their viability: shell integrity, embryo size, and embryo colour. A positive association was found between embryo size and hatching success in those eggs having an intact shell. Diapausing eggs that showed good shell integrity and no more than a 25% reduction of multinuclear embryo maximum size were classified as healthy and 98.9% hatched. Darkening of diapausing egg embryo was an indicator of viability loss. A decreasing frequency of healthy-looking diapausing eggs was observed with increasing sediment depth, although some exceptions were found. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Variation in watershed land use is known to influence the physical and chemical conditions in resident streams; however, few studies have evaluated variation in ecosystem structure and function, in a quantitative sense, whereby specific environmental break-points in land use could be defined. We conducted seasonal sampling (spring, summer, and fall of 2005-2006) in 43 third order streams that were representative of conditions throughout the mid-Atlantic region. Stream physical, biological, and chemical conditions were measured as represented by 19 environmental variables (physical-chemical), in addition to benthic chlorophyll concentrations and the relative abundance of diatom species collected from each stream. Watershed forest cover explained significant variation in stream benthic chlorophyll (stepwise linear regression, r(2) = 39.2 %) as selected from a set of relevant variables (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, % Forest cover, and stream temperature). Benthic chlorophyll (range 0.1 to 917 mg m(-2)) and nutrient tolerant diatom guilds were inversely correlated with forest cover, while nutrient sensitive diatom species had a positive correlation. Loess trend analysis coupled with regression tree analysis (RPART) identified abrupt changes in benthic chlorophyll and the relative abundance of diatom nutrient guilds at breakpoints of 60 % and 80 % forest cover. Despite the correlative nature of this study, the findings here suggest individual ecosystems may exhibit abrupt changes in ecosystem function following declines in forest cover, particularly at the breakpoints identified here.

AB  - Avoided ecological loss is an appropriate measure of conservation effectiveness, but challenging to measure because it requires consideration of counterfactual conditions. Land-use simulation is a well suited but under-utilized tool in this regard. As a case study for the application of land-use simulation to assess the impact of protected areas, we present a scenario analysis exploring conservation options in Canada's western boreal forest. The cumulative effect of multiple natural resource sectors, including oil and gas, forestry, and agriculture, have substantially altered the region's ecosystems in recent decades and elevated risk to wildlife. The evolving state of the region is such that managing risks to biodiversity requires consideration of not only today's but also tomorrow's conditions. We simulated the long-term (50-year) outcomes of land use and protection to caribou, fisher, fish, and resource production in each of 104 watersheds in the 693,345 km(2) study area. Simulated land use caused increased risk to wildlife in response to northwards expansion of resource extraction and expansion of agricultural lands. For each watershed, indicator performance with and without protection were compared to calculate the benefit (avoided ecological loss) and cost (lost opportunity for resource production) of protection. The capacity for protected areas to avoid disturbance varied substantially across watersheds, as did the potential loss of economic opportunity. Focusing protection on cost-effective watersheds made protected area expansion a more efficient strategy for reducing wildlife risk than reducing the overall rate of natural resource production. Heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness of protection presents an opportunity to balance ecological integrity and economic growth.

AB  - Understanding how changes in oceanographic conditions affect predators and their prey is fundamental for interpreting variability in natural marine ecosystems. At South Georgia, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are known cephalopod predators and potential indicators of changes in regional environment conditions and prey availability. The cephalopod component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia was assessed using lower beaks found in scats collected over 5 consecutive years (2009-2013) under known variable oceanographic conditions. In years of unusually warm oceanographic conditions around South Georgia and low Antarctic krill Euphausia superba density, the number of squids Slosarczykovia circumantarctica increased in the seals' diet. Moreover, stable isotope analysis of beaks showed that S. circumantarctica exhibited higher delta N-15 values in years that were associated with an offshore habitat (lower delta C-13 values) where Antarctic fur seals had been foraging. This study provides evidence of the ecological links between the feeding behaviour of Antarctic fur seals, their main cephalopod prey, Antarctic krill densities and oceanographic conditions.

AB  - Inferences drawn from regional bioassessments could be strengthened by integrating data from different monitoring programs. We combined data from the US Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program and the US Environmental Protection Agency Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) to expand the scope of an existing River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)-type predictive model and to assess the biological condition of streams across the western US in a variety of landuse classes. We used model-derived estimates of taxon-specific probabilities of capture and observed taxon occurrences to identify taxa that were absent from sites where they were predicted to occur (decreasers) and taxa that were present at sites where they were not predicted to occur (increasers). Integration of 87 NAWQA reference sites increased the scope of the existing WSA predictive model to include larger streams and later season sampling. Biological condition at 336 NAWQA test sites was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with basin land use and tended to be lower in basins with intensive landuse modification (e.g., mixed, urban, and agricultural basins) than in basins with relatively undisturbed land use (e.g., forested basins). Of the 437 taxa observed among reference and test sites, 180 (41%) were increasers or decreasers. In general, decreasers had a different set of ecological traits (functional traits or tolerance values) than did increasers. We could predict whether a taxon was a decreaser or an increaser based on just a few traits, e.g., desiccation resistance, timing of larval development, habit, and thermal preference, but we were unable to predict the type of basin land use from trait states present in invertebrate assemblages. Refined characterization of traits might be required before bioassessment data call be used routinely to aid in the diagnoses of the causes of biological impairment.

AB  - Conversion of native forest to pastures is a common practice worldwide; it has complex effects on river biota that are related to activity type and intensity. This work was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of cattle grazing on environmental features and to select the most appropriate measures based on the macroinvertebrate community as indicators of ecological changes. Physicochemical features, riparian ecosystem quality, habitat condition, and benthic macroinvertebrates were investigated in streams draining pastures and were compared to reference streams located in nonimpacted native forested catchments. Strong evidence of sediment deposition was observed at pasture streams, which had higher percentage of sand in the streambed but also increased levels of suspended solids. Pasture sites had significantly higher water temperature and conductivity as well as lower dissolved oxygen concentrations than did forested sites. Both riparian quality and in-stream habitat condition were degraded at pasture sites. Among metrics, total richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness, Plecoptera richness, Shannon diversity, percentage of dominant taxon, percentage of Chironomidae species, shredder richness, and percentage of predator resulted to be the most consistent measures by displaying stronger responses to impairment. Our results suggest that forest conversion to pasture for livestock practices is diminishing macroinvertebrate biodiversity and potentially changing functioning and dynamics of Patagonian mountain streams as well. Damage prevention on riverine landscapes by restoring riparian ecosystems, replanting missing vegetation in buffer areas, and limiting livestock access to the riverbanks could contribute to enhance the ecological integrity at converted areas. A more extended and comprehensive use of macroinvertebrate metrics could contribute to better understand and evaluate impact effects of these extended land use activities and to promote conservation strategies.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) are widely used to assess the ecological health of freshwater ecosystems. An MMI is a sum of several standardized numeric variables or metrics, each representing a different attribute of a biological assemblage. Many researchers believe that highly correlated metrics should not be included in the same MMI because they convey redundant information. To seek evidence for or against this belief, I compared the performance of 1,000 MMIs created for each of eight existing data sets by randomly resampling metrics from sets of previously identified candidates. An MMI's performance was measured by its precision and its ability to detect differences between assemblages sampled in independently assessed reference and impacted streams. Across the 1,000 MMIs, precision decreased with increasing mean correlation magnitude for seven of the eight data sets. For seven of the data sets, multiple linear regressions fitted to each set of 1,000 MMIs predicted a decrease in MMI detection ability as the mean correlation magnitude between metrics increased, after adjusting for the average responsiveness of individual metrics to the difference between reference and impacted conditions. However, similar regressions showed that the size of the largest correlation between any two metrics in an MMI had little or no effect on its detection ability. Thus, minimizing the mean of metric correlations is more effective than the widespread practice of setting an upper correlation limit when optimal MMI performance is desired. Finally, an MMI had originally been built for each data set by selecting one set of individually best metrics. In 23 of 24 assessments, 5-100% of randomly selected MMIs outperformed the original MMIs. Because individually best metrics rarely yielded a best-performing summed index, I recommend assessing multiple candidate MMIs, rather than just multiple candidate metrics, when developing a new MMI.

AB  - Since ponds are limnologically different from rivers and lakes, and as there is a lack of specific methods to assess their ecological quality, we developed a method to assist managers in routine biomonitoring of ponds. For this work, a total of 36 lowland permanent ponds were selected from an existing dataset of 134 Swiss ponds that were classified along a gradient from reference to degraded sites. Site degradation was characterised by seven variables indicative of pond ecological condition: (i) one descriptor of plant communities (macrophyte species richness); (ii) one descriptor of trophic state (total phosphorus and total nitrogen (PN)), and (iii) five anthropogenic stressors linked to land use (percentage of semi-natural areas within a 50-m radius of the site, connectivity with other wetlands within 1 km, percentage of agricultural activities and pastures in the pond catchment, and dominant land use in terms of surface area).
   A total of 55 potential macroinvertebrate and amphibian metrics were tested to assess their relationship to site degradation. The metrics were based on taxonomic richness (total and selected macroinvertebrate groups), intolerance of degradation, conservation values, and biological/ecological traits. The selection of the metrics to be integrated into the index followed a stepwise procedure. To be selected, a metric had to fulfil four criteria. It must have: (1) a significant relationship with at least one of the seven indicators of pond ecological condition; (2) the ability to discriminate between reference and degraded sites; (3) a relative scope of impairment inferior to 1(low inherent variability of a metric); (4) no redundancy with other metrics used in the index. To produce the index, 18 combinations of selected metrics were tested.
   The final index (CIEPT) was built using three metrics: genera richness of Coleoptera (C), macroinvertebrate family richness (I), and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) family richness. The CIEPT responded significantly to pond ecological condition and was tested successfully with an external dataset to confirm suitability. The CIEPT index could be a useful and relatively low cost tool to assist site managers in assessing the ecological quality of ponds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial lakes, initially built in estuaries for positive purposes such as flood prevention and providing irrigation water, have been found to have negative impacts including blocking tidal cycles, disappearance of brackish water zones, sediment increase, water pollution, change of microbial diversity inhabiting patterns, and a decline in fish diversity. In this study, multidisciplinary field studies including physical, chemical, and biological analyses were performed to demonstrate decadal and seasonal scale changes in the ecological environment in Yeongsan Reservoir (YSR), Korea, since the construction of a 4.35 km-long dam in 1981. The results of the study show that the volume of sediment accumulated in YSR was 75.2 million m(3) since the dam was constructed, resulting in a 33.6% reduction of the total water storage capacity. Also, water quality in YSR was affected by complex physico-chemical and hydrological phenomena, including saline and thermal stratifications, and pollutant loadings leading to eutrophication. Subsequent sediment bacteria analyses showed microbial diversity according to different depths in sediment, indicating the environmental change of sediment ecology. Moreover, the fish diversity in this study (2006-2007) was found to be considerably reduced compared to a similar study in 1989 (42% reduction), and the ecological health was deemed to be in a "poor" condition based on the 10-metric Lentic Ecosystem Health Assessment (LEHA) model. Accordingly, these results indicate that aquatic ecosystems are detrimentally affected by estuarine dams that block tidal flows, and when applied to short/long-term management strategies for artificial lakes in estuaries, suggest that similar construction projects have to be suitably controlled.

AB  - Biotic indices are widely applied for conservation and management of aquatic resources since they allow water resources monitoring agencies to get insight in complex biological data and yield policy relevant information. Despite the worldwide popularity of biotic indices, little information on their use and applicability in Eastern Africa is available. Here, we develop a multimetric index based on macroinvertebrates to assess the ecological condition of natural wetlands in Southwest Ethiopia. Index development was based on a dataset of 222 samples collected during two consecutive years from 63 sites located at eight different wetlands. We used physico-chemical and hydro-morphological variables (land use pattern, habitat alteration, hydrological modification and chemical water quality) to classify sites as reference or degraded. We tested a total of 58 potential metrics representing various aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblages including family richness, composition, tolerance measures and presence and abundance of functional feeding groups. Metrics were selected for the development of a final index based on their sensitivity in discriminating reference from impaired sites, strength of correlation with the anthropogenic disturbance gradient, chemical measurements, and the degree of redundancy. Metrics retained for the final index were:overall family richness, family richness of Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Trichoptera (EDT), and percentage of filterer-collectors. The final index, derived from the sum of three metric scores, was divided into five water quality classes (very bad, bad, moderate, good and very good). Our final multimetric macroinvertebrate index (MMI) distinguished well between reference and impaired wetland sites and showed a significant negative response to a gradient of disturbances (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.05). Moreover, it classified a validation dataset accurately with a correctly classified instances of 80% and a Cohen's Kappa value of 0.6. This MMI can be considered as a robust and sensitive tool that can be applied to evaluate the ecological condition of natural wetlands in Ethiopia, where wetland resources are under high pressure as a result of agricultural activities such as grazing and urbanization.

AB  - Determining what indicators can be used to measure forest health has been much discussed but largely unresolved in the forestry literature. A model is presented in which the condition of a stand is quantified relative to a suitable target condition based on a preselected set of stands that, in the opinions of the managers, meet management objectives. Each stand was characterized by a list of variables that were selected from the existing forest database. We termed these characterizations stand profiles. Profiles of inventory data for 28 stands, each managed for either wildlife habitat or timber production in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in eastern Oregon, USA, were used to develop this model. Healthy stands were represented by points in multidimensional scaling space that fell within the bounds of a 65% kernel density estimation of the distribution of stands preselected for each management objective. Stands falling outside these bounds were, by definition unhealthy, and the distance from the bounds is a measure of degree of unhealthiness. Operationally, the objectives of silvicultural manipulations would be to maintain or move points to within the target space by selectively manipulating the values composing stand profiles. The direction and length of the trajectory associated with manipulations is an indicator of the effect of management actions. More work needs to be done to develop and validate this method.

AB  - The relationship between biodiversity and each ecosystem service or bundle of ecosystem services (e.g. win win, win lose or win neutral) is an active field of research that requires structured and consistent information. The application of that research for conservation and decision-making can be hampered by the ambiguity found in the definition of the nursery function under the ecosystem service perspective. In this paper, we review how the role of nursery habitats is included in the ecosystem services literature, covering conceptual, biophysical and economic reflections. The role of ecosystems as nurseries is mostly analyzed in coastal environments. The main observation is that there is no consensus on the consideration of the nursery function as a service (e.g. which species or habitats) or on how to assess it (e.g. which indicators or valuation methods). After that review, we analyze three different interpretations given to the nursery function, namely the ecological, conservationist and economic point of view; and we distinguish between different types of assessment that may consider the nursery function. We conclude that the nursery function can be considered an ecosystem service on its own right when it is linked to a concrete human benefit and not when it is represented with indicators of general biodiversity or ecosystem condition. Thus, the analysis of the delivery of ecosystem services should be differentiated from the analysis of ecological integrity. Only with this distinction science may be able to quantify the link between biodiversity and ecosystem services and policy may be effective in halting biodiversity loss. Similar considerations could apply for other biodiversity constituents that may be treated as ecosystem services. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity has been impacted by several stressors such as eutrophication, turbidity and metals. Be-sides these frequent impacts, large-scale accidents occasionally affect aquatic systems, input an intense load of contaminants to the water bodies, as in the case of the Fundao tailing dam collapse (Brazil), which launched mil-lions of meters cubic of iron ore tailing in the Doce River Basin. Our aim in this study was to assess how much stress the environmental conditions of lentic and lotic environments in the lower region of this basin impact the periphytic community. In addition, we intend to verify whether the limits of changes of the periphytic com-munities agreed with Brazilian legislation for the protection of aquatic life. For that, monthly samplings were car-ried out in seven sampling stations in lentic environments and five in lotic environments, including the Doce River channel, between October/2018 and March/2021 (except in October/2019). Concentrations of metals (iron, aluminum, manganese and chromium), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, conductivity, and suspended par-ticulate material were determined. The periphytic community was collected from natural substrates (macro-phytes or pebbles) and quantified by the sedimentation chamber method. From these data, thresholds of concentrations of variables that caused changes in periphytic communities were determined by the Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). We concluded that evidence of chronic impact of iron ore tailing should be re-vealed and that the standards established by Brazilian legislation may be incompatible with the protection of aquatic life. Moreover, we found that the Doce River mouth and surrounding environments were the most stress-ful environments for the periphytic communities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lakes in Europe are subject to multiple anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication, habitat degradation and introduction of alien species, which are frequently inter-related. Therefore, effective assessment methods addressing multiple pressures are needed. In addition, these systems have to be harmonised (i.e. intercalibrated) to achieve common management objectives across Europe.
   Assessments of fish communities inform environmental policies on ecological conditions integrating the impacts of multiple pressures. However, the challenge is to ensure consistency in ecological assessments through time, across ecosystem types and across jurisdictional boundaries. To overcome the serious comparability issues between national assessment systems in Europe, a total anthropogenic pressure intensity (TAPI) index was developed as a weighted combination of the most common pressures in European lakes that is validated against 10 national fish-based Water quality assessment systems using data from 556 lakes.
   Multi-pressure indices showed significantly higher correlations with fish indices than single-pressure indices. The best-performing index combines eutrophication, hydromorphological alterations and human use intensity of lakes. For specific lake types also biological pressures may constitute an important additional pressure. The best-performing index showed a strong correlation with eight national fish-based assessment systems. This index can be used in lake management for assessing total anthropogenic pressure on lake ecosystems and creates a benchmark for comparison of fish assessments independent of fish community composition, size structure and fishing-gear.
   We argue that fish-based multiple-pressure assessment tools should be seen as complementary to single-pressure tools offering the major advantage of integrating direct and indirect effects of multiple pressures over large scales of space and time. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study shows how the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2 that originated from United States was readapted to formulate the River Physical Quality Index (RPQI) for Malaysia. The approach emphasizes that it is not necessary to "reinvent the wheel" as globally, there are already a range of established best practices in developed countries to emulate. The proposed RPQI protocol was tested on four eco-hydrological zones in Kampar River for 18 months to measure and detect temporal and spatial physical impairment induced by natural and anthropogenic factors. To be relevant to the Malaysian context, local fish community structure metrics were deployed to test and validate RPQI sensitivity and effectiveness. The results showed that RPQI values were able to reflect river physical degradation and correlated strongly with most fish-based metrics. However, the RPQI values were weakly linked to fish population abundance and evenness metrics. The results implied that species niche responses need to be considered when applied for testing river assessment system, particularly when introduced species are present. The novel insights provided herein are constructive to inform similar endeavours in other Southeast Asia tropical countries for testing river physical assessment systems with biological metrics.

AB  - A fish - based index for the assessment of the ecological quality of natural temperate lakes was developed, in accordance to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. As a case study, 11 natural lakes located at northern and western Greece were selected. Fish surveys were conducted during mid summer to mid autumn in 2010, 2011 and 2012 using Nordic gillnets and electrofishing. Environmental parameters and anthropogenic pressures were assessed for each lake. Fish species richness, abundance, trophic, reproductive and habitat functional guilds were used for extracting a set of 107 metrics, meeting the requirements of the WFD. All metrics were initially tested as candidates for the index development. A stepwise linear regression of each metric against environmental parameters (lake area, altitude, maximum depth, alkalinity) and anthropogenic pressures (drainage area covered by non-natural land uses - NNLC, water total phosphorus concentrations - TP, Lake Habitat Modification Score - LHMS) was initially conducted for ensuring pressure-response relationships. Reference conditions for each lake were estimated by the hindcasting procedure and the ecological quality for each lake was expressed as the ecological quality ratio (EQR) by a value ranging from 0 (poor quality) to I (excellent quality). Two fish fauna metrics, the relative numerical abundance of introduced species (Introduced(a)) and the relative biomass of omnivorous species (OMNIb) were finally extracted as the most significant, responding to LHMS and TP, respectively. The final index was expressed as the mean values of the EQRs of these two metrics. The multimetric fish index presented herein could serve as a tool for assessing the ecological quality of natural lakes at broad geographical scale and generally, in the Mediterranean temperate lakes with similar hydromorphological characteristics.

AB  - Natural temporal variation in biological assemblages is generally acknowledged, but rarely controlled for in existing bioassessment approaches. Many bioassessment methods ignore the variation of assemblage structure through time and, thus, lack a process to evaluate the effects of natural temporal variation on their outcomes. We used an 11-y data set from 24 near-pristine reference streams (validation sites) and a 5-y data set from 10 streams exposed to human disturbance (test sites) in northern Finland to examine: 1) the amount of interannual variation in macroinvertebrate communities in both types of streams measured as variation in taxonomic completeness (i.e., ratio of observed/expected taxa; O/E ratio), and 2) how temporal variability affects bioassessment outcomes. Most of the variation in O/E values was explained by stream type (validation or test). Interannual variation in O/E was low at both validation and test sites, a result supporting the assumption of high constancy of biological assemblages through time. Temporal variation in O/E at validation sites was related to climatic factors (regional precipitation) and to some local environmental variables, e. g., substratum heterogeneity. Communities in validation and test sites responded differentially to climatic variation. The low interannual variation in O/E suggests that 1-y data from reference sites can be extrapolated across years relatively safely, but climatically extreme years may be problematic. Temporal variability in O/E was low at both types of sites, but it was still high enough to result in variable ecological status assessments across years, mainly at test sites with lower O/E ratios. Thus, at test sites, use of only 1-y data may cause erroneous management decisions, and accurate assessment of the biological quality of test sites might require repeated sampling over several years.

AB  - Despite the important role of wetlands in our society, they are continuously threatened by human activity. In Canada, the critical loss of these habitats has fostered the application of preventive measures to at least reduce, if not avoid, their accelerated disappearance. In order to implement adequate environmental practices to protect these ecosystems, managers need to have a global knowledge of their situation. In this context, Web Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer the possibility to visualize and share multiple integrated data as well as geoprocessings that can provide essential information to understand the relative risks wetlands are undergoing. In this work, we present the extension of an existing open source Web-GIS platform to manage wetlands in the province of Quebec, eastern Canada. The current platform offers new systematic and generalist spatial processing tools inspired on the metapopulation theory and on the concept of ecological integrity to evaluate changes in landscape that could affect wetlands systems. These new functionalities provides more compact and valuable information about wetlands' state that can inform decision-making in conservation of these habitats and biodiversity. The functions proposed can be used by different type of users without any particular or specific knowledge.

AB  - In this study, we assess the potential of ants as bioindicators of riparian ecological health in two river types (upland and lowland type) located in the Catalonian region. We proposed to understand to what extent do metrics based on ant responses provide useful information that cannot be presented by traditional biophysical assessments while attempting an approach to creating an ant-based multimetric index (ant-based MMI) of the riparian ecological health. A total of 22 ant species were identified, and 42 metrics related to ant foraging activity, species richness, and functional traits were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Riparian features and proximal land use land cover (LULC) were used to distinguish disturbed from less disturbed sites. We found that ant communities strongly responded to human disturbance. When compared with an exclusively physical-based index for the assessment of the riparian health, the ant-based MMI was more sensitive to human disturbance, by also reacting to the effects of the surrounding LULC pressure. This study provides a preliminary approach for an ant-based assessment tool to evaluate the health of riparian corridors although additional research is required to include other river types and a wider stressor gradient before a wider application.

AB  - Reservoirs are heavily modified lentic ecosystems. In spite of their differences from natural lakes, it is important to maintain and improve their chemical and ecological status. In the present study, we tested the value of an assessment tool based on the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, to evaluate the Ecological Potential (EP) of tropical reservoirs. We designed a conceptual assessment scheme based on the Reference Condition Approach, and developed a statistical model based on 28 sites classified as having Maximum Ecological Potential, localized in the reservoir of Serra Azul, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Sixty-two disturbed sites from three reservoirs were used to test the model. A classification system based on three EP classes was found to be the best option, and tracked different levels of total dissolved solids, turbidity, total nitrogen and trophic status. This study confirmed the utility of benthic macroinvertebrates as an indicator group of biological quality in reservoirs, and the statistical model applied was effective in providing a measure of the ecosystem health of the reservoirs. As a further improvement, the level of taxonomic resolution for certain groups such as chironomids could be increased, because knowledge of the species composition may provide a better discrimination of intermediate degradation levels.

AB  - Terrestrial salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have unique attributes that make them excellent indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in forested habitats. Their longevity, small territory size, site fidelity, sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic perturbations, tendency to occur in high densities, and low sampling costs mean that counts of plethodontid salamanders provide numerous advantages over counts of other North American forest organisms for indicating environmental change. Furthermore, they are tightly linked physiologically to microclimatic and successional processes that influence the distribution and abundance of numerous other hydrophilic but difficult-to-study forest dwelling plants and animals. Ecosystem process such as moisture cycling, food-wed dynamics, and succession, with their related structural and microclimatic variability, all affect forest biodiversity and have been shown to affect salamander populations as well. We determined the variability associated with sampling for plethodontid salamanders by estimating the coefficient of variation (CV) from available time-series data. The median coefficient of variation indicated that variation in counts of individuals among studies was much lower in plethodontids (27%) than in lepidoptera (93%), passerine birds (57%), small mammals (69%), or other amphibians (37-46%), which means plethodontid salamanders provide an important statistical advantage over other species for monitoring long-term forest health.

AB  - Large structures and high-value assets require inspection and integrity assessment methodologies that ensure maximum availability and operational capabilities. Large membranes are used as floating covers at the anaerobic wastewater lagoons of Melbourne Water's Western Treatment Plant (WTP). A critical function of this high-value asset pertains to the harnessing of the biogas gas generated at these lagoons as well as protecting the environment from the release of odours and greenhouse gases. Therefore, a proactive inspection and efficient management strategy are required to ensure these expensive covers' integrity and continued operation. Not only is identifying the state of stress on the floating cover crucial for its structural integrity assessment, but the development of rapid and non-contact inspections will significantly assist in determining the "real-life" performance of the cover for superior maintenance management. This study investigates a strain determination method for WTP floating cover which integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted photogrammetry with finite element analyses to determine the structural integrity of these covers. Collective aerial images were compiled to form 3D digital models of the deformed cover specimens, which were then employed in computational and statistical analyses to assess and predict the strain of the cover. The findings complement the future implementation of UAV-assisted aerial photogrammetry for structural health assessment of the large floating covers.

AB  - Bacterial spores are resistant to severe conditions and form a challenge to eradicate from food or food packaging material. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment is receiving more attention as potential sterilization method at relatively mild conditions but the exact mechanism of inactivation is still not fully understood. In this study, the biocidal effect by nitrogen CAP was determined for chemical (hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide), physical (UV) and heat-resistant spores. The three different sporeformers used are Bacillus cereus a food-borne pathogen, and Bacillus atrophaeus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus that are used as biological indicators for validation of chemical sterilization and thermal processes, respectively. The different spores showed variation in their degree of inactivation by applied heat, hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and UV treatments, whereas similar inactivation results were obtained with the different spores treated with nitrogen CAP. G. stearothermophilus spores displayed high resistance to heat, hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, while for UV treatment B. atrophaeus spores are most tolerant. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed distinct morphological changes for nitrogen CAP-treated B. cereus spores including etching effects and the appearance of rough spore surfaces, whereas morphology of spores treated with heat or disinfectants showed no such changes. Moreover, microscopy analysis revealed CAP-exposed B. cereus spores to turn phase grey conceivably because of water influx indicating damage of the spores, a phenomenon that was not observed for non-treated spores. In addition, data are supplied that exclude UV radiation as determinant of antimicrobial activity of nitrogen CAP. Overall, this study shows that nitrogen CAP treatment has a biocidal effect on selected Bacillus and Geobacillus spores associated with alterations in spore surface morphology and loss of spore integrity.

AB  - This paper focus on factors attributing to casing failure, their failure mechanism and the resulting failure mode. The casing is a critical component in a well and the main mechanical structural barrier element that provide conduits and avenue for oil and gas production over the well lifecycle and beyond. The casings are normally subjected to material degradation, varying local loads, induced stresses during stimulation, natural fractures, slip and shear during their installation and operation leading to different kinds of casing failure modes. The review paper also covers recent developments in casing integrity assessment techniques and their respective limitations.
   The taxonomy of the major causes and cases of casing failure in different well types is covered. In addition, an overview of casing trend utilisation and failure mix by grades is provided. The trend of casing utilisation in different wells examined show deep-water and shale gas horizontal wells employing higher tensile grades (P110 & Q125) due to their characteristics. Additionally, this review presents casing failure mixed by grades, with P110 recording the highest failure cases owing to its stiffness, high application in injection wells, shale gas, deep-water and high temperature and high temperature (HPHT) - wells with high failure probability. A summary of existing tools used for the assessment of well integrity issues and their respective limitations is provided and conclusions drawn.

AB  - The immature Odonata community is used to diagnose and monitor impacts on aquatic environments. Degraded environments, with a wide range of environmental variables, usually present highly resilient species. Here we present a highly diverse immature Odonata community, collect with great sample effort. In doing so, we were able to show that these altered and natural environments have similar immature Odonata communities, and pH was the only abiotic variable affecting the system and the community. The community also changes with seasonal variation, because rains modify the river flow. Furthermore, the ecological integrity of the streams was influenced by anthropogenic activities, changing the dynamics of the Odonata communities. Two genera, Brechmorhoga and "Unidentified genus 1", are indicators of altered environments, so they can be used as bioindicator in others monitoring environmental evaluations.

AB  - This study focused on a multi-indicator assessment methodology for governmental environmental auditing of water protection programs. The environmental status of Wuli Lake in China was assessed using the global indicators (driver-status-response) developed by the Commission on Sustainable Development, and four additional indicators proposed by the author: water quality, pollution load, aquatic ecosystem status, and lake sediment deposition. Various hydrological, chemical, biological and environmental parameters were used to estimate the values of the indicators for assessment of environmental status of the lake based on time series data sets for,twenty years. The indicators proposed can be customized to meeting the needs for particular assessment of water protection programs. This method can be used to evaluate the performance of national environmental protection programs and provide technical support for environmental auditors.

AB  - This study establishes the optimum thresholds and rating scales to evaluate the ecological integrity of Pasonanca Natural Park protected area in Zamboanga City, Philippines. Six indicators representing four key eco-hydrological attributes of sustainable water supply namely vegetation and soil at the riparian buffer zone, the hydrology and water quality of the stream, were assessed. Tree basal area was found to be high ranging from 56.08 m(2) ha(-1) to 65.46 m(2) ha(-1) in undisturbed sites. These values are higher than other tropical forests in Southeast Asia. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were at critical levels. Mean streamflow was significantly declining at 0.101 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1)(p<0.001) suggesting the possibility of diminishing water supply in the coming years. The annual mean water turbidity was significantly increasing at 2.572 NTU yr(-1) or 22.48% yr(-1)(p<0.001) hinting at higher frequency of chemical treatment and increasing risk of exposure to disinfection by-products in drinking water. Annual high turbidity day count occurred more than 90 days from 2007 to 2013 with the highest at 181 days in 2011. The overall ecological integrity rating of Pasonanca Natural Park is poor. The withdrawal of the riparian buffer zone from strict protection status and its reclassification to special use zone to pave the way for active management should be considered.

AB  - Regionally stratified biological criteria are being used increasingly to assess stream quality. We used multivariate analysis of variance and canonical analysis to examine the utility of two regional frameworks (basins and ecoregions) and 14 candidate metrics of local fish assemblages for assessing the biotic integrity of streams in the mid-Atlantic highlands (montane areas from Pennsylvania to Virginia). In particular, we determined (1) how metrics varied naturally among basins and ecoregions and (2) which metrics varied most consistently with site quality. We also examined the ability of preliminary multimetric indices (MMIs) to distinguish site quality. Metrics varied meaningfully among both basins and ecoregions, but most metrics differed more among basins. The basin effect was especially strong for taxonomic metrics (e.g., number of species [TOTSP]), which reflected the influence of zoogeography on fish community composition. Few metrics differed strongly among both basins and ecoregions. Collectively, metrics distinguished among high, medium-, and low-quality sites within most regions, but the discriminative ability of individual metrics differed by region. The number of darter or sculpin species (DOSSP) was the only metric related to site quality both in most basins and most ecoregions. Metric differences among site-quality classes were more consistent with a priori expectations within basins than within ecoregions. In each of five regions, we built an MMI from the most discriminative metrics. Only DOSSP and the proportional abundance of tolerants were included in all five MMIs. All MMIs included taxonomic and reproductive (e.g., proportional abundance of simple lithophils, excluding tolerants) metrics, but not all included trophic metrics (e.g., proportional abundance of invertivores). Multimetric indices distinguished between high- and low-quality sites in each region tested, but they usually did not do so to a greater degree than did taxonomic metrics alone. Among the metrics included in MMIs, TOTSP was most consistently related to site quality. Our findings indicate that both basins and ecoregions provide useful frameworks for regionalizing biotic assessments based on fishes and that metric utility may vary considerably among regions even when regions are environmentally similar. To enhance MMI performance, we encourage an increased reliance on region-specific empirical relations in the development of metrics and scoring criteria.

AB  - The inclusion of biological and ecological aspects in the assessment of fish population status is one of the bases for an ecosystem-based fisheries management. During the past two decades the Eastern Baltic cod has experienced a drastic reduction in growth and body condition that may have affected its survival. We used results from published experimental literature linking cod condition to starvation and mortality, to estimate the annual proportion of cod close to the lethal condition level in the Eastern Baltic cod stock. Thereafter we applied these results to adjust the natural mortality (M) assumed in the analytical stock assessment model. The results in terms of Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB), Fishing mortality (F) and Recruitment (R) in the final year from the stock assessment using M values adjusted for low condition were up to 40% different compared with the assessment assuming a constant M = 0.2. This method could be used for adjusting natural mortalities for other cod stocks where changes in condition are observed.

AB  - This study investigated the relationships between fish condition and environmental variables in Barbus sclateri from semi-arid freshwater ecosystems in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. Two main habitats were studied: semi-arid streams characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations in flow level (droughts and floods) and reservoirs (artificial ecosystems characterised by waters of high conductivity). The mass-length relationships were used to test differences in fish condition between nine stream populations and five reservoir populations of B. sclateri from the Segura River basin. The relationships between seven ecosystem variables (conductivity, oxygen concentration, water temperature. pH, seasonal water flow, submerged vegetation and sub-basin location) and fish condition were analysed. The ecological variables that accounted for most of the variation in fish condition were seasonal water fluctuation and water conductivity. The condition of B. sclateri populations may be a good indicator of fish habitat quality in Mediterranean semi-arid freshwater ecosystems and should be considered when such populations are subjected to sports fishing regulations, recovery plans or any other management programme.

AB  - Freshwaters are among the most imperiled ecosystems on the planet such that much effort is expended on environmental monitoring to support the management of these systems. Many traditional monitoring efforts focus on abiotic characterization of water quantity or quality and/or indices of biotic integrity that focus on higher scale population or community level metrics such as abundance or diversity. However, these indicators may take time to manifest in degraded systems and delay the identification and restoration of these systems. Physiological indicators manifest rapidly and portend oncoming changes in populations that can hasten restoration and facilitate preventative medicine for degraded habitats. Therefore, assessing freshwater ecosystem integrity using physiological indicators of health is a promising tool to improve freshwater monitoring and restoration. Here, we discuss the value of using comparative, longitudinal physiological data collected at a broad spatial (i.e. watershed) scale (i.e. macrophysiology) as a tool for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health within and among local watersheds to develop timely and effective management plans. There are emerging tools and techniques available for rapid, cost-effective, and non-lethal physiological sampling and we discuss how these can be integrated into management using fish as sentinel indicators in freshwater. Although many examples of this approach are relatively recent, we foresee increasing use of macrophysiology in monitoring, and advocate for the development of more standard tools for consistent and reliable assessment.

AB  - Karst springs are considered among the most vulnerable groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Despite their ecological value and importance as strategic water sources. Mediterranean karst springs are still poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to analyse the epilithic diatom assemblages and to test their usefulness as indicators of enviroiunental quality on the Su Gologone spring (central-eastern Sardinia. Italy). a biotope of great natural value and a precious source of drinking water A total of 89 diatom taxa were found with 25 new records for Sardinian running waters. Species richness. Shannon-Wiener and Pielou indices showed good biotic integrity. The dominant taxa were alkalipliilous, halophobous-oligohalobous exigent, xeno-oligosaprobic and characteristic of oligotrophic waters. The eutrophication/pollution index diatom based (EPI-D) and the Navicula Nitzschia,S"urirella indices indicated respectively an excellent/good biological water quality and a low, physical disturbance. However, the biological and chemical oxygen demand, and the microbiological variables (E. coli fecal and total coliforms) revealed an organic contamination of the water, although moderate. The judgment provided by the EP1-D should be verified after updating of the index. In fact, 10 taxa found in this study are not currently considered by the EPI-D method.

AB  - Environmental pollutants might significantly affect the ecological integrity of coastal waters. Biological indicators like seaweeds have been used globally to assess water pollution. In the present work, the seaweed Ellisolandia elongata was used to evaluate the pollution status in coastal waters around Essaouira city. Three sites were chosen: One as reference station (S1) and two polluted ones (S2 and S3). Seaweed biodiversity, physiologic parameters of E. elongata, as well as, abiotic parameters were studied. Results showed that at the polluted stations, seaweed biodiversity was significantly lower than in S1. However, the concentrations of Total Suspended Solids, Electrical Conductivity, Biological Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Ammonium, and Orthophosphates at S2 were significantly higher than at S1. Metal content of E. elongata remained below detection limit at all stations except for Zn and Cu at S2 considered the most polluted station. With respect to the physiologic parameters, Proline, Glycine Betaine and Polyphenol contents at S2 were above, whereas, Chlorophyll a content and axis length were below those determined at the reference station. From the results it can be concluded that seaweed E. elongata could be a good indicator to determine organic pollution in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Urban tourist beach ecosystems provide the essential service of recreation. These ecosystems also support critical ecological functions where biodiversity conservation is not usually a priority. The sudden lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of human absence in these urban coastal ecosystems. This study examined bioindicators from 29 urban tourist beaches in seven Latin-American countries and assesses their response to lockdown about some relevant anthropogenic stressors such as pollution, noise, human activities, and user density. The presence of animals and plants, as well as the intensity of stressors, were assessed through a standardized protocol during lockdown conditions. Additionally, the environmental conditions of the beaches before and during lockdown were qualitatively compared using multivariate non-parametric statistics. We found notable positive changes in biological components and a clear decrease in human stressors on almost all the beaches. Dune vegetation increased on most sites. Similarly, high burrow densities of ghost crabs were observed on beaches, except those where cleaning activity persisted. Because of the lockdown, there was an exceptionally low frequency of beach users, which in turn reduced litter, noise and unnatural odors. The observed patterns suggest that tourist beaches can be restored to natural settings relatively quickly. We propose several indicators to measure changes in beaches once lockdown is relaxed. Adequate conservation strategies will render the recreational service of tourist beaches more environmental-friendly.

AB  - The selection of forest fragments for conservation is usually based on spatial parameters as forest size and canopy integrity. This strategy assumes that chosen fragments present high conservation status, ensuring biodiversity and ecological functions. We argue that a well-preserved forest fragment that remains connected by the landscape structure, does not necessarily hold attributes that ensure the presence of keystone species. We also discuss that the presence of keystone species does not always mean that it has the best conditions for its occurrence and maintenance. We developed a model to select areas in forest landscapes to be prioritized for protection based on suitability curves that unify and compare spatial indicators of three categories: forest fragment quality, landscape quality, and environmental conditions for the occurrence of a keystone species. We use a case study to compare different suitability degrees for Euterpe edulis presence, considered an important functional element in Atlantic Forest (So Paulo, Brazil) landscapes and a forest resource for local people. The results show that the identification of medium or advanced stage fragments as singular indicator of forest quality does not guarantee the existence or maintenance of this keystone species. Even in some well-preserved forest fragments, connected to others and with palm presence, the reverse J-shaped distribution of the population size structure is not sustained and these forests continue to be threatened due to human disturbances.

AB  - The EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) may be skewed by the wide tolerance to multiple stressors of the Baetid, Caenid and Hydropsychid families, which affects the performance of the EPT index as an indicator of multiple stressors in aquatic ecosystems. The effect of the BCH families on the EPT index was evaluated and alternatives were considered to improve its performance. The hypothesis that the removal of the BCH families improves sensitivity of the EPT index to human-induced stressors in streams and rivers was tested. Macroinvertebrates were collected in January-March 2009 at 22 sites in the Nyando and Nzoia Rivers, Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. Nine derivatives and modifications of the EPT index were tested for responses to a disturbance gradient, ranked into three condition categories (reference, intermediate and impaired). The sensitivity of the proportionate abundance derivative of the EPT index improved when the BCH families were removed, whereas that of the richness derivative improved marginally. Other modifications considered performed poorly when compared with the EPT-BCH metrics. Wide distribution of the BCH across all sites, irrespective of the level of disturbance, reduced the sensitivity of the EPT index in the studied streams. The removal of the BCH families enhanced the sensitivity of the index to multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams and rivers.

AB  - An integration of sediment physical, chemical, biological, and toxicity data is necessary for a meaningful interpretation of the complex sediment conditions in the marine environment. Assessment of benthic community is a vital component for that interpretation, yet their evaluation is complex and requires a large expenditure of time and funds. Thus, there is a need for new tools that are less expensive and more understandable for managers. This paper presents a benthic biotope index to predict from physical and chemical variables the occurrence of macrobenthic habitats. Parameters such as sediment type, organic matter, depth, and hydrodynamic parameters were selected, through a discriminant analysis, to compute the index. Other authors have used multivariate methods to determine the benthic biotopes for Sado Estuary. The index proved to be a valid tool to classify and assess the spatial patterns of benthic habitat and to synthesize stress biotope gradients. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The installation of dams causes changes to the integrity of rivers and to the water cycle, performing an instrumental role in the organization of biological communities, including that of phytoplankton. In the present study, we analyzed the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton in two hydroelectric reservoirs on the Sao Francisco River, Itaparica and Xingo reservoirs. Samples were collected at quarterly intervals between December 2007 and September 2009, at 12 sampling stations in each reservoir, totaling 92 samples. We identified 110 species in the Itaparica reservoir and 136 in the Xingo reservoir, of which diatoms followed by green algae, played a major contribution to both reservoirs. Most of the species is rare and/or occasional. In the Itaparica reservoir, there were no very frequent species, although in the Xingo this category was represented by the diatoms Aulacoseira granulata (Ehrenberg) Simonsen and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton. These results show that, despite the similarity in the composition of phytoplankton, the reservoirs studied certainly differed regarding their environmental conditions.

AB  - Researchers and industrials need decision-making tools to make informed decisions on environmental mitigation strategies and proceed with the overall ecodesign of processes. In this study, a tool that couples membrane filtration process modelling and life cycle analysis has been developed, for which material and energy flows are calculated for variable operating conditions and are the basis for environmental impact assessment. The resulting generic model has been applied to dead-end ultrafiltration of ground and surface waters for drinking water production with cellulose triacetate hollow fibers. Operating strategies have been investigated to mitigate environmental impacts of the two major hotspots (electricity and backwash cleaning chemical consumptions). Adjusting filtration cycle duration and filtration flux has shown to be a promising lever. The developed model is sufficiently flexible and modular for its adaptation to other membrane materials, filtration configurations (i.e. cross-flow) as well as to other applications.

AB  - Purpose
   In recent years, the mechanical industries began to apply many investments in research and technological development to obtain efficient methods to analyze the integrity of structures and prevent disasters and/or accidents, ensuring people's lives and preventing economic losses. Any structure, whether mechanical or aeronautical, before being put into use undergoes a structural integrity assessment and testing. In this case, non-destructive evaluations are performed, aiming to estimate the degree of safety and reliability of the structure. For this, there are techniques traditionally used such as ultrasonic inspection, X-ray, acoustic emission tests, among other techniques. The traditional techniques may even have a good instrumental apparatus and be well formulated for structural integrity assessment; however, these techniques cannot meet growing industrial needs, even more so when structures are in motion. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate artificial immune systems (AISs), ate and strengthen the emergence of an innovative technological tool, the biological immune systems and AISs, and these are presented as computing methods in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM).
   Design/methodology/approach
   The concept of SHM is based on a fault detection mechanism used in industries, and in other applications, involving the observation of a structure or a mechanical system. This observation occurs through the dynamic response of periodic measurements, later related to the statistical analysis, determining the integrity of the system. This study aims to develop a methodology that identifies and classifies a signal in normal signals or in faults, using an algorithm based on artificial immunological systems, being the negative selection algorithm, and later, this algorithm classifies the failures in probabilities of failure and degree of fault severity. The results demonstrate that the proposed SHM is efficient and robust for prognosis and failure detection.
   Findings
   The present study aims to develop different fast access methodologies for the prognosis and detection of failures, classifying and judging the types of failures based on AISs. The authors declare that the present study was neither published in any other vehicle of scientific information nor is under consideration for publication in another scientific journal, and that this paper strictly followed the ethical procedures of research and publication as requested.
   Originality/value
   This study is original by the fact that conventional structural integrity monitoring methods need improvements, which intelligent computing techniques can satisfy. Intelligent techniques are tools inspired by natural and/or biological processes and belong to the field of computational intelligence. They present good results in problems of pattern recognition and diagnosis and thus can be adapted to solve problems of monitoring and identifying structural failures in mechanical and aeronautical engineering. Thus, the proposal of this study demonstrates and strengthens the emergence of an innovative technological tool, the biological immune system and the AIS, and these are presented as computation methods in the field of SHM in rotating systems - a topic not yet addressed in the literature.

AB  - Riparian zones and their associated vegetation are important for the ecological integrity of lotic surface waters although they are often not surveyed in routine river ecological status assessments. Interest in riparian zones has increased in Europe due to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EU) which considers the conservation of river hydromorphological features in its assessments. This study describes a first screening of the ecological status of riparian zones in the rivers of mainland Greece using the Spanish "Riparian Forest Quality Index' (QBR) as a rapid riparian/ hydromorphological visual assessment tool. The cumulative results based on the assessment of 222 river riparian sites in 35 independent river basins show that 65% of the sites register below good or high status while only 10% are of high status, i.e. near natural condition. These results of riparian quality show a positive correlation with the independent assessment of the surface water ecological status of 212 water bodies associated with the surveyed sites. This is the first time the QBR index is employed to assess river riparian condition within such a broad area covering major river basins in all five freshwater ecoregions of mainland Greece. The QBR index shows that it can be an effective tool for rapidly identifying the general state of riverine riparian zones and is therefore useful when employed along-side in-stream protocols to complement assessment and monitoring applications.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors to lotic environments are diverse and often act in complex and synergistic ways through space and time. The need to adequately quantify and communicate these stressors in lotic environments is important for assessing stream health and informing management decisions. We used 21 physicochemical parameters from water quality samples and weighted each parameter by relationships with land use to develop a water quality index (WQI) across lotic environments in Pennsylvania. Four dominant land use categories were identified from water quality analysis: forested, urban, agriculture, and land disturbance. These categories were indexed (0-100) with low scores representing disturbed and high scores representing least-disturbed conditions for each land use category. We propose an interpretation and validation schema for establishing an overall measure of stress, while providing insight into both expected and unexpected sources of stress. The WQI was highly correlated with land use at a coarse scale, where scores decreased in response to non-forested landscapes. We then present two case studies that serve as examples of stressor quantification and communication. In addition to outperforming static measures of land use/cover, the resulting WQI serves multiple functions by communicating stream health to policy makers and citizens in an easily understood form, providing a stressor gradient for biological assessments and measuring stream condition across Pennsylvania's diverse water resources.

AB  - Biological quality in rivers based on benthic macroinvertebrates is typically assessed by comparison with ex-pected reference conditions, which represent relatively undisturbed situations. Commonly, reference conditions are set in agreement with river typologies to handle major ecological differences and limit biological variability. Although natural hydrological variation can be highly influential, site-specific tuning of reference conditions is rare in Mediterranean countries. River flow and local hydraulics change continuously over time, shaping the occurrence of lentic and lotic habitat features. Thus, biological reference conditions might require site-specific adjustment based on the ratio of lentic to lotic habitats assessed at the time of sampling. This would help reducing systematic bias in ecological assessments, interpreting benthic invertebrate responses to pressures, and diminishing the amount of unexplained biological variability. In this study, the response to the lentic-lotic character of river reaches was assessed for nineteen macroinvertebrate metrics and indices commonly used for the classification of ecological status in South European rivers. The study sites, with a prevalent temporary character, were located in Sardinia, southwestern Italy. Most metrics were significantly related to the lentic-lotic habitat conditions, both in pool and riffle mesohabitats, and their response curves were either parabolic or linearly decreasing at increasing lentic conditions. Taxonomic richness, score-based metrics, ovoviviparous taxa and multi-metric indices related well to the lentic-lotic conditions, while abundance metrics correlated less. The potential impact on ecological status classification was tested for the method formally used in Italy, which had a major role in comparing and inter-calibrating European assessment methods for the Water Framework Directive. After adjusting for bias due to the ratio of lentic to lotic habitat features, quality classification shifted towards better ecological status for approximate to 23% samples. This highlighted the impact of ignoring lentic-lotic information when defining reference conditions for assessing ecological status, varying from difficulties in understanding the biological response to pressures, to largely biased ecological status classification. The observed response of macroinvertebrate metrics to lentic-lotic conditions should be a key consideration for realistic ecological status assessment and could further be a valuable input for evaluating the effects of human-induced hydrological alteration and for assessing environmental flows.

AB  - Crosslinking is essential for maintaining the integrity of protein-based nanoparticles against environmental fluctuations. However, conventional crosslinkers (e.g. glutaraldehyde) are usually toxic and environmental unfriendly. In this study, a tyrosinase-aided crosslinking procedure was developed and compared to the conventional glutaraldehyde-based process. Sodium caseinate (SC) nanoparticles were synthesized by ionic gelation or desolvation under aqueous or alcoholic condition, respectively. The nanoparticles were stabilized by different crosslinkers and challenged under simulated environmental stress, including acidification and antisolvent removal. A simple procedure based on dynamic light scattering (DLS) was developed to evaluate the particle integrity, using the retention of particle size and count rate as indicators. Satisfying crosslinking was observed for the ionic gelation procedure in the presence of tyrosinase (10 U/mol SC) combined with two phenols (catechol or chlorogenic acid, 2.5 mol/mol SC). In comparison, a higher dose of glutaraldehyde (7.5 mol/mol SC) was required for achieving a comparable crosslinking effect. For the desolvation procedure, the efficacies for both glutaraldehyde and tyrosinase-phenol blends decreased, although they were still significant, and glutaraldehyde exhibited better crosslinking effect. The results from the DLS study were in consistence with those obtained from scanning electron microscopy. Overall, tyrosinase-aided oxidation is a competitive, low-toxicity approach for crosslinking protein-based nanostructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ecological literature on eastern forest-floor herbs and data collected in the southern Appalachians in Tennessee and North Carolina suggest five possible ecological mechanisms for reducing or limiting alpha diversity of vernal herbs in logged stands, three of which may also account for the slow recovery of some herbaceous species: (1) logging reduces populations of rarer herbs; (2) populations of forest-floor species are further reduced during the successional stages following logging, either by inability to adapt to changed microclimate or by competition with r-selected species that are better dispersers and better able to tolerate desiccation and increased radiation; (3) forest-floor herbs have slow growth and reproduction rates, thus population densities increase slowly; (4) many forest-floor herbs are clonal, ant-dispersed, or gravity-dispersed, thus they are slow to reoccupy suitable habitat once extirpated or greatly reduced in population numbers; and (5) logging results in less-than-optimal conditions for forest-floor herb reproduction by modifying microhabitats on the forest floor and by temporarily eliminating gap-phase succession. The data indicate some species of vernal herbs are far more tolerant of disturbance than others, and that sensitive species can be identified and utilized as indicators of community integrity and diversity.

AB  - Residual stresses are an important consideration in the structural integrity assessment of welded joints and reliable predictions of structural integrity therefore require that the residual stress distribution is adequately accounted for. However, distributions are dependent on the weld geometry and, in the absence of comprehensive information for welded joints, it is usually necessary to make conservative assumptions, This can result in unrealistic predictions, and consequently, further information on the nature and behaviour of residual stress distributions is required to enable the provision of improved guidance on this subject.
   The further development of the BS 7910 and R6 procedures for the assessment of residual stress effects was a principal task in the EC funded project named structural integrity assessment procedures for European industry, SINTAP, and an extensive investigation of this subject was performed. It entailed an extensive literature review of distributions in the principal weld geometries (including plate butt, pipe butt, pipe to plate, T-butt and tubular welded joints), experimental and numerical investigations and the development and validation of procedures.

AB  - Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests in the Rocky Mountains are an indicator of ecological conditions because they have maintained their presence for thousands of years through vegetative reproduction, and these communities have high biodiversity. Aspen can be tied to ecosystem condition through a 4-level trophic model that links humans, wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and aspen through the processes of predation, herbivory, burning, and differential wildlife responses to humans. We used a comparative study of research literature and historic photographs to evaluate aspen change over time in 6 Rocky Mountain national parks in Canada and the United States: Jasper, Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, Yellowstone, and Rocky Mountain. Across all parks, aspen has consistent responses to increased browsing by ungulates and decreased frequency of fire. Although aspen was historically vigorous in all parks, today most stands are in decline. Trees are intermediate to mature in age (60-120 years old), and elk browse off new suckers before they reach 2 m in height. Fire, combined with browsing, has hindered regeneration of aspen. The exception to this pattern is northern Jasper National Park where elk densities appear to have been reduced by wolves in the 1970s, and aspen regenerated. We found a gradient of increasing human-caused ecosystem changes in Rocky Mountain national parks: (1) historic conditions with frequent fires and low elk density regulated by humans, wolves, and other predators (i.e., all parks); (2) current conditions of patches of high elk density, where wolves are displaced by human land use, within a matrix of moderate elk density, where wolves and other predators are present (i.e., Banff and Jasper national parks); (3) recent conditions inside parks, where wolves are absent, and very high elk density is regulated by competition for food (i.e., Yellowstone before 1995); and (4) potential future conditions, where increasing human land use around parks displaces carnivores and reduces hunting, and very high elk density occurs throughout landscapes. Aspen stands regenerate well in areas of low elk density and in some areas of moderate elk density; however, in areas of high and very high elk density, aspen does not regenerate to heights >2 m, and burning accelerates clone deterioration. Our recommendations to national park managers are to restore carnivores, use fire in areas of low elk density, and control human uses that displace carnivores.

AB  - The ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems is regularly examined through assessment of their macroinvertebrate assemblages. The various methods used in such biomonitoring all have one characteristic in common the neglect of water mites. Even though this group perfectly fulfills all necessary requisites for successful bioindicators, these invertebrates are either completely ignored or lumped together as "Acari".
   This study, for the first time, uses water mites (Hydrachnidia) as bioindicators in the Neotropics to compare the anthropogenic stress in 15 streams at three different levels of contamination (pristine, rural, urban). In total, 4371 water mite specimens, belonging to 31 genera and 14 families, were collected.
   Diversity, abundance, and richness of water mite assemblages were significantly reduced with increasing levels of contamination. These differences were clearest in the dry season. Atractidella turned out to be, by far, the most tolerant water mite genus, having the greatest abundance at the most contaminated sites. In contrast, Pseudotorrenticola was found only in pristine waters, while Hydrodroma, Limnesia, Koenikea, Torrenticola, Monatractides and the family Aturidae showed clear preferences for pristine waters.
   Our data show, that water mites, identified to genus level, are well suited for water quality assessment in neotropical lowland streams, clearly distinguishing different levels of contamination/anthropogenic stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Expansion and intensification of human land uses has resulted in the loss of all but remnant areas of natural cover over increasingly vast areas of land. Effective stream assessment in these regions thus requires indicators sensitive to ecosystem change in systems that are already highly stressed. The goal of this study was to determine if benthic macroinvertebrate communities in streams exposed to extensive anthropogenic stress are associated with land-use variables and demonstrate potential to be used as bioindicators for assessment of further land use modification. Using the Grand River in southern Ontario as our model, we sampled for benthic macro invertebrates in 70 small (3-20 km(2)) sub-watersheds that comprised a gradient of intensive land use (65-100% developed). Redundancy analysis and variance partitioning results indicated that macroinvertebrate taxonomy and traits were only weakly associated with environmental gradients with the strongest associations occurring at the reach scale. With strong anthropogenic filters present across the watershed, it is likely that the majority of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Grand River have experienced a homogenization towards tolerant taxa and traits that respond more to local habitat variables. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) revealed 19 valid taxa indicators and 32 valid trait indicators for one or more of six environmental variables (percent sub-watershed agriculture, percent buffer agriculture, pool substrate, sediment reduction, natural channel, and riparian width). However, individual taxon and community change points exhibited broad quantile scores indicating a gradual or random response to environmental variables. Comparison of traits and taxonomic associations with environmental variables showed minimal difference suggesting traits may not offer increased sensitivity to land-use stress. However, several traits did show potential to serve as diagnostic indicators for specific stressors associated with agricultural land use. Our ability to identify even a few indicators in a region with intensive human activity is promising for land managers charged with detecting biotic alterations in this stressed system. Further research developing indicators sensitive to intensification of anthropogenic stress in extensively developed landscapes is critical to ensuring managers have the tools needed to protect and enhance aquatic resources.

AB  - An Environmental Assessment (EA) is one of the steps within the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Birds are often used in EA to help decision makers evaluate potential human impacts from proposed development activities. A "sensitivity to human disturbance" index, created by Parker III et al. (1996) for all Neotropical species, is commonly considered an ecological indicator. However, this parameter was created subjectively and, for most species, there have been no rigorous field test to validate its effectiveness as such. Therefore, in this study, we aim to: (1) evaluate if, at the local scale, birds from forest patches in a human-modified landscape (HML) may differ in sensitivity from Parker's sensitivity classification; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the species richness value at each sensitivity level as an ecological indicator; (3) gather information on how often and in which manner Parker's classification has been used in EA. To do so, bird sampling was performed in eight forest patches in a HML over one year. Then, we created a local sensitivity to disturbance using information about threat, endemism, spatial distribution and relative abundance of all species in the study area. We found that 37% of the forest birds showed different local sensitivity levels when compared with Parker's classification. Our results show that only the richness of high-sensitivity species from our local classification fitted the ecological indicator assumptions helping the environmental conditions evaluation of the studied patches. We conclude that species richness of each Parker's bird sensitivity levels do not necessarily perform as an ecological indicator at the local scale, and particularly in HML. Nevertheless, Parker's Neotropical bird sensitivity classification was used in 50% of EA we reviewed. In these, 76% assumed that it was an accurate ecological indicator of the local forest conditions for birds. The lack of clear criteria used in Parker's classification allows diverse interpretations by ornithologists, and there is no agreement about the ecological meaning of each sensitivity level and what environmental conditions each level may indicate of. Therefore, the use of Parker's classification in EA may jeopardize accurate interpretations of proposed anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, because a bird species' sensitivity often varies between locations, we argue that Parker's generalized classification of bird sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of forest environmental conditions in EA throughout HMLs in Neotropics. Rather, local bird ecological indices should be explored, otherwise, erroneous predictions of the anthropogenic impacts will continue to be common. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The protocols described here are designed to allow researchers to study cell communication without altering the integrity of the environment in which the cells are located. Specifically, they have been developed to analyze the electrical activity of excitable cells, such as spinal neurons. In such a scenario, it is crucial to preserve the integrity of the spinal cell, but it is also important to preserve the anatomy and physiological shape of the systems involved. Indeed, the comprehension of the manner in which the nervous system-and other complex systems-works must be based on a systemic approach. For this reason, the live zebrafish embryo was chosen as a model system, and the spinal neuron membrane voltage changes were evaluated without interfering with the physiological conditions of the embryos.
   Here, an approach combining the employment of zebrafish embryos with a FRET-based biosensor is described. Zebrafish embryos are characterized by a very simplified nervous system and are particularly suited for imaging applications thanks to their transparency, allowing for the employment of fluorescence-based voltage indicators at the plasma membrane during zebrafish development. The synergy between these two components makes it possible to analyze the electrical activity of the cells in intact living organisms, without perturbing the physiological state. Finally, this non-invasive approach can co-exist with other analyses (e.g., spontaneous movement recordings, as shown here).

AB  - While it is well known that the nature of the applied electric field and the heterogeneity of the tissue can influence the impact of PEF treatment on the plant tissues found in plant-based foods, few studies have investigated the influence of PEF on plant structures that are made up of multiple structurally similar organs. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF), at different electric field strengths (0, 0.3, 0.7 and 1.2 kV/cm) and specific energy (7, 21 and 52 kJ/kg), on a multilayered plant material, with bunching onion bulb tissues being used as a model system. The present study found that carbohydrates leakage was an appropriate index to assess PEF induced damage and that plasmolysis of epidermal cells was a good indicator of plasma membrane integrity after PEF. In addition, electric field strength had a greater impact on the cell integrity than specific energy applied. While other studies have shown that different cell types have different sensitivities to PEF, using plasmolysis as an indicator of cell damage, this study clearly showed that the same PEF treatment conditions had a greater effect on the epidermal cells of the outer scales compared to the inner scales. Hence, while different plant cell types vary in their sensitivities to PEF the spatial location of the same cell type within a complex plant material made up of multiple similar organs, i.e. an onion bulb, can also influence how cells respond to the PEF treatment. Despite PEF induced disruption at the cellular level being detected by carbohydrate leakage, the epidermal cell plasmolysis test and by cryo-scanning electromicroscopy (cryo-SEM), no gross structural changes at the organ level were observed using cryo-SEM or fluorescence microscopy. This study also reports for the first time that PEF treatment can enhance fructan leakage from onion bulbs, which means that PEF treatments have the potential to manipulate the fructan contents of some plant-based foods.

AB  - The suitability of a set of ecophysiological parameters, to be used as early warning indicator to detect signs of a worsening environment around geothermal power plants, was tested by comparison with the diversity of epiphytic lichens, a well-established indicator of geothermal air pollution. Samples of the lichen Evernia prunastri were transplanted around a geothermal power plant at Larderello (Tuscany, Italy) and at a control site, and integrity of cell membranes, concentration of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids, chlorophyll integrity and variations in pH of thalli were measured. The results showed that cell membrane damage, expressed by changes in electrical conductivity, could be used to detect early (exposure periods as short as I month) deleterious effects of geothermal air pollution.

AB  - We examined impacts of future climate scenarios on flow regimes and how predicted changes might affect river ecosystems. We examined two case studies: Cle Elum River, Washington, and Chattahoochee-Apalachicola River Basin, Georgia and Florida. These rivers had available downscaled global circulation model (GCM) data and allowed us to analyse the effects of future climate scenarios on rivers with (1) different hydrographs, (2) high future water demands, and (3) a river-floodplain system. We compared observed flow regimes to those predicted under future climate scenarios to describe the extent and type of changes predicted to occur. Daily stream flow under future climate scenarios was created by either statistically downscaling GCMs (Cle Elum) or creating a regression model between climatological parameters predicted from GCMs and stream flow (Chattahoochee-Apalachicola). Flow regimes were examined for changes from current conditions with respect to ecologically relevant features including the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flows. The Cie Elum's hydrograph under future climate scenarios showed a dramatic shift in the timing of peak flows and lower low flow of a longer duration. These changes could mean higher summer water temperatures, lower summer dissolved oxygen, and reduced survival of larval fishes. The Chattahoochee-Apalachicola basin is heavily impacted by dams and water withdrawals for human consumption; therefore, we made comparisons between pre-large dam conditions, current conditions, current conditions with future demand, and future climate scenarios with future demand to separate climate change effects and other anthropogenic impacts. Dam construction, future climate, and future demand decreased the flow variability of the river. In addition, minimum flows were lower under future climate scenarios. These changes could decrease the connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent. Our study illustrates the types of changes that river ecosystems might experience under future climates. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The ventilation method used in the management of laboratory rats is important in maintaining their health. Rats kept under general diluting ventilation (GDV) are exposed to high levels of pollutants present in the environment (dust, airborne bacteria, etc.) or those pollutants produced by animal metabolism and excretion inside the boxes (e.g. ammonia and carbon dioxide). These pollutants may contribute to respiratory pathologies. An alternative experimental ventilation system for laboratory animal housing using intracage ventilation technology (individually ventilated cage system, IVC) was developed. In this system, ammonia levels decreased and rats exhibited better reproductive performance and a lower incidence of pneumonia than rats maintained under GDV. Using two different levels of air speed (0.03-0.26 m/s: IVC1; 0.27-0.80 m/s: IVC2), the effects of IVC were compared with GDV (control) in Wistar rats in terms of respiratory mucus properties, on the nasal epithelium (as measured by quantitative morphometry) and on the lungs (as determined by the cellular composition obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage). Mucus of the respiratory system was evaluated using the following techniques: rheology (viscoelasticity) by microrheometer, in vitro mucociliary transportability (frog palate) and contact angle (an indicator of adhesivity). Also, membrane transepithelial potential difference was measured as a biomarker of airway integrity. After bedding was changed, ammonia concentrations inside the cages on day 3 were significantly higher for GDV than for IVC1 and IVC2. The potential-difference values for IVC1, IVC2 and GDV in the epiglottis and in the trachea also showed differences. Although some significant differences were observed across the three groups in counts of some cell types, the intragroup results were highly variable among individuals and inconsistent between sexes. No significant differences in the other parameters were found across groups. These results establish that rats maintained under GDV in relatively unregulated conditions are exposed to factors that can lead to deleterious effects on the ciliated epithelium of the airways, and that these effects can be prevented by the use of IVC.

AB  - Mapping trawling pressure on the benthic habitats is needed as background to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The extent and intensity of bottom trawling on the European continental shelf (0-1000 m) was analysed from logbook statistics and vessel monitoring system data for 2010-2012 at a grid cell resolution of 1 x 1 min longitude and latitude. Trawling intensity profiles with seabed impact at the surface and subsurface level are presented for 14 management areas in the North-east Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The footprint of the management areas ranged between 53-99% and 6-94% for the depth zone from 0 to 200 m (Shallow) and from 201 to 1000 m (Deep), respectively. The footprint was estimated as the total area of all grid cells that were trawled fully or partially. Excluding the untrawled proportions reduced the footprint estimates to 28-85% and 2-77%. Largest footprints per unit landings were observed off Portugal and in the Mediterranean Sea. Mean trawling intensity ranged between 0.5 and 8.5 times per year, but was less in the Deep zone with a maximum intensity of 6.4. Highest intensities were recorded in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, Iberian Portuguese area, Tyrrhenian Sea and Adriatic Sea. Bottom trawling was highly aggregated. For the Shallow zone the seabed area where 90% of the effort occurred comprised between 17% and 63% (median 36%) of the management area. Footprints were high over a broad range of soft sediment habitats. Using the longevity distribution of the untrawled infaunal community, the seabed integrity was estimated as the proportion of the biomass of benthic taxa where the trawling interval at the subsurface level exceeds their life span. Seabed integrity was low (< 0.1) in large parts of the European continental shelfs, although smaller pockets of seabed with higher integrity values occur. The methods developed here integrate official fishing effort statistics and industry-based gear information to provide high-resolution pressure maps and indicators, which greatly improve the basis for assessing and managing benthic pressure from bottom trawling. Further they provide quantitative estimates of trawling impact on a continuous scale by which managers can steer.

AB  - Favorable characteristics for development of agricultural activities were crucial factors in the fast substitution of the physiognomy of the Cerrado by agricultural crops and pastures. During this occupation process. the remaining natural vegetation became extremely fragmented and a little is known about the structural and functional integrity even about the species diversity of these ecosystems. The use of vegetation indices as indicators of the forest integrity has been shown to be a useful tool for environmental planning and also for conservation strategies. in this study, we analyzed the correlations between floristic diversity of 22 forests fragments, from diversity indices of Shannon and the equability of Pielou: and the structural parameters of communities represented by basal area and cylindrical volume. Correlations between the diversity and patch metric: AREA, PERIM, GYRATE, PARA, SHAPE. FRAC, CIRCLE. CONTIG, CORE, CAI. PROX and ENN obtained for fragments and among the indices NDVI, SAVI, EVI, MV15 and MV17 derived from TM/Landsat images acquired in two seasons Were also evaluated. The index which presented strongest correlation with floristic diversity was EVI and the one that showed strongest correlation with the equability was MV15. The structural parameters basal area and cylindrical volume did not present correlations with diversity and equability. The diversity and equability indices showed correlations with the fragment shape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Headwater streams play an essential role in catchment ecosystem processes and are particularly vulnerable to land use degradation and anthropic hydrological alterations. Considering that fish assemblages are reliable indicators of the ecological integrity of streams, we evaluated the ichthyofauna structure in four headwater Pampean streams located at catchment areas with contrasting land uses and hydrological man-made alterations. During autumn and spring of 2017 and 2018, fish assemblages were sampled and physicochemical and water table depth were measured. Specific richness, abundance, and diversity of fish assemblages were estimated. The degree of anthropic intervention of drainage networks and wetland coverage was estimated for each catchment. Statistical analyses assessed the differences between rural and periurban sampling sites in terms of environmental variables and fish assemblage structure, as well as the relationships between the biotic and abiotic variables. Results showed differences among headwater streams according to their land uses, hydrological alterations, and fish assemblage structure, evidencing a combined effect of land use and hydrologic alterations on fish assemblage. Changes in these communities can reflect not only alterations in water quality caused by local land use but also the influence of the catchment environmental integrity related to hydrological modifications and other phenomena that can occur simultaneously and at different geographical scales.

AB  - The reactive behavior of a mixed fluid (supercritical CO2 and brine) under physical-chemical conditions relevant to geologic storage and sequestration in a carbon repository is largely unknown. Experiments were conducted in a flexible cell hydrothermal apparatus to evaluate fluid-rock (aquifer plus aquitard) reactions that may adversely impact the integrity of the repository. A 5.5 molal NaCl brine-rock system was held at 200 degrees C and 200 bars (20 MPa) for 32 days (772 h) to approach steady state, then injected with CO2 and allowed to react for an additional 45 days (1079 h). In a separate experiment at 200 degrees C and 200 bars, the system was allowed to react for 77 days (1845 h) without injection of CO2. Corroded magnesite and euhedral siderite crystallized in a paragenetic sequence after CO2 injection. Nucleation and growth of siderite on shale suggests the aquitard is a reactive component in the system. Changes in elemental abundances in the brine following addition of CO2 include pH decrease and depletion of sodium due to accelerated growth of analcime. A pH increase follows pressure and temperature decrease and loss of saturated CO2 from acidic brine. Silica concentrations and dissolution rates are enhanced and silica precipitation inhibited in the acidic brine.
   Geochemical reactions in a carbon repository extend beyond pH decrease and carbonate mineral precipitation. Rock-dominated reaction systems yield to acid-dominated and related reactions controlled by mixed fluid equilibria (i.e., a fluid-dominated system). Escape of CO2 or migration of brine from the repository into overlying aquifers may cause silica super-saturation and increased alkalinity due to mixed fluid phase equilibria. These geochemical changes could be monitored in aquifers as indicators of repository integrity. Return of silica super-saturated brine to a rock-dominated reaction system buffered to neutral pH conditions may enhance precipitation of quartz, chalcedony, or amorphous silica. In addition to the potential effects (beneficial or deleterious) that silica super-saturation and precipitation may hold for repository performance, an understanding of the effects of multi-phase equilibrium relationships between supercritical CO2 and dissolved silica in aquifer-brine systems also raises new questions for a variety of geologic systems. Multi-phase fluid equilibria may, for example, account for quartz cements in some sedimentary basin sandstones and quartz vein mineralization in some ore districts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coral reefs are highly valued ecosystems currently threatened by both local and global stressors. Given the importance of coral reef ecosystems, a Bayesian network approach can benefit an evaluation of threats to reef condition. To this end, we used data to evaluate the overlap between local stressors (overfishing and destructive fishing, watershed-based pollution, marine-based pollution, and coastal development threats), global stressors (acidification and thermal stress), and management effectiveness with indicators of coral reef health (live coral index, live coral cover, population bleaching, colony bleaching, and recently killed corals). Each of the coral health indicators had Bayesian networks constructed globally and for Pacific, Atlantic, Australia, Middle East, Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia coral reef locations. Sensitivity analysis helped evaluate the strength of the relationships between different stressors and reef condition indicators. The relationships between indicators and stressors were also evaluated with conditional analyses of linear and nonlinear interactions. In this process, a standardized direct effects analysis was emphasized with a target mean analysis to predict changes in the mean value of the reef indicator from individual changes to the distribution of the predictor variables. The standardized direct effects analysis identified higher risks in the Middle East for watershed-based pollution with population bleaching and in Australia for overfishing and destructive fishing with living coral. For thermal stress, colony bleaching and recently killed coral in the Indian Ocean were found to have the strongest direct associations along with living coral in the Middle East. For acidification threat, Australia had a relatively strong association with colony bleaching, and the Middle East had the strongest overall association with recently killed coral, although extrapolated spatial data were used for the acidification estimates. The Bayesian network approach helped to explore the relationships among existing databases used for policy development in coral reef management by examining the sensitivity of multiple indicators of reef condition to spatially distributed stress.

AB  - This paper focuses on the environmental flow assessment (EFA) methods that maintain the river ecosystem and its integrity for hydropower plants (HPP) with their implementations on a run-off river type HPP. EFA is a crucial phenomenon in terms of electricity production and sustaining river integrity simultaneously. The novelty of this study is that it consists both a comparison of widely used preferred EFA methods and a detailed investigation of the river with pre and post-dam flow regimes. The research shows that by expanding the content and scope of the methods, their relative reliabilities increase. However, this situation requires much more expert, money, and time. Apart from most of the relevant literature, pre and post-dam situations are investigated with a flow duration curve (FDC). It is concluded that the dramatic difference between the flow characteristics of pre and post-dam situations affects long-term aquatic life. Furthermore, a case study is conducted using the selected hydrological flow assessment methods, Tennant and Tessman methods, and comparisons are made. The calculated flows are compared with monthly average flow values before dam construction, projected environmental flow data, and the current situation. Accordingly, Tennant's good classification is proposed to determine the environmental flow (EF) for the considered case study.

AB  - The implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, especially regarding the establishment of fish indexes for riverine habitats, has taken different paths in different countries. For example, in Italy previous efforts have been directed towards a taxonomy-based index, contrarily to most other European countries where an ecofunctional approach took place. Taxonomical indexes are particularly hard to apply to Mediterranean countries, where fish taxonomy is often revised causing problems in practical implementation. Alternatively, ecofunctional characteristics of fish communities could be exploited to inform on river habitat quality and to detect anthropogenic impacts, thus reducing the index sensitivity to the taxonomical variability of the fish fauna. We therefore proposed a new, multimetric index based on ecofunctional traits of fish species (EFFI, EcoFunctional Fish Index) and tested it on 208 river sampling stations of the Emilia-Romagna region, northern Italy. Using theoretical reference communities, ecological quality ratios were estimated for the whole area expressing the ecological distance of each site from reference conditions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this work underlined how fish communities were more degraded at lower altitudes than at higher ones. EFFI scores were 'remarkably close to two already-established indexes for chemical (LIM) and macrozoobenthos communities (ME) alteration. Further work should explore the validity of this approach over a wider geographical range as well as investigate the definition of environmental class boundaries and its potential intercalibration with other indexes.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) recommends the development of biotic indices for assessing the ecological quality status of water bodies. The Benthic Index based on Taxonomic Sufficiency (BITS) was specifically developed for lagoonal systems, according to the tolerant/opportunistic approach. Macrobenthic data, variables indicative of eutrophication and variables indicative of sedimentary organic matter quality were collected during 18 surveys carried out between 2004 and 2005 in three Adriatic coastal lagoons (Venice Lagoon, Sacca di Goro, Lesina Lagoon). The relationship between environmental variables and biotic indices (AMBI, BENTIX, BITS, BOPA and FINE) was tested using multivariate analyses. Indices based on species classification level appeared to relate better with the variables describing organic matter quality, whereas BITS, which is based on family classification level, seemed related to eutrophication indicative variables, such as sulphide, ammonium, dissolved oxygen and orthophosphate concentrations. The BITS approach reduces the costs associated with sorting and identification of organisms. Providing a rapid assessment of ecological quality, and producing an ecologically relevant classification, BITS seems a promising tool for monitoring programs of Adriatic lagoonal ecosystems. Its sensitivity in reflecting the field conditions elsewhere, however, remains to be assessed.

AB  - A new benthic freshwater diatom, Cymbella tridentina sp. nov., was identified with the aid of light and scanning electron micrographs. The most characteristic morphological features are the valve outline (in particular, the shape of the ventral margin), the number of stigmata, and the length/breadth ratio. The new species was epilithic in carbonate, mountain, flowing springs in 3 Natural Parks of the Alps. The environmental preferences of the new species, assessed by the comparative analysis of the sites where it was found and by seasonal and longitudinal-distribution data available for the type locality, are quite distinctive. The new species appears to be rheophilic and oligotraphentic (not present in N-enriched sites), characteristic of dolomite mountain ranges (even if dolomite is not the dominating carbonate rock in the basin), and to develop year-round with low relative abundances (peaks associated with high discharge in autumn and spring). The combination of these ecological requirements might determine the preferential occurrence of C. tridentina sp. nov. in close-to-pristine, carbonate, mountain, flowing springs. The preference of the new species for the spring zone of running waters, and its possible use as an integrity indicator, is discussed in the wider context of crenobiosis. The importance of oligotrophic headwaters for the integrity of running-water systems and for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity, is highlighted.

AB  - The importance of maintaining healthy riparian communities to sustain natural stream processes and function is well documented. Land management agencies in the West are currently developing methods to assess and monitor riparian community condition to adapt land use practices that would better protect rangeland ecosystems. To determine whether these methods also provide an indication of abiotic and biotic stream condition, we compared the classification system of riparian communities developed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to physical parameters of stream condition and to aquatic invertebrate community assemblages. Thirty-three sites in 19 different streams of the Toiyabe Range in central Nevada were measured for water quality substrate characteristics, and fish abundance and diversity, We sampled aquatic invertebrates and calculated community indices based on environmental tolerance levels. taxonomic diversity; and abundance of sensitive taxa. USFS personnel classified these sites by dominant riparian plant community type (meadow, willow, or aspen) and ecological status (low, moderate, or high) using plant abundance data, rooting depth, and soil infiltration to determine similarities to potential natural communities.
   Riparian condition indices as well as community diversity were significantly correlated to proportions of fine and small-diameter substrate in streambeds. Accumulation of silt was significantly related to plant community type, with meadow sites expressing highest proportions. Further examinations indicated that 2 of 6 invertebrate community indices were significantly related to ecological status, with highest diversity levels occurring mainly in willow- and aspen-dominated sites in moderate ecological condition. Nevertheless, we show that several other environmental variables, including substrate characteristics, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and species richness of fish communities, were more strongly and consistently related to invertebrate assemblage patterns. Our results demonstrate that information on aquatic invertebrates and stream condition could augment the existing riparian classification system and provide useful monitoring tools to more thoroughly examine ecosystem health in rangelands.

AB  - The floristic quality index is a widely used method for ecological condition assessments in the United States. The foundation of the index is the conservatism concept, which estimates a species' ecological sensitivity or propensity to occur in areas least altered by humans. Plant species are assigned coefficients of conservatism (CoC) where ruderal and exotic species receive the lowest scores, competitors and matrix species intermediate scores, and remnant-dependent species the highest scores. The method has spread to over half of the United States, but New York and New England still lack CoC coverage. With funding from the Environmental Protection Agency and using nine of the region's most experienced botanists, an effort was undertaken to select CoC for the complete vascular flora of each New England state and New York State. Frequency distributions and rank correlations of CoC varied widely among states, except that each flora contained a large proportion of exotic species. Few taxa were scored with low confidence, although CoC at the extreme ends of the scale tended to be scored with higher confidence than more intermediate CoC. Differences in mean CoC and other summary measures for two botanists working independently on the same state indicate estimator bias in the ranking process, and calls for additional expert opinions, more careful instruction, and calibration of botanists, or the use of objective scoring methods.

AB  - We investigated outcomes of three monitoring networks for assessing ecological character and condition of wadeable streams, Waikato region, New Zealand. Site selection was based on professional judgment, stratification within categories of watershed characteristics, or on using an unequal-probability survey design. The professional-judgment network, stratified network and all site analyses included more >= 4th-order streams than for the probability-network survey-design estimates Professional-judgment and stratified network sites and survey-design analyses incorporated higher-quality catchments with coarser substrates. Cumulative frequency distributions indicated that the stratified and/or judgmental networks yielded fewer taxa than did the probability network, and that the stratified network provided lower estimates of the macroinvertebrate community index (MCI). Compared with the probability-network survey-design analysis, the stratified network site analysis underestimated percentage stream length classed as 'Excellent' by the quantitative MCI, and the professional-judgment site and survey-design analyses overestimated the percentage classed 'Fair' by the average score per metric. We conclude that deriving reliable estimates of wadeable stream character and condition requires (1) clearly defining and quantifying the target population for which inferences will be drawn, (2) accounting for probability of site selection and (3) optimising spatial representation across dominant stressor gradients.

AB  - We investigated the effects of cryopreservation on the quality of Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata) sperm, which were examined before and after freezing; sperm motility, fertilizing capacity, and ultrastructural morphology were analyzed. The motility percentage and fertilizing capacity of the cryopreserved sperm (mean +/- standard error) were 16% +/- 1% and 17% +/- 8%, respectively. In the pre-freezing sperm, these were 58% +/- 2% and 76% +/- 4%, respectively. The sperm sustained substantial morphological and ultrastructural damage during cryopreservation. The morphological changes varied considerably in nature and extent, ranging from no apparent damage to virtual disintegration. Sperm were stained with fluorescent dyes to assess viability, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, acrosomal membrane integrity, oxidation level, and DNA fragmentation and examined through flow cytometry. The methods used for the flow cytometry assays were slightly modified from those used for evaluating the semen quality of livestock. Relative to the pre-freezing sperm, the frozen-thawed sperm exhibited lower acrosomal membrane integrity (acrosomal damage, 59.86 +/- 5.29; P < 0.05) and substantially higher oxidation levels (free radicals, 60.06 +/- 0.82; P < 0.003). Oxidation level was found to be the most sensitive indicator of cryodamage. Along with ultrastructural analysis, we used flow cytometry to measure the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of Portuguese oyster sperm before and after cryopreservation rapidly, objectively, and accurately. This is the first study to assess the quality of Portuguese oyster sperm through these methods.

AB  - Aim: Epiphytic lichens are biological indicators, which can give information about the environmental changes of the ecosystem. The differences in richness and community compositions of lichens can indicate the environmental quality of their location. This study was done in order to examine the possible differences in richness and in community composition of lichens that may have occurred in the research area, Kursunlu Waterfall Nature Park and surroundings.
   Methodology: Kursunlu Waterfall Nature Park and surroundings was divided into 4 sections; natural area near brook, natural pine forest area, planted pine forest area and agricultural greenhouses area. The study was planned to focus on epiphytic lichens living on Pinus brutia Ten. trees. European Guideline, which is a standardized method to assess lichen diversity (LDV) on tree bark for monitoring environmental stress, was used for monitoring quality of four different environmental conditions with lichens. In order to determine the differences of lichen community composition of these four conditions, some statistical analyses were performed.
   Results: Lichen richness of planted pine forest area was found poorer and statistically different than the other areas . In addition, the lichen community composition of natural pine forest area was found significantly different than the agricultural greenhouse area and the natural area near brook, partly different than the planted pine forest area. Statistical evaluations indicate that the natural pine forest area had natural or semi-natural habitat characteristics and there was no or less eutrophication in this region. Also it showed that other areas were affected by the presence of human damage and eutrophic pollution load in the environment. This eutrophic pollution load was related to non-ecological agriculture applications around the park.
   Interpretation: This study proves that epiphytic lichens change their community composition by adapting to changes in environmental conditions. Also this study showed that lichens are strong indicators of environmental quality.

AB  - Reference site networks should consist of minimally disturbed sites that collectively characterize the ranges of natural settings within a region. Compromise between reference-quality and representativeness is required. We evaluated how tradeoffs between reference-quality and regional representativeness affected applicability, performance, and interpretation of multi-metric (MMI) and Observed/Expected (O/E) indices developed for streams in eastern China. We emphasized reference-quality by applying the most-stringent objective criteria and expert-judgment to select reference-group1 (G1). We emphasized representativeness by applying the least-stringent criteria to select reference-group2 (G2) sites from different strata based on watershed size. We balanced reference-quality and representativeness in G3 by applying intermediate stringent criteria from each watershed size stratum used previously. Increasing representativeness using G2 improved index applicability to almost more than twice the number of test sites than when reference-quality maximized using G1. Bias in O/E index was almost eliminated only when reference-quality and representativeness balanced using G3. MMIs developed when reference-quality maximized using G1 eliminated all bias and had the highest precision. High-quality reference with limited representativeness affected the metrics selected for inclusion in MMIs and restricted the sites to which both types of indices could be applied. A balanced approach worked best in this instance and similar approaches should be tested in other regions.

AB  - This article presents the rationale for the need to take into account and assess natural capital as an important factor for viable managerial decision-making concerning the study, use and reproduction of natural resources in the interests of sustainable development. The activity of authorities in Tomsk oblast was used as an example in examining the issues related to integration of accounting and assessing natural capital and ecosystem services in the system of managerial decision-making. We used strategic and normative documents of Tomsk oblast, departmental information and material from previous research into assessments of natural capital. A rationale is given for the need to improve the institutional conditions for proper inventory and assessment of all functions of natural capital and ecosystems in managerial decision-making, namely the development of the monitoring system for economic value in the sphere of environmental management which is based on the system of ecological-economic accounting and constitutes a set of coherent statistical indicators reflecting the status of natural capital. The mechanism is suggested for generation of the information-methodological base of economic assessment of natural capital. It is determined that a qualitatively new information basis integrated into the system of regional management. Qualitatively new information basis integrated into the regional government system will make it possible not to simply obtain information on the flows of expenditures and benefits in the sphere of environmental management but also to ensure interaction between state and municipal authorities and with organizations and the population. The monitoring system for economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services integrated into the region's executive bodies will permit adaptive governance of environmental management of the region in the face of changes and uncertainty.

AB  - In northeast Corrientes Province, there are more than 50,000 semi-rounded shallow rain-fed lakes. Several lakes have been disturbed mainly because urbanization causes eutrophication due to the illegal discharge of wastewater. We compared 22 metrics based on the structural attributes of macro-invertebrates associated with Egeria najas across seasons between five lakes with different human disturbance levels. Sixty-six samples of E. najas and associated invertebrates were collected seasonally using a net with an area of 962cm(2). A total of 17,737 macro-invertebrates of eight major groups, 35 families and 30 genera were recorded. The total macro-invertebrate abundance (number of individuals per plant dry weigh) and the family richness were significantly higher in less disturbed lakes than those under human disturbance, but the differences between seasons were not significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis differentiated the macro-invertebrate abundances between the more and less disturbed lakes; instead, the diversity indices were not useful for measuring the changes in the studied lakes. Besides, total number of taxa, number of EOT (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Trichoptera) taxa, abundance and proportion of Trichoptera and abundance of Chironomidae reflected significant differences between the more and less disturbed lakes. Our results suggest that seven invertebrate metrics respond to urbanization, and they could be used to assess biological integrity of the studied lakes in complement of chemical monitoring of water quality. Management efforts should focus on the maintenance of macrophyte stands that provide high invertebrate diversity, which serve as food for a wide variety of fish.

AB  - Risk assessors and risk managers generally either examine ecological health (using bioindicators) or human health (using biomarkers of exposure or effect). In this paper we suggest that it is possible and advantageous to develop bioindicators that can be used to assess exposure and effect for both human and non-human receptors. We describe the characteristics of suitable bioindicators for both human and ecological health, using mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) as examples, and list the general characteristics of other species that would make them useful indicators for assessing both human and ecological health. Bioindicators can be used cross-sectionally to assess the status of ecosystems and risk as well as longitudinally for monitoring changes or evaluating remediation. For both human and ecological risk assessment, there are three sets of characteristics to consider when selecting bioindicators: biological relevance, methodological relevance, and societal relevance. An indicator which fails to fulfill these is not likely to be considered cost-effective and is likely to be abandoned. The indicator should be readily measured and must measure an important range of impacts. For long-term support of a bioindicator, the indicator should be easily understood, and be cost effective. We suggest that bioindicators that can also be used for both ecological and human health risk assessment are optimal.

AB  - The use of veterinary medical products and herbicides is a common practice in intensified livestock systems. These compounds affect nontarget organisms that perform important ecosystem functions, such as dung beetles. The assessment of body condition allows us to determine how individuals respond to changes in the environment. However, assessments of how contamination associated with cattle farming affects coprophagous insects such as dung beetles have not been conducted in natural systems. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of ivermectin (an antiparasitic drug) and herbicides on the body condition of 3 species of dung beetles collected in the field: Copris incertus, Euoniticellus intermedius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. We recorded 3 condition indicators (body size, lipid mass, and muscle mass) of beetles collected from 19 livestock ranches in northeastern Mexico. In general, the use of ivermectin had adverse effects on C. incertus and E. intermedius whereas the effects were positive for D. gazella. Conversely, the use of herbicides had adverse effects on D. gazella and positive effects on C. incertus. The different effects of ivermectin and herbicides found in males and females show that sex can be important in determining individual responses to environmental contamination. Importantly, we provide the first evidence under natural conditions that native and exotic species of dung beetles are highly sensitive to different types of livestock management, with veterinary medications and herbicides having the ability to alter body condition. Changes in dung beetle condition can reduce the ecosystem services that dung beetles provide in livestock systems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-13. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB  - 1. Fish and invertebrate assemblage data collected from 670 stream sites in Minnesota (U.S.A.) were used to calculate concordance across three nested spatial scales (statewide, ecoregion and catchment). Predictive taxa richness models, calibrated using the same data, were used to evaluate whether concordant communities exhibited similar trends in human-induced taxa loss across all three scales. Finally, we evaluated the strength of the relationship between selected environmental variables and the composition of both assemblages at all three spatial scales.
   2. Significant concordance between fish and invertebrate communities occurred at the statewide scale as well as in six of seven ecoregions and 17 of the 21 major catchments. However, concordance was not consistently indicative of significant relationships between rates of fish and invertebrate taxa loss at those same scales.
   3. Fish and invertebrate communities were largely associated with different environmental variables, although the composition of both communities was strongly correlated with stream size across all three scales.
   4. Predictive taxa-loss models for fish assemblages were less sensitive and precise than models for invertebrate assemblages, likely because of the relatively low number of common fish taxa in our data set. Both models, however, distinguished reference from non-reference sites.
   5. The importance of concordance, geographic context and scale are discussed in relation to the design and interpretation of stream integrity indicators. In particular, our findings suggest that community concordance should not be viewed as a substitute for an evaluation of how assemblages respond to environmental stressors.

AB  - The main aim of the present review is to synthesise the present level of knowledge on the hydrobiology of springs in the Alps. Springs are usually small, but complex and taxa rich. They have a mosaic structure, a high degree of individuality and an azonal character, due to the peculiar physicochemical stability. Springs are ecotones linking an aquifer to the uppermost section of a surface running water system. Due to adaptations, of which stenothermy is the most frequent, representatives of many groups of plants and animals have in springs their exclusive (crenobionts) or favourite (crenophiles) habitat. This leads to a peculiar longitudinal distribution of organisms. In spite of this complexity, springs (in particular high elevation springs of the Alps) have received much less attention than other types of inland waters. They are endangered habitats, being menaced by a series of direct impacts (primarily water abstractions) and indirect impacts. The classical Steinmann-Thienemann ecomorphological types are still used with differences in the physical and chemical characteristics and in the biota. In the Alps rheocrene springs (where current velocity is one of the most relevant factors and the importance of the fringing semi-aquatic habitats is reduced) are the most frequent. However, in nature, most springs are transition types among the three traditional ones and these can now be assessed thanks to procedures considering mainly the substrate particle size. The physicochemistry of springs is characterised by limited seasonal fluctuations and determined by the characteristics of the aquifer and by indirect (especially airborne contaminants) and direct impacts. Many groups of organisms are well represented and include indicators of the trophic and acid-base status, of hydrogeology, hydrological stability and biological integrity. The groups with the highest proportions of specialised taxa are mosses, water mites, dipterans, hydrobioid snails and caddisflies. Attempts are being made to add to the traditional spring types hydrochemistry and vegetation and to the regional faunistic types, diatom-based types, to combine different approaches and to consider also functional ones, such as the distinction between POM and mosses' springs. Given the high proportion of spring-specific taxa, we propose to use the zoobenthos, especially water mites, for an evaluation of the biological integrity of springs, whilst autotrophs, and in particular diatoms, which are the most widespread and taxa-rich group, can provide excellent indicators of eutrophication, acidification and ionic strength. This would require the calibration of the most promising diatom-based procedures to the spring environment and improvement of the knowledge on the taxonomy and distribution of key zoobenthos groups in the Alps. Other areas where further research is required are the definition of integrated spring-types, the potential for recovery of autotrophs in restored springs, functional aspects, the applicability of paleolimnological techniques to springs and the link between impacts on the drainage basin and spring environmental quality. Only once the importance of springs can be understood and effective conservation measures are undertaken, will it be possible to use these peculiar environments characterised by stability and by integration in time and space of direct and indirect impacts as ideal study sites for long-term ecological research.

AB  - Wetlands are commonly assessed for ecological condition and biological integrity using a three-tiered framework of landscape-scale assessment, rapid assessment protocols, and intensive biological and physiochemical measurements. However, increased inundation resulting from accelerated sea level rise (SLR) is negatively impacting tidal marsh ecosystem functions for US Northeast coastal wetlands, yet relative vulnerability to this stressor is not incorporated in condition assessments. This article assesses tools available to measure coastal wetland vulnerability to SLR, including measurements made as part of traditional rapid condition assessments (e.g., vegetation communities, soil strength), field and remote sensing-based measurements of elevation, VDatum, and Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) model outputs. A vulnerability metric that incorporates these tools was calibrated and validated using recent rates of marsh vegetation losses (1972-2011) as a surrogate for future vulnerability. The metric includes complementary measures of elevation capital, including the percentage of high vs. low marsh vegetation, Spartina alterniflora height, elevation measurements, and SLAMM outputs that collectively explained 62% of the variability in recent rates of marsh vegetation loss. Stepwise regression revealed that all three elements (elevation, vegetation measures, and SLAMM outputs) explained significant and largely unique components of vulnerability to SLR, with the greatest level of overlap found between SLAMM outputs and elevation metrics. While soil strength varied predictably with habitat zone, it did not contribute significantly to the vulnerability metric. Despite the importance of determining wetland elevation above key tidal datums of mean sea level and mean high water, we caution that VDatum was found to perform poorly in back-barrier estuaries. This factor makes it difficult to compare elevation capital among marshes that differ in tidal range and poses accuracy problems for broad-scale modeling efforts that require accurate tidal datums. Given the pervasive pattern of coastal wetland drowning occurring in the Northeastern USA and elsewhere, we advocate that compilation of regional data on marsh habitats and vulnerability to SLR is crucial as it permits agencies to target adaptation to sites based on their vulnerability or mixture of habitats, it helps match sites to appropriate interventions, and it provides a broader regional context to site-specific management actions. Without such data, adaptation actions may be implemented where action is not necessary and to the disadvantage of vulnerable sites where opportunities for successful adaptation will be missed.

AB  - A suite of biomarkers were measured in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) from five North Queensland estuaries along a perceived pollution gradient. The biomarkers selected were 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), cytochrome P450, fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs), DNA integrity, RNA:DNA ratio, cholinesterase activity (ChE), condition factor and hepatosomatic index. The resulting database was subjected to uni- and multi-variate analyses in order to assess the most suitable biomarkers to assess pollution in North Queensland estuaries and to classify the environmental quality of the sites. Principal components analysis (PCA) on the biochemical markers revealed that EROD, EROD/P450, DNA damage and to a lesser extent ChE and FACs were found to be responsive to contaminants in the environment while cytochrome P450, condition factor and the hepatosomatic index were found to be less responsive biomarkers. This study has demonstrated the utility of applying a multibiomarker approach in conjunction with traditional analysis of contaminants in providing valuable information in environmental risk assessment.

AB  - A collaborative study among three nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands) along the Meuse River developed a consistent approach for collecting and interpreting macroinvertebrate data. Specific mesohabitats were sampled in 16 locations along an 800-km stretch of this lowland regulated river. The objective was to assess the 'river health' using macroinvertebrate communities as indicators of biological and ecological variation in space. The main changes in assemblages were investigated using multimetric and multivariate approaches. The authors examined relationships between faunal variations and both physico-chemical gradients and man-made disturbances. We related species traits to faunal changes and habitat characteristics. Both a gradual shift from a macroinvertebrate assemblage dominated by insects to a community dominated by crustaceans and molluscs and a drastic decrease in biotic index values were observed along the longitudinal gradient. Taxa were distributed according to oxygen, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, pH, conductivity and summer hydraulic conditions. But major faunal differences among sites could not be explained simply by physico-chemical variables. The trait analysis underlined the role of temporary habitats in structuring the summer macroinvertebrate community of sites of the uppermost French sector, which supported the most diverse community in terms of trait combination. Downstream the macroinvertebrate community exhibited a more simple and less stable functional organization. We concluded that the Meuse River exhibited both a high biodiversity and a 'reasonably good' water quality in the upper reaches. Two transition zones highlighted the influence of a high degree of human impact on stream integrity. Regulation for navigation, ship traffic and heavily polluted effluent discharges influenced instream conditions via multiple processes determining a decline of both habitat stability and diversity. However, the rare occurrence of habitat-sensitive species in the lower reaches indicated that a partial recovery of communities may be predicted if restoration and protection of disturbed (especially riparian) habitats are fulfilled.

AB  - Naturalness assessments are required for the evaluation of conservation schemes and programmes such as large-scale IUCN protected areas (National Parks) where nature restoration is a main management objective. More than 99% of the landscapes of Central Europe lost their reference sites for naturalness assessments with cutting of the last virgin forests. We present the Relative Quantitative Reference Approach for Naturalness Assessments (RANA), a method for overcoming the lack of virgin forests using a surrogate reference for forested landscapes. RANA combines heterogeneously scaled bio-important variables. We tested the RANA in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, with an assumed naturalness gradient in different park zones. The results demonstrate that the RANA is a highly sensitive method for evaluating ecosystem responses to forest restoration and conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine ecosystem protection and conservation initiatives rely on the assessment of ecological integrity and health status of marine environments. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), which consists on using macroinvertebrate diversity as indicator of ecosystem health, is used worldwide for this purpose. Yet, this index requires taxonomic assignment of specimens, which typically involves a time and resource consuming visual identification of each sample. DNA barcoding or metabarcoding are potential harmonized, faster and cheaper alternatives for species identification, although the suitability of these methods for easing the implementation of the AMBI is yet to be evaluated. Here, we analyze the requirements for the implementation of a genetics based AMBI (gAMBI), and show, using available sequence data, that information about presence/absence of the most frequently occurring species provides accurate AMBI values. Our results set the basics for the implementation of the gAMBI, which has direct implications for a faster and cheaper marine monitoring and health status assessment.

AB  - Alteration of streamflow and thermal conditions may adversely affect lotic invertebrate communities, but few studies have assessed these phenomena using indicators that control for the potentially confounding influence of natural variability. We designed a study to assess how flow and thermal alteration influence stream health - as indicated by the condition of invertebrate communities. We studied thirty streams in the Sierra Nevada, California, that span a wide range of hydrologic modification due to storage reservoirs and hydroelectric diversions. Daily water temperature and streamflows were monitored, and basic chemistry and habitat conditions were characterized when invertebrate communities were sampled. Streamflow alteration, thermal alteration, and invertebrate condition were quantified by predicting site-specific natural expectations using statistical models developed using data from regional reference sites. Monthly flows were typically depleted (relative to natural expectations) during fall, winter, and spring. Most hydrologically altered sites experienced cooled thermal conditions in summer, with mean daily temperatures as much 12 degrees C below natural expectations. The most influential predictor of invertebrate community condition was the degree of alteration of March flows, which suggests that there are key interactions between hydrological and biological processes during this month in Sierra Nevada streams. Thermal alteration was also an important predictor - particularly at sites with the most severe hydrological alteration. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - South Africa faces growing impacts on wetlands and limited resources for conducting assessments. In response, a method for the rapid assessment of ecological condition based on the impacts of human stressors on hydrogeomorphic processes and vegetation responses was developed. The rapid assessment method, referred to as WET-Health, divides wetlands into hydrogeomorphic (HGM) units that are assessed individually. Results are then combined into a composite health score for the wetland system being evaluated. Deviation from the natural reference condition is examined for three separate but inter-linked components of ecosystem health: hydrology, geomorphology and vegetation. The spatial extent of the HGM unit affected by a human impact is estimated and the intensity of the impact in the affected area is scored on a scale of 0 (no impact) to 10 (complete transformation) based on pre-determined indicators that are rated using clear scoring guidelines. Extent and intensity are combined to give an index of the level of departure from the natural reference condition. An assessment is also made in each module of the likely trajectory of change of the wetland. This paper describes the method in order to reflect on the central approach and highlight its heuristic and hypothesis generating value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The three-tier framework of wetland monitoring and assessment methods in the United States is the soundest methodology for wetland assessment at present. This study aims to evaluate the ecosystem health condition of Baiyangdian wetland, a typical marsh wetland in northern China, by means of LDI (Landscape development intensity index), which belongs to Level 1 of this framework. Two field investigations were successively conducted in November 2009 and July 2010. Distributed soil and water samples were collected during the investigations in order to evaluate temporal and spatial variations of wetland health condition. Results show that LDI is a sensitive assessment tool to evaluate the anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Baiyangdian wetland. Strong correlation was found between the assessment results of LDI and soil parameters, which demonstrated the robustness of the method. Baiyangdian wetland has been suffering from serious deterioration, which is caused mainly by intensive anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. Our study has provided critical information about the health status of Baiyangdian wetland, which can also guide the further restoration of this important wetland in northern China.

AB  - Studies investigating the effects of temperature, food availability, or other physical factors on the physiology of marine animals have led to the development of biochemical indicators of growth rate, metabolic condition, and physiological stress. Measurements of metabolic enzyme activity and RNA/DNA have been especially valuable as indicators of condition in studies of marine invertebrates and fishes, groups for which accurate determination of field metabolic rates is difficult. Properly calibrated and applied, biochemical indicators have been successfully used in studies of rocky intertidal ecology, where two decades of experimentation have generated rigorous, testable models for determining the relative influences of biotic and abiotic factors on species distribution, abundance, and interaction. Biochemical indicators of condition and metabolic activity (metabolic enzymes, RNA/DNA) have been used to test nutrient-productivity models by demonstrating tight linkages between nearshore oceanographic processes (such as upwelling) and benthic rocky intertidal ecosystems. Indices of condition and heat stress (heat shock proteins, or Hsps) have begun to be used to test environmental stress models by comparing condition, activity, and Hsp expression of key rocky intertidal predator and prey species. Using biochemical indicators of condition and stress in natural systems holds great promise for understanding mechanisms by which organisms respond to rapid environmental change.

AB  - Biomarkers are useful tools to assess biological effects of pollutants that are extensively used in monitoring programs to assess ecosystem health. However, they are strongly affected by mussel physiological state, especially nutritive status, which has led to the search of new biological indicators of chemical pollutants exposition. Environmental metabolomics is an approach for examining the metabolic responses (measurement of low molecular weight endogenous metabolites) of an organism to both natural and anthropogenic stressors that can occur in its environment. The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluoranthene (FLU) exposure on the metabolomic profiles of mussel digestive glands under different nutritive conditions. To achieve this objective, mussels were reared, for a period of 56 days, under three different food rations in order to obtain a gradient of nutritive status (negative, zero and positive energy balance), and after that, they were exposed, during 3 weeks, to a nominal concentration of 3 mu g FLU L-1. A total of 43 metabolites, including aminoacids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, etc.), energy metabolism related metabolites (ATP, AMP, etc.), organic osmolytes (taurine, etc.), redox metabolism (GSH, NADP +) and nucleotides, were identified and quantified in the digestive glands of the mussels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) defined two principal components (PC1 and PC2) that explained 55.6% of the total variance, although the first component explains more than 80% of this variance, this being related to the mussel nutritive condition. The effect of the toxicant, explained by the PC2, is similar to that produced under conditions of food restriction, which masks the effect of the toxicant under these conditions. As the feeding conditions are more favorable, the toxic effect becomes more apparent. Therefore, the great influence of nutritive condition on mussel metabolome implies a handicap for the use of metabolomic biomarkers, as previously demonstrated for biochemical and other molecular biomarkers, in large-scale monitoring programs in which several food conditions coexist with pollution levels.

AB  - Benthic algae were used to identify reference conditions of springs for bioassessment purposes. Benthic algae and environmental factors were quantified in 70 springs (nonthermal and mostly near-natural) in the southeastern Alps. Spring types were identified by fuzzy clustering of nondiatom, benthic algal assemblages. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and indicator species analysis (IndVal) were used to identify the most relevant environmental determinants of taxonomic composition in springs and to characterize the ecological traits of key taxa. A total of 120 macro-and microscopic benthic pro-and eukaryotic algae (excluding diatoms) were identified. Cyanobacteria (especially Chroococcales and Oscillatoriales) were strongly prevalent. Seven spring types were identified by fuzzy clustering of nondiatom, benthic algal assemblages. IndVal identified 22 taxa that were significant indicators of spring type, and fuzzy clustering based on environmental preferences identified 18 other important taxa associated with spring type. Spring types differed in environmental features, species richness, and diversity. Mid-to-high altitude, oligotrophic, carbonate flowing springs (rheocrenes) with medium conductivity were the most common spring type and were characterized by shade-tolerant (Chroococcales) or rheophilic (Tapinothrix varians) cyanobacteria. Low-altitude, shaded, and slightly NO3-N-enriched carbonate rheocrenes with medium-to-high conductivity supported rheophilic or eutraphentic cyanobacteria and red algae. Siliceous rheocrenes had benthic algal assemblages dominated by soft-water, rheophilic cyanobacteria and by the rheobiontic chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus. Mostly siliceous seepages and pool springs supported predominantly chlorophytes, especially filamentous Zygnematales. Xerotolerant cyanobacteria were common on carbonate rock-face seepages. Tufa springs were characterized by cyanobacteria and by the desmid, Oocardium stratum. In iron springs, benthic algae (mainly filamentous green algae and xanthophytes) were poorly developed, whereas iron bacteria were common. The most influential factors were pH and conductivity, shading, NO3-N, temperature, current velocity, and substratum particle size. The spring types identified may prove useful as references for assessments of ecological integrity naturalness value, at least for the Alps ecoregion.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a review of the state of technology for renewal of force mains. Force mains are critical components of many sewer collection systems with significant environmental and cost consequences for failure. The review identified several needs, including the need for rational and common design approaches for rehabilitation systems, quality assurance/quality control procedures, and better practices for operation and maintenance. The difficulty in assessing the condition of sewer force mains, leaving many owners with questions about the integrity of their systems, and the limited amount of technologies available for renewing a deteriorated main, has limited the amount of renewal work in the past. Most of the renewal activity has involved complete replacement of the force main. As the nation's force mains age further, greater emphasis must be placed on finding cost-effective ways to renew these critical assets. Fortunately, new products and technologies are now emerging for condition assessment, as well as rehabilitation. Some newer methods developed for gravity sewers and water distribution systems are being adapted for use in force main rehabilitation but design and performance data gaps remain to be filled.

AB  - P>1. Biological invasions, still occurring worldwide at an alarming rate, are widely acknowledged as threats to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. In addition to introducing disease, biological invasions have also been linked to sudden increases in the incidence or severity of previously existing diseases. We review and illustrate the potential direct and indirect impacts of introduced species on the dynamics of endemic parasites in freshwater ecosystems.
   2. Introduced species may trigger and sustain disease emergence by acting as competent hosts for endemic parasites in which infection is amplified and then 'spilled back' to native hosts. In contrast, if introduced species are not suitable hosts for endemic parasites but become infected anyway, they may act as sinks for parasites and thus dilute disease risk for native hosts.
   3. Another mechanism by which introduced species can influence endemic parasitic diseases is by altering the relative abundance of one of the parasite's hosts in ways that could either enhance or reduce disease transmission to other native hosts in the parasite's life cycle.
   4. Introduced species may also alter disease incidence and severity in native hosts through trait-mediated indirect effects. For example, the introduced species could change the exposure or susceptibility of native hosts to infection by causing alterations in their behaviour or immunocompetence. Also, by directly changing physicochemical conditions and modifying environmental stressors introduced species may indirectly affect native host exposure and/or resistance to disease.
   5. A survey of parasites infecting introduced freshwater fish in four distinct geographical areas revealed that use of non-indigenous hosts by endemic parasites is widespread, mostly involving parasites transmitted via the food chain.
   6. We conclude by presenting a framework, based on risk assessment, for the prediction and possible mitigation of the impact of introduced species on endemic diseases and by calling for greater recognition of the potential role of invasive species as triggers of endemic disease emergence.

AB  - Benthic diatoms have been universally used as indicators to assess water quality in lotic ecosystems. However, most diatom-based indices developed in Europe have not been widely used or tested in other continents such as Asia or Oceania. This study compared the performance of 14 widely-applied diatom indices in assessing ecological conditions in subtropical streams in South East Queensland (SEQ) in Australia and in the upper Han River in China. Most water quality variables in the upper Han River including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) had strong relationships with at least one diatom index, with the exception of IDAP (Index Diatom Artois-Picardie), and TDI (Trophic Diatom Index). However, in SEQ, most of the environmental variables including DOC, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), TN, SRP, and electrical conductivity (EC) showed no significant relationships with diatom indices, and the DI-CH (Swiss Diatom Index) and WAT (Watanabe's Index) were unrelated to any of the variables examined. Only pH and nitrite or nitrate nitrogen (NOX-N) were significant predictors of several diatom indices in SEQ, especially TID ( Rott trophic index). In the upper Han River, much of the spatial variation in most diatom indices was explained by proximate determinants alone, including EC, DOC, dissolved oxygen (DO) or SRP, or a combination of ultimate (canopy, forest) and proximate factors (R-2 in most models > 0.75). Most diatom indices performed as predicted in the upper Han River where nutrient and organic matter pollution was relatively high, and variation in pH low. However, the indices performed poorly in SEQ where the water quality gradient was low and instead most responded to spatial variation in pH. This finding serves as a caution to the application of diatom indices in river basins that fall outside of the range of water quality values of the systems in which they originally developed.

AB  - Over a 3-yr period, the qualitative assessment protocol "Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health" was used to evaluate the status of three ecosystem attributes (soil/site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity) at over 500 locations in and adjacent to Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (Utah). Objectives were to provide data and interpretations to support the development of site-specific management strategies and to investigate broad-scale patterns in the status of different rangeland ecological sites. Quantitative data on ground cover, plant community composition, and soil stability were collected to aid the evaluation of qualitative attributes and improve consistency of the assessment process. Ecological sites with potential vegetation dominated by varieties of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nuttall) had the highest frequencies (46.7%-75.0%) of assessments with low ratings (moderate or greater departure from expected reference conditions) for all three ecosystem attributes. In contrast, sites with potential vegetation characterized by Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma [Torrey] Little) and/or Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelmann) had low frequencies (0.0%-7.8%) of assessments with low ratings for all attributes. Several interacting factors likely contributed to the development of patterns among ecological sites, including 1) potential primary production and thus long-term exposure to production-oriented land uses such as livestock grazing; 2) the presence of unpalatable woody plants capable of increasing and becoming persistent site dominants due to selective herbivory, absence of fire, or succession; 3) soil texture through effects on hydrologic responses to livestock grazing, trampling, and other disturbances; and 4) past management that resulted in high livestock use of ecological sites with sensitive fine-loamy soils following treatments designed to increase forage availability. This case study illustrates an extensive application of an assessment technique that is receiving increasing use worldwide, and results contribute to an understanding of factors contributing to patterns and processes of rangeland degradation.

AB  - Upland areas of southeastern United States tidal creek watersheds are popular locations for development, and they form part of the estuarine ecosystem characterized by high economic and ecological value. The primary objective of this work was to define the relationships between coastal development, with its concomitant land use changes and associated increases in nonpoint source pollution loading, and the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems including related consequences to human populations and coastal communities. Nineteen tidal creek systems, located along the southeastern US coast from southern North Carolina to southern Georgia, were sampled in the summer, 2005 and 2006. Within each system, creeks were divided into two primary segments based upon tidal zoning-intertidal (i.e., shallow, narrow headwater sections) and subtidal (i.e., deeper and wider sections)-and then watersheds were delineated for each segment. Relationships between coastal development, concomitant land use changes, nonpoint source pollution loading, the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems, and the potential impacts to human populations and coastal communities were evaluated. In particular, relationships were identified between the amount of impervious cover (indicator of coastal development) and a range of exposure and response measures including increased chemical contamination of the sediments, increased pathogens in the water, increased nitrate/nitrite levels, increased salinity range, decreased biological productivity of the macrobenthos, alterations to the food web, increased flooding potential, and increased human risk of exposure to pathogens and harmful chemicals. The integrity of tidal creeks, particularly the headwaters or intertidally dominated sections, was impaired by increases in nonpoint source pollution associated with sprawling urbanization (i.e., increases in impervious cover). This finding suggests that these habitats are valuable early warning sentinels of ensuing ecological impacts and potential public health and flooding risk from sprawling coastal development. The results also validate the use of a conceptual model with impervious cover thresholds for tidal creek systems in the southeast region.

AB  - Introduction of non-native trees is one of the major threats to ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. Stands of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) introduced decades ago represent a threat to the specialized plant communities of serpentine outcrops in Italy. This study investigates the effects of such invasions at the community and species level, based on vegetation sampling in three selected sites with comparable environmental conditions. Pine cover caused a decrease of alpha-diversity by lowering the species evenness of the community, though species richness was not negatively affected. Compositional changes between the two habitats were significant but not clearly associated with a decrease in taxonomic distinctness in the pine stands. As many as nine indicator species were found in the open vegetation, along with the obligate endemics Odontarrhena bertolonii and Armeria denticulata. Both of them declined in the pine stands. Here, an increase in the phytoavailable nickel fraction was associated with a decrease in total nickel concentration in the soil, via mobilization of the metal caused by lowering of pH induced by the conifer litter. The nickel-hyperaccumulator O. bertolonii was able to maintain high metal concentrations in the shoots despite a decrease in root concentration, resulting in a higher shoot/root ratio in the pine stands (similar to 20). Conversely, shoot/root ratio in the non-accumulator Plantago holosteumwas <1 and not affected by the conifer, as well as its abundance in this anthropogenic habitat. Contrasting responses of the two species were likely due to their different sensitivity to modified light and soil conditions, whereas stability of shoot nickel-concentration in O. bertolonii did not support increased predation by natural enemies as one of the causes for its decline under the conifer.
   Progressive thinning of these stands is advocated to limit soil nickel mobilization and to restore a unique ecosystem with its endemic metallophytes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Questions The Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass ecosystem is one of the most endangered in the United States, yet community-level patterns of non-native plant distribution and abundance remain largely unexplored. To address this information gap, we asked the following questions: What are the distinct plant communities within Zumwalt Prairie Preserve? What are the most widespread and abundant non-native species and how does non-native species composition and dominance vary across plant communities? How do historic land use, biotic and environmental factors influence plant community composition, particularly in terms of non-native species abundance and dominance? Location Zumwalt Prairie Preserve, Wallowa County, Oregon, USA. Methods We sampled 123 plots using point-intercept methods within a stratified random sampling approach. We analyzed community variation using cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling, and related composition and non-native plant abundance to historical land use, biotic and environmental variables using joint plots, linear regression, and non-parametric multiplicative regression. Results While native perennial grasses were the most abundant species, non-native species accounted for 27% of species encountered and four of the ten most abundant species were non-native annual grasses (e.g., Ventenata dubia) or non-native perennial grasses (e.g., Poa pratensis). Abundance patterns of non-native perennial grasses differed markedly from those of non-native annual grasses; non-native perennial grasses were concentrated in old fields, while non-native annual grasses were abundant in moisture-limited uncultivated sites. Conclusions Despite its protected status, non-native plant species pose a serious threat to the biotic integrity of the Preserve, with unknown consequences to ecosystem dynamics and function. Moreover, patterns of non-native abundance vary considerably, with different species responding individually to land-use, environmental, and biotic gradients. An improved understanding of the relationship between non-native species distributions and historical, environmental, and biotic factors can help in the development of ecologically appropriate, cost-effective strategies for the conservation and restoration of this unique landscape.

AB  - Aim of study: This paper presents a novel index, the Riparian Forest Evaluation (RFV) index, for assessing the ecological condition of riparian forests. The status of riparian ecosystems has global importance due to the ecological and social benefits and services they provide. The initiation of the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/CE) requires the assessment of the hydromorphological quality of natural channels. The Directive describes riparian forests as one of the fundamental components that determine the structure of riverine areas. The RFV index was developed to meet the aim of the Directive and to complement the existing methodologies for the evaluation of riparian forests.
   Area of study: The RFV index was applied to a wide range of streams and rivers (170 water bodies) in Spain.
   Material and methods: The calculation of the RFV index is based on the assessment of both the spatial continuity of the forest (in its three core dimensions: longitudinal, transversal and vertical) and the regeneration capacity of the forest, in a sampling area related to the river hydromorphological pattern. This index enables an evaluation of the quality and degree of alteration of riparian forests. In addition, it helps to determine the scenarios that are necessary to improve the status of riparian forests and to develop processes for restoring their structure and composition.
   Main results: The results were compared with some previous tools for the assessment of riparian vegetation. The RFV index got the highest average scores in the basins of northern Spain, which suffer lower human influence. The forests in central and southern rivers got worse scores. The bigger differences with other tools were found in complex and partially altered streams and rivers.
   Research highlights: The study showed the index's applicability under diverse hydromorphological and ecological conditions and the main advantages of its application. The utilization of the index allows a better understanding of the status of riparian forests, and enhances improvements in the conservation and management of riparian areas.

AB  - Bioindicators provide better information about environmental quality than chemical and physical measures alone. This paper addresses how this information can improve the efficiency of water pollution control policy. We model bioindicators as a means of resolving uncertainty about the relationship of human activities and environmental effects. Two economic policy models are developed to formalize efficiency gains that result from biological information. We find that resolving uncertainty is valuable in both a benefit-cost framework and in implementing an exogenously-determined safety standard. The results imply that ecological research capable of providing this kind of information can have a direct economic payoff.

AB  - Disentangling the influences of multiple environmental factors on ecosystem integrity is not straightforward because environmental factors may interact and biotic responses may be nonlinear. We aimed to understand better the relationships between freshwater invertebrate assemblages and multiple, interacting environmental factors. We analyzed stream monitoring data for 689 sampling sites in the state of Ohio (USA) with Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). We used 16 environmental predictors covering geography, water chemistry, physical-habitat quality, and toxic pressure. We represented freshwater invertebrate assemblages by the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) and its 10 component metrics. The ICI was mainly related to physical-habitat quality, nutrient concentrations (P and N), and pH. Responses of the ICI component metrics to physical-habitat quality and water-chemistry variables were similar and were associated with amplified importance of these predictors for the ICI, whereas heterogeneous responses of the component metrics to geographic variables appeared to cancel each other out at the level of the ICI. Models including predictor interactions explained 22 to 54% of the deviation in the biotic endpoints, whereas the no-interactions models explained 14 to 47%. The gain in predictive power was largest between the no- and the pairwise interaction models and decreased rapidly for each additional interaction level. We conclude that a focus on pairwise interactions is a good compromise between higher predictive power and interpretability of the results.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study based on a very comprehensive set of empirical data from many international data bases including fresh water systems, coastal brackish water areas and marine coastal areas. We present a general trophic level classification system (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic categories) for sites/areas characterised by a wide range of salinities. This classification system targets on the following operational effect variables (bioindicators), which are meant to reflect key structural and functional aspects of aquatic ecosystems and characteristic (median) values for entire defined areas (the ecosystem scale) for the growing season: Secchi depth (as a standard measure of water clarity), chlorophyll-a concentrations (a measure of primary phytoplankton biomass), the oxygen saturation in the deep-water zone (an indicator reflecting sedimentation, oxygen consumption, oxygen concentrations and the habitat conditions for zoobenthos, an important functional group) and the macrophyte cover (an important variable for the bioproduction potential, including fish production, and the "biological value" of aquatic systems). For a wide range of systems, these bioindicators can be predicted using practically useful models, i.e., models based on variables that can be accessed from standard monitoring programs and maps. These bioindicators are regulated by a set of abiotic factors, such as salinity, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nutrient concentrations (N and P), morphometry and water exchange. Empirical data ultimately form the basis for most ecological/environmental studies and this work uses maybe the most comprehensive data set ever related to trophic level conditions. It also gives compilations of empirically-based (statistical) models quantifying how the variables are interrelated and how they reflect fundamental aspects of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Parasites can be used as effective monitoring tools in environmental impact studies as they are able to accumulate certain pollutants (e.g. metals) at levels much higher than those of their ambient environment and of free-living sentinels. Thus, they provide valuable information not only about the chemical conditions of their and their hosts' environment but also deliver insights into the biological availability of allochthonous substances. While a large number of different freshwater parasites (mainly acanthocephalans and cestodes) were investigated in terms of pollutant bioaccumulation, studies based on marine host-parasites systems remain scarce. However, available data show that different marine parasite taxa such as nematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans exhibit also an excellent metal accumulation capacity.
   The biological availability of metals and their uptake routes in marine biota and parasites differ from those of freshwater organisms. We assume that a large part of metals and other pollutants are also taken up via the digestive system of the host. Therefore, in addition to environmental conditions the physiology of the host also plays an important role for the accumulation process. Additionally, we highlight some advantages in using parasites as accumulation indicators in marine ecosystems. As parasites occur ubiquitously in marine food webs, the monitoring of metals in their tissues can deliver information about the spatial and trophic distribution of pollutants. Accordingly, parasites as indicators offer an ecological assessment on a broader scale, in contrast to established free-living marine indicators, which are mostly benthic invertebrates and therefore limited in habitat distribution. Globally distributed parasite taxa, which are highly abundant in a large number of host species, are suggested as worldwide applicable sentinels. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major goal of current environmental policies is to preserve or return areas to a good ecological status, which should be assessed at the ecosystem level, using several biological elements, together with physical, chemical and pollution elements. This study investigated the use of early life stages of fishes as indicators of estuarine ecosystem condition, testing the hypothesis that estuaries with different human impacts would carry distinct larval and juvenile fish assemblages. We used two estuaries as models, the Ave and Cavado (NW Portugal) that have similar geomorphologies but are submitted to different human pressures. Surveys were conducted during spring and autumn 2009, and included the collection of larval and juvenile stages of fishes, together with the physical and chemical characterization of water and sediments. Several indicators of human pressure, namely sewage contamination and toxicology of water were assayed. Physical and chemical water characteristics did not vary between the two estuaries and exhibited a similar seasonal trend. However, during autumn, atypical freshet conditions were observed in the Cavado as a result of increased precipitation and river flow, illustrating hydrological pressures. Despite this, the Cavado with unmodified banks, lower nutrient load, organic matter and sewage contamination appeared less impacted than the Ave. Although the abundance and diversity were similar, the structure of larval fish assemblages varied between the two estuaries. Marine species dominated the Ave larval assemblages, while in the Cavado resident species were the most abundant taxa. Juvenile fish assemblages were more abundant and diverse in the Cavado, with a total of thirteen species against the eight species observed in the Ave. The Cavado larval and juvenile fish assemblages comprised more functional guilds than in the Ave estuary. The marine species Solea senegalensis and Dicentrarchus labrax were identified as responsible for the major differences in larval and juvenile fish assemblages, respectively. In the case of species that were simultaneously present during larval and juvenile phases, only two resident species were observed in the Ave, while five species were observed in the Cavado, including resident and marine juveniles. Thus, early life stages of fishes were indicative of a better ecological condition and environmental status of the Cavado estuary, which is less impacted and has a lower pollution level than the Ave estuary. The present study reinforced the idea that larval and juvenile stages of fishes can be useful tools for the assessment of ecological condition status of transitional waters especially in estuaries noted for their nursery function.

AB  - The pressures of a growing population and a fluctuating economy have caused extensive landuse transformations in the Colombian Andes, and >63% of the natural land cover has been replaced by cattle and crop fields. Despite the obvious importance of agriculture as a driver of stream degradation, the specific effects of agriculture on low-order streams of the Andean region are poorly understood. We used aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of biological integrity and applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore mechanisms through which local agricultural practices degrade headwater streams of the Colombian coffee-growing region. Our results suggest that agriculture affects the aquatic macroinvertebrate community indirectly by increasing the concentration of NH3-N in the water and reducing the width of the riparian forest. Moreover, through the reduction of riparian forest width, agriculture increased % slow-flowing habitats and decreased the availability of coarse substrates in the reach, which also had important effects on the benthic community. These results indicate that local farming practices, such as the elimination of the riparian forest and the use of riparian zones for crops and cattle grazing, are responsible for most of the effects of agriculture on streams in this region. Our results also highlight the importance of further research to formulate management alternatives relevant to the local context.

AB  - As the most populous continent, and its dominant role in the global economy, Asia is arguably the most important region for understanding global change. To evaluate and guide humanity's growth toward a more sustainable future, indicators and their composite indices have been adopted as key tools resulting in a paralyzing amount for decision-makers, practitioners, and researchers to choose from. Although research has improved understanding of development metrics for evaluating and monitoring global change, making progress toward sustainability remains as open as ever. Building from previous work, 44 Asian nations were studied using four guiding research questions: (i) What are the hidden dimensions within a collection of known sustainable development indices, and what differentiates winning locations from losing ones? (ii) Are the three major divisions of sustainability (economic growth, social equity, environmental integrity) equally supported by these development measuring initiatives? (iii) How do common global change indicators statistically respond to the canonical development dimensions? (iv) Do recent population growth and urbanization trends move humanity closer to planetary sustainability? Those questions were explored using four amassing methodological stages. First, six hidden development dimensions (factor axes) were revealed while maintaining over 80% of 35 known sustainable development indices' variation. The dimensions expressed: (F1) human well-being synergies; (F2) environmentally efficient happiness; (F3) ecological integrity to economic performance trade-off; (F4) peace, prosperity, and natural resources protection; (F5) economic and political liberty; and (F6) generosity. Second, a mega-index of sustainable development (MISD) was created by combining the six latent dimensions. Third, spatial patterns of the hidden development axes, MISD, and nine common global change metrics were explored. Fourth, using global and local inferential tests, associations between the canonical development dimensions, MISD, and global change indicators were made. The human well-being synergies dimension (F1) explained over one-third of the total variance, and positively clustered in northern Asia and negatively in southern Asia. The MISD ranked Singapore best, followed by Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Kyrgyzstan, and Malaysia; Afghanistan ranked worst, then China, Syria, Russia, Turkmenistan, and India. Overall, improved sustainable development position came through increased population density, decreased country area, lower latitude, and a greater proportion of urban land cover. This cross-country analysis reiterates an underrepresentation of biogeochemical (ecosphere) conditions across development indices; moreover, spatial patterns of favorable development were rarely found simultaneous. Trade-offs and the lack of spatial concordance will make achieving sustainability a very difficult task in an urbanizing world without limits.

AB  - The textile industry is one of the largest sectors globally, representing up to 20% of industrial water pollution. However, there is limited insight into how fluvial ecosystems respond and recover from this impact. From summer 2012 to spring 2013, we examined water quality and ecological status upstream and 1.5 km downstream the input of a textile industry wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ripoll River, NE Spain. The ecological status was determined via diversity measures and 10 biotic indices based on diatoms, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish. Our results showed that the WWTP severely deteriorated water quality and biological communities at the discharge site, but that they improved at 15 km downstream. Severity also varied across taxa and seasons, being fish the most affected taxa and spring the season with the best ecological status. The strong correlation amongst water quality variables and many biotic indices across taxa indicated that this is a chronic pollution event affecting multiple trophic levels. Thus, this study suggests that there is an urgent need to invest in wastewater treatment in this industry to preserve the ecological integrity of Ripoll River and especially its fish fauna. Likewise, it illustrates the diagnostic power of biotic indices based on diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish, as driven by the European Water Framework Directive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The decrease in foaling rates after artificial insemination with cooled semen warrants the search for new predictors of fertility. The objectives were to investigate levels of naturally occurring reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cooled, stored stallion semen doses for artificial insemination (AI), and their relationship with parameters of semen quality and with pregnancy rate. Semen was collected from warmblood stallions (n=15) and used to prepare commercial semen doses for AI. Sperm quality was evaluated after cooled transport to the laboratory overnight. The results were correlated with observed foaling and pregnancy rates. Hydroethidine and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate were used as indicators for the ROS superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Sperm morphology, motility, plasma membrane integrity and chromatin integrity were also evaluated. These variables were correlated with each other and with pregnancy rates. We found a high inter-individual variation in the ROS levels between stallions. The proportion of live, hydrogen peroxide-negative spermatozoa was correlated with progressive motility, whereas live hydrogen peroxide-negative spermatozoa and chromatin damage were negatively correlated, indicating that low levels of hydrogen peroxide were correlated with good chromatin integrity. The percentage of dead hydrogen peroxide-positive sperm was negatively related to the foaling rate. The negative relationships were stronger when combining results from both assays for ROS. These results for stored semen samples indicate that high individual variation exists for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide measurements, and that ROS status can influence sperm quality. Thus, ROS may be some of the factors influencing fertility. Moreover, combinations of ROS variables improved the correlation with fertility, indicating the usefulness of including these variables in a future model for prediction of the fertility of a semen sample.

AB  - Bacterial communities are important for the health and productivity of soil ecosystems and have great potential as novel indicators of environmental per-turbations. To assess how they are affected by anthropogenic activity and to determine their ability to provide alternative metrics of environmental health, we sought to define which soil variables bacteria respond to across multiple soil types and land uses. We determined, through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the composition of bacterial communities in soil samples from 110 natural or human-impacted sites, located up to 300 km apart. Overall, soil bacterial communities varied more in response to changing soil environments than in response to changes in climate or increasing geographic distance. We identified strong correlations between the relative abundances of members of Pirellulaceae and soil pH, members of Gaiellaceae and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, members of Bradyrhizobium and the levels of Olsen P (a measure of plant available phosphorus), and members of Chitinophagaceae and aluminum concentrations. These relationships between specific soil attributes and individual soil taxa not only highlight ecological characteristics of these organisms but also demonstrate the ability of key bacterial taxonomic groups to reflect the impact of specific anthropogenic activities, even in comparisons of samples across large geographic areas and diverse soil types. Overall, we provide strong evidence that there is scope to use relative taxon abundances as biological indicators of soil condition.
   IMPORTANCE The impact of land use change and management on soil microbial community composition remains poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between a wide range of soil factors and soil bacterial community composition. We included variables related to anthropogenic activity and collected samples across a large spatial scale to interrogate the complex relationships between various bacterial community attributes and soil condition. We provide evidence of strong relationships between individual taxa and specific soil attributes even across large spatial scales and soil and land use types. Collectively, we were able to demonstrate the largely untapped potential of microorganisms to indicate the condition of soil and thereby influence the way that we monitor the effects of anthropogenic activity on soil ecosystems into the future.

AB  - Fixation and permeabilization of cells and tissues are essential processes in biological techniques like immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry for cell biology studies. In typical procedures, the biological samples are treated by paraformaldehyde and Triton X-100 to achieve cellular fixation and permeabilization, respectively, prior to the incubation with specific antibodies. While it is well-known that the integrity of cell membrane has been broken during these processes, quantitative studies on the loss of cellular mass density and the enhancement of molecular accessibility at single cell level are still rare. In this study, we employed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging technique to monitor the mass density change of single cells during sequential fixation and permeabilization processes. We further utilize the osmotic responses of single cells to sugar molecules as an indicator to evaluate the integrity of cell membranes. It was found that, while fixation initially destructed the integrity of cell membranes and increased the permeability of intra- and extra-cellular molecules, it was permeabilization process that substantially induced significant loss in cellular mass density.

AB  - Neotropical caves located in pristine ecosystems harbor high biodiversity but face functional shifts and degradation interlinked with aboveground changes. Cave-roosting bats have been proposed as integrity indicators of karst landscapes considering their sensitive to both the underground and aboveground characteristics and resources. In the present study, the selection of caves by bats in karst areas across a landscape gradient in the Brazilian Amazon was investigated. We envisioned that taxonomic and guild diversity should respond dissimilarly to disturbance at different scales, namely by a selective offsetting of the bat community. To test our hypothesis, we accordingly selected caves spanning a gradient of disturbance, located in old growth forests, secondary forests, forest fragments, agricultural landscapes, and pastures. Species and traits showing responses to the gradient of caves and aboveground ecosystems were identified. On the basis of patterns of occurrence, we determined those communities unique to or primarily associated with undisturbed caves located in pristine ecosystems and landscapes. Disturbed caves, which are generally located in areas of agriculture and pastures, were found to have detrimental effects on specialized species and functional guilds diversity. Our preliminary results reveal that bat communities are particularly sensitive to gradients of cave and ecosystem disturbance, and consequently might add ecological information to the currently used indicators for assessing the ecological status of landscapes in the Neotropics.

AB  - Comparisons of transcriptional and translational expression in normal and abnormal states are important to reach an understanding of pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Maintaining the biochemical, molecular, and structural sample integrity is essential for correct sample comparisons. We demonstrate that both proteins and neuropeptides, including their PTMs, are subjected to massive degradation in the brain already 1 min postmortem. Further, markers for determining the integrity and status of a biological sample were identified. The protein fragment stathmin 2-20 correlated well with the general level of postmortem degradation and may serve as a sample quality indicator for future work, both in animal and human postmortem brains. Finally, a novel method for preventing degradation of proteins and peptides in postmortem tissue is presented using rapid and uniform conductive heat transfer on tissue prior to the actual sample preparation procedures, which enables the relatively low-abundant neuropeptides to remain intact, minimizes degradation of proteins by proteolysis, and conserves the PTMs of the neuropeptides.

AB  - The aim of this study was to use an integrated, multi-indicator approach to assess and compare the biotic integrity of the polluted rivers flowing into the hyper-eutrophic Roodeplaat Dam. This included seasonal assessments of physical, chemical and biological parameters of the water and sediment, as well as a habitat, macroinvertebrate and histology-based fish health assessment. The results showed that all three rivers are polluted by metals and faecal coliform bacteria and high nutrient levels which explains the eutrophic status of the receiving impoundment. The Edendalespruit showed higher metal concentrations while the Pienaars River showed higher nutrients and Chlorophyll-a levels. Semi-volatile organic compounds were detected in sediment samples from all three rivers. The macroinvertebrate assessment confirmed that the water quality of the rivers are negatively impacted with most of the sites classified as "fair" to "poor" based on the number of taxa identified and their sensitivity scores. The histological assessment of six different target organs of two indicator fish species indicated a definite tissue response, especially in terms of the liver alterations in Clarias gariepinus. The percentage prevalence of alterations varied across rivers and seasons with no discernible pattern identified. The assessment of both abiotic and biotic indicators indicated that this system is plagued by a number of negative impacts and that management initiatives should focus especially on the activities influencing the Pienaars River to mitigate the continuing eutrophication of the Roodeplaat Dam.

KW  - INTEGRITY
AB  - Ecological risk assessment is recognized by many as an important conceptual tool in ecosystem management. The purpose of such a risk assessment is to identify those factors (stressors) that pose the greatest risk to ecosystem integrity so that environmental protection efforts can be focused on those strategies likely to yield the greatest reduction in ecosystem risk. If ecological risk assessment is to move from the conceptual stage to the implementation stage, new methodological tools must be developed and successfully applied. The purpose of this paper is to describe the application of a basic methodological risk assessment tool, first developed by the authors as part of a case study involving Green Bay of Lake Michigan to the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway located in northwestern Wisconsin and east-central Minnesota.
   The information needed for conducting the risk assessment was provided by the participants in a e-day workshop. The invited participants, who possessed knowledge of the St. Croix ecosystem, identified through a group-consensus process a list of stressors and a list of ecosystem values. They then assigned numerical values to each stressor-ecosystem value pair that reflected the degree to which the given stressor contributes to ecosystem risk as measured by the given ecosystem value. Based on this information, the analytical portion of the methodology was then used to rank the ecosystem risks (stressors) when examined from several different perspectives: immediate impact, time-duration. and management activities. Regardless of the perspective taken, riverway development emerged as the most significant stressor.

AB  - In this article we demonstrate how to integrate the ecosystem services concept into regional planning using the example of a case study in Saxony, Germany. We analysed how the reduction of water erosion as a regulating service impacts six other ecosystem services. Ecological integrity, provisioning services (provision of food and fibre, provision of biomass), regulating services (soil erosion protection, drought-risk regulation, flood regulation), and the cultural service landscape aesthetics are taken into account. Using a decision support software, we found that the greening of preferential discharge paths can reduce water erosion by 2-7 %. The introduction of hedgerows and the change in the soil management system from tillage to no-till practices revealed a reduction in the total soil loss by 33 and 89 %, respectively. A combination of the three erosion control measures-greening, hedgerows, and no-till management-reduced the soil loss most efficiently by 92 %. We found synergies between the measures for reducing erosion and the provision of ecological integrity, of regulating and cultural ecosystem services. In contrast, the impact on provisioning services was slightly negative. For the land use planning in the case study region we recommend therefore a combination of greening, hedges, and management change. We found that the applied integrated ecosystem services assessment approach, in combination with stakeholder involvement in the scenario development, helped communicating cross-sectoral effects of different management strategies in a comprehensive way and therefore supports regional planning.

AB  - Suppressing expert knowledge can hide environmentally damaging practices and policies from public scrutiny. We surveyed ecologists and conservation scientists from universities, government, and industry across Australia to understand the prevalence and consequences of suppressing science communication. Government (34%) and industry (30%) respondents reported higher rates of undue interference by employers than did university respondents (5%). Internal communications (29%) and media (28%) were curtailed most, followed by journal articles (11%), and presentations (12%). When university and industry researchers avoided public commentary, this was mainly for fear of media misrepresentation, while government employees were most often constrained by senior management and workplace policy. One third of respondents reported personal suffering related to suppression, including job losses and deteriorating mental health. Substantial reforms are needed, including to codes of practice, and governance of environmental assessments and research, so that scientific advice can be reported openly, in a timely manner and free from interference.

TI  - An ecosystem management program and assessment process for Ontario national parks
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - An ecosystem management program and assessment process was developed to standardize an ecosystem-based approach to protecting the ecological integrity of Ontario's national parks. The elements of the ecosystem management program collectively represent the dominant planning and technical aspects of ecosystem management. Within the program, 11 specific products-ecosystem conservation plan, greater park ecosystem inventory and analysis, greater park ecosystem scope, area of cooperation, stakeholder analysis, partnership group management guidelines, scientific research program, ecological indicators, ecological integrity monitoring program, information network, and communication strategy-are considered requisite tools to improve the scientific understanding required for park management within the context of greater park ecosystems and to increase communication and coordination among governments and citizens to improve decision making. The formal process uses evaluation criteria associated with the 11 products to assess progress in developing an ecosystem management program and the content of the related products. The assessment process, which provides comprehensive identification of a park's specific ecosystem management needs, has been applied to all national parks in Ontario in the past year, which has had the immediate effect of refining their ecosystem management programs.

AB  - The cryogenic temperature of LNG induces unexpected thermal stress on a metallic structure when LNG comes in contact with it. The induced thermal stress may combine with other operational stress causing the system to face abnormally high stress rates. Furthermore, small cracks, imperfections or design flaws can propagate at high rate under the new increased stress condition. This may lead to catastrophic failure of the structure. In this study, a methodology is proposed for the assessment of the impact of a fugitive LNG spill on a typical steel structure. The study outlines an insight into the structural integrity assessment of the structure during an LNG spill. The focus of the study is to model an LNG pool formation in a complex offshore structure using Flame Acceleration Simulator (FLACS), and to analyse the temperature profile of the pool using thermal analysis. The thermal stress obtained from the transient analysis is considered as a load for LNG spill impact assessment. Ten different semi-elliptical crack sizes are considered to analyse the impact of thermal stress on crack propagation. The outcome of this study reveals that the fugitive release of LNG does not cause immediate crack propagation, however, it has a significant impact on the operational life of the structure. This study confirms that the fugitive release of LNG is a serious hazard for structural integrity and demands effective preventive and/or control measures.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are affected by ever-increasing natural and human pressures. Because the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics unique to estuarine ecosystems control the ways that biological resources respond to ecosystem stressors, we present a flexible and adaptable biological assessment method for estuaries. The biological condition gradient (BCG) is a scientific framework of biological response to increasing anthropogenic stress that is comprehensive and ecosystem based and evaluates environmental conditions and the status of ecosystem services in order to identify, communicate, and prioritize management action. Using existing data, we constructed the first estuarine BCG framework that examines changes in habitat structure through time. Working in a New England (U.S.) estuary with a long history of human influence, we developed an approach to define a reference level, which we described as a "minimally disturbed" range of conditions for the ecosystem, anchored by observations before 1850 AD. Like many estuaries in the U.S., the relative importance of environmental stressors changed over time, but even qualitative descriptions of the biological indicators' status provided useful information for defining condition levels. This BCG demonstrated that stressors rarely acted alone and that declines in one biological indicator influenced the declines of others. By documenting the biological responses to cumulative stressors, the BCG inherently suggests an ecosystem-based approach to management. Additionally, the BCG process initiates thinking over long time scales and can be used to inspire scientists, managers, and the public toward environmental action.

AB  - EU countries are required to perform an assessment of all freshwater habitats larger than 50 ha by 2015 to meet the requirements set by the Water Framework Directive (2000). To achieve this, an array of indicators and multimetric indices has been developed to monitor European waters. In general, these indicators are developed for large water bodies, while they are still largely lacking for smaller wetlands. This is in contrast with the conservation value, valuable ecosystem services and the often unique biodiversity of these systems, and the fact that like large (>50 ha) wetlands they are also covered by the Ramsar Convention. In (semi) and regions, such as the Mediterranean basin, small water bodies are often of a temporary nature, are abundant and provide an important source of water for the local people, their livestock and agriculture. The quantity and quality of temporary wetlands are, however, decreasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Although some monitoring techniques were recently proposed, there is still an urgent need for a consistent policy and a user friendly set of monitoring tools for temporary wetlands that can be applied in different regions. In the following review, we present a whole range of indicators used to monitor different types of freshwater habitats, and discuss how some of these methods could be applied to temporary wetlands. Finally, we formulate some recommendations for temporary wetland monitoring and conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA  - English
KW  - TAOISM
AB  - The concepts dao and de in the Daodejing may be evoked to support a distinctive and plausible account of environmental holism. Dao refers to the totality of particulars, including the relations that hold between them, and the respective roles and functions of each within the whole. De refers to the distinctiveness of each particular, realized meaningfully only within the context of its interdependence with others, and its situatedness within the whole. Together, dao and de provide support for an ethical holism that avoids sacrificing individuals for the sake of the whole, The integrity and stability of the whole are important not because the whole is an end-in-itself but because those conditions assist in preserving the well-being of the constituent parts. In other words, the ethical holism supported in the Daodejing does not present individuals and wholes in mutually exclusive terms, but sees them in symbiotic relation, allowing for events to be mutually beneficial, or mutually obstructive, to both. In addition, two other Daoist concepts, wuwei (non-action) and ziran (spontaneity), provide further support for this construction of holism. If the distinctiveness of particular individuals is valued, then unilateral or reductive norms which obliterate such individuality are inappropriate. In this regard, the methodology of wuwei allows for the idea of individuals developing spontaneously in relation to others. According to this view of holism, individuals manifest and realize their integrity in relation to others in the environmental context, achieving an outcome that is maximally co-possible within those limits, rather than one that is maximally beneficial only for particular individuals.

AB  - In assessing the ecological conditions and classification of urban soils, data about soil biota should be taken into account. The environment of urban territories is characterized by significant changes compared to their surrounding environments. It is established that the algal flora of urban soils lose their zonal features and features associated with the edification influence of higher plants. Specific biotopes with a definite species structure are formed in urboecosystems. Fifty 50 algae species have been recorded in the soils of the Henichesk urboecosystems (Kherson region, Ukraine): Cyanoprocaryota - 21, Chlorophyta - 13, Charophyta - 2, Eustigmatophyta - 1, Xanthophyta - 11, Bacillariophyta - 2. Among dominant and subdominant species were Cyanoprocaryota and Chlorophyta. The other phyla were represented by Klebsormidium dissectum, K. flaccidum, Hantzschia amphioxys, Eustigmatos magnus, Botrydiopsis eriensis. Compared with the surrounding environment, the urbanized flora of Henichesk has a low species richness, and is characterized by prevalence of Cyanoprocaryota and Chlorophyta species. The coefficient that takes into account the percentage of preservation of species richness in a particular urban area compared to the background indicators of species richness can be used to evaluate the urban transformation of soil biota. The degree of degradatory changes in the composition of living organisms and the direction of these changes depends on the specificity and intensity of exploitation of the territory of the urban ecosystem. The most diverse composition of algae species within the the city of Henichesk was noted in the recreational, residential, and transport zones, in comparison with the industrial zone and the zone of special use. Different functional areas of the city are distinguished not only by the algae species richness, but also by the composition of dominants. Among the dominants and subdominants of the recreational and transport zones were species of different phyla. The dominants and subdominants of the residential and industrial zones were Cyanoprocaryota species, in the zone of special use - representatives of Chlorophyta. The distribution of species richness of algae along the soil profile in the city acquires an atypical character. The species richness increases not in the most superficial layers of soil, but in the lower, aphotic parts of the soil profile. The soil biota, on the one hand, depends on the ecological conditions of soil, and on the other as a result of its life activity, changes the ecological functions of the soil, strengthening or weakening them. The reduction in the species richness of the soil algae of the urboecosystem Henichesk shows the limitations of ecological functions of urban soils. It is established that changes in the composition of algae in soils of urban ecosystems are one of the indicators of the presence and severity of transformation processes. These processes occur with the soil biota and soil as a whole under the conditions of urban ecosystems and can be used as indicators in the environmental assessment of urban soils, in the development and subsequent examination of ways to reduce negative expression of urbanization.

AB  - As nature-based tourism grows, its impacts on aquatic ecosystems follow, requiring effective management techniques to conserve river integrity. Nevertheless, strong indicators of tourism impacts are scarce and have seldom been studied for many species. This study evaluated whether microhabitat use and activity period of a variety of fish species are effective for assessing tourism impacts in a headwater stream in which recreation (snorkelling) occurs. Microhabitat use and activity period of the most representative fish were observed in river stretches used for recreation and compared with reference stretches. Fish neither altered microhabitat use nor became more cryptic owing to tourism, maybe because they have evolved to occupy a certain microhabitat and cannot inhabit others, thus making habitat use a poor indicator of tourism impact. Fish respond to the presence of tourists by changing the promptness to begin and end activity, making the time of activity a good indicator of tourism impact, which can be easily assessed by tourism managers or government agencies and used to control the environmental impact of recreation involving fish. It is suggested that aquatic conservation protocols should include local indicators, and that behavioural indicators (activity period) might be more relevant than ecological indicators (microhabitat use) for early recognition of tourism impacts. These findings can be extended to the conservation of other fish communities subject to intensive tourism and with a strong circadian rhythm, such as coral reef fishes.

TI  - Scavenging Rate Ecoassay: A Potential Indicator of Estuary Condition
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CONSUMPTION
AB  - Monitoring of estuary condition is essential due to the highly productive and often intensely impacted nature of these ecosystems. Assessment of the physico-chemical condition of estuaries is expensive and difficult due to naturally fluctuating water quality and biota. Assessing the vigour of ecosystem processes is an alternative method with potential to overcome much of the variability associated with physico-chemical measures. Indicators of estuary condition should have small spatial and temporal variability, have a predictable response to perturbation and be ecologically relevant. Here, we present tests of the first criterion, the spatio-temporal variability of a potential ecoassay measuring the rate of scavenging in estuaries. We hypothesised that the proposed scavenging ecoassay would not vary significantly among A) sites in an estuary, B) trips separated by weeks, or C) days in a trip. Because not all habitats are present in all estuaries, this test was undertaken in two habitats. When conducted over bare substrate there were occasional significant differences, but no discernible patterns, within levels of the experiment. When conducted over vegetated substrate, days within a trip did not vary significantly, but later trips experienced greater scavenging. This scavenging ecoassay shows potential as a tool for assessing the condition of estuarine ecosystems, and further exploration of this protocol is warranted by implementation in estuaries across a gradient of anthropogenic stress.

AB  - The management of the water resources is an important issue in the countries around the world because it depends on many variables. Prior to the growing environmental awareness, flow rate and regime are critical components of water supply, water quality, and the ecological integrity of river systems. Environmental flow may be described as the required stream flow quantity to support the ecological activity in a river system. While environmental flow assessment provides protection and use balance over the water resources and it also reduces the natural and artificial effects that caused of deterioration of the natural condition of the rivers. There are only a few environmental flow assessment studies in Turkey. In this paper, daily flow data has been used to determine the flow regimes in order to have some idea about the environmental flow. For this purpose, common methods such as original Tennant method, modified Tennant method, wetted perimeter method, 7Q10 and Q95 have been examined. Daily flow data has been obtained from three gauging stations located in Great Menderes Basin. The first one (07-30) is unregulated, the second is regulated (07-04) and the third one is indirectly regulated (07-71) gauging stations. As a result of this study, particular methods have more reliability and might be more appropriate for each case. The modified Tennant method could be selected as the most practical method for the measured data of flow rates in unregulated gauging station. Q95 method can be used for the other two stations.

AB  - A multi-level coastal wetland assessment strategy was applied to wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to evaluate the feasibility of this approach for a broad national scale wetland condition assessment (US Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetlands Condition Assessment). Landscape-scale assessment indicators (tier 1) were developed and applied at the sub-watershed (12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC)) level within the GOM coastal wetland sample frame with scores calculated using land-use maps and geographic information system. Rapid assessment protocols (tier 2), using a combination of data analysis and field work, evaluated metrics associated with landscape context, hydrology, physical structure, and biological structure. Intensive site monitoring (tier 3) included measures of soil chemistry and composition, water column and pore-water chemistry, and dominant macrophyte community composition and tissue chemistry. Relationships within and among assessment levels were evaluated using multivariate analyses with few significant correlations found. More detailed measures of hydrology, soils, and macrophyte species composition from sites across a known condition gradient, in conjunction with validation of standardized rapid assessment method, may be necessary to fully characterize coastal wetlands across the region.

AB  - The identification of biological reference conditions specific to each type of water body is essential for the development of sound biological indicators and criteria. The purpose of the present study was to establish the reference conditions of each stream type sampled in southern Quebec (Canada) using benthic diatoms and environmental variables characterizing streams and watersheds. First, stream reaches were classified as a function of their natural watershed and habitat characteristics. Second, diatom communities were classified based solely on taxa abundance data. Resulting groups were graphically presented on ordinations to interpret, a posteriori, the environmental gradients associated with diatom groups and to identify the diatom communities representing the reference conditions of each of the stream reach groups. A final classification based solely on diatom reference communities found pH and conductivity to be the main discriminating factors, regardless of ecoregion and stream type. Although a specific diatom reference community may be identified for each stream group, our results suggest that many of these communities exhibit strong similarities. Only two reference communities may therefore be used, one for circumneutral conditions and one for alkaline conditions. These reference communities represent the baseline for biocriteria development.

AB  - Diatoms are widely recognised as potentially useful biological indicators, and are increasingly incorporated into water quality monitoring in North America and Europe. Despite their potential there have been no diatom-based indices developed for New Zealand. Overseas, diatoms have been shown to be especially useful in the monitoring of acid mine drainage (AMD). We sampled diatoms from 39 streams along an AMD gradient on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. We developed two indices from relative abundance data; a single biotic index (pHBI) and a multimetric index (Diatom Mine Pollution Score [DMPS]). Both indices were able to categorise streams as circum-neutral, moderately or severely impacted by AMD. However, neither index was able to differentiate naturally acidic streams (pH 4.0-5.7) from those moderately impacted by AMD. Diatom species responded to changes in acidity but were less affected by metals. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential usefulness of diatoms in monitoring the impacts of AMD, specifically acidity, in New Zealand streams.

AB  - The key to coping with global warming is reconstructing energy governance from carbon-based to sustainable resources. Offshore energy sources, such as offshore wind turbines, are promising alternatives. However, the abnormal climate is a potential threat to the safety of offshore structures because construction guidelines cannot embrace climate outliers. A cosine similarity-based maintenance strategy may be a possible solution for managing and mitigating these risks. However, a study reporting its application to an actual field structure has not yet been reported. Thus, as an initial study, this study investigated whether the technique is applicable or whether it has limitations in the real field using an actual example, the Gageocho Ocean Research Station. Consequently, it was found that damage can only be detected correctly if the damage states are very similar to the comparison target database. Therefore, the high accuracy of natural frequencies, including environmental effects, should be ensured. Specifically, damage scenarios must be carefully designed, and an alternative is to devise more efficient techniques that can compensate for the present procedure.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates have been used around the world as indicators of the biological quality of freshwater habitats. Because of the intensive deterioration of waterbodies as a result of different land uses, indicators are used for environmental monitoring, control and remediation. The aim of this study was to assess (1) the sensitivity of taxonomical metrics and (2) functional traits to select the most appropriate for evaluating environmental impacts on rivers with high salinity and (3) to propose a multimetric index based on the selected metrics. Information from a preexisting database on twenty-eight sites in the Salado River basin (Argentina) was used. One hundred and twenty-three metrics were calculated to assess sensitivity to different land uses along the gradient of habitat condition, from low-disturbed (reference), to medium-disturbed (agricultural and industrial) and high-disturbed (agricultural, industrial and urban). This gradient was defined by available information in original articles and by quantifying the percentage of the different land uses. Filtering collectors (%), Gathering collectors (%), Ostracoda density, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri/Total density, Naididae (%), Tubifex/Total density and Pristina/Total density were the metrics that distinguished the different land uses along the gradient of habitat condition. These metrics were used to propose a macroinvertebrate multimetric index in saline rivers: Index of Benthic Invertebrates in Saline Rivers (IBIS). Thus, this study provides a useful tool for management and monitoring of saline rivers and diagnoses of salinized environments.

AB  - Phytoplankton bioindicators were used to assess environmental conditions in urban aquatic systems in a large Canadian city. Sampling was conducted during summers 2010 and 2011 in 20 urban waterbodies on the Island of Montreal (Quebec, Canada). We evaluated 4 indicators: (1) fluorometric estimates of the chlorophyll concentration of the total phytoplankton and of 4 spectral groups, (2) species richness, and (3) biovolumes of taxonomic and (4) functional groups of the microphytoplankton. We assessed how these indicators changed among types of urban waterbodies and determined the limnological features and/or management practices driving their spatial variation. Principal component analysis captured 48% of total environmental heterogeneity, and K-means clustering analyses defined 5 relevant types of waterbodies. Overall, 96 microphytoplankton species (gamma diversity) were recorded, and species richness (alpha diversity) per waterbody varied from 1 to 27. Chlorophyll concentration of the total phytoplankton and the green algae spectral group, as well as the total biovolume of microphytoplankton, dinophytes, and of 2 functional groups (large flagellates, large colonies of green algae, and cyanobacteria) differed among waterbody types. Phytoplankton indicators based on in situ fluorometry and microphytoplankton biovolume of functional and taxonomic groups were fairly coherent and showed potential for monitoring. Implications of our findings are discussed in light of guiding future management practices to sustain biodiversity, ecological integrity, and water quality of urban waterbodies.

AB  - This study investigated the physiological response of the epiphytic lichen Evernia prunastri to ecologically relevant concentrations of nitrogen compounds. Lichen samples were sprayed for 4 weeks either with water or 50, 150 and 500 mu M NH4Cl. The integrity of cell membranes and chlorophyll a fluorescence emission (F-V/F-M and PIABS) were analyzed. No membrane damage occurred after the exposure period. F-V/F-M, a classical fluorescence indicator, decreased during the second week of treatment with 500 mu M NH4Cl and the third week with 50 and 150 mu M NH4Cl. PIABS, an overall index of the photosynthetic performance, was more sensitive and decreased already during the first week with 500 mu M NH4Cl and the second week with 150 mu M NH4Cl. Since E. prunastri has been exposed to ammonium loads corresponding to real environmental conditions, these findings open the way to an effective use of this species as early indicators of environmental nitrogen excess.

AB  - The Lake Kinneret watershed (LKW) is an important freshwater resource in Israel, providing a myriad of water-dependent ecosystem services. Presently, environmental monitoring of the LKW is focused mainly on water quality and quantity parameters, but neglects biology. To fill this gap, a reference-based biological monitoring scheme is being developed. This approach requires a description of stream types, i.e. clusters of streams that naturally share similar environmental conditions, to help identify type-specific reference conditions and their associated communities. Here, we present the first stream typology for the entire LKW. Using a compilation of data layers of regional climate (precipitation and air temperature), local geology (volcanic, carbonic, and organic), and geomorphology (elevation, size, and slope), we have differentiated altogether nine stream types: small and mid-sized basaltic streams (41.6 and 2% of the entire catchment, respectively), small and mid-sized calcareous streams (36.4 and 2.9%), small organic streams (6.8%), and montane streams (6.5%). In addition, due to its size, the Jordan River is divided into three section-types: the karstic upper Jordan (6.3 km), the organic section of the Hula Valley (HV) (13.1 km), and the basaltic canyon-like section (16.9 km that stretches between the HV and the Lake Kinneret). Although Israel is not obligated to comply with the EU Water Framework Directive, this work constitutes an important step towards the development of the first bioassessment scheme for the LKW.

AB  - Over 2000 coastal wetland complexes have been identified in the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed, each providing critical habitat for numerous aquatic and terrestrial species. Research has shown there is a direct link between anthropogenic activities (urbanization and agricultural development) and deterioration in wetland health in terms of water quality and biotic integrity. In this study, we evaluate coastal marshes throughout the Great Lakes basin using a suite of published ecological indices developed specifically for coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes (Water Quality Index (WQI). Wetland Macrophyte Index (WMI), and the Wetland Fish Index (WFI(Basin))). We surveyed 181 wetlands, including 19 in Lake Superior (11%), 11 in Lake Michigan (6%), 13 in Lake Huron (7%), 92 in Georgian Bay and the North Channel (51%), 18 in Lake Erie (10%), and 28 in Lake Ontario (15%), over a 13 year period (1995-2008). Water quality parameters were measured at every site, while paired fyke nets were used to assess the fish community (132 sites) and macrophytes were surveyed and identified to species (174 sites); all of this information was used to calculate the associated index scores. One-way ANOVA results showed that there were significant differences in wetland quality among lakes. According to the WQI, we found that over 50% of marshes in Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario were in degraded condition, while over 70% of marshes in Lakes Superior, Huron, and Georgian Bay were minimally impacted. Georgian Bay had the highest proportion of wetlands in very good and excellent condition and least number of wetlands in a degraded state. The WMI and WFI showed similar results. This is the largest bi-national database of coastal wetlands and the first study to provide a snapshot of the quality of coastal habitats within the Great Lakes basin. We recommend this information be used to guide conservation and restoration efforts within the Laurentian Great Lakes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A mechanistic understanding of the effects of nutrient enrichment in lotic systems has been advanced over the last two decades such that identification of management thresholds for the prevention of eutrophication is now possible. This study describes relationships among primary nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), benthic chlorophyll a concentrations, daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and the condition of macroinvertebrate and fish communities in small rivers and streams in Ohio, USA. Clear associations between nutrients, secondary response indicators (i.e., benthic chlorophyll and DO), and biological condition were found, and change points between the various indicators were identified for use in water quality criteria for nutrients in small rivers and streams (< 1300 km(2)). A change point in benthic chlorophyll a density was detected at an inorganic nitrogen concentration of 0.435 mg/l (+/- 0.599 SD), and a total phosphorus (TP) concentration of 0.038 mg/l (+/- 0.085 SD). Daily variation in DO concentration was significantly related to benthic chlorophyll concentration and canopy cover, and a change point in 24-h DO concentration range was detected at a benthic chlorophyll level of 182 mg/m(2). The condition of macroinvertebrate communities was related to benthic chlorophyll concentration and both minimum and 24-h range of DO concentration. The condition of fish communities was best explained by habitat quality. The thresholds found in relationships between the stressor and the response variables, when interpreted in light of the uncertainty surrounding individual change points, may now serve as a framework for nutrient criteria in water quality standards.

AB  - This study is focused on detecting vegetation stress in natural and seminatural riparian wetland ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems play an important role at the local and global scale. They provide various ecosystem services as long as they are in good condition. The global climate change influences a local environment, in which wetlands health become an indicator of drought conditions. Persisting adverse conditions might lead to irreversible changes in these precious ecosystems. Hence, modern methods for the monitoring of these ecosystems are required to be developed. In the scope of this study, based on basic meteorological elements (air temperature and humidity) and canopy temperature from two different platforms (meteorological tower and Landsat-8 satellite), crop water stress index (CWSI) was proposed for riparian wetland habitats and wet meadows monitoring. The study was conducted in the Upper Biebrza Basin (NE, Poland). As a first step, CWSI was calculated based on meteorological measurements and compared with CWSI calculated for surrounding Landsat-8 pixels covered by the same land-use type as one being in the tower sensor field of view. CWSI from both sensors were in significant agreement. In the second step of the analysis, CWSI and selected optical indices were calculated for a longer period based on satellite data. Those indices were compared with test if they indicate the same conditions, or if their indications are inconsistent. Results show that CWSI and optical indices indicate different plant stress factors. Hence, for proper wetlands condition assessment, still more research is required to properly assess their conditions and its causes.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities may affect wild animal populations. Among them, amphibians are particularly sensitive to environmental change. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health condition of Rhinella fernandezae populations at three sites in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina: a site inside a natural reserve (S1), a site surrounded mainly by industrial activities (S2) and a site surrounded principally by agriculture (S3). Sex and body condition (health status indicators), and micronuclei frequency (genotoxicity biomarker) of R. fernandezae adults were recorded to determine the health status of the local populations. Water samples were also analyzed for metals and pesticides to identify potential correlations with R. fernandezae malformations. Metals and pes-ticides were detected in the water samples of all three sites, with Al, Cu and Se exceeding the relevant limits for the protection of aquatic life. S1 had the highest overall environmental quality, and S2 had the greatest variety of pesticides. Individuals from S3 had significantly higher micronuclei frequency and females from S3 significantly lower body condition than females from S1, while females from S2 were significantly smaller than those from S1. Worst amphibian-based biological quality was assessed for S3, followed by S2 and S1. The low health status -fitness of females from the impacted sites (especially of the agriculture-surrounded S3 site), indicated by the low body condition and the high micronuclei frequency, may compromise the long-term health of the local am-phibian populations. We conclude that action needs to be taken towards the long-term conservation of local amphibian populations from human-induced ecosystem degradation.

AB  - Beaches are landscapes valued greatly by society that, when left intact, support both ecological processes and sustainable use. In Southeast Florida, alteration of beaches for human activities has resulted in substantial loss of naturally functioning beach habitat and reduced biological diversity. Of particular importance is the impact on beach ecosystems by the nearby urban environment. Beaches are dynamic ecosystems that require space to respond to natural or anthropogenic drivers and pressures. In Southeast Florida urban development has restricted or eliminated the ability of most beaches to react in a manner that conserves the natural beach ecosystem. The frequent result has been oceanfront areas with little or no intact habitat and limited opportunities for restoration, though disturbed beaches may still provide opportunities for ocean access, recreation, and other socioeconomic benefits in highly urbanized areas. In this study we present a framework for selecting relevant ecosystem and human dimension indicators for the beaches of Southeast Florida based on a conceptual ecosystem model. To capture the level of beach disturbance relatively pristine beaches and heavily altered beaches are endpoints in a continuum of beach development. Across this continuum nine indicators were developed to quantify beach condition. For ecosystem and human dimension assessment purposes, beaches were placed in one of two overarching categories: undeveloped to relatively undeveloped, or developed to highly developed. Nine selected indicators are then assessed as good (3), fair (2), or poor (1). The indicator scores are then summed to produce a total condition score for a particular beach. This simple 'stop-light' method is applicable even when there are limited data and provides a useful relative determination of ecosystem condition. Case studies employing this methodology are presented for three Southeast Florida beaches ranging from mostly natural to highly developed condition.
   The indicators directly address both ecosystem and human dimension goals to maintain healthy, sustainable, and useable beaches and shorelines in Southeast Florida. They balance the ecological benefit of remaining natural beaches with the societal benefit of recreational opportunities and access for a beach that can no longer sustain a suitable ecosystem. Each indicator is interpreted in the context of the trade-offs among multiple ecosystem and human dimension services provided by most beaches in Southeast Florida. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify and classify the lichens; determine the diversity index and richness of lichens. A total of 36 species belonging to six genera under three families was identified. Lichen species were mostly found at moderate high altitudinal range with an elevation of 1,131 meters above sea level and open areas where they received adequate sunlight with high moisture and humidity contents. Diversity, composition and altitudinal distribution of lichens was evaluated in Mt. Kitanglad Range, Kaatauan, Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines a wet forest type forest. The maximum species richness was reported on Usnea rubicunda Stirt. The abiotic factors were shown to be essential in adapting the relative abundance of lichens for it is capable to survive in the range of light levels, it appears that drier and lighter conditions competitively favored. Additionally, lichen diversity is dependent on the climatic and environmental conditions which makes them as an excellent biological indicators of ecosystem changes in the forests of Mindanao Island, Philippines.

AB  - There is a growing movement in government, environmental non -governmental organizations and the private sector to include ecosystem services in decision making. Adding ecosystem services into assessments implies measuring how much a change in ecological conditions affects people, social benefit, or value to society. Despite consensus around the general merit of accounting for ecosystem services, systematic guidance on what to measure and how is lacking. Current ecosystem services assessments often resort to biophysical proxies (e.g., area of wetland in a floodplain) or even disregard services that seem difficult to measure. Valuation, an important tool for assessing trade-offs and comparing outcomes, is also frequently omitted due to lack of data on social preferences, lack of expertise with valuation methods, or mistrust of valuation methods for non-market services.
   To address these shortcomings, we propose the use of a new type of indicator that explicitly reflects an ecosystem's capacity to provide benefits to society, ensuring that ecosystem services assessments measure outcomes that are demonstrably and directly relevant to human welfare. We call these Benefit-relevant indicators (BRIs) and describe a process for developing them using causal chains that link management decisions through ecological responses to effects on human well-being. BRIs identify what is valued and by whom, but stop short of valuation. A BRI for the ability of wetlands to ameliorate flooding would connect measures of the quantity and quality of wetland in a floodplain, as affected by wetlands management decisions, to the number of people or properties downstream that are vulnerable to flooding. BRIs can support monetary or non-monetary valuation, but are particularly useful when valuation will not be conducted; in such cases they serve as stand-alone measures of "what is valued" by particular beneficiaries. BRIs are valid measures of ecosystem services in that they are directly linked to human well-being. Flexibility in the development of BRIs helps to ensure that they are broadly applicable across practitioner and stakeholder communities and decision contexts.

AB  - Environmental water management is increasingly used to restore riverine, wetland and floodplain ecosystems and requires an understanding of what the flow regime or restoration objectives are, why these objectives are being targeted and how outcomes will be evaluated. This perspective paper focuses on non-woody vegetation, an important component of river-floodplain ecosystems and a targeted outcome for many environmental flow management programs, such as the Basin wide environmental watering strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Effective management of non-woody vegetation using environmental water requires identifying a suite of measurable condition outcomes (the "what"), understanding how these relate to broader functions and values (the "why") and developing clear cause-and-effect relationships between management and outcomes (the "how"). A critical component of this process is to characterise what constitutes management success, which requires reimagining current definitions of condition to better incorporate dynamic functions and diverse values. We identify the need to characterise condition in a structured framework using both ecological data and societal values. This approach will not only help inform the development of benchmarks, watering objectives and monitoring metrics, but will also facilitate engagement by a broader spectrum of the community with the management and outcomes of environmental watering.

AB  - To ensure indicators of ecosystem health are integrated into environmental decision-making, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive framework for indicator selection and use. The same framework can also be used to evaluate the utility of any given indicator. The Atlantic Slope Consortium (ASC) has developed such a framework, based upon three primary elements: 1) The specific questions to be answered (the type of indicator), recognizing the following types of questions/indicators: Condition assessment: snapshot of the current state of the system; Stressor diagnosis: identification of causative factors of condition; Communication to the public: encouraging comprehension of condition in its most elementary or integrated form; Futures assessment: estimating the probable trajectory of condition, or assessing the vulnerability of any system to a stochastic event; Evaluation: a subset of condition indicators that evaluate the effectiveness of management actions. 2) The spatial and/or temporal scale of the issue being addressed (the spatial/temporal scale over which the indicator is valid). 3) The context of the question, using categories of surrounding land use as surrogates for social choices. A Fish Community Index (FCI) developed for the ASC will provide an example of utilizing the framework to select an indicator, as well as using the framework to judge the utility of the indicator.

AB  - Urban parks are important places for the conservation of biodiversity within cities but their vegetation is affected by a number of anthropogenic stressors This study took an exploratory approach to examining the influence of management land-use legacy fragmentation-related factors and natural disturbance (by a hurricane) on compositional and structural indicators of vegetation within urban parks of the Halifax Regional Municipality Nova Scotia Canada The study sites (each a particular park) were selected using a stratified random sampling procedure based on the size of the parks Plots of 10 m x 10 m were randomly distributed throughout the sites and used to quantify plant composition forest structural attributes and environmental variables Variation in composition was described using species and plant functional groups which were identified by combining information on growth form life history and biogeographical status Plant communities within the parks varied greatly in character and ranged from remnants of natural forest dominated by native species to structurally simple anthropogenic habitats comprised mostly of exotics Historical use and edge influences (from trails and stand boundaries) were significantly associated with variation in vegetative composition within semi-natural forests particularly reflecting a higher prominence of exotic taxa The intensity of hurricane disturbance also had a strong influence on affected communities but was not found to promote exotics Results of this study suggest ways to direct the design and management of urban parks in ways that help conserve native biodiversity and thereby enhance their ecological integrity (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - A biomonitoring protocol based on macroinvertebrates was applied to the estuaries of the rivers Alfeios and Pineios (Greece) in order to meet with the framework set by the WFD for the protection of waters. Seven metrics based on taxa richness and diversity were integrated in the calculation of the environmental assessment. Its results were in agreement to those obtained by the physicochemical parameters. The protocol used was easy to handle and possibly applicable to different geographical areas. However its intercalibration with other proposed methodologies within the European member states is suggested.

AB  - The 'normative definitions' of ecological water quality classes given by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) are narrative descriptions of the conditions present in water bodies of different qualities relative to reference conditions found in unimpacted sites. In order to fill these descriptions with a more solid content, the definitions have been a subject of intensive development of quantitative methodologies for ecological status assessment as well as for rules and criteria for setting of reference conditions and ecological status boundaries for classification of water bodies. In this article, we recall the basic principles of the WFD that sometimes have been overlooked and point out some gaps remained and problems arisen during the ongoing implementation of the directive. Defining type-specific reference conditions for water bodies and finding biological metrics that sensitively reflect only the anthropogenic deviations from those conditions are the biggest challenges that the ecological status assessment faces. So far, there is no guarantee that reference conditions are comparable across EU Member States due to a lack of common criteria, which need still to be elaborated. Defining site-specific reference conditions instead of type specific is a novel approach that allows for minimizing uncertainties introduced by applying broad types. Search for new metrics has led to a real boom of multimetric indices which ought to be the adequate tool to measure the multiple human impairments but which should pass a thorough check before being included in monitoring programs. Curiously, some biological indices constructed as surrogates for chemistry (especially nutrients) start 'living their own life' and continue indicating the disturbance when the controlling factors change. This shows the obvious advantage of biological indicators against chemical ones. New challenges to WFD implementation are brought about by the need to consider the effects of alien species and climate change in the assessment framework, and by the nonlinear dose-response relationships dominating in biological systems. Attempts to diminish uncertainties in quality assessment have become a new labour-intensive field for researchers.

AB  - Phytometers are indicator transplants that provide information on site conditions based on plant survival, growth and reproduction. Since this is a relatively new approach, standards for its implementation remain to be defined, for example, during peatland restoration. Peatland restoration frequently aims at recovering characteristic communities, and a key attribute of successfully restored ecosystems is their capacity to sustain viable populations of target species. When not actively introduced, these species are expected to establish on their own after improving site conditions, for example by rewetting. Assessments to determine whether this goal is met require the long-term monitoring of species' presence, whereas the underlying causes of these observations, i.e. site or dispersal limitation, often remain unknown. Using phytometers within ecological restoration helps addressing this question. The goal of this study is to compare the responses of several species and traits to environmental conditions in restored peatlands. Three target species (Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum, Vaccinium oxycoccos) were planted in restored montane peatlands in central Germany, while in a greenhouse experiment, the same species were grown on peat from the field sites and exposed to two water levels. Several plant traits were measured and compared with variation in light, water and soil conditions. The response to habitat conditions was species-specific, indicating that the use of different phytometers increases the reliability of monitoring. Survival and growth traits were suitable to assess a wide range of abiotic conditions, while differences in reproductive output were more time-consuming to measure. Survival provided the most conclusive results for species sensitive to stressful habitat conditions. Biomass and other size metrics of the phytometers, as well as growth and reproductive traits were partly redundant. Thus, we suggest recording survival and biomass and use non-destructive growth measurements for repeated assessments, while the choice of the most suitable size trait should depend on the growth form. Our study stresses the potential of phytometers for monitoring the restoration outcome, while highlighting the importance of species and trait selection.

AB  - Site-specific (precision) management (SSM) has potential for application in managing nematodes and soil conditions in environmentally meaningful ways. Successful application of SSM, however, may be dependent on how agronomically, biologically, and ecologically integrated the plan in question is. Otherwise, SSM risks falling into the "Tried but did not last" category. With this background and in addition to describing the concepts and principles of SSM, this presentation discusses the following interrelated points: (1) Case studies of spatio-temporal analysis of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) infestations, soil conditions and crop yield in managed ecosystems. Among the critical factors to an accurate and sustained application of SSM are understanding (i) the temporal structure and (ii) the spatial structure of the attribute in question, and (iii) establishing cause-and-effect relationships in the prevailing conditions. New approaches to temporal structure analysis when balancing the purpose of SSM application and nematode biology (as it relates to life stages), population density in soil and root tissue (to determine threshold), and damage functions (physiological stress of the plant during the growing season) are outlined. (2) Application of the concept of fertiliser use efficiency (FUE) to identify soil conditions when managing soil fertility. Defined as increase in host productivity and/or decrease in plant-parasitic nematode population density in response to a given fertiliser treatment, the FUE model recognizes variable responses and identifies four categories of interactions necessary for integrated management decision-making options that account for agronomic, economic, ecological and environmental and pest management issues. (3) Approaches to changing soil conditions in agro-biologically integrated ways. By incorporating nematode community structure (an excellent indicator of soil bio-ecological changes), soil nutrient amendments and crop yield, we have described a modification of the FUE model to identify and monitor changes in soil conditions, thereby creating the necessary bridges to disciplinary and cross-disciplinary gaps and interactions.

AB  - Seagrasses are marine ecosystem engineers that are currently declining in abundance at an alarming rate due to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances in ecological niches. Despite reports on the morphological and physiological adaptations of seagrasses to extreme environments, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying photo-acclimation, and/or tolerance in these marine plants. This study applies the two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (2D-IEF) proteomics approach to identify photo-acclimation/tolerance proteins in the marine seagrass Zostera muelleri. For this, Z. muelleri was exposed for 10 days in laboratory mesocosms to saturating (control, 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), super-saturating (SSL, 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), and limited light (LL, 20 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) irradiance conditions. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, 93 and 40 protein spots were differentially regulated under SSL and LL conditions, respectively, when compared to the control. In contrast to the LL condition, Z. muelleri robustly tolerated super-saturation light than control conditions, evidenced by their higher relative maximum electron transport rate and minimum saturating irradiance values. Proteomic analyses revealed up-regulation and/or appearances of proteins belonging to the Calvin-Benson and Krebs cycle, glycolysis, the glycine cleavage system of photorespiration, and the antioxidant system. These proteins, together with those from the inter-connected glutamate-proline-GABA pathway, shaped Z. muelleri photosynthesis and growth under SSL conditions. In contrast, the LL condition negatively impacted the metabolic activities of Z. muelleri by down-regulating key metabolic enzymes for photosynthesis and the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids, which is consistent with the observation with lower photosynthetic performance under LL condition. This study provides novel insights into the underlying molecular photo-acclimation mechanisms in Z. muelleri, in addition to identifying protein-based biomarkers that could be used as early indicators to detect acute/chronic light stress in seagrasses to monitor seagrass health.

AB  - There is a growing need to understand relationships between agricultural intensification and global change. Monitoring solutions, however, often do not include pollinator communities that are of importance to ecosystem integrity. Here, we put forth the honey bee as an economical and broadly available bioindicator that can be used to assess and track changes in the quality of agricultural ecosystems. We detail a variety of simple, low-cost procedures that can be deployed within honey bee hives to gain generalizable information about ecosystem quality at multiple scales, and discuss the potential of the honey bee system in both environmental and ecological bioindication.

AB  - It is important to protect forest and grassland ecosystems because they are ecologically rich and provide numerous ecosystem services. Upscaling monitoring from local to global scale is imperative in reaching this goal. The SDG Agenda does not include indicators that directly quantify ecosystem health. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can bridge the gap for large-scale ecosystem health assessment. We systematically reviewed field-based and remote-based measures of ecosystem health for forests and grasslands, identified the most important ones and provided an overview on remote sensing and GIS-based measures. We included 163 English language studies within terrestrial non-tropical biomes and used a pre-defined classification system to extract ecological stressors and attributes, collected corresponding indicators, measures, and proxy values. We found that the main ecological attributes of each ecosystem contribute differently in the literature, and that almost half of the examined studies used remote sensing to estimate indicators. The major stressor for forests was "climate change", followed by "insect infestation"; for grasslands it was "grazing", followed by "climate change". "Biotic interactions, composition, and structure" was the most important ecological attribute for both ecosystems. "Fire disturbance" was the second most important for forests, while for grasslands it was "soil chemistry and structure". Less than a fifth of studies used vegetation indices; NDVI was the most common. There are monitoring inconsistencies from the broad range of indicators and measures. Therefore, we recommend a standardized field, GIS, and remote sensing-based approach to monitor ecosystem health and integrity and facilitate land managers and policy-makers.

AB  - The extensive use of synthetic chemicals for pest control is recognized as a major threat to ecosystem integrity and the realization of low-carbon agriculture. There have been many studies of agrochemical reduction technologies, but little work to date has been done to achieve a combined reduction of chemical pesticides and chemical fertilizers. This fact has led us to the conception of assessment methodologies and the establishment of a relevant ecological model. A significant challenge to the development of assessment methodologies is agro-ecosystem complexity. In this study, we explain the agro-ecosystem as one composed of various social, economic and natural factors that can be defined using a comprehensive positive/negative effect evaluation index system, which is based on fuzzy theory and can be used to assess combinations of technologies for reduced use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in cauliflower fields. On this basis, a technology using 14% calcium superphosphate 750 kg hm(-2), 46% urea 825 kg hm(-2), 12% granular boron fertilizer 4.5 kg hm(-2), active pesticides 3.09 kg hm(-2) and hanging sex pheromone lure on the watermelon-cauliflower rotation mode resulted in the largest index evaluation value (0.3795) and was considered the best combined reduction technology in Chongming Eco-island, Shanghai of China. The results of our study should be of interest to policy makers and environmental managers who seek to realize low-carbon agriculture and to farmers who seek to optimize application technology in practice.

AB  - Panels of experts from the Society for Range Management and the National Research Council proposed that status of rangeland ecosystems could be ascertained by evaluating an ecological site's potential to conserve soil resources and by a series of indicators for ecosystem processes and site stability. Using these recommendations as a starting point, we developed a rapid, qualitative method for assessing a moment-in-time status of rangelands. Evaluators rate 17 indicators to assess 3 ecosystem attributes (soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity) for a given location. Indicators include rills, water flow patterns, pedestals and terracettes, bare ground, gullies, wind scour and depositional areas, litter movement, soil resistance to erosion, soil surface loss or degradation, plant composition relative to infiltration, soil compaction, plant functional/structural groups, plant mortality, litter amount, annual production, invasive plants, and reproductive capability. In this paper, we detail the development and evolution of the technique and introduce a modified ecological reference worksheet that documents the expected presence and amount of each indicator on the ecological site. In addition, we review the intended applications for this technique and clarify the differences between assessment and monitoring that lead us to recommend this technique be used for moment-in-time assessments and not be used for temporal monitoring of rangeland status. Lastly, we propose a mechanism for adapting and modifying this technique to reflect improvements in understanding of ecosystem processes. We support the need for quantitative measures for monitoring rangeland health and propose some measures that we believe may address some of the 17 indicators.

AB  - The sight of land managers poring over ant checklists is a regular occurrence in Australia, where ant monitoring has been successfully applied to a wide range of land-use situations. The robustness of ants as ecological indicators has been consistently demonstrated, and is supported by an extensive understanding of their community dynamics in relation to disturbance. Despite the widespread recognition of the value of terrestrial invertebrates as bioindicators, the use of ants represents one of the few examples where invertebrates are widely adopted in land management as indicator organisms, as opposed to being consigned to the "too hard" basket. The use of invertebrates as bioindicators in land management will always require specialist expertise and a substantial investment in resources. However, research in Australia shows that invertebrate monitoring does not require comprehensive surveys, and that it is possible to simplify sampling and processing without compromising indicator performance. This should help take invertebrates out of the "too hard" basket and provide land managers with a powerful tool for environmental monitoring.

AB  - Background The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 foresees that Member States assess conditions and potential developments of ecosystems under climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. This combination of environmental impacts has never been modelled for the German territory before. Therefore, the aim of the presented dynamic modelling of soil parameters under the influence of changing atmospheric nitrogen deposition with simultaneous climate change at representative sites in Germany was to derive knowledge about the expected development of ecosystem conditions up to a possible change of the respective site-specific current ecosystem type. The dynamic modelling was performed with the Very Simple Dynamic soil model. The selection of 15 modelling sites regarded the availability of data from environmental monitoring programmes routinely operated by public institutions and the aptitude of data for parametrising the soil model. The most important input data are time series of nitrogen and acid deposition as well as time series of the relevant climatic-ecological parameters. The simulation period covered the years 1920-2070. Results There are no continuous linear correlations between the level of acidifying or eutrophying inputs and the course of soil parameter values. The step-like courses result from the resilience of the ecosystems within certain parameter ranges. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition has led to nitrogen saturation at 14 of 15 sites selected for modelling. Currently, no linear (negative) correlation between nitrogen deposition and carbon/nitrogen ratio could be established at these sites any more. An increase in the N-content in the soil was only slight, if at all. On the other hand, the nitrate concentration in the leachate increases in correlation to the N deposition. A clear (negative) correlation was found for the dependence of the C/N ratio on the temperature development in connection with climate change. The predicted air temperature rise until 2070 will also cause a decrease of the carbon content in the future, caused by the increasing activity of decomposing soil organisms. Thus, the drastic decrease of the C/N ratio at all of the study sites is due to the significant decrease in the C content. The validation shows that the dynamic modelling of abiotic site parameters has delivered plausible results at the investigated sites. The applicability of the results could be demonstrated. Thus, the evaluation of the time series of soil and climate parameters resulted in forest ecosystem types that are capable of self-regeneration in the future under the conditions of air pollutant inputs and climate change. Conclusions The dynamic modelling of soil parameters under the influence of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and of climate change enables to transparently rank the potential development of ecosystem conditions up to a possible extinction of the current ecosystem type. Thus, the soil modelling approach presented contributes to the implementation of the European Biodiversity Strategy.

AB  - As a contribution to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives. Mixed-species MSY was lower than the sum of the single-species MSYs.

AB  - 1. In trying to operationalize the notion of sustainable ecosystem health, ecologists have focused on identifying sets of indicators which can be used to assess river condition relative to some normative, undegraded condition. Recognition and description of this normative state has proved elusive, particularly in highly variable semiarid ecosystems. Without an operational definition of the desired system condition that reflects both scientific rigour and broader societal value systems, rivers are unlikely to be managed effectively.
   2. Managing river health should not be confused with measuring it. Many monitoring or assessment programs become ends in themselves instead of being the means to achieving specific management goals. The absence of a test of the results of monitoring further introduces the risk of management by observation and 'pseudo-fact'. Health 'endpoints' provide a scientific description of management goals, while 'values' provide a societal perspective. Together they complement the use of indicators and provide the basis for a strategic rather than reactive approach to management.
   3. The integration of value systems, endpoints and indicators of ecosystem health or ecosystem integrity forms the cornerstone of a consultative management process for the rivers of the Kruger National Park.
   4. An objectives hierarchy has been developed to service management's institutional hierarchy. 'Vision' and objectives serve upper levels of management with value based statements of strategic intent which have been tested against public opinion. Goals provide managers on the ground with specific ecological endpoints termed 'thresholds of probable concern' (TPCs). TPCs are described by a range of spatially and temporally bounded indicators of the system's response to the main potential agents of change.
   5. TPCs represent statements or hypotheses of the limits of acceptable change in ecosystem structure, function and composition. They thereby provide an inductive and strategic approach to adaptive management in a data poor situation. Integrated monitoring, research and modelling track criteria relative to TPCs and question whether management action, or recalibration of the TPC, is needed. TPCs thus provide direction for management but their validity and appropriateness are frequently challenged and adaptively modified.
   6. The objectives hierarchy gives Kruger Park management a mandate to 'maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and fluxes'. Alluviation, as a consequence of increased sediment supply and decreased sediment transport capacity, is a major threat to the biodiversity of the bedrock-controlled rivers which flow through the park. Thus, for example, TPCs for geomorphic diversity reflect permissible ranges of change in bedrock character of the physical template. They are measured as change in the proportion of different geomorphic units in identified representative reaches. TPCs for riparian vegetation are measured as change in population structure of selected species within the representative reaches. They reflect a likely range of biotic responses to change in the physical template. A specific set of indicators, reflecting response to the major agents of change, therefore provides a parsimonious program for assessing ecosystem condition relative to explicit goals and a clearly defined management process.

AB  - Benchmarks provide context and are a critical element of all ecological assessments. Over the last 25 y, hundreds of papers have been published on various aspects of ecological assessments, and most of the analyses described in these papers depend on specifying an ecological benchmark for context. Freshwater scientists and managers usually use reference sites (typically sites in natural or least-disturbed condition) to assess the ecological conditions at other sites. Accurate and precise assessments require that assessed sites be matched with appropriate reference conditions. Two general types of approaches have been proposed to predict reference conditions classifications based on natural environmental settings and models that use continuously variable environmental attributes as inputs Two types of classifications have been examined geographic-dependent regionalizations based on general landscape features and geographic-independent typologies that are typically based on combinations of regional and channel features We examined >1000 papers that addressed some aspect of predicting the reference condition in freshwater ecosystems We focused on 5 types of benchmarks: ecological, thermal, hydrologic, geomorphic, and chemical Our review showed that over the last 25 y, researchers have developed increasingly sophisticated methods that can be used to predict reference conditions. Most disciplines have increasingly moved toward site-specific modeling approaches as a way to improve both accuracy and precision of predictions, although typological approaches dominate geomorphic characterizations Papers published in I-NABS have been especially important in advancing and refining methods for predicting ecological benchmarks Much of the progress made in the science of ecological assessment emerged from research that advanced our understanding of how the spatial and temporal distributions of freshwater biota are related to naturally occurring environmental features and how those relationships can be most accurately and precisely described and predicted Thus, the performance of ecological assessments is critically linked to how well we characterize freshwater environments, and research in the watershed sciences that addresses predicting thermal, hydrologic, geomorphic, and chemical attributes of freshwater ecosystems has paralleled research focused on predicting biota. We anticipate that knowledge produced from future collaborations between ecologists and watershed scientists coupled with the application of modern modeling techniques will largely determine progress in characterizing and predicting biota-environment relationships and, thus, the accuracy and precision of future ecological assessments

AB  - In floodplain wetland the evaluation of aquatic environment has been implemented as an effective tool for the rapid assessment. Ox-bow lakes i.e. natural wetlands are the abandoned part of the former meander are common features developed in floodplain. The northern portion of Coochbehar district is under the Tarai belt and the southern portion lies under the alluvial plain physiographic region. The Tarai zone is composed of alternate layers of clay and sand, with a high water table that creates many wetlands. Many natural wetlands in the form of ox-bow lakes have been formed in Tufanganj C.D. Blocks which are locally known as beel or baor. These beels are the abandoned channels of Raidak I, Gadadhar, Kaljani, and Mora Raidak River. Due to the geological and geomorphological set up of this region the rivers mentioned above frequently change their course. Topographical, Geomorphological and Geohydrological maps have been used to know the spatial distribution of wetlands and physiographic set up of the region. Many beels have evolved which are ecologically very much productive. With the help of the Oakton multi parameter and WTW DO meter wetland index has been prepared in some of the beels to analyze the physico-chemical properties of wetlands and to assess the ecological importance as well as human intervention. Thermal bands of Landsat image (OLI/TIRS) have also been used to assess the temperature distribution of the land and wetlands. This paper investigates the role of wetland hydrology to evaluate aquatic environment for the wetland assessment in the floodplain regime.

AB  - Many ecologists are concerned that biodiversity loss from human impact on natural ecosystems could compromise ecosystem stability. A relationship between diversity and stability was proposed by MacArthur [MacArthur, R.H., 1955. Fluctuation of animal populations and a measure of community stability. Ecology 36, 533-536.]. Current thinking (for example, McCann, K., 2000. The diversity-stability debate. Nature 405, 228-233.) acknowledges that interaction pattern among species, rather than species richness per se, is one element of this relationship. Dunne et al. [Dunne, J.A., Williams, R.J., Martinez, N.D., 2002a. Network structure and biodiversity loss in food webs: robustness increases with connectance. Ecol. Lett. 5, 558-567.] showed that the robustness of 16 food webs is correlated with their connectance. Connectance is one measure of interaction pattern. Robustness relates to the maintenance of network integrity and so has consequences for stability; the loss of integrity must have ecosystem-wide implications. This paper tests the hypothesis that changes in a food web's connectance indicate changes in its robustness. It concludes that any change in connectance with species loss, but especially large, negative changes, constitutes a decrease in robustness. Estimation of the change in connectance could support interpretation of monitoring data on species composition, acting as an indicator of food web robustness and, indirectly, of ecosystem stability. It could assist managers to understand the implications of biodiversity loss caused by human intervention in ecosystems, and could assist either choice of intervention or amelioration of impacts.

AB  - Macrophytes are an essential biological element of freshwater aquatic ecosystems and are well known to reflect prevailing ecological conditions in rivers. Their use as bioindicators of nutrient status in river systems is widespread yet their reliability is hotly debated. The aim of this investigation was to assess whether macrophytes are reliable indicators of nutrient levels or better applied as indicators of other non-nutrient environmental conditions. The importance of two water-column nutrients; nitrates (N) and orthophosphates (P) were assessed in terms of their influence on macrophyte species richness and diversity in relation to other non-nutrient environmental factors using 395 river plots from Ireland. Then, in this context, the efficiency of macrophytes to detect nutrient levels was assessed by selecting two macrophyte-based water quality assessment tools; the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and the Predictions And Classification System for river macrophytes (LEAFPACS2). Finally, the ability of phytosociological communities within these rivers to reflect trophic levels was examined using the same two water quality assessment tools. It was shown that water-column nutrients N and P have a minor influence on macrophyte richness and no significant influence on macrophyte diversity and that MTR and LEAFPACS2 were only weakly correlated with N and P levels. It was concluded that macrophytes are sensitive to environmental changes but respond to a combination of ecological factors rather than N or P alone. Therefore, this study suggests that macrophytes are not the most efficient taxon group to apply when assessing trophic changes in isolation of other non-nutrient factors.

AB  - The increasing use of dragonflies and damselflies as models in studies on biodiversity in the last decades has unraveled several features of natural processes and mechanisms for species conservation. Nevertheless, biodiversity is a polysemic concept that resolves multiple dimensions that, together, enroll what we observe as species and lineages diversity. One of these dimensions is Ethodiversity, which may represent the individual diversity of behavioral traits and higher organization levels. Hence, measures of Ethodiversity may be used as indicator tools to measure such dimensions of biodiversity. However, we still lack methods and protocols to measure this diversity. Therefore, here we addressed whether damselfly behaviors may act as indicators of environmental impacts. We collected behavioral data of 120 males in two sites, one in an ecological reserve and another in an impacted habitat. Our results show differences in behavioral syndromes and behavioral integrity when comparing populations in impacted and conserved environments. In conclusion, we hope that these results stimulate future endeavors to create a methodological framework to assess behavioral diversity.

AB  - The demand for sensitive biological tools to assess the environmental quality of coastal waters at broad spatial scales is increasing. Many of the tools used are based on the taxonomic composition of biotic assemblages. They usually require a valuable taxonomic expertise while are unique reflecting the overall ecosystem integrity. Here, we evaluate the potential indicator value of several features of the epiphytic community (overall assemblage composition, species richness, and proportion of the main taxonomic groups) growing on the seagrass Posidonia oceanica leaves. We do so by empirically examining their changes along a disturbance gradient where multiple human activities have interactive and cumulative impacts, sampling at different spatial scales and at two different depths (5 and 15 m). Our results show that the specific composition of the epiphytic assemblages (i.e. species composition) closely reflects, in the deep meadows, the combined effects of different anthropogenic stressors along the gradient, showing an integrative and non-specific response. Similarly, an increase in the proportion of hydrozoans, and a decrease in the proportion of rhodophytes and chlorophytes are observed in deep meadows along the gradient. In shallow meadows, grazing and biotic features of the seagrass seem the main forcing factors determining species composition, and therefore masking the response of epiphytes to the deterioration gradient. After address the effect of natural sources of variability (water depth, within- and between-meadow heterogeneity), changes in epiphyte assemblages and in the proportion of hydrozoans, rhodophytes and chlorophytes in relatively deep meadows seem promising monitoring tools for detecting coastal environmental deterioration.

AB  - 1.In stream ecosystems, bacterial communities play an important role in nutrient and energy cycling processes as they are among the most numerous and active organisms at the basal trophic level of the stream food web. Bacterial communities in stream biofilms have been shown to correlate well with different catchment land use and therefore provide an opportunity for the development of a novel ecological indicator of stream ecosystem health.
   2.In this study, a bacterial community index (BCI) model was developed and validated using a national data set of biofilm bacterial community profiles collected from 223 streams across seven geographical regions in New Zealand. The six-component BCI model was generated using the partial least squares regression method to associate the multivariate bacterial community profile with the macroinvertebrate community index, which is a well-established indicator of stream health.
   3.Despite strong regional clustering of the bacterial community profiles, the BCI was indicative of the level of disturbance in the catchment, as shown by significant correlations with a wide range of independent indicators of water quality, macroinvertebrate community data, ecosystem functioning and catchment land-use data. The BCI was able to explain 35% of the variation in a multi-metric index incorporating ten common ecological parameters, suggesting that the stream bacterial communities could provide useful information about the ecosystem integrity.
   4.The BCI provides a novel ecosystem assessment tool, which can be used to complement existing stream health measures in the management of anthropogenic impacts on freshwater streams and rivers.

AB  - Alien plant species are stressors to ecosystems and indicators of reduced ecosystem integrity. The magnitude of the stress reflects not only the quantity of aliens present, but also the quality of their interactions with native ecosystems. We develop an Index of Alien Impact (IAI) to estimate the collective ecological impact of in situ alien species. IAI summarizes the frequency of occurrence and potential ecological impact (Invasiveness-Impact Score (I (i) )) of individual alien species for all aliens present in a particular location or community type. A component metric, I (i) , is based on ecological species traits (life history, ecological amplitude, and ability to alter ecosystem processes) that reflect mechanisms, which can increase impact to ecosystem structure and function. While I (i) is less complex than some other multi-metric rankings of alien impact, it compares well to these metrics and to qualitative judgments. IAI can be adapted for different ecological settings by modifying the set of species traits incorporated in I (i) to reflect properties likely to breach biotic and abiotic barriers or alter ecosystem function in a particular region or community type of interest. To demonstrate our approach, we created versions of IAI and I (i) , applicable to the diverse streamside vegetation of a river basin (19,631 km(2)) spanning low-elevation arid to mesic montane habitats in eastern Oregon, USA. In this demonstration effort, we (1) evaluate relationships of IAI to metrics describing invasion level, and (2) illustrate the potential utility of IAI for prioritizing alien species management activities and informing restoration goals.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment has become a commonly used tool in policy analysis, but its use is controversial. Opinions are diverse; they range from enthusiastic support to caustic dismissal. Much of the controversy with using risk assessment in ecological policy analysis revolves around defining the initial policy question or problem to be assessed. In formulating the "question" in ecological risk assessment, the nature of the analytical technique forces analysts to make assumptions of values and priorities; these assumptions may not be the same as those of the public or their elected or appointed representatives. Specifically, much of the difficulty with applying risk assessment is that, by definition, risk is adverse. Deciding which ecological changes are adverse (undesired) and which are beneficial (desired) is likely to be the primary political debate. Ecological conditions and changes are classified by the values and priorities of the person or administrative body doing the classification; ecological condition or change in itself is neither good nor bad, beneficial nor adverse, healthy nor degraded. One method often used to determine which ecological conditions or changes are adverse is to apply the human "health" metaphor to ecosystems or ecological components. However, application of the concept of ecosystem health is fraught with value-based requirements which are difficult and probably impossible to attain. Formulating the question is, or at least should be, driven by societal values, preferences, and priorities, but this is difficult to do in a pluralistic society. Better ways to evaluate and measure public values, preferences, and priorities in framing ecological questions are needed to enhance the utility of ecological risk assessment.

AB  - The rehabilitation of French former uranium mining sites has not prevented the contamination of the surrounding aquatic ecosystems with metal elements. This study assesses the impact of the discharge of treated uranium mining effluents on periphytic diatom communities to evaluate their potential of bioindication. A 7-month survey was conducted on the Ritord watercourse to measure the environmental conditions of microalgae, the non-taxonomic attributes of periphyton (photosynthesis and biomass) and to determine the specific composition of diatom assemblages grown on artificial substrates. The environmental conditions were altered by the mine waters, that contaminate the watercourse with uranium and with chemicals used in the pit-water treatment plants (BaCl2 and Al-2(SO4)(3)). The biomass and photosynthetic activity of periphyton seemed not to respond to the stress induced by the treated mining effluents whereas the altered environmental conditions clearly impacted the composition of diatom communities. Downstream the discharges, the communities tended to be characterized by indicator species belonging to the genera Fragilaria, Eunotia and Brachysira and were highly similar to assemblages at acid mine drainage sites. The species Eunotia pectinalis var. undulata, Psammothidium rechtensis, Gomphonema lagenula and Pinnularia major were found to be sensitive to uranium effluents whereas Neidium alpinum and several species of Gomphonema tolerated this contamination. The relevance of diatoms as ecological indicator was illustrated through the changes in structure of communities induced by the discharge of uranium mining effluents and creates prospects for development of a bioindicator tool for this kind of impairment of water quality.

AB  - The concept of environmental flows has been developed to manage human alteration of river flow regimes, as effective management requires an understanding of the ecological consequences of flow alteration. This study explores the concept of macroinvertebrate sensitivity to river flow alteration to establish robust quantitative relationships between biological indicators and hydrological pressures. Existing environmental flow classifications used by the environmental regulator for English rivers were tested using multilevel regression modelling. Results showed a weak relationship between the current abstraction sensitivity classification and macroinvertebrate response to flow pressure. An alternative approach, based on physically derived river types, was a better predictor of macroinvertebrate response. Intermediate sized lowland streams displayed the best model fit, while upland rivers exhibited poor model performance. A better understanding of the ecological response to flow variation in different river types could help water resource managers develop improved ecologically appropriate flow regimes, which support the integrity of river ecosystems.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to help managers better understand implications of using aggregate community metrics, such as taxon richness or Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), for detecting threshold responses to anthropogenic environmental gradients. To illustrate, we offer an alternative analytical approach, Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN), geared toward identifying synchronous changes in the distribution of multiple taxa as evidence of an ecological community threshold. Our approach underscores the fundamental reality that which taxa are affected by stressors is important, both from a conservation standpoint and because taxon-specific life-history traits help us understand relevant mechanisms. First, we examine macroinvertebrate community response to an impervious cover gradient using a well-studied biomonitoring data set to show that representative community metrics are relatively insensitive to synchronous threshold declines of numerous individual taxa. We then reproduce these response relationships using a simulated community data set with similar properties to demonstrate that linear or wedge-shaped responses of community metrics to anthropogenic gradients can occur as an artifact of aggregating multiple taxa into a single value per sampling unit, despite strong nonlinearity in community response. Our findings do not repudiate the use of community metrics or multimetric indices, but they challenge assumptions that such metrics are capable of accurately reflecting community thresholds across a broad range of anthropogenic gradients. We recommend an alternative analysis framework that begins with characterization of the responses of individual taxa and uses aggregation only after distinguishing the magnitude, direction, and uncertainty in the responses of individual members of the community.

AB  - Ecosystems modified by human activities are generally predicted to be biologically impoverished. However, much pollution impact theory stems from laboratory or small-scale field studies, and few studies replicate at the level of estuary. Furthermore, assessments are often based on sediment contamination and infauna, and impacts to epibiota (sessile invertebrates and algae) are seldom considered. We surveyed epibiota in six estuaries in south-east Australia. Half the estuaries were relatively pristine, and half were subject to internationally high levels of contamination, urbanisation, and industrialisation. Contrary to predictions, epibiota in modified estuaries had greater coverage and were similarly diverse as those in unmodified estuaries. Change in epibiota community structure was linearly correlated with sediment-bound copper, and the tubeworm Hydroides elegans showed a strong positive correlation with sediment metals. Stressors such as metal contamination can reduce biodiversity and productivity, but others such as nutrient enrichment and resource provision may obscure signals of impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organic matter decomposition and ecosystem metabolism have been suggested as promising functional indicators of stream ecosystem integrity, but tests of their applicability to tropical systems are rare. Here, we tested the suitability of the ecosystem processes leaf decomposition (LD), community respiration (CR) and gross primary production (GPP) as functional indicators of catchment and riparian corridor land use impacts on 16 rural, tropical headwater streams. Agricultural and urban land cover contributed 0.0-78.3% and 0.0-8.3%, respectively, to total catchment land cover, and 0.0-61.2% and 0.0-7.8%, respectively, to land cover in a riparian corridor of 20 m width of the investigated streams. Median rates of GPP and CR in the studied streams were 0.4 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) (0.0-1.6, min-max) and 3.3 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) (1.8-15), respectively. According to the double exponential model, median leaf litter decay coefficients of the recalcitrant and the labile litter fraction were 0.006 d(-1) (-0.017 to 0.016) and 0.15 d(-1) (0.06-0.86), respectively. While land use in the riparian corridor was correlated to the studied ecosystem processes, whole catchment land use did not exhibit such relations. Nitrogen enrichment and increased CR, both related to urban land use, were the main impacts, indicating that already low levels of urban land cover can have considerable effects on stream integrity in the investigated rural tropical landscape. Although spanning a much wider gradient, agricultural land cover was a less important stressor, and stimulated GPP was related to stream morphology, but not to nutrient enrichment. Leaf decomposition was negatively correlated with both the agricultural and the urban impacts, suggesting that high rates of leaf decomposition are an indicator of pristine conditions in the studied streams. In conclusion, measurements of LD, CR and GPP appear to be suitable, and complementary functional indicators of stream integrity and provided insights into mechanisms of land use impacts on streams in tropical rural catchments.

AB  - Maintaining healthy ecosystems is a prerequisite for conserving biodiversity. The complex nature of ecosystems often necessitates the use of indicator ta,va to monitor ecosystem health. However, ambiguous selection criteria and the use of inappropriate taxa have brought the utility of indicator taxa under question. This review compiles existing selection criteria From the literature, evaluates inconsistencies among these criteria, and proposes a step-wise selection process. In addition, 100 vertebrate and 32 invertebrate taxa documented in the conservation science literature as indicators of ecosystem health are examined to assess how well they adhere to the referenced criteria. Few vertebrate taxa fulfill multiple criteria, as most are highly mobile generalists that lack established tolerance levels and correlations with ecosystem changes. Most suggested invertebrate taxa also lack correlations to ecosystem changes, but satisfy other selection criteria. However, invertebrate taxa are often suggested at high taxonomic levels, encompassing many species, making it difficult to measure specific attributes, and potentially including many unnecessary and even inappropriate species.

AB  - The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been reporting country-level area in primary forests in its Global Forest Resource Assessment since 2005. The FAO definition of a primary forest (naturally regenerated forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed) is generally accepted as authoritative and is being used in policy making. However, problems with this definition undermine our capacity to obtain globally coherent estimates. In addition, the current reporting on primary forests fails to consider the complementarily of non-primary forests toward the maintenance of ecosystem services. These issues undermine the appropriate tracking of changes in primary and non-primary forests, and the assessment of impacts of such changes on ecosystem services. We present the case for an operational reconsideration of the primary forest concept and discuss how alternatives or supplements might be developed.

AB  - Bioindication has become an indispensable part of water quality monitoring in most countries of the world, with the presence and abundance of bioindicator taxa, mostly multicellular eukaryotes, used for biotic indices. In contrast, microbes (bacteria, archaea and protists) are seldom used as bioindicators in routine assessments, although they have been recognized for their importance in environmental processes. Recently, the use of molecular methods has revealed unexpected diversity within known functional groups and novel metabolic pathways that are particularly important in energy and nutrient cycling. In various habitats, microbial communities respond to eutrophication, metals, and natural or anthropogenic organic pollutants through changes in diversity and function. In this review, we evaluated the common trends in these changes, documenting that they have value as bioindicators and can be used not only for monitoring but also for improving our understanding of the major processes in lotic and lentic environments. Current knowledge provides a solid foundation for exploiting microbial taxa, community structures and diversity, as well as functional genes, in novel monitoring programs. These microbial community measures can also be combined into biotic indices, improving the resolution of individual bioindicators. Here, we assess particular molecular approaches complemented by advanced bioinformatic analysis, as these are the most promising with respect to detailed bioindication value. We conclude that microbial community dynamics are a missing link important for our understanding of rapid changes in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, and should be addressed in the future environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding and managing increasing threat from diverse anthropogenic pressures on estuaries requires impact assessment and monitoring indices that provide accurate quantification of change and are readily communicable. Although indices based on nekton assemblage structure have obvious appeal to managers, the imperative to produce the most accurate measures possible has seen a move away from simple composite measures (such as diversity indices) towards complex multivariate approaches. However, complex methods often provide a poor basis for reporting because they can be difficult to report in terms that are meaningful to the end user. Effective indices should be simple to construct and communicate, relate directly to definable biological attributes, fall within predictable ranges for unimpacted systems and show demonstrable responses to known impacts. We use published nekton data for 30 natural and two artificial estuaries to develop a set of nekton assemblage-based summary measures that fit these criteria. We evaluated a suite of simple parallel measures based on both catch per unit effort (CPUE) and probability of encounter (PoE). Parallel measures provide complementary information thus a more robust assessments of change. Three measures fell within consistent bounds as long as comparisons were confined to the same time of year to remove the influence of seasonal variability, and were efficient at differentiating degraded from unimpacted estuaries. Because the successful approaches rely on PoE rather than CPUE they have considerable tactical advantages in that they are less destructive, allow for the collection of many more samples per unit time, and treat schooling and non-schooling species equivalently.

AB  - Estuaries are globally important to fisheries but face many anthropogenic stressors that reduce water quality and degrade benthic habitat. The Maumee River estuary has been degraded by industrial contaminants, high sediment and nutrient loads, channelization and elimination of surrounding wetlands, lessening its value as spawning habitat for fishes of Lake Erie. Regulation and better management practices (BMPs) in the watershed have improved the water quality in this estuary, which should result in a response of the biotic community. We compared recent (2010/2011) larval fish assemblage data to similar data from the 1970s (1976/1977) in order to identify changes due to improved water and habitat quality. Family-level diversity was greater in recent study years compared to the 1970s and family richness increased from 6 to 10. In addition, the abundance of lithophilic spawning fishes was significantly greater in the recent study years. Increased diversity and family richness were consistent with increased water quality in the Maumee River whereas the observed increase in abundance of lithophilic spawners was consistent with an increase in the amount or quality of benthic habitat used by species in these families for spawning. Better wastewater management and agricultural practices in coastal watersheds can benefit the early life stages of fishes, thus benefitting coastal fisheries. Furthermore, larval fish assemblages may be useful indicators of biological integrity because of their sensitivities to environmental change. Routine sampling of estuarine larval fish assemblages could provide practitioners with insight into ecosystem changes and measure the response of the biotic community to restoration.

AB  - Survival was generally high, 94 100%, for newly hatched larvae of the nase Chondrostoma nasus held at 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25 and 28 degrees C up to day 66 post-fertilization. The developmental rate decreased with age and increased with temperature. Specific growth rates increased with temperature: within one temperature range growth rate decreased with ontogenetic development. Food consumption and respiration increased with temperature and body size. A temperature increase From 25 to 28 degrees C resulted in slightly reduced survival, minor acceleration of developmental growth and respiration rates, and impeded skeleton formation. Growth efficiency of consumed energy decreased throughout the larval period From 55 to 67% at the first larval stage (L(1)) to 36-48% at the first juvenile stage (J(1)). A similar trend For assimilation efficiency and its utilization for growth was observed. The constant temperatures required by larval nase ranged from a minimum 8-10 degrees C to a maximum 25-28 degrees C. A shirt of optimum temperatures. 8-12, 13-16, 15-18, 19 and 22 degrees C for nase spawning, embryonic development, yolk feeding larvae, early externally Feeding larvae and, late larvae and juveniles, respectively, paralleled the spring rise in the river water temperature. Larval and juvenile nase show high survival, growth and energy conversion efficiencies compared with other fish species. On the other hand, low survival rates and growth can be attributed to external perturbations; thus, young nase may be considered a good indicator or the environmental and ecological integrity of river systems.

AB  - Ecological indicators are often constructed as an integrated set to represent key information and characteristics of the ecosystem which are tightly linked to management objectives. As an effective tool, ecological indicators play an increasingly important role in ecosystem monitoring, assessment and management. Reasonable selection of an indicator is a prerequisite for effectively using it. A defined protocol with scientific rigor to select ecological indicators is imperative to solve the challenges in ecological indicator selection. This paper compares the Causal Network (CN) with the Ecological Hierarchy Network (EHN) as a framework to select ecological indicators. These frameworks are not exclusive but interdependent in constructing a network framework. Based on the network framework, a quantitative ecological indicator selection method is demonstrated through a theoretical example. In the selection process, the criteria and requirements considering the balance of science and utility are proposed and translated into quantitative constraints of a selection model. By resolving the model under a mathematical operation, the human arbitrary disturbance will be reduced and random selection minimized. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Restoration of riparian forests has been promoted as a means of mitigating urban impacts on stream ecosystems. However, conventional urban stormwater drainage may diminish the beneficial effect of riparian forests.
   2. The relative effects of riparian deforestation and catchment urbanisation on stream ecosystems have rarely been discriminated because urban land use and riparian degradation usually covary. However, land use at three scales (channel canopy cover along a 100-m site, riparian forest cover within 200 m of the channel for 1 km upstream, and catchment imperviousness) covaried only weakly along the lowland Yarra River, Victoria, Australia.
   3. We tested the extent to which each land use measure explained macroinvertebrate assemblage composition on woody debris and in the sediments of pools or runs in the mainstem Yarra River in autumn and spring 1998.
   4. Assemblage composition in both habitats and in both seasons was most strongly correlated with proportion of catchment covered by impervious surfaces. Sites with higher imperviousness had fewer sensitive taxa (those having a strong positive influence on indicators of biological integrity) and more taxa typical of degraded urban streams. Sensitive taxa rarely occurred in sites with > 4% total imperviousness. However, within sites of similar imperviousness, those with more riparian forest cover had more dipteran taxa. Channel canopy cover did not explain assemblage composition strongly.
   5. Riparian forest cover may influence richness of some macroinvertebrate taxa, but catchment urbanisation probably has a stronger effect on sensitive taxa. In catchments with even a small amount of conventionally drained urban land, riparian revegetation is unlikely to have an effect on indicators of stream biological integrity. Reducing the impacts of catchment urbanisation through dispersed, low-impact drainage schemes is likely to be more effective.

AB  - Soil hydraulic properties were characterized on a ridgetop training site and other sites not impacted by training at Fort Benning, a military installation in southwestern, GA to: (1) examine the influence of mechanized training on soil hydraulic properties and (2) evaluate the utility of soil hydraulic properties as disturbance-level indicators related to ecosystem integrity. Ridgetop surface soils impacted by mechanized military training exhibited a reduction in the mean pore size, as indicated by smaller scaling factors, an increase in the soil bulk density and a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity for training locations versus non-training locations. Soil bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and scaling factors exhibited lower population variance in the training sites, indicating repetitive training cycles that progressively mix and homogenize the soil. Surface soils (0-3 em below ground surface) at all sites were predominantly loamy sands. The observed differences in measured soil properties at training and non-training sites characterize the endpoints of an ecosystem disturbance gradient where relatively un-impacted forest transitions to barren, churned sand. They also help explain the visual evidence of increased overland flow and significant soil erosion in the training areas. While results from this research showed a marked difference in measured soil properties between the two extreme types of land management, more work is needed to establish threshold levels for soil properties related to mechanized vehicle training cycles and training intensity and corresponding ecosystem degradation/integrity. It is noted that for assessment of immediate erosion potential and ecosystem integrity, remote sensing techniques paired with watershed-scale numerical modeling may be more valuable and that greater research emphasis be given to characterizing the indirect, yet more widespread, down-slope impacts of mechanized training activities localized on the ridgetops.

AB  - This study analysed the impact of riparian land use in structuring the larval ephemeropteran communities from 25 sites in streams and rivers of Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) of the southern end of the Western Ghats, India. A total of twenty-eight species belonging to twenty-four genera of six families were collected across all the sites. Baetidae and Leptophlebiidae were the most numerous and ubiquitous families, comprising eight genera in each family and eleven and nine species, respectively. The physico-chemical parameters and species richness and abundance of mayflies varied across streams and rivers with different riparian land-use types. Species distribution was influenced by the environmental gradients. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed a clear separation of the mayfly assemblages along water quality and riparian land-use gradients. The results of this study suggest that Ephemeroptera taxa can be potentially used as sensitive indicators of riparian land use in lotic ecosystems.

AB  - The aim of this research is to assess the effects of oil palm plantations on stream habitat and their fish assemblage diversity. We hypothesize that streams which drain through oil palm plantations tend to be less heterogeneous, limiting the occurrence of many species, than streams that drain through forest fragments, which support higher fish diversity. A total of 17 streams were sampled; eight in forest fragments and nine in oil palm plantations. Environmental and biological variables were sampled along 150 m stretch in each stream. Of the 242 environmental variables measured, ten were considered important to assess the condition of structural habitat, and out of these variables, four were considered relevant in the distinction between streams in oil palm plantations and forest fragments. A total of 7245 fishes were collected, belonging to 63 species. Unlike our original hypothesis, the species richness did not differ between forest fragment and oil palm plantations streams, showing that it is not a good divert measure in streams disturbance assessment. However, fish assemblages differed in species composition, and 56 species were recorded in oil palm plantation streams, while 44 species were recorded in forest fragments streams. Some species were identified as indicators of either altered (Aequidens tetramerus and Apistogramma agassizii) or undisturbed areas (Helogenes marmoratus). Overall, oil palm plantations were proven to change stream habitat structure and fish species distribution, corroborating other studies that have evidenced changes in patterns of biological community structure due to impacts by different land uses.

AB  - Continuous monitoring data can be extremely useful for assessing water-quality conditions particularly for variables, such as dissolved oxygen, that exhibit dynamic diel swings. As a means of evaluating stream dissolved oxygen criteria used by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), we compared continuous dissolved oxygen (DO) data collected at five small- to moderate-sized (watersheds 10-100 mi(2)), high-gradient streams in the Boston Mountains distributed across a land-use and nutrient condition gradient. The sampled streams exhibit a general pattern established for other aquatic systems (e.g., larger streams, low-gradient streams, and lakes) where increasing land-use intensity results in increased nutrient concentrations, stream eutrophication, and increased DO variability. DO concentrations were < 6 mg/L for fewer than 4% of measurements at the two sites identified "a priori" as least disturbed by nutrient and land-use indices, while concentrations at the three sites identified as moderately and most disturbed were < 6 mg/L for 20 to 33% of measurements. These findings demonstrate that the current criterion (10% of the DO measurements are < 6 mg/L) employed by ADEQ was effective at identifying various degrees of DO impairment in Boston Mountain streams. Our analysis also demonstrated that continuous pH and specific conductance data and estimates of stream metabolism were helpful for attributing DO variability to anthropogenic or natural origins. Considerations that were useful for examining these relationships and evaluating ADEQ's DO criterion should be applicable to DO studies in other locations where stream and geologic characteristics are similar to those of the Boston Mountains.

AB  - Background
   Insomnia symptoms are common among young adults and affect about 5% to 26% of 19 to 34-year-olds. In addition, insomnia is associated with poor mental health and may affect daily performance. In research, as well as in clinical practice, sleep questionnaires are used to screen for and diagnose insomnia. However, most questionnaires are not developed according to current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. An exception is the recently developed Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), an eight-item scale screening for insomnia.
   Aim
   The aim of this study was to perform a Classical Test Theory (CTT) based psychometric evaluation of the SCI in a sample of Swedish university students, by taking the ordinal nature of item level data into account.
   Methods
   The SCI was translated into Swedish and distributed online to undergraduate students at three Swedish universities, within programs of health, psychology, science or economy. Of 3673 invited students, 634 (mean age 26.9 years; SD = 7.4) completed the questionnaire that, in addition to the SCI, comprised other scales on sleep, stress, lifestyle and students' study environment. Data were analyzed according to CTT investigating data completeness, item homogeneity and unidimensionality.
   Results
   Polychoric based explorative factor analysis suggested unidimensionality of the SCI, and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha, 0.91; ordinal alpha, 0.94). SCI scores correlated with the Insomnia Severity Index (-0.88) as well as with sleep quality (-0.85) and perceived stress (-0.50), supporting external construct validity.
   Conclusions
   These observations support the integrity of the of the SCI. The SCI demonstrates sound CTT-based psychometric properties, supporting its use as an insomnia screening tool.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are impacted by climate change. However, the level of impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040-2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.

AB  - Floristic quality indices are used to monitor and assess wetland condition by measuring a plant community's tolerance to environmental stress. The aim of our research was to evaluate whether stormwater and reclamation marshes supported wet meadow plant communities that were similar in floristic quality to reference wetlands. Coefficients of conservatism were assigned to a comprehensive list of marsh plant species by nine expert botanists. Various metrics such as the floristic quality index (FQI) were tested for a linear relationship to regional environmental stress gradients in 78 sites in the northern prairies (Aspen Parkland) and 66 sites in the Boreal Plains ecoregions in Alberta, Canada. Sensitivity of floristic quality metrics to the stress gradients was higher when rare species were excluded (species with <5% site-level cover). An adjusted FQI that eliminated bias towards sites with higher species richness yielded the strongest relationship to the stress gradient in both ecoregions (r(2) = 0.55 in northern prairies; r(2) = 0.46 in Boreal Plains). The adjusted FQI also yielded more consistent scores than richness-weighted metrics in a subset of 47 sites where sampling was replicated in dry and wet years (r = 0.75). Including exotic species in floristic quality metrics was not beneficial in the northern prairies where reference sites were located near areas of high urban and agricultural development. This study demonstrates that floristic quality assessments are reasonably good predictors of plant community condition in relation to environmental stress. Results of this study also highlight that existing stormwater ponds and reclamation marshes are not successfully restoring plant community habitat.

AB  - Fungal infections constitute a vital clinical issue concerning various groups of patients, among them patients with total parenteral nutrition. The most common etiological infection factors, affecting the aforementioned group of patients, are among others yeastlike fungi. In clinical specimens, the predominant genus of yeastlike fungi, as isolated from the patients with total parenteral nutrition, is Candida spp. The species of yeastlike fungi of the Candida genus generate various pathogenic factors enabling invasion process and the progression of the subsequent infection stages. The most crucial of them are:
   ability to adhere and ability to form biofilms. This feature, with the mediation of adhesion proteins, enables the fungi to grow on the biomaterial surfaces, to invade the host's tissue, and conditions survival and existence in the environment;
   dimorphism. Creation of two antigenically different forms - yeast and hyphae - conditions specific escape from the immunological system of the macroorganism;
   high enzymatic activity. Hydrolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic activity, featuring primarily the adaptative function, is the indicator of the metabolic stimulation required for the infection process,
   Due to the insignificant pathogenic potential of the Candida genus fungi, associated with the fact of their natural existence on skin and mucous membrane, the research is currently often directed at detection of the factors responsible for the colonisation and development of the fungal infections. These research attempts are aimed at differentiating between both processes.

AB  - Background Although freshwater ecological restoration (FER) has undergone an immense development over the past two decades in China either in the number of projects or in the spatial scale of implementations, a dearth of clear and comprehensive trends in this field is still a particular concern. We conducted a literature survey through searching the database of Web of Science between 1997 and 2017 to investigate the driving force behind FER practice and to summarize the restoration outcomes. Results A total of 2047 publications were hit and 198 of them were finally retained after manual screening. The number of studies in this field has been steadily increasing in recent years and their provincial distribution is positively correlated with GDP growth and the investment to pollution control and environmental protection, suggesting that economic development is a key driving factor of FER practice. Among the remaining articles, nearly half (46.5%) focus on lake ecosystems, and 34.8% and 32.8% of the studies indicate that land reclamation and eutrophication are the predominant causes of freshwater ecosystem degradation. The overarching target of the restoration is biodiversity increase (31.4%), followed by water quality improvement (24.7%) and ecosystem services (23.9%). Revegetation is a dominant restoration approach (40.9%). Reference sites for assessment of restoration projects are normally control locations without intervention (60%), or the status of the targeted sites before the interventions. For the restoration outcome evaluation, 86% of the studies present positive outcomes in terms of water quality improvement, and 79% have improvement in biological features. The most frequently monitored organisms are macrophytes (31%), followed by benthos as indicators of ecological condition. Conclusions Economic growth, water pollution and investment into environmental protection are the main driving factors of FER practice in China. The effort of restoration and evaluation over the past two decades has not been limited to improving hydrological function and water quality, but also pay increasingly more attention to biological processes and ecological integrity, and further the ecosystem services in recent years. However, the lack of long-term monitoring and socioeconomic attributes considered in restoration success assessments are still particular issues that need to be addressed in the future FER researches and projects.

AB  - A key requirement for polymer pipes, in having the ability to achieve a long in service life, is the retention by the polymeric material of its anti-oxidants. In dry air and other favourable environmental conditions the life-span of the polymer material can be many decades. However, when polymer pipes are transporting water and the pipes need to be installed in all kinds of ground conditions then the loss of anti-oxidant from the polymer can become more of a problem. To maintain integrity of water distribution networks, companies aim to plan for replacement of water pipes before they are likely to fail. This paper presents ways in which small scale evaluations of aged pipe material can be employed to assess remaining in-service life of water pipes. Small-scale chemical and physical evaluations have been devised to provide indicators of the ageing process with associated loss of mechanical properties. The presented studies were performed using MDPE and PE80 pipe materials. These materials were evaluated before and after ageing to identify which chemical and physical evaluations were the most appropriate to assess the remaining life of in service polymer pipes.

AB  - Fish species richness is an important indicator of river ecological condition but it is particularly difficult to estimate in large unwadeable rapidly flowing rivers. Intensive multi-gear sampling is time consuming, logistically complex and expensive. However, insufficient sampling effort underestimates species richness and yields inaccurate data about the ecological condition of river sites. We raft-electrofished 10 large river sites in 10 different ecoregions and six western USA states for distances equal to 300 times their mean wetted channel widths (MCWs) to estimate the effort needed to approach asymptotes in fish species richness. To collect 90% of the observed fish species at the sites, we found that an average of 150 MCWs (ranging 80?210 MCWs) were needed, with the number of MCWs increasing in rivers with a higher proportion of spatially rare species. Frequently, the second or third additional 100 MCWs produced only one or two additional singletons or doubletons (species occurring only once or twice at a site). Before initiating sampling programs for estimating species richness, we recommend assessing sampling effort, particularly if rare or uncommon species are expected or desired.

AB  - The relationship at the local level between fish condition and environmental variables was investigated in Salaria pavo (peacock blenny) juveniles. The relationships between fish condition and 18 environmental variables of shallow areas of the lagoon relating to intra- and interspecific fish interactions, water quality and habitat structure, were analysed. The study revealed that water depth and S. pavo biomass (both related to intraspecific fish interactions) were the ecological variables accounting for most of the variation in the condition of S. pavo juveniles, in this case a negative effect. In this way, the condition of S. pavo juvenile populations may be a good indicator of fish density interactions.

AB  - Fish assemblage structure was evaluated and compared among 36 karstic pools located within protected areas of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (southern Mexico) and unprotected adjacent areas beyond the Reserve. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS), indicator species analysis (ISA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to identify which environmental factors reflected local influences and to evaluate the correlation of these variables with fish assemblages structure. Thirty-one species were encountered in these karstic pools, some for the first time within the Reserve. These aquatic environments were separated into three groups based on physico-chemical characteristics. Although CCA identified significant associations between several fish species (based on their relative abundance) and environmental variables (K, NH4, NO3, and conductivity), the most abundant species (Astyanax aeneus, Poecilia mexicana, and Gambusia sexradiata) occur in most pools and under several environmental conditions. Baseline data on fish diversity along with a continued monitoring program are essential in order to evaluate the conservation status of fish assemblages and their habitats, as well as to measure the influence of anthropogenic impacts on pristine habitats such as the karstic pools of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting has become one of the key components in the revision of international statistical standards. Expansion of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for ecosystem services follows the rapid progress of science in this area as well as expanding applications to sustainability challenges. In this contribution, we discuss approaches to accounting of ecosystem assets as a natural capital basis that is critical for ecosystem service delivery. Based on examples from the Czech Republic, a Central European country, we illustrate the construction of ecosystem extent accounts based on the methodology of Land and Ecosystem Accounting. This analysis is complemented by monetary ecosystem asset accounting through quantification of the present value of future ecosystem service flows. Ecosystem condition is represented by the Mean Species Abundance indicator, which gauges the direction of ecosystem naturalness. Based on the demonstration of approaches to ecosystem asset accounting, we discuss selected aspects of ecosystem condition measurements, valuation, and policy implications of ecosystem asset accounting at the national level.

AB  - The ecosystem approach (EA) to environmental management is commonly associated with the holistic, integrative assessment of ecosystem status, where assessments of single elements are aggregated across one or multiple levels. Such an integrative assessment is required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Member states of the European Union must assess the environmental status of their marine waters every six years. For this purpose the MSFD is structured into eleven descriptors of good environmental status (GES), which in turn are subdivided into 29 criteria containing a total of 56 different ecosystem indicators. These 56 indicators are recommended to be used by the member states to assess the status of biodiversity, invasive species, exploited fisheries resources, food webs, seafloor integrity, hydrological conditions as well as the impacts of eutrophication, contamination, litter and anthropogenic noise. The nested structure of the indicators within the commission decision on criteria for GES provides a hierarchy of information, for which aggregation at different levels may be necessary, namely within criteria, within descriptors and across descriptors. However, to date no aggregation rules have been provided by the European Commission. This study explores the implications of five commonly used aggregation methods, once applied with the assessment structure outlined for the MSFD, on the aggregated assessment outcomes at the level of criteria, descriptors and overall GES. Assessing the 56 indicators within the nested structure of the MSFD led to different outcomes between the different methods. Furthermore, all five methods were sensitive to the number of aggregated elements, with higher numbers of assessed elements being associated with lower probability of reaching GES. To overcome this drawback, two new aggregation methods were developed with the aim to ensure that the probability of achieving GES was equal for each indicator, criteria, descriptor and the overall environmental status. This aim was termed as principal of equal probability (PEP). In practice, only one out of the two aggregation methods developed succeeded in maintaining PEP across all hierarchical levels. Whether PEP is imperative for multi-element ecosystem assessments remains to be debated, however, both scientists and managers should be aware of PEP and the implications of its violation.

AB  - Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to assess the stress conditions in water hyacinth along the Paraiba do Sul River (PSR), an important River in southeastern Brazil. The data were obtained at the end of the dry season of 2005 and at the end of the wet season of 2006. Changes in F-o and F-m parameters were observed as differentiated responses, depending on the season. Non-photochemical dissipation (qN and NPQ) from plants was greater in the most industrialized region of the PSR in both seasons. However, F-v/F-m for all samples ranged between 0.77 and 0.81, showing that high maximum quantum yield was maintained. Although the F-v/F-m suggests that the plants were exhibiting normal photochemical activities, ultrastructural changes in chloroplasts showed thylakoids disorganization. Plants from the most industrialized region showed non-stacking grana thylakoids disposition. In spite of these alterations, the membrane integrity was maintained, suggesting an adaptation to adjustment to adverse environmental conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess of the stability and repeatability of the biological soil-quality (BSQ) index over time and at short/long distances in agricultural soils of the Po Valley, Northern Italy, to support its correct use in soil-quality monitoring and is based on soil microarthropods representative of the structure, function and composition of ecological systems, but avoiding classification at the species level. Microarthropods are separated from the soil and weighted using the biological form approach to evaluate their level of adaptation to the soil environment. The field test was organized to assess time and scale effects in a landscape within the coordinates 45 degrees 00' to 45 degrees 16'N and 9 degrees 50' to 10 degrees 15'E for an estimated area of 200 km(2). The BSQ had, in different soils cropped with corn and fertilized with sewage sludge, an average value of 76.4 +/- 23.5; it appears to be reproducible both over short distances as well as over short periods of time, but no significant differences (p > 0.05) between years nor between farms were observed. In the landscape conditions tested, it appears reproducible and stable at a field and basin scale, though very sensitive to seasonal climatic variations. From a practical point of view, the information reported in this paper contributes to the standardization of the application of BSQ and provides reference values for this index in soils of the Northern Italy cropped with corn.

AB  - Reliable ecological indicators of wetland integrity are necessary for assessing recovery of restored wetlands; yet, little consensus currently exists on which indicators are most appropriate. We employed indicators derived from simple, standard measures of ecosystem function selected on the basis of ecological succession theory developed by [Science 164 (1969) 262; Bioscience 35 (1985) 419], which suggests that respiration: biomass ratios should increase in disturbed systems due to the diversion of energy from growth to maintenance. This hypothesis holds potential for the development of a simple ecological indicator and therefore was tested among prairie wetlands restored after drainage disturbance. No difference was observed in respiration: biomass ratios in restored wetlands and reference wetlands designated as controls. Plankton respiration or biomass may be poor indicators of disturbance because plankton responds quickly to re-establishment of a wetland hydrology regime and/or because different plankton species may have redundant function. We suggest employing more revealing assessment techniques that employ simultaneous examination of ecosystem structure and function to better characterize subtle or lingering effects of wetland disturbance after restoration.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are widely used as indicators of the health of freshwater ecosystems, responding both to water quality and to the hydromorphological integrity. In urban streams, evaluations can be tricky for the synergistic effects of multiple stressors and confounding factors. In these situations, the most broadly used multimetric indices can be used to assess the overall damage to the invertebrate community and, thus, the overall anthropogenic pressure, but they do not allow to understand the specific causal effects. Particularly, habitat loss due to morphological alterations can be difficult to evaluate, especially due to the often concurrent disturbance caused by water pollution. We used a multivariate approach to focus on the characteristics of the streams and rivers in an urban district and to define which macroinvertebrate metrics should be used to assess the influence of the different kinds of alteration in a severely damaged environment. Some metrics enabling the assessment of habitat loss (ratio of oligochaeta, ratio of filterers) were identified. These metrics may help to raise a better awareness in the evaluation of river restoration success and, thus, in the support of decision-making processes.

AB  - Aim To compare fire behaviour and fire management practice at a site managed continuously by traditional Aboriginal owners with other sites in tropical northern Australia, including the nearby Kakadu National Park, and relate those observations to indicators of landscape condition.
   Location Dukaladjarranj, a clan estate in north-central Arnhem Land, in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. The site abuts a vast sandstone plateau that is an internationally recognized cent re of plant and animal biodiversity.
   Methods Ecological assessments included: (1) mapping of the resource base of the estate from both traditional and ecological perspectives; (2) aerial survey of the extent of burning, distribution of the fire-sensitive native pine Callitris intratropica, rock habitats, and a range of macropod and other fauna resources; (3) fauna inventory; (4) detailed ecological assessment of the status of fire-sensitive vegetation; and (5) empirical assessment of the intensities of experimental fires. Ethnographic information concerning traditional fire management practice was documented in interviews with senior custodians.
   Results Experimental fires lit during the study were of low intensity compared with late dry season fires reported elsewhere, despite weather conditions favouring rapid combustion. In contrast to other parts of the savanna, fuel loads comprised mostly leaf litter and little grass. We found that (i) a large proportion of the estate had been burned during the year of the study (ii) burned sires attracted important animal food resources such as large macropods (iii) important plant foods remained abundant (iv) well represented in the landscape were fire sensitive vegetation types (e.g. Callitris intratropica Baker & Smith woodlands) and slow growing sandstone 'heath' typically dominated by myrtaceaous and proteaceous shrubs (v) diversity of vertebrate fauna was high, including rare or range-restricted species (vi) exotic plants were all but absent. Traditional practice includes regular, smaller fires, lit throughout the year, and cooperation with neighbouring clans in planning and implementing burning regimes.
   Main conclusions We attribute the ecological integrity of the site to continued human occupation and maintenance of traditional fire management practice, which suppresses otherwise abundant annual grasses (Sorghum spp.) and limits accumulation of fuels in perennial grasses (Triodia spp.) or other litter. Suppression of fuels and coordination of fire use combine to greatly reduce wildfire risk and to produce and maintain diverse habitats. Aboriginal people derive clear economic benefits from this style of management, as evidenced by abundant and diverse animal and plant foods. However, the motives for the Aboriginal management system are complex and include the fulfillment of social and religious needs, a factor that remains important to Aboriginal people despite the rapid and ongoing transformation of their traditional lifestyles. The implication of this study is that the maintenance of the biodiversity of the Arnhem Land plateau requires intensive, skilled management that can be best achieved by developing co-operative programmes with local indigenous communities.

AB  - During June and July, 2002, forty-seven stations were sampled within estuaries along the gulf coast of the state of Veracruz, MX, using a probabilistic survey design and a common set of response indicators. The objective of the study was to collect information to assess the condition of estuarine waters within the state of Veracruz, and to provide data that would strengthen future assessments of Gulf of Mexico estuaries. Samples for water quality, sediment contaminants, sediment toxicity, and benthic populations were collected in a manner consistent with EPA's National Coastal Assessment (NCA). Data were evaluated by comparing indicator measurements to tropical waters threshold values cited in US EPA's National Coastal Condition Report II, 2004, for tropical waters. In Veracruz, 75% of the area sampled rated poor for water quality, attributed primarily to high concentrations reported for chlorophyll a, and dissolved nutrients. One percent of the area exhibited poor sediment quality, based on PAH and metals concentrations. Compared to US estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico, water quality observed in Veracruz estuaries was more affected by nutrient over-enrichment. The probabilitistic nature of the survey design allowed for the comparison of the condition of Veracruz and the US GOM estuaries.

AB  - Most species of earthworm that inhabit the forests of the northern United States arc invasive and have been shown to alter soil composition and decrease the leaf-litter layer. These environmental changes could impact salamanders that live within leaf-litter and the invertebrates that they prey on. Our objective was to determine the potential impact that invasive earthworms have on salamander abundance and distribution at 36 sites within four forested ravines of Southwest Michigan, USA. We sampled earthworms using mustard extraction and estimated salamander abundance using cover boards to obtain salamander counts from north and south facing slopes, and at low and high elevations. We also collected environmental data that might influence the impact of earthworms, including soil moisture, leaf-litter cover, and soil pH. Salamander counts were negatively associated with epigeic earthworms, but not endogeic earthworms; whereas, increasing woody debris and soil moisture had a positive association with salamander counts. Leaf-litter cover and organic content of the A horizon had no significant effects on salamanders counts. Elevation and slope aspect, as independent factors, had no significant effect on salamander or earthworm distribution. Epigeic earthworms feed within the leaf-litter layer, which could lead to higher rates of salamander desiccation and allow them less time to forage for prey, along with a decline in soillitter invertebrates. This potential impact could be a part of an already suggested complex decline syndrome of Plethodontid salamanders, which are considered detrital keystone species in deciduous forests and ideal biological indicators of forest biological diversity and ecological integrity.

AB  - As anthropogenic pressures on fresh water continues, a balance must be achieved to ensure estuaries receive sufficient riverine inputs to sustain ecosystem health. With increased demand on freshwater resources upstream, salinities in the coastal systems may increase, providing an opportunity for encroachment or invasion by species with a higher salt tolerance. These events compromise ecosystem function, integrity and sustainability, particularly of native estuarine habitats. Estuarine dependent teleost fish species may be considered appropriate bioindicators of abiotic stressors. While estuarine fish have a wide tolerance of many environmental conditions, each species has its own tolerance range and/or sensitivity, and at specific phases during their life cycle. A statistical analysis was conducted to better understand the relationship of Ictalurus furcatus (blue catfish), Brevoortia patronus (Gulf menhaden) and Lagodon rhomboides (pinfish) to abiotic parameters associated with freshwater inflows (i.e. salinity, nutrients, turbidity, etc). Data for this study were collected in Galveston Bay, Texas (USA) by various state agencies and spanned 124 seasons between 1979 and 2010. Distance based linear models were run to determine correlations between the selected indicator species and water quality parameters known to be related to freshwater inflows. These relationships were visualized with Spearman vectors overlain on principal coordinates analysis plots. Blue catfish and Gulf menhaden displayed a significant inverse correlation with salinity and significant positive correlation with NO3- +NO2- (mu M), DIN:DIP and turbidity (NTU). During periods of drought, blue catfish were found closest to the river mouth, where salinity was lowest when considering other locations within Galveston Bay. Gulf menhaden maintain a wider distribution across the Bay as they have a wider salinity range tolerance. Pinfish display a significant positive correlation with salinity and temperature within Galveston Bay; as bioindicators this species is expected to be more tolerant to higher salinities. These relationships support the potential use of these species as beneficial indicators of changing estuarine conditions, namely freshwater inflows. Further study is essential to determine if these and/or other species can be applied to other bays along the Texas coast as well as other sub-tropical estuarine systems in which they are found.

AB  - Many ecological responses to environmental variables or anthropogenic agents are difficult and expensive to measure. Therefore it is attractive to describe such responses in terms of indicators that are easier to measure. In ecosystem management, indicators can be used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in an environmental feature. The aim of this paper is to show that it is important to take Liebig's law of the minimum into consideration to understand when it is appropriate or inappropriate to use ecological indicators based on abundance. When developing indicators that relate the abundance of an organism to an environmental factor, it is likely that this relationship will be polygonal rather than a simple linear relationship. The upper boundary of the distribution describes how abundance is limited by this factor, while the variation below the upper boundary is explained by situations when factors other than the factor of interest limit abundance. The variation below the upper boundary of the distribution means that the use of indicators to examine spatial patterns in the response of abundance to an environmental factor can be problematic. Thus, while abundance-based indicators can identify sites that are in a good condition, they are less useful to detect those affected by environmental degradation. In contrast, abundance-based ecological indicators may enable temporal monitoring of the impact of environmental factors, as it is expected that limiting factors are less variable in time than in space. In conclusion, when multiple factors are limiting, a significant correlation between an indicator and a variable is not enough to validate the status of a factor as an indicator.

AB  - The cytotoxic effects of the herbicide alachlor were compared on rainbow trout gonadal RTG-2 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. The end points evaluated in both cells after 24, 48, and 72 h of exposure were total protein content (PC), lysosomal function, and mitochondrial's integrity by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. After 24 h, cytoplasmic membrane integrity by cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and LDH intracellular activity were also studied. In addition, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) was quantified in SH-SY5Y cells. The possible biotransformation of alachlor by RTG-2 cells was investigated by analyzing the exposure culture medium by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In RTG-2, EC50 values on PC, lysosomal function, and SDH activity after 24 h exposure ranged from 80 to 95 mu M and decreased to approximately 40 mu M for longer exposure time periods. SH-SY5Y cells were slightly more sensitive than RTG-2 cells, with EC50 values on PC and lysosomal function ranging from 87 to 75 mu M at 24 h and decreasing to 47 mu M and 34 mu M at 72 h, respectively. AChE activity was increased, being the most sensitive marker for SH-SY5Y with an EC50 of 20 mu M at 24 h. The metabolic enzyme SDH was stimulated in SH-SY5Y and reduced in RTG-2 cells. At the studied conditions, no metabolites of alachlor were detected in RTG-2 cultures. In conclusion, the proposed battery approach is an effective screening tool for the safety assessment of environmental contaminants as a complement to fish and animal toxicity procedures.

AB  - The Government of the Republic of Armenia (RA) strives to ensure the measures to achieve good ecological status for Armenian surface water bodies. However, the main goal remains unaccomplished, as the hydro-biological monitoring tools are not properly developed. Thus, the current work aims at contributing to the establishment of principles and a relevant and cost-effective biological monitoring tool for the RA aquatic ecosystems, through the development of a simplified multimetric index (MMI). Since the adoption of the decree N degrees 927-N from 11 Jun 2011, the baseline studies have been initiated in the six river basin management areas established in the RA. The current work is summing up the results for the Arpa River system in order to test the methodology. In particular, it is testing the possibility to develop MMI based on the use of Rapid Biological Assessment protocol accepted in our monitoring system. Also, the work represents the approach of bottom-up biotic validation of reference sites established in the recent hydro-biologic monitoring system. Due to the proposed validation procedure, further use of one of the established reference sites in the case study object has been rejected. Considering well-established approaches for MMI development in EU member states, four variations of MMI were developed for a particular river system, and the combination of N-taxa-%EPT-Abundance(ind/m(2))-BMWP-ASPT-FBI-N-family metrics has been proposed as the main one. However, further development of a river typology and the establishment of joint reference conditions in the Caucasus region have concluded as a priority.

AB  - Developing ecological models for accurately predicting the dynamics of a population and individual physiological processes in field conditions is a challenging task for ecosystem management and ecological risk assessment. Here, we propose to assess the relevance of a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model calibrated using data previously generated from laboratory experiments for adult three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) living in semi-natural conditions. We compared different ways of integrating different data sets such as temperature and prey abundance obtained in mesocosm experiments to assess the predictive capacity of the model. By this study, we provide recommendations for developing an appropriate environmental scenario (e.g. natural variations of food and temperature) for using a DEB model in a field context. We conclude that a DEB model calibrated with laboratory data can be used to predict the physiological processes of an organism living in semi-natural conditions, but that the reproductive behaviour of the organism can affect the predictions. At last, we suggest that further studies on the feeding behaviour may be necessary for immature organisms.

AB  - Feeding interactions among functional feeding groups (FFGs) of macroinvertebrates are robust indicators of aquatic ecosystem interactions. They provide information regarding organic matter processing, habitat condition and trophic dynamics. In tropical rivers with pronounced wet and dry seasons, macroinvertebrate based ecological monitoring tools are explicitly focused on metrics and indices, while ignoring interactions of FFG5. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the functional feeding type metrics, diversity indices and feeding interactions among FFG5 of macroinvertebrates along the water pollution gradient in Gilgel Gibe watershed, Ethiopia. Water quality parameters and macroinvertebrate community attributes were assessed for samples collected from upstream sites (15 sites), urban-impacted stretches (12 sites) and wetland-affected river zones (7 sites) of the watershed during the rainy (July) and dry (February) seasons. To understand the effect of pollution on the feeding interactions, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed. Macroinvertebrate-based diversity indices and functional feeding type metric showed deterioration of ecological integrity at the urban-impacted sites and substantial recovery in the wetland-affected downstream sites. Omnivorous feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates was noted for the upstream sites, whereas clear trophic guilds of FFG5 were suggested for the wetland-affected river zones by the stable isotope results. The results of pollution gradient analysis and feeding interactions among FFGs revealed that the urban-impacted sites showed weaker interactions when compared to upstream and wetland influenced sites. This affirms the potential importance of feeding interactions among FFGs of macroinvertebrates in water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are without spinal cord living organisms that spend their main phases of metamorphosis in water; so, changing the ecological structure of their communities represents environmental health condition. The main purpose of this study was to identify the macroinvertebrate families as a biological indicator and, consequently, determining the water ecological quality in the Ghezel Ozan River, NW Iran. The sampling was conducted at 18 stations in autumn 2017. At the same time, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity, fecal and total coliform, BOD5, COD, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, chloride, and sulfate were measured based on APHA in each station. Then, based on the collected data, the NSFWQI, IRWQIsc, EQR, and BMWP/ASPT indices were calculated. In total, 1778 individual belong to 12 orders and 22 families were identified, which the most abundant order was Ephemeroptera by 47.8%. Except for the pH, COD, DO, and nitrogen compounds, other studied parameters were exceeded from their acceptable level. It seems that the geological characteristics are very effective in changing the parameters especially salinity. The best water quality was at Kharmaneh-Sar station (7), which runs from the protected area at high altitudes without human pressure. Also, the trend of water quality decreases from the upstream to downstream, which is completely in line with human activities. Therefore, the results of this study can well illustrate the role of land use and geology changes on the macroinvertebrate communities, which can be used to evaluate the ecological integrity of the river. Regular monitoring of river water quality and controlling and managing the quantity and quality of fish farms along the river can help in the ecological health of the river.

AB  - Dams and diversions in rivers often alter flow regimes, which in turn can affect stream biota, particularly when the novel conditions are dramatically different from those under which native species evolved.
   Management of regulated rivers can include development of environmental flows that seek to restore ecological integrity. However, designing a flow regime that adequately supports aquatic biodiversity requires quantifiable metrics of hydrologic variability that directly relate to aquatic species diversity.
   This study examined both regulated and unregulated montane rivers over 3years within the marked seasonality of California's Mediterranean climate to determine which quantifiable elements of a flow regime were most correlated with changes in the biologic community, using stream invertebrates during the summer low flow period as an indicator.
   Boosted regression trees were used to assess relationships between quantifiable metrics of flow regimes and the invertebrate community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and a multi-response permutation procedure were used to analyze general trends in invertebrate assemblage patterns between rivers and years. Results indicated that hydrologic alteration corresponded to differences in invertebrate community composition, and that metrics related to the spring snowmelt recession and variability in summer water temperature had the greatest relative influence on invertebrate community diversity.
   Rivers exhibiting longer duration spring recessions, lower daily rates of change during the spring recession, and stable water temperatures during summer supported relatively higher invertebrate community diversity. These relationships suggest that quantifiable metrics associated with seasonal flow variability and predictability should be an integral part of environmental flow design and monitoring.

AB  - The analysis of multiple biomarker responses is nowadays recognized as a valuable tool to circumvent potential confounding factors affecting biomonitoring studies and allows a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying exposure to natural mixtures of toxicants. For the purpose of an environmental risk assessment (ERA) in an impacted estuary in SW Europe (the Sado, Portugal), juvenile Solea senegalensis from commercial fishing areas were surveyed for histopathological liver alterations and biochemical biomarkers. Although the findings revealed moderate differences in the patterns of histopathological traits between urban/industrial- and agricultural-influenced areas within the same estuary, no significant distinction was found between the cumulative alterations in animals from the two sites. The overall level of histopathological injury was low and severe traits like neoplasms or pre-neoplastic foci were absent. While metallothionein induction and lipid peroxidation could relate to histopathological condition indices, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes appeared to be impaired in animals collected off the estuary's heavy-industry belt (the most contaminated site), which may partially explain some degree of hepatic integrity loss. Overall, the results are consistent with low-moderate contamination of the estuary and indicate that oxidative stress is the most important factor accounting for differences between sites. The study highlights the need of integrating multiple biomarkers when multiple environmental stressors are involved and the advantages of surveying toxicity effects in field-collected, foraging, organisms.

AB  - Soil and litter arthropods are important in many forest ecosystem processes where they help to regulate nutrient dynamics and soil quality, and are useful bioindicators of ecosystem condition and change. This study was initiated in response to concerns about possible decline in site productivity due to intensive forestry practices. We investigated the effects of tree harvesting and site preparation treatments on soil and litter arthropod abundance in a loblolly pine plantation in eastern Texas, USA. Using soil and litter cores, we sampled abundance of selected arthropods over two years following tree harvesting. Response to treatments varied somewhat among arthropod taxa. Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails), the numerically dominant taxa in core samples, were initially higher in abundance in less intensive harvesting and site preparation treatments. However, after 2 years, abundance of these arthropods was comparable in all harvesting and site preparation treatments. Fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus had a strong positive effect on abundance of most arthropod groups in the second year of the study. The recovery of arthropod abundance through time suggests that the silvicultural practices used did not jeopardize the ecological integrity of the site. The results reported here contrast with other similar studies which suggests that soil and litter arthropod communities respond differently in different geographic locations and forest types. Further comparative and extensive studies of this nature are needed therefore for a deeper understanding of the impacts of forest management practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to conduct a techno-economic life-extension analysis for fixed offshore wind turbines for the purpose of classification and certification. The early installed offshore wind turbines are approaching the end of their design service lives. The life extension of these structures is under serious consideration as the support structures are still in a condition for further use. Hence, it is technically possible and economically beneficial to investigate roadmaps for potential life-extension decisions. The methodology developed to analyse the life-extension projects merges a structural integrity assessment of a monopile structure with a corrosion-induced crack development with an economic analysis of the return on assets accounting for the likelihood of obtaining the estimated return. The methodology commences with preprocessing the structural health monitoring data using a Gaussian kernel for denoising, followed by a time-domain crack growth analysis accounting for retardation performed on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The corrosion-related failure mechanisms are growing concerns for currently operating monopile offshore wind turbines. The present study introduces a novel nonlinear corrosion model to address the emergent issue, which is developed considering the spatial and temporal changes in the environmental and operational parameters and the reinforcing effect of fracture on the corrosion. The failure assessment diagram identifies the threshold based on the maintenance cost calculated with a confidence level. The economic analysis combines revenue estimates and operational expenditures, considering the life-extension duration and appropriate discount rate. The results of the life-extension assessment, presented through a risk-return diagram, are used to classify the life-extension projects using unsupervised machine learning k-means clustering algorithm.

AB  - Mod 9Cr-1Mo steel (T91) is a candidate material for pressure vessels and for some internal structures of GCR (Gas Cooled Reactors). In order to validate this choice, it is necessary, firstly to verify that it is able to withstand the planned environmental and operating conditions, and secondly to check if it is covered by the existing design codes, concerning its procurement, fabrication, welding, examination methods and mechanical design rules. A large R&D program on mod 9Cr-1Mo steel has been undertaken at CEA in order to characterize the behaviour of this material and of its welded junctions. In this program, the role of the Laboratory for structural Integrity and Standards (LISN) is to develop high temperature defect assessment procedures under fatigue and creep loadings. Concerning the GCR, complementary studies are conducted in order to validate the existing methods (developed for the fast reactors) and to get new experimental data on Mod 9Cr-1Mo steel. Moreover, if the geometry and the loadings of a standard CT specimen allow performing a 2D analysis, the case of industrial loadings appears much more complicated, notably because of surface defects which propagate and present shapes that can be considered as half ellipse. Therefore, in the frame of the defect assessment methods validation, the LISN undertakes both standard tests on CT specimens to determine the propagation laws and bending tests on large plates under high temperature fatigue and creep loadings. These components present an initial semi-elliptical surface notch normal to the loading direction and its initiation and propagation are studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to perform a human and ecological risk assessment of pharmaceutical products (PPs) in natural waters, it is necessary to accurately quantify a broad variety of PPs at low concentrations. Although numerous currently implemented analytical methodologies, less is known about the preservation of PPs in natural water samples within the period before analysis (holding time, storage conditions). This paper is the first literature review about the stability of PPs in natural waters (surface and groundwaters) during sample storage. The current work focuses on a comparison of the performances of the available preservation techniques (filtration, container materials, storage temperature, preservative agents, etc.) for PPs in samples. All 58 reviewed PPs may be successfully stabilized during 7 days in surface waters by at least one appropriate methodology regarding temperature, acidic and non-acidic preservatives. When temperature is not a sufficient preservation parameter for some PPs (hormones and fluoxetine) its combination with the addition of chemical agents into the samples may prolong the integrity of the PPs during storage in surface water. There is a strong need to use standard protocols to assess and compare the stability of PPs in environmental water matrices during storage as well as during analytical preparation or analysis (European criteria 2002/657/EC). Since the stability of PPs during sample storage is a critical parameter that could call into question the quality of the data provided for the concentrations, the design of stability studies should rigorously take into account all critical parameters that could impact the concentrations of the PPs with time.

AB  - The long-term ecological recovery of an impaired stream in response to an industrial facility's pollution abatement actions and the implications of the biological monitoring effort to environmental management is the subject of this special issue of Environmental Management. This final article focuses on the synthesis of the biological monitoring program's components and methods, the efficacy of various biological monitoring techniques to environmental management, and the lessons learned from the program that might be applicable to the design and application of other programs. The focus of the 25-year program has been on East Fork Poplar Creek, an ecologically impaired stream in Oak Ridge, Tennessee with varied and complex stressors from a Department of Energy facility in its headwaters. Major components of the long-term program included testing and monitoring of invertebrate and fish toxicity, bioindicators of fish health, fish contaminant accumulation, and instream communities (including periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrate, and fish). Key parallel components of the program include water chemistry sampling and data management. Multiple lines of evidence suggested positive ecological responses during three major pollution abatement periods. Based on this case study and the related literature, effective environmental management of impaired streams starts with program design that is consistent across space and time, but also adaptable to changing conditions. The biological monitoring approaches used for the program provided a strong basis for assessments of recovery from remedial actions, and the likely causes of impairment. This case study provides a unique application of multidisciplinary and quantitative techniques to address multiple and complex regulatory and programmatic goals, environmental stressors, and remedial actions.

AB  - Although dams have impounded the majority of the world's altered watercourses, there is a growing awareness of the importance of mitigating or reversing some of the negative effects on aquatic ecosystems and the related services they provide. We used an ecosystem approach, including detailed studies on hydrology, geomorphology, invertebrates, fish, and food web dynamics on a river altered by waterpower production and a natural flowing river to assess system responses to a change in the altered flow regime (specifically the ramping rate or rate of change of flow). Although there was significant alteration in the flow and sediment regimes under the original restricted ramping rate regime, differences in many biotic variables in the two rivers were not significant including total invertebrate abundance and diversity, fish biomass, fish condition, and food web length. However, significant differences in the abundance and distribution of some sensitive invertebrate taxa and fish diversity were observed between the altered and natural flowing rivers as was the energy base of the food web, measured with stable isotopes. The altered river had lower overall abundance of Odonata, Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, and Diptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Coleoptera increase in abundance towards the deeper and higher velocity thalweg. On average, d13C values were lighter in altered sites compared to unaltered sites, likely due to carbon export from the upstream reservoir. Results will inform Canadian federal and provincial policy concerning the efficacy of ramping rate restrictions as a tool to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with peaking waterpower dam operations.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates are commonly used biological indicators for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems. However, counting all the invertebrates in the large samples that are usually collected for rapid site assessment is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, sub-sampling is often done with fixed time or fixed count live-sorting in the field or with preserved material using sample splitters in the laboratory. We investigate the differences between site assessments provided when the two sub-sampling approaches (Live-sort and Lab-sort) were used in conjunction with predictive bioassessment models. The samples showed a method bias. The Live-sort sub-samples tended to have more large, conspicuous invertebrates and often fewer small and, or cryptic animals that were more likely to be found in Lab-sort samples where a microscope was used. The Live-sort method recovered 4-6 more taxa than Lab-sorting in spring, but not in autumn. The magnitude of the significant differences between Live-sort and Lab-sort predictive model outputs, observed to expected (O/E) taxa scores, for the same sites ranged from 0.12 to 0.53. These differences in the methods resulted in different assessments of some sites only and the number of sites that were assessed differently depended on the season, with spring samples showing most disparity. The samples may differ most in spring because many of the invertebrates are larger at that time (and thus are more conspicuous targets for live-sorters). The Live-sort data cannot be run through a predictive model created from Lab-sort data (and vice versa) because of the taxonomic differences in sub-sample composition and the sub-sampling methods must be standardized within and among studies if biological assessment is to provide valid comparisons of site condition. Assessments that rely on the Live-sorting method may indicate that sites are 'less impaired' in spring compared to autumn because more taxa are retrieved in spring when they are larger and more visible. Laboratory sub-sampling may return fewer taxa in spring, which may affect assessments relying on taxonomic richness.

AB  - Objective measures of forest ecosystem condition are needed to gauge the effects of management activities and natural phenomena on sustainability. The Bioindicators of Forest Condition Project seeks to develop a Forest Condition Rating (FCR) system using a physiological, remote sensing approach. In particular, the goal of the project is to test whether hyperspectral remote sensing may be used to infer stand-level information about pigment concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence, and other physiological features of condition. The project spans a four-year period of intensive sampling in tolerant hardwood forests in Ontario using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). For each airborne campaign, concurrent ground-based sampling for leaf physiological features was performed. Controlled laboratory and greenhouse studies were also conducted to derive relationships between leaf-based spectral measurements and physiology in the presence of environmental stresses. The project has identified several promising bioindicators of strain that are discernible from hyperspectral images and related to ground-based physiology. The most promising remote indicator for semi-operational testing is estimation of chlorophyll content, which can be used to classify maple stands on a five-stage scale of health. Chlorophyll fluorescence has also been discerned from spectral signatures, but our studies indicate it may be confounded by chlorophyll content. The intent here is to update the forestry community on progress made, insights gained, and the practical implications of the research.

AB  - The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement stipulates that the Governments of Canada and the United States are responsible for restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. Due to varying mandates and areas of expertise, monitoring to assess progress towards this objective is conducted by a multitude of Canadian and U. S. federal and provincial/state agencies, in cooperation with academia and regional authorities. This paper highlights selected long-term monitoring programs and discusses a number of documented ecological changes that indicate the present state of the open and nearshore waters of the Great Lakes.

AB  - The generally negative effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the quality of habitats for species viability makes it a common focus of conservation assessment and prioritization efforts. Although many available spatial models and metrics (e.g., distance to or density of disturbance) characterize impact patterns of anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape, a general evaluation of model performance against empirical measurements of ecological integrity is lacking. We tested both distance-based and disturbance-density models in relation to ecological indicators. The models included roads, residential and commercial development, agricultural land use, mining, energy development infrastructure, and transmission structures as disturbance sources. Model parameters were based on expert input and results from the published literature. The disturbance models were tested against two disparate and independent measures of habitat quality: a floristic quality index and measures of greater sagegrouse population integrity. Floristic quality scores were significantly lower in vegetation plots closer to disturbances in a general distance-based disturbance model across Colorado. Although the proportion of variation in floristic quality explained by anthropogenic disturbance was relatively low (8.5-11.8%), it appeared to represent a ubiquitous baseline negative effect of proximity to anthropogenic disturbance on the quality of vegetation communities. For both distance-and density-based greater sage-grouse models, modeled disturbance indices were significantly lower (10-12 times) near active than historic leks, and numbers of males counted at leks increased significantly (3.2-3.4 times) as modeled disturbance decreased. Our findings indicate that as a general class, geospatial models can depict effects of anthropogenic disturbance on both plant communities and individual animal species. Empirical validation of disturbance models focused on other species or regions is recommended to further evaluate the utility and reliability of these methods.

AB  - Secondary production of the benthic community was estimated in the four functional habitats identified in the pristine Pioverna stream (Northern Italy): riffle, pool, transition and bedrock habitats. The instantaneous growth, removal-summation and size-frequency methods were used to estimate production. Twelve taxa reached appreciable densities and presumably accounted for most of total benthic production. Three of them belong to the Plecoptera, seven to the Ephemeroptera and one each to Diptera and Trichoptera. The riffle habitat had the highest secondary production, while bedrock habitat had the lowest. Pool and transition habitats showed intermediate production values. Shredders and predators were the major component of production in pools, with a low contribution of gathering collectors. In riffles, this last category and scrapers had the highest production, with shredders, predators and filtering collectors showing decreasing production values. In general terms, shredders, gathering collectors and scrapers contributed most to total production. The rank-production curves for the habitats are reported. In riffles, a proportionally high evenness of the most productive taxa was noted. In contrast, in the pool habitat a steep curve was recognised. The potential of comparing rank/production curves and changes in reference species production between unaltered and impacted stream habitats and sites is discussed as a means to estimate ecological integrity. For site comparisons of secondary production in the alpine area, the riffle habitat is suggested as the most adequate, as it shows a lower dominance and more taxa contributing to overall production. The calculation of secondary production for indicator and dominant taxa in the different habitats should constitute an effective way to describe some functional aspects of the community to assess the ecological integrity of mountain streams.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate communities have been widely used as a tool for assessing the environmental quality of freshwater ecosystems, whereas zooplankton communities have been to some extent neglected. However, the importance of using different indicators to achieve a more comprehensive framework of assessment regarding water quality has been recognized. This study compared estimates of species richness (number of species) and the Shannon Wiener index for data on macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities in tropical reservoirs and related them to their trophic state. The trop+hic classification was obtained by applying the Carlson index (1977) modified by Toledo et al. (1983), and the index of the Brazilian Society of the Environmental Technology Agency. The comparative response of the different indicators was analyzed using a series of bivariate correlations (Draftsman's plot). The results illustrate that diversity measures, namely species richness, responded differently when related to the trophic classification of reservoirs, depending on the community considered. The species richness of zooplankton was positively related to hypereutrophic conditions, due to the higher number of rotifer species, including tolerant generalist species and at the same time, as a result of the exclusion of species from other groups, whereas for macroinvertebrates, species richness was negatively related to hypereutrophic conditions. Melanoides tuberculatus, which exhibits a high tolerance and competitive ability under such conditions, was the dominant species in macroinvertebrate communities, which excluded endemic species and reduced local richness and diversity. The same indicators applied to the zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities might therefore provide contradictory responses regarding ecological quality assessment in tropical reservoirs, which suggest that zooplankton should be taken into account among the biological quality elements considered in the ecological quality assessment, management, and restoration of water bodies.

AB  - Baseflow is an integral component of environmental flow prescriptions to mitigate the impacts of flow regime alteration on the ecological condition of rivers and often the most contentious issue in project planning, particularly for waterpower development. Baseflow prescriptions to meet ecological objectives are increasingly derived from a natural reference condition, often a simulated streamflow time series for an ungauged basin. Accuracy of baseflow estimates is important for identifying ecological water requirements and possible ecosystem and economic tradeoffs with confidence. Estimating baseflow time series in ungauged basins to accurately quantify a natural reference condition in all regions of Ontario is particularly difficult given the heterogeneity in landscape, climate, and size of the basins where simulated time series are required. To identify the optimal hydrologic model for baseflow simulation in all regions of Ontario, five variants of McMaster University-Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (MAC-HBV) were tested using a combination of possible model parameters, linear and nonlinear storage-discharge relationship in deep soil layers, and different criteria for optimizing model parameter sets. It was found that the hydrologic model which used a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship, a larger range of model parameters and included low flow criteria in the optimization procedure showed the best performance for baseflow estimates. The optimal model was then combined with a coupled regionalization method to improve baseflow estimates in ungauged basins compared with the original MAC-HBV model. This included a similar to 20% increase in the median of Nash Sutcliffe efficiencies and a 50% reduction in the volume errors for the tested basins. The resulting model provides a tool that can be used reliably throughout Ontario to simulate streamflow and baseflow time series in ungauged basins and to calculate baseflow indicators and criteria for aquatic ecosystem assessments of planned flow regime alterations.

AB  - The idea behind multimetric indices is to integrate information from several metrics to provide a general classification of water bodies without losing the particularities of each individual metric. Historically, multimetric indices use information on richness, taxon sensitivity, and taxonomic diversity. Recently, functional and phylogenetic diversity proved to capture different dimensions of biodiversity. Here we asked if these new metrics provide complementary information to classical metrics and should be included in multimetric indices. We used an index construction protocol based on statistical filters to test candidate metrics for range, sensitivity, and redundancy. We used macroinvertebrate data from streams located in a Savanna region of Brazil, encompassing a gradient of impact, to test our ideas. Of 41 candidate metrics, functional dispersion of functional diversity, mean nearest neighbor distance of phylogenetic diversity, and four classical metrics passed the filter selection composing the final multimetric index. Our results indicated that functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics indeed responded to environmental impact and complemented the information provided by classical metrics. We suggest that future indices should consider including new metrics of functional and phylogenetic diversity to properly monitor multiple dimensions of biodiversity.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is a key activity for the long-term survival of human-environmental systems and the assessment of agricultural sustainability has been gaining increasing relevance. In spite of several proposals developed, there is not a holistic approach that can be generally applied to assess sustainability of irrigated agricultural areas. In this paper we present a framework and associated indicators for the assessment of sustainability of irrigated agricultural systems in different contexts and locations. The framework covers four main sustainability dimensions: environmental integrity, economic resilience and profitability, social wellbeing and good governance. This approach was tested in 10 agricultural areas in eight different countries that represent a wide variety of situations in terms of agricultural development, environmental conditions, socio-economic settings and political contexts, but that share the fact that water use is a critical aspect for agricultural development. The obtained results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to obtain a holistic picture of sustainability in irrigated agriculture areas, even in situations of poor data availability. It is also an excellent starting point for the construction of roadmaps towards more sustainable agricultural systems.

AB  - Wetland plants, due to their sedentary nature, hold great potential for use as indicators of ecosystem condition in the Great Lakes. However, natural variations in lake levels have historically confounded efforts to create such indicators. Our goal was to use zone-level vegetation data collected over a seven-year period of low to high water levels to overcome these difficulties and identify metrics capable of accurately reflecting disturbance despite lake-level variation. Through a combination of multivariate statistical analyses and a review of the literature, we identified and tested a series of plant-based metrics for wet meadow, emergent, and submergent zones of lacustrine coastal wetlands of Western Lake Huron. These were combined into zone-specific indicators of ecosystem health, which were then applied to wetlands of the remaining Great Lakes to assess basin-wide viability. The resulting indicators were found to reflect disturbance without bias towards high or low water levels. While they must be assessed for use in riverine and barrier-beach coastal wetlands before full-scale implementation can occur, we suggest their use on a preliminary basis in monitoring and management efforts.

AB  - Because dragonflies are very sensitive to alien trees, we assessed their response to large-scale restoration of riparian corridors. We compared three types of disturbance regime-alien invaded, cleared of alien vegetation, and natural vegetation (control)-and recorded data on 22 environmental variables. The most significant variables in determining dragonfly assemblages were percentage of bank cover and tree canopy cover, which indicates the importance of vegetation architecture for these dragonflies. This finding suggests that it is important to restore appropriate marginal vegetation and sunlight conditions. Recovery of dragonfly assemblages after the clearing of alien trees was substantial. Species richness and abundance at restored sites matched those at control sites. Dragonfly assemblage patterns reflected vegetation succession. Thus, initially eurytopic, widespread species were the main beneficiaries of the removal of alien trees, and stenotopic, endemic species appeared after indigenous vegetation recovered over time. Important indicator species were the two national endemics (Allocnemis leucosticta and Pseudagrion furcigerum), which, along with vegetation type, can be used to monitor return of overall integrity of riparian ecology and to make management decisions. Endemic species as a whole responded positively to restoration, which suggests that indigenous vegetation recovery has major benefits for irreplaceable and widespread generalist species.

AB  - Effects of landscape metrics and land-use variables on macroinvertebrate communities and habitat characteristics
   The growing number of studies establishing links between stream biota, environmental factors and river classification has contributed to a better understanding of fluvial ecosystem function. Environmental factors influencing river systems are distributed over hierarchically organised spatial scales. We used a nested hierarchical sampling design across four catchments to assess how benthic macroinvertebrate community composition and lower spatial scale habitat descriptors were shaped by landscape and land-use patterns. We found that benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and composition varied significantly from catchment to habitat level. We assessed and identified fractal metrics of landscape descriptors capable of explaining compositional and functional change in the benthic faunal indicators and compared them with the traditional variables describing land use and reach level habitat descriptors within a 1 km radius of each sampling site. We found that fractal landscape metrics were the best predictor variables for benthic rnacroinvertebrate community composition, function, instream habitat and river corridor characteristics.

AB  - Keratinous 'soft tissue' structures (i.e. epidermally derived and originally non-biomineralized), include feathers, skin, claws, beaks, and hair. Despite their relatively common occurrence in the fossil record (second only to bone and teeth), few studies have addressed natural degradation processes that must occur in all organic material, including those keratinous structures that are incorporated into the rock record as fossils. Because feathers have high preservation potential and strong phylogenetic signal, in the current study we examine feathers subjected to different burial environments for a duration of similar to 10 years, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ immunofluorescence (IF). We use morphology and persistence of specific immunoreactivity as indicators of preservation at the molecular and microstructural levels. We show that feather keratin is durable, demonstrates structural and microstructural integrity, and retains epitopes suitable for specific antibody recognition in even the harshest conditions. These data support the hypothesis that keratin antibody reactivity can be used to identify the nature and composition of epidermal structures in the rock record, and to address evolutionary questions by distinguishing between alpha- (widely distributed) and beta- (limited to sauropsids) keratin.

AB  - A procedure to select the most relevant metrics for assessing the ecological condition of the Douro basin (north Portugal) was developed based upon a set of 184 benthic community metrics. They were grouped into 16 biological categories selected from literature using data collected over 2 years from 54 sites along 31 rivers covering the whole perceived range of human disturbance. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the main trends in the macroinvertebrate data, to select reference versus impaired sites, to avoid multicolinearity between metrics, and to identify those that were clearly independent from natural stream typology. Structural metrics, adaptation metrics, and tolerance measures most effectively responded across a range of human influence. We find these attributes to be ecologically sound for monitoring Portugal's lotic ecosystems and providing information relevant to the Water Framework Directive, which asserts that the definition of water quality depends on its "ecological status", independent of the actual or potential uses of those waters.

AB  - This contribution aims at understanding the storage techniques used in the past by means of studying the entomological and plant remains present in the pre-hispanic granary of Risco Pintado, dated between the IX and XV centuries cal AD. This type of granary groups together a large number of silos excavated in the volcanic rig situated on steep escarpments, difficult to access and easy to defend. The exceptional environmental conditions of these infrastructures have allowed the desiccated remains of the stored plant products and the pests associated with such storage to be preserved within the silos. The domestic species documented include cereals (barley and wheat), legumes (broad beans and lentils) and fruits (figs), as well as other gathered indigenous plants. Together with these remains, insects that developed as primary and secondary storage pests are recorded (grain weevil and sawtoothed grain beetle). To combat these infestations, the ancient Canarians used a number of natural insecticides (laurel and lentisk). The presence of these pests is analysed as an indicator of long-term storage and of the strategies developed to ensure the integrity of stored plant resources.

AB  - The Floristic Quality Index (FQI) has been proposed as a tool that can be used to identify areas of high conservation value, monitor sites over time, assess the anthropogenic impacts affecting an area, and measure the ecological condition of an area. FQI is based on the Coefficient of Conservatism (C), which is a numerical score assigned to each plant species in a local flora, primarily from best professional judgment, that reflects the likelihood that a species is found in natural habitats. FQI is computed by multiplying the mean Coefficient of Conservatism ((C) over bar) by the square root of species richness for an observational unit. Great Lakes coastal wetlands were used to assess the properties and performance of various species richness, Coefficient of Conservatism, and Floristic Quality indices, as well as compare C-value assignments from two U.S. states (Wisconsin and Michigan). FQI and species richness increased with sampling area according to a power function, but (C) over bar more or less remained constant. Sampling schemes should therefore focus on controlling sampling area and minimally sampling each community type at a site. In some cases, Wisconsin and Michigan assigned different values of C to the same species, highlighting possible effects due to the somewhat subjective nature of C-value assignment. Coefficient of Conservatism and Floristic Quality indices were better at discriminating differences between sites, independent of a condition gradient, than species richness alone, but neither index type outperformed the other. Both types of indices were also found to be acceptable ecological indicators of condition, although Floristic Quality indices consistently outperformed Coefficient of Conservatism indices in this capacity. Regardless of the subjectivity involved with the assignment of C-values and that 'floristic quality' is a human concept and not a true ecosystem property, both Coefficient of Conservatism and Floristic Quality indices seem to be effective indicators of condition in Great Lakes coastal wetlands.

AB  - The production of resting cysts in four species of dinoflagellates (Scrippsiella trochoidea, Ensiculifera sp., Alexandrium lusitanicum and Lingulodinium polyedra) was studied in response to several environmental factors of ecological importance (nitrate, phosphate, iron, copper and cyanocobalamin deficiencies, high concentrations of copper, turbulence, darkness plus concentration, as well as various media biologically conditioned by dinoflagellates) using unialgal cultures and enrichments of natural populations. Some nutritional deficiencies, mainly phosphorus or nitrogen (in this order), are the most effective inducers of encystment. Among the other deficiencies tested, only iron deficiency was important, affecting only A.lusitanicum. In some cases, biological conditioning produced considerable encystment reductions, making it an important means of competition between species. We suggest that encystment may be induced in these neritic species by deficiencies in compounds that act as indicators of changes in the hydrographic conditions to which the particular species are adapted.

AB  - The second half of the 20th century witnessed substantial progress in the assurance and verification of microbiological integrity, i.e., safety and sensory quality, of drinking water. Enteropathogenic agents, such as particular viruses and protozoa, not previously identified as transmitted by industrially provided water supplies, were demonstrated to cause disease outbreaks, when ingested with piped water. The potential harm posed by carry-over of orally toxic metabolites of organisms, producing 'algal' (cyanophytic) blooms, was considered. In addition, earlier observations on the colonization of attenuated drinking water bodies by a variety of oligotrophic Gram-negative bacteria were confirmed and extended. This new evidence called for updating both water purification technologies and analytical methodology, serving to verify that goals had been attained.
   For the former purpose, the hazard analysis empowering control of critical practices (HACCP) strategy, introduced about 1960 in industrial food processing, was successfully adopted. Elimination, devitalization or barrier technologies for the more recently identified water-borne pathogens were elaborated, taking account of the hazard of production of chlorinated compounds with alleged adverse health effects. Biofilm formation throughout water distribution networks was brought under control by strict limitation of concentrations of compounds, assimilable by oligotrophic bacteria.
   Upon acknowledging that direct detection tests for pathogens were finite, because of their most sporadic and erratic distribution, Schardinger's marker organism concept was anew embraced, rigorously revised and substantially enlarged. Misleading designations, like searches for 'faecal coliforms' were replaced by boundary testing for Escherichia coli and appropriate Enterococcus spp. In addition, though still to be perfected, detection protocols for relevant bacteriophages or index viruses and, to a certain extent, also for spores of aerobic and anaerobic sporing rods were also elaborated. In all monitoring account was taken of sublethally injured target organisms, surviving purification technologies, though not deprived of their ecological significance. A need remains for a rigorously standardized operating procedure (SOP) for colony counts of psychrotrophic, oligotrophic Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria ('heterotrophic plate count'), which constitute a useful criterion of indicator value.
   As in the contemporary HACCP approach to food safety, guidelines for assessing success or failure in control of integrity (Water Safety Objectives) were empirically elaborated. These rely on surveys on water samples, originating from drinking water supplies, previously verified as complying with longitudinally integrated HACCP-based purification technologies.
   Structured Academic dissemination of these innovations, through professional microbiologists to operator and executive levels, is recommended. Web based Distance Learning MSc Programmes, like the one, since the academic year 2003-2004, offered by the University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK, may contribute to such endeavours. Though the complete Course is centered around Food Safety, the Modules in-Residence Practicals and Science and Technology of Drinking Water can be studied as an entity while being employed.

AB  - Flow regulation is generally perceived to negatively influence fluvial ecosystems through alterations of natural habitat conditions, particularly in highly variable Mediterranean streams. However, the detection of impact may depend on chosen metrics, requiring a multiple-lines-of-evidence approach for ecologically relevant impact assessment. In this study, we compare the community structure, the trophic function, the microhabitat influence and the body condition of benthic invertebrates between the regulated Bullaque River and unregulated tributaries (Guadiana River basin, central Spain). Invertebrates and physical microhabitats were studied seasonally in 2010. Total abundance, EPT abundance, Rheoindex and LIFE metrics were higher in the regulated river during summer, whereas Shannon diversity was lower. Rheoindex and LIFE were higher in the tributaries during winter. Filterers were very abundant in spring and summer in the tributaries and the regulated stream, respectively. Deposit feeders dominated during summer in the tributaries. Despite these differences, ANOSIM revealed similar community structure and feeding groups characteristics in both fluvial system types. In addition, body condition, measured as fluctuating asymmetry level, indicated that darning created favourable developmental conditions for several invertebrate species in the Bullaque River. This suggests that darning surprisingly buffered from the adverse environmental conditions inflicted by seasonal summer drougths, which occur recurrently in Mediterranean areas. Results also suggest that the application of fluctuating asymmetry could therefore be promising for revealing integral ecological responses to different and often combined forms of anthropogenic and natural disturbance.

AB  - During the 20th century, environmental problems have increased from sewage discharge in the first decennia towards climate change today. An increase in scale of threats implies an increase in scale of management and assessment. Successively, physico-chemical, biological and ecological assessment evolved but failed to stop deterioration. The development in techniques runs parallel to the evolution in assessment. Eight major groups of assessment techniques are distinguished: indices (saprobic, diversity, biotic), multimetrics and rapid techniques, physico-ecological, catchment scale, ecosystem components, assemblage/community, process, and non-taxonomic assessment. An increasing refinement is observed in objectives, measures and complexity, and a decreasing one in levels of scale, stream type and, more often, taxonomy. The applied algorithms were typically restricted to single summary measures. Multivariate analysis was introduced only recently. Assessment can do without a reference condition. Still, this condition is often used in assessment. Therefore, the role of the reference is discussed and it is concluded that, if used, it needs to be defined strictly. The role of nine concepts of lotic ecology in assessment is studied. Two major groups of concepts are distinguished. One is related to catchment-scale functioning of streams and the other to instream habitat-related processes and biodiversity. The 5-S-Model, a frame that divides the stream ecosystem into five major components: system conditions, stream hydrology, structures, substances and species (Verdonschot et al., 1998: The 5-S-Model, an integrated approach for stream rehabilitation. In H.O. Hansen & B.L. Madsen, River Restoration '96, Session lectures proceedings. National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark, International Conference arranged by the European Centre for River Restoration: 36-44), is a first attempt to comprise this knowledge in management. Finally, integrated ecological assessment is defined. It is based on three major approaches: an ecological typology approach, an ecological catchment approach and a societal approach. Ecological typology implies a nested multiple parameter approach based on regional ecological stream typology where types are scaled and different taxonomic groups are incorporated. Ecological typology sets the ecological demands necessary to make management sustainable. The ecological catchment approach implies a nested multiple scale approach which couples natural and anthropogenic features and dynamics of the catchment both in space and time. This approach sets the conditions within the catchment to facilitate sustainable catchment management. The societal approach adds human activities to the first two. It couples ecological demands and anthropogenic uses and supports those user choices that make management sustainable. The application of these three approaches is initiated to enable sustainable catchment management.

AB  - Studies on the impacts of climate change typically focus on changes to mean conditions. However, animals live in temporally variable environments that give rise to different exposure histories that can potentially affect their sensitivities to climate change. Ocean deoxygenation has been observed in nearshore, upper-slope depths in the Southern California Bight, but how these changes compare to the magnitude of natural O-2 variability experienced by seafloor communities at short timescales is largely unknown. We developed a low-cost and spatially flexible approach for studying nearshore, deep-sea ecosystems and monitoring deepwater oxygen variability and benthic community responses. Using a novel, autonomous, hand-deployable Nanolander (R) with an SBE MicroCAT and camera system, high-frequency environmental (O-2, T, estimated pH) and seafloor community data were collected at depths between 100 and 400 m off San Diego, CA, to characterize timescales of natural environmental variability, changes in O-2 variability with depth, and community responses to O-2 variability. Oxygen variability was strongly linked to tidal processes, and contrary to expectation, oxygen variability did not decline linearly with depth. Depths of 200 and 400 m showed especially high O-2 variability; these conditions may give rise to greater community resilience to deoxygenation stress by exposing animals to periods of reprieve during higher O-2 conditions and invoking physiological acclimation during low O-2 conditions at daily and weekly timescales. Despite experiencing high O-2 variability, seafloor communities showed limited responses to changing conditions at these shorter timescales. Over 5-month timescales, some differences in seafloor communities may have been related to seasonal changes in the O-2 regime. Overall, we found lower-oxygen conditions to be associated with a transition from fish-dominated to invertebrate-dominated communities, suggesting this taxonomic shift may be a useful ecological indicator of hypoxia. Due to their small size and ease of use with small boats, hand-deployable Nanolanders can serve as a powerful capacity-building tool in data-poor regions for characterizing environmental variability and examining seafloor community sensitivity to climate-driven changes.

AB  - In the current context of climate change, benthic cnidarians of the genus Palythoa have been suggested to be resistant owing to their intrinsic biological characteristics. In tropical regions, some species are currently proliferating in areas where environmental conditions are less suitable for other organisms, even replacing hard coral ecosystems.
   Considering their tropical affinities, phase-shifts towards Palythoa-dominated areas could become more frequent in future climate change scenarios, leading to changes in ecosystem organization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of climate change stressors in two common Palythoa spp. with different habitat affinities within a subtropical region, and the effect upon their predator-prey interactions.
   The results of this experimental study demonstrated that colonies of P. aff. clavata and P. caribaeorum were significantly affected by exposure to temperature and pH conditions predicted for 2100 in the Canary Islands, during 62 days.
   Despite zoantharians' lack of carbonate in their body wall, Palythoa spp. were most affected in their growth rates by lowered pH, and colonies significantly decreased in weight and size. Although all colonies exhibited symptoms of bleaching at high temperature, a reduction in chlorophyll content was also observed at low pH.
   Predation by Platypodiella picta crabs decreased on P. aff. clavata exposed to acidic conditions, which may compensate for the lowered ecological performance of the species in these climate change conditions. In contrast, P. picta was able to actively feed on P. caribaeorum colonies regardless of the experimental conditions.
   Despite being suggested as winner species in a climate change scenario, our study demonstrated that low pH negatively impacted Palythoa spp. survival. If the species are not able to acclimatize to the new conditions, changes in their populations may be expected, although their magnitude could be ameliorated by means of a decrease in predation rates.

AB  - States and tribes are encouraged to use multiple biological assemblages in assessment of water bodies. An assessment index for each assemblage provides information on aspects of the aquatic resource that may be unique in terms of stressor sensitivity, stressor type, or ecological scale. However, assessment results relative to impairment thresholds can disagree among indices for an individual water body, leading to uncertain overall water-body assessments. We explored options for combining stream indices for macroinvertebrates, fish, and habitat in ways that would yield the most consistent and sensitive results relative to established disturbance categories. Methods varied in the scoring or rating scales used to standardize each index value, the thresholds used to define impairment of aquatic life uses, and the ways of synthesizing multiple indices. The index compositing method that scores each index on a continuous scale and averages the scores after standardizing had superior accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. In addition, using the 25th quantile of reference sites instead of the10th quantile resulted in a more balanced error rate among reference and degraded site categories.

AB  - A Mid-Atlantic multimetric index provides a quick and cost effective assessment of brook trout streams or potential brook trout streams in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Using five core metrics - three in-stream metrics (riffle/run quality, dissolved oxygen content and water temperature) and two watershed metrics (percent land use in agriculture and distance to the nearest road from the survey site), the index can be calculated in the field by professional natural resource managers or trained volunteers. The index should be used in concert with other assessment tools, including a classification model designed to allow resource managers to quickly screen a given stream reach in order to determine its potential for supporting sustainable populations of brook trout. Used in tandem, the classification model could provide a preliminary assessment of a stream, followed by a secondary assessment using an index rating to further evaluate stream quality and potential.

AB  - Equatorial rivers of East Africa exhibit unusually complex seasonal and inter-annual flow regimes, and aquatic and adjacent terrestrial organisms have adapted to cope with this flow variability. This study examined the annual flow regime over the past 40 years for three gauging stations on the Mara River in Kenya and Tanzania, which is of international importance because it is the only perennial river traversing the Mara-Serengeti ecoregion. Select environmental flow components were quantified and converted to ecologically relevant hydraulic variables. Vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish were collected and identified at target study sites during low and high flows. The results were compared with available knowledge of the life histories and flow sensitivities of the riverine communities to infer flow-ecology relationships. Management implications are discussed, including the need to preserve a dynamic environmental flow regime to protect ecosystems in the region. The results for the Mara may serve as a useful model for river basins of the wider equatorial East Africa region.

AB  - Several techniques have been developed to measure the amount of sperm DNA damage in an effort to identify more objective parameters for evaluation of infertile men. The integrity of sperm DNA influences a couple's fertility and helps predict the chances of pregnancy and its successful outcome. The available tests of sperm DNA damage require additional large-scale clinical trails before their integration into routine clinical practice. The physiological/molecular integrity of sperm DNA is a novel parameter of semen quality and a potential fertility predictor. Although DNA integrity assessment appears to be a logical biomarker of sperm quality, it is not being assessed as a routine part of semen analysis by clinical andrologists [26].
   Extensive investigation has been conducted for the comparative evolution of these techniques. However, some of these techniques require expensive instrumentation for optimal and unbiased analysis, are labor intensive, or require the use of enzymes whose activity and accessibility to DNA breaks may be irregular. Thus, these techniques are recommended for basic research rather than for routine andrology laboratories.
   Sperm chromatin structure evaluation is applied to detect male factors that may affect the chance of success with IVF as well as natural fertility. Further research is needed to define the optimal test of sperm chromatin structure. The clinical application of this test will evolve as well.

AB  - Dominant agricultural society of Nepal demonstrates the sign of compromises on its rural and virgin landscape. The current study investigates the fish base indices on some of its watershed. It is a proven fact that fish base variables such as species diversity and the abundance indicate the extent of impact by various disturbances on the ecological integrity of the river system. Three rivers, namely Jhikhukhola, Rapti and Tinau were studied to see the agricultural impact by taking fish species number and their abundance as the indicators in this work. The study was done for an academic purpose from 2003 to 2006 in which sampling was done using electro-fishing gear by standard wading method. Four replicates of sample taken in four major seasons were obtained in the field. Altogether, 10542 fishes of 24 genera and 34 species were captured during the entire sampling. The comparison of their distribution and abundance showed a clear sign of impact mainly on the downstream of the rivers indicating the rapid increase in unaccounted and indiscriminate use of agricultural inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This was further verified by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test which showed the significant variations in the impact on the downstream in major agricultural season.

AB  - Pipeline crossing construction alters river and stream channels, hence may have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems. This review examines the effects of crossing construction on fish and fish habitat in rivers and streams, and recommends an approach to monitoring and assessment of impacts associated with these activities. Pipeline crossing construction is shown to not only compromise the integrity of the physical and chemical nature of fish habitat, but also to affect biological habitat (e.g., benthic invertebrates and invertebrate drift), and fish behavior and physiology. Indicators of effect include: water quality (total suspended solids TSS), physical habitat (substrate particle size, channel morphology), benthic invertebrate community structure and drift (abundance, species composition, diversity, standing crop), and fish behavior and physiology (hierarchy, feeding, respiration rate, loss of equilibrium, blood hematocrit and leukocrit levels, heart rate and stroke volume). The Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach, which is often applied in Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM), is recommended as a basis for impact assessment, as is consideration of site-specific sensitivities, assessment of significance, and cumulative effects.

AB  - 1. Despite escalating conflict over fresh water, recent years have witnessed a growing realisation that human society must modify its behaviour to ensure long-term ecological vitality of riverine ecosystems. In response, ecologists have been increasingly asked to guide instream flow management by providing 'environmental flow' prescriptions for sustaining the ecological integrity of riverine systems.
   2. Environmental flows are typically discussed in the context of water releases from dams and water allocation for extraction ( such as for urban use or irrigation), where there is general agreement that rivers need to exhibit some resemblance of natural flow variability necessary to support a functioning ecosystem. Although productive dialogue continues on how best to define environmental flows, these discussions have been focused primarily on water quantity without explicit consideration of many components of water quality, including water temperature - a fundamental ecological variable.
   3. Many human activities on the landscape have modified riverine thermal regimes. In particular, many dams have modified thermal regimes by selectively releasing hypolimnetic ( cold) or epilimnetic ( warm) water from thermally stratified reservoirs to the detriment of entire assemblages of native organisms. Despite the global scope of thermal alteration by dams, the prevention or mitigation of thermal degradation has not entered the conversation when environmental flows are discussed.
   4. Here, we propose that a river's thermal regime is a key, yet poorly acknowledged, component of environmental flows. This study explores the concept of the natural thermal regime, reviews how dam operations modify thermal regimes, and discusses the ecological implications of thermal alteration for freshwater ecosystems. We identify five major challenges for incorporating water temperatures into environmental flow assessments, and describe future research opportunities and some alternative approaches for confronting those challenges.
   5. We encourage ecologists and water managers to broaden their perspective on environmental flows to include both water quantity and quality with respect to restoring natural thermal regimes. We suggest that scientific research should focus on the comprehensive characterisation of seasonality and variability in stream temperatures, quantification of the temporal and spatial impacts of dam operations on thermal regimes and clearer elucidation of the relative roles of altered flow and temperature in shaping ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems. Future investigations should also concentrate on using this acquired knowledge to identify the 'manageable' components of the thermal regime, and develop optimisation models that evaluate management trade-offs and provide a range of optimal environmental flows that meet both ecosystem and human needs for fresh water.

AB  - Understanding and mapping the spatial variation in stream biological condition could provide an important tool for conservation, assessment, and restoration of stream ecosystems. The USEPA's 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) summarizes the percentage of stream lengths within the conterminous United States that are in good, fair, or poor biological condition based on a multimetric index of benthic invertebrate assemblages. However, condition is usually summarized at regional or national scales, and these assessments do not provide substantial insight into the spatial distribution of conditions at unsampled locations. We used random forests to model and predict the probable condition of several million kilometers of streams across the conterminous United States based on nearby and upstream landscape features, including human-related alterations to watersheds. To do so, we linked NRSA sample sites to the USEPA's Stream Cat Dataset; a database of several hundred landscape metrics for all 1:100,000-scale streams and their associated watersheds within the conterminous United States. The StreamCat data provided geospatial indicators of nearby and upstream land use, land cover, climate, and other landscape features for modeling. Nationally, the model correctly predicted the biological condition class of 75% of NRSA sites. Although model evaluations suggested good discrimination among condition classes, we present maps as predicted probabilities of good condition, given upstream and nearby landscape settings. Inversely, the maps can be interpreted as the probability of a stream being in poor condition, given human-related watershed alterations. These predictions are available for download from the USEPA's StreamCat website. Finally, we illustrate how these predictions could be used to prioritize streams for conservation or restoration.

AB  - Biological monitoring is the evaluating changes in the environment using the biological responses with the intent of using such information in quality control of the ecosystem. Biomarkers and bioindicators are two main components of the hierarchy of biomonitoring process. Bioindicators can be used to monitor changes of ecosystems and to distinguish alteration of human impact from natural variability. There is a wide range of aquatic taxa such as macroinvertebrates, fish and periphyton, planktons which are successfully used in the biomonitoring process. Among them, macroinvertebrates are an important group of aquatic organisms that involves transferring energy and material through the trophic levels of the aquatic food chain and their sensitivity to environmental changes differs among the species. The main approaches of assessing freshwater ecosystems health using macroinvertebrates include measurement of diversity indices, biotic indices, multimetric approaches, multivariate approaches, Indices of Biological Integrity (IBI), and trait-based approaches. Among these, biotic indices and multimetric approaches are commonly used to evaluate the pesticide impacts on aquatic systems. Recently developed trait-based approaches such as SPEcies At Risk of pesticides (SPEAR) index was successfully applied in temperate regions to monitor the events of pesticide pollution of aquatic ecosystems but with limited use in tropics. This paper reviews the literature on different approaches of biomonitoring of the aquatic environment giving special reference to macroinvertebrates. It also reviews the literature on how biomonitoring could be used to monitor pesticide pollution of the aquatic environment. Thus the review aims to instil the importance of current approaches of biomonitoring for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems especially in the regions of the world where such knowledge has not been integrated in ecosystem conservation approaches.

AB  - Assessing ecological quality of surface waters is getting more important to achieve environmental sustainability since the implementation of EU Water Framework Directive. This study was designed to assess ecological quality of freshwater bodies in the North Aegean catchment using the trophic index Turkey (TIT), recently developed for Turkish running water assessment. This first work attempts to evaluate rivers water quality in the Northern Aegean catchment, a touristic region based on the diatom index dedicated to the Anatolia region. Data were taken from 18 sampling stations in the Northern Aegean catchment (Turkey) from August 2014 to August 2015. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) performed to evaluate the relationship between diatom assemblages and environmental variables especially nutrients, temperature, electrical conductivity, and biochemical oxygen demand played important roles in the distribution of diatom species. CCA explained 12.5% of the cumulative percentage variance of diatom assemblage's data with 92.8% of the species-environment correlations. In related to the water ecological status, the lowest TIT (1.57) values was recorded in Geyikli creek, whereas the highest TIT (2.82) was calculated in Bakircay stream. The ecological quality ratio changed between 0.58 (Bakircay stream with moderate status) and 0.99 (Geyikli, Kar and Kemer creeks with high status). Pollution tolerant species such as Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula recens, Navicula cryptocephala, Navicula cryptotenella, Navicula trivialis, and Cyclotella meneghiniana characterized the moderate ecological status water bodies were, while the high and good ecological status sites were characterized by nutrient sensitive species such Navicula radiosa, Didymosphenia geminata, Cymbella excisa, and Hannaea arcus. The ecological status the water bodies indicated exactly the state of deterioration of these watercourses due to human activities in the catchment. A significant positive correlation between TIT values and logTP confirmed that this index as a metric is a useful biological tool for the bioassessment of regional water quality.

AB  - Managing coastal development requires a set of tools to adequately detect ecosystem and water column degradation, but it also demands tools to detect any post-disturbance improvement. Structural seagrass indicators (such as shoot density or cover) are often used to detect or assess disturbances, but while they may be very sensitive to the impact itself, it is unclear if those indicators on their own can effectively reflect recovery at time scales relevant to managers. We used the construction of a harbour affecting a nearby Posidonia oceanica seagrass community to test the ability of a set of indicators (structural and others) to detect alterations and to evaluate their sensitivity to recovery of environmental quality after harbour construction was complete and the disturbance ceased. We used a Beyond Before After Control Impact (BBACI) design to evaluate effects on one impacted and three control meadows where we used structural, morphological, community and physiological indicators (26 in total) to asses disturbance impacts. Additionally, we measured some of the potential environmental factors that could be altered during and after the construction of the harbour and are critical to the survival of the seagrass meadow (light, sediment organic matter, sediment accrual).
   Harbour construction caused a clear increase in sediment organic matter and in sediment deposition rates, especially fine sand. Light availability was also reduced due to suspended sediments. Sediment and light conditions returned to normal levels 5 and 15 months after the construction began. As expected, seagrass structural indicators responded unequivocally to these environmental changes, with clear reductions in shoot density. Additionally, reduced light conditions quickly resulted in a decline in carbohydrate content in affected meadows. Unexpectedly, we also recorded a significant increase in metal content in plant tissues. No response was detected in the physiological indicators related to eutrophication (e.g. N and P content in tissues) and in morphological (shoot biomass) and community (epiphyte biomass) indicators. More than three years after the completion of the harbour, structural indicators did not show any sign of recovery. In contrast, physiological indicators, mainly heavy metal and carbohydrates content, were much better in detecting the improvement of the environmental conditions over the fairly short period of this study. These results indicate that while structural indicators are critical to evaluate the immediate effect of disturbances and the recovery on impacted systems, specific physiological indicators may be much better suited to determining the timing of environmental quality recovery. The design of impact and monitoring protocols in the wake of coastal developmental projects need to consider the differential effectiveness and time-response of measured indicators carefully.

AB  - Hydropower is the most important renewable electricity source worldwide. It shows clear advantages for the global CO2 balance but creates serious ecological impacts on a local scale. As a consequence, concern for the conservation of natural river ecosystems is growing within society and more people are willing to pay extra for so-called 'green electricity'. The definition of 'green', however, is not straightforward and customers cannot directly examine the quality of electricity products. Therefore, credible certification of high ecological standards is essential for successful green electricity marketing.
   In this paper we introduce a new assessment procedure for evaluating environmentally compatible hydropower production. This so-called 'Green Hydro' concept was developed in the context of a multidisciplinary case study on a 400 MW hydropower scheme in the Southern Alps of Switzerland. The concept guarantees both general standards for different schemes operating in different types of watersheds and flexibility for local particularities. We developed an environmental management matrix that considers basic criteria and eco-investments and covers five environmental areas of concern (i.e. hydrological character, connectivity, morphology, landscape, and biological communities). The ecological perspective is complemented by five management domains (i.e. instream flow regimes, hydropeaking, reservoir and bedload management, and power plant structures). Applying assessment and modelling tools for the Green Hydro procedure showed that dynamic habitat models allowed quantification of the effects of different instream flow regulations at morphologically distinct sites. In this case, morphological restoration could be more beneficial than increasing the minimum flow.
   The first experience with the Green Hydro certification is encouraging. So far, 13 facilities have successfully passed the certification procedure. They produce a total of 186 GWh green electricity per year, which is sufficient for the supply of almost 40 000 households in Switzerland. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A challenge for statewide stream monitoring is visualizing the spatial and statistical characteristics of such data to compare the biotic condition of watersheds and relate that condition to watershed-level estimates of instream variables. We used linked micromaps on stream survey data of 25 subbasins (766-5,982km(2)) for biotic condition, nine water quality, and twohabitat variables. Subbasin biotic condition was negatively correlated with conductivity, magnesium and sulfate concentrations, and weakly positively correlated with habitat scores of sedimentation and embeddedness, with higher scores indicating better habitat. Positive spatial autocorrelation was detected among the subbasins in both habitat variables, iron concentration, pH, and exceedances of fecal coliform criteria as shown in linked micromaps. A spatial principal components analysis reduced the 11 environmental variables to two principal axes. The first axis synthesized a gradient of water quality and habitat scores among the subbasins. Subbasin biotic condition regressed on first axis subbasin scores had a significant, negative slope and accounted for 55% of the variation. Subbasins in degraded biotic condition had elevated conductivities and ion concentrations in northern and southern subbasins, and low habitat scores in western subbasins. Through linked micromaps, we compared the biotic condition among subbasins and identified stressors prevalent among subbasins that affected biotic condition.

AB  - The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non-metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.

AB  - Purpose - In the carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) project, the integrity of CO2 injection wells plays a vital role in the long-term safety of CO2 storage. The authors aim to practically investigate possible CO2 leakage of a CO2 injection well section during the injection operation and shut-in by the thermomechanical FEM simulation. The application of numerical simulation to the CO2 injection well deep underground is the first step that will help in the quantitative evaluation of the mechanical risks.
   Design/methodology/approach - The injection of CO2 at a temperature different from those of the well and the surrounding geological formation is likely to cause different thermal deformations of constitutive well materials. This could lead to cement cracking and microannuli openings at the interfaces of different materials such as casing/cement and cement/rock. In this paper, the possibility and order of magnitude of cement cracking and microannuli creation in the cross section of the well are assessed from a numerical case study within a classical thermomechanical finite element model framework.
   Findings - The possibility of compressive failure and tensile cracking in the cement of the studied wells due to CO2 injection is small unless a large casing eccentricity or an initial defect in the cement is present. Some microannuli openings are generated at interfaces cement/casing and/or cement/rock during the CO2 injection because of different thermal shrinkage of each material. However, the width is not important enough to cause significant CO2 leakage under the studied conditions. The use of "flexible" cement especially developed for oil well applications could mitigate the risk of cement cracking during CO2 injection.
   Originality/value - Numerous experimental studies on the chemical deterioration of the cement under severe conditions have been carried out On the other hand, only a few investigations have focused on the mechanical behavior under thermal/pressure changes related to CO2 injection. In this paper, the quantitative analysis to investigate cement cracking and microannuli formation is achieved to help in the identification of possible mechanical defects to cause CO2 leakage. In addition, the discussion about the risk of the possible casing eccentricity and the application of flexible cement in the oil and gas field to CO2 injection well could be practically useful.

AB  - Establishment of high-quality, consistent on-board assessment of the neurotoxicity of planetary, and interstellar dust particles will be required to predict their potential threat to human health during long-term space missions. This Perspective article proposes an approach for the rapid assessment of potential neurotoxicity of micro-sized and nano-sized dust particles based on experimental results with other neurotoxic particles. Capacity of particles to affect membrane potential, integrity of nerve terminals, and consequently key synaptic transmission characteristics can be assessed using a planar lipid bilayer technique by monitoring artificial membrane conductivity in the presence of particles. Preliminary neurotoxicity data of nanoparticles, including lunar and Martian dust simulants, obtained using a planar lipid bilayer technique, is compared with that acquired using more-established methodological approaches. Under space flight conditions, neurotoxicity assessments of particulate matter could be rapidly and reproducibly performed using a planar lipid bilayer technique, which does not require biological material.

AB  - Aldo Leopold's land ethic has proved more complex and subtle than he envisioned. Nevertheless, Leopold launched what, facing a new millennium, has proved urgent on the global agenda: an environmental ethics concerned in theory and practice about appropriate respect for values carried by the natural world and human responsibilities for the sustaining of these values. A blending of anthropocentric and biocentric values continues to be vital. These duties toward nature involve analysis of ecosystem integrity and evolutionary dynamism at both scientific and philosophical levels; any responsible environmental policy must be based on plausible accounts of ecosystems and a sustainable biosphere. Humans and this planet have entwined destinies. We now envision an Earth ethic beyond the land ethic.

AB  - Biomarkers are useful diagnostic tools for identifying exposure to physical, chemical, and environmental stresses. In this study, a suite of techniques-measurements of metallothionein, lysosomal integrity, and osmoregulatory ability-have been used in an attempt to provide an in situ assessment of environmental quality. Five estuarine sites were studied, two clean sites, two urban sites, and one intermediate. Shore crabs, Carcinus maenas, Mere collected and haemolymph taken for the lysosomal and osmoregulatory assays. Animals were killed and tissue preserved for metallothionein analysis. Lysosomal integrity was significantly different in crabs from clean sites and the urban sites (n=40, p<0.05). The potential value of the biomarker approach is that it could provide data for impact assessment and is applicable in the field. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A male-specific bacteriophage plaque assay was evaluated as a faecal contamination or process integrity indicator for aspects of the pork slaughter process. Over 400 samples were tested including: sponge swabs from animal hauling trailer floors and dressed carcass surfaces; faecal material; water from slaughter sites; and water from each stage of wastewater treatment. Bacteriophage were observed in wastewater, trailers, slaughter process water and swine faeces. No bacteriophage were observed on dressed carcasses. Numbers of phage plaque-forming units per gram or millilitre showed greater variation and were usually lower than standard indicators, including total coliform or Escherichia roll counts. Among the applications studied, male-specific bacteriophage appear to be best suited for process control verification for wastewater treatment.

AB  - Large-scale spatial variability of macrofaunal traits has rarely been studied. This paucity of information hinders progress to derive indicators of seabed integrity under current policy drivers. Based on data from 327 stations across the Greater North Sea, a sub-region of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), we describe variability in the numerical dominance of ten important macrofaunal traits and their relationships with the physical environment.
   For six traits (longevity, larval development position, egg development position, sediment position and bioturbation method), macrofaunal assemblages were dominated by one or two trait categories; these traits showed more pronounced spatial patterns than traits with a wider (and more even) trait category expression. Similar spatial distributions of some dominant categories were observed. For example, egg-brooding, surfaced welling and suspension feeding traits were dominant in the central English Channel and off the Humber Estuary. Traits generally showed weak spatial relationships with environmental variables, although sediment position and feeding type were related to variations in bed shear stress and gravel content. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to monitoring seabed integrity under the MSFD.

AB  - Globally, the value of integrating multiple knowledge systems is being recognised in ecosystem assessments, monitoring and management. This paper describes a participatory eco-cultural assessment of freshwater billabongs in the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia, that drew on Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) and Western science using social and natural science research methods. IEK holders were concerned about feral ungulates trampling and consuming traditional bush food resources and reducing water quality, affecting eco-cultural values of billabongs. We recorded qualitative IEK and conducted a multivariate snapshot assessment of billabong physiochemical water quality, ground condition, yarlbun (water lily) cover and macroinvertebrate assemblage that showed distinct seasonal variation. Although both knowledge systems revealed indicators of seasonal change over 1 year, IEK also revealed longer-term changes and that degradation of billabongs in the late dry season was exacerbated by feral ungulates. This participatory research illustrates how the condition of freshwater systems can be assessed using cross-cultural techniques, how these techniques can reveal more nuanced understandings of eco-cultural condition and the value of including IEK for setting ecological baselines and recording long-term change.

AB  - Investigating relationships of benthic invertebrates and sedimentation is challenging because fine sediments act as both natural habitat and potential pollutant at excessive levels. Determining benthic invertebrate sensitivity to sedimentation in forested headwater streams comprised of extreme spatial heterogeneity is even more challenging, especially when associated with a background of historical and intense watershed disturbances that contributed unknown amounts of fine sediments to stream channels. This scenario exists in the Chattahoochee National Forest where such historical timber harvests and contemporary land-uses associated with recreation have potentially affected the biological integrity of headwater streams. In this study, we investigated relationships of sedimentation and the macroinvertebrate assemblages among 14 headwater streams in the forest by assigning 30, 100-m reaches to low, medium, or high sedimentation categories. Only one of 17 assemblage metrics (percent clingers) varied significantly across these categories. This finding has important implications for biological assessments by showing streams impaired physically by sedimentation may not be impaired biologically, at least using traditional approaches. A subsequent multivariate cluster analysis and indicator species analysis were used to further investigate biological patterns independent of sedimentation categories. Evaluating the distribution of sedimentation categories among biological reach clusters showed both within-stream variability in reach-scale sedimentation and sedimentation categories generally variable within clusters, reflecting the overall physical heterogeneity of these headwater environments. Furthermore, relationships of individual sedimentation variables and metrics across the biological cluster groups were weak, suggesting these measures of sedimentation are poor predictors of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure when using a systematic longitudinal sampling design. Further investigations of invertebrate sensitivity to sedimentation may benefit from assessments of sedimentation impacts at different spatial scales, determining compromised physical habitat integrity of specific taxa and developing alternative streambed measures for quantifying sedimentation.

AB  - The Benthic Ecological Assessment for Marginal Reefs (BEAMR) method is a universal assessment procedure which v helps to quantify the "health" condition of a coral reef habitat over time. Coral reefs, due to their complexity as an ecosystem, have presented problems in the past to marine researchers trying to assess the performance of the habitat through statistical evaluation. Previous methodologies such as the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment method and the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Program, while being useful, were created specifically for reefs within the Caribbean Sea and are biased toward one or two main indicator organisms (e.g., stony corals). However, given that most reefs worldwide are considered marginal habitats, which describes them as having an impoverished community condition with biogeographic limits, the BEAMR method offers a more comprehensive analysis of all benthic functional groups defining the reef. Assessments and analysis using the BEAMR method provide marine researchers with accurate in situ documentation of all aspects within benthic coral communities, allowing conservation managers to more effectively protect these marine habitats. Coral reef resources are under a constant threat from both human and natural forces, making habitat assessment protocols, such as the BEAMR method, an important: tool in the worldwide conservation of coral reef communities.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems and their fauna are vulnerable to a variety of climate-related changes. Benthic macroinvertebrates are used frequently by water-quality agencies to monitor the status of aquatic resources. We used several regionally distributed state bioassessment data sets to analyze how climate change might influence metrics used to define ecological condition of streams. Many widely used, taxonomically based metrics were composed of both cold- and warm-water-preference taxa, and differing responses of these temperature-preference groups to climate-induced changes in stream temperatures could undermine assessment of stream condition. Climate responsiveness of these trait groups varied among states and ecoregions, but the groups generally were sensitive to changing temperature conditions. Temperature sensitivity of taxa and their sensitivity to organic pollution were moderately but significantly correlated. Therefore, metrics selected for condition assessments because taxa are sensitive to disturbance or to conventional pollutants also were sensitive to changes in temperature. We explored the feasibility of modifying metrics by partitioning components based on temperature sensitivity to reduce the likelihood that responses to climate change would confound responses to impairment from other causes and to facilitate tracking of climate-change-related taxon losses and replacements.

AB  - Documented biodiversity loss has galvanised a global process to develop conceptual frameworks that link the social and ecological systems. This paper focusses on the development of the first marine natural capital asset and risk register as a foundational decision support tool to understand the risk to ecosystem service delivery in relation to policy or management interventions. We make use of existing marine data products to define the component parts of the asset status (extent, condition, spatial configuration) in line with a natural capital approach. We 'Pioneer' the application of this approach in North Devon, UK, an area defined by UK Government to test how marine natural capital can be effectively managed to deliver benefits to the environment, economy and people, and identify how best to share and scale up this learning. We demonstrate that the majority of asset-benefit relationships are at a medium to high risk of loss under current use and management. Despite policy and management measures to reduce pressures on marine systems, activities linked to fishing, farming and the water industry continue to pose a medium to high risk to the asset-benefit relationships. A lack of accurate spatial fishing effort data greatly reduces opportunities for rational and targeted approaches to improve the condition status of marine natural capital assets. Marine protected areas as a single tool are insufficient to prevent further loss of biodiversity that underpins all asset-benefit relationships. Synthesis and applications. Through development of the first marine natural capital asset and risk register we demonstrates a novel decision support tool to understand the risk to ecosystem service availability in relation to environmental policy or management interventions. The results highlight that current marine governance strategies to protect biodiversity are not sufficient to reduce the risk of loss of ecosystem services. Wider application of the marine natural capital approach will require increasing confidence in the metrics to define marine asset status; more directed monitoring (extent and condition) and; greater accuracy in spatial fishing effort.

AB  - A common approach used to assess environmental impacts in aquatic environments is to measure indicators of stress (biomarkers) and condition of fish within ecosystems. Particularly in estuarine ecosystems with multiple stressors, it is often desirable to quantify a suite of biological endpoints that (1) reflect fish condition at several levels of biological organization and time scales and (2) are sensitive to a range of environmental stressors. However, established methods of preservation and processing of fish for specific endpoints are often incompatible. Here, we developed a novel flash-freezing approach for assessing the health of a small, sensitive fish, the endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) after collections from the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We assess whether flash-freezing the entire fish ensures effective preservation of multiple tissues for subsequent biomarker analyses by comparing measurements of fresh to frozen tissue. Tissues included brain, gill, and liver for enzyme activity, kidney and spleen for pathogens, and gills, liver, and gonads for histopathology and reproduction. Although flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen altered the length, weight, and condition factor of Delta Smelt, the percent changes were small (<1.5%). Histological analyses of the cellular morphology of gills, liver, and gonads were similar between both methods. Freezing artefacts were observed in ovaries, but did not hinder the identification and interpretation of cell types and oocyte stages. Freezing did not alter bacterial isolation or the activities of ethoxyresorufin-0-deethylase (EROD) or acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but had a small, negative influence on sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. Thus, flash-freezing in the field is a versatile preservation method for Delta Smelt, allowing for multiple tissue collections and bioassays from an individual tiny fish exposed to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Similar methodology may be applicable to other species for which a range of biological endpoints and histopathology data are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rivers are valuable to human beings because of their various functions. Unfortunately, ecological integrity of rivers has been seriously threatened by human activities, resulting in poor river functions. It is thus necessary to evaluate and maintain river health. Meanwhile, it is challenging to comprehensively assess river health with a single method alone. It is therefore relevant to combine the advantages of multiple methods in river health assessment. By classifying and characterizing river functions, we first established an indicator system for river health assessment in plain river network regions. We then assessed the health status of the Taihu Plain in terms of an improved entropy-based fuzzy matter-element model. We found that the overall health status of the Taihu Plain is below "good". In particular, the health status of Yang-Cheng-Dian-Mao and Hang-Jia-Hu Region is "moderate"; the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu Region displays the poorest natural and social river functions. We also found that flood control is the most important influential factor in river health. Our findings suggest that rivers in the Taihu Plain must be restored to maintain their health, with the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu Region that must be restored preferentially, and that the river function of flood control must be improved at the scale of whole watershed. Comparing with other four commonly used comprehensive assessment methods, our improved entropy-based fuzzy matter-element model outperforms in reflecting objective fact and can be applied to river health assessment. Our results are generally consistent with existing studies, confirming that the proposed method for river health assessment is effective and feasible. Therefore, it provides a useful reference for river health assessment in other plain river network regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - At approximately the same time in March, the coauthors of this communication found themselves in similar situations with the need to teach their students online. The educational crisis caused by Covid-19 required more focused attention on communication, technology, and assessment/academic integrity with students. As members of a coach/teacher team in the Science Coaches American Association of College Teachers program, immediate contact was critical. Challenging times such as the impact of Covid-19 on education required the need to adapt to an online environment for teaching. The two teachers, one who taught chemistry at the university level and an AP Chemistry teacher who taught high school, used the time to continue to work together, support each other, and brainstorm ways to maintain meaningful contact with students. The article addresses education during a crisis, the AACT coach/team program, the hybrid nature of the coach/teacher team with suggestions/questions to be considered, what contributed to the success of the team, and a comparison of student communication, use of technology, and assessment/academic integrity of the coach/teacher team.

AB  - Sediments from Cova Gran de Santa Linya (Southeastern Prepyrenees of Lleida, Iberia) are investigated by geoarchaeological means.
   Micromorphological, textural, quartz grain morphoscopy and geochemical analyses are coupled with stratigraphic and sedimentary macroscopic data to provide new insights into the formation processes and the integrity of the occupation layers and embedded sterile deposit documented at the Middle-to Upper Palaeolithic boundary.
   Direct indicators of the anthropogenic and natural dynamics involved in the deposition and alteration of the sediments investigated are provided.
   Results reveal the presence of in situ combustion structures as a major sedimentary indicator of human activity and occupation surfaces at the site. The overall good preservation of the combustion residues indicates that occupation layers have been preserved in their original context of deposition. Traits of surface exposure in parallel to progressive lessening of evidence related to human activity at the top of the Middle Palaeolithic sequence suggest discontinuity in the occupation of the site and a possible abandonment of the rock-shelter at the end of this period.
   Formation processes of the sterile deposit documented between the Mousterian and the Early Upper Palaeolithic levels involved the accumulation of debris from local sediments and soils as well as from the structure of the rock-shelter.
   Soil-forming dynamics related to palaeoenvironmental moisture fluctuations have also been recorded throughout the sequence investigated and indicate periods of surface stability during the formation of the sterile deposit.
   Environmental dynamics active during the formation of the sterile partially disturbed the top of the Mousterian layer, however, our data indicate that such dynamics did not substantially affect the overall integrity of the archaeological record.
   Our results highlight the crucial contribution of geoarchaeology and microstratigraphy to the characterisation and assessment of the anthropogenic and natural dynamics involved in the accumulation and taphonomy of Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic sequences.

AB  - Urbanization is occurring rapidly in southeastern Asia where streams are increasingly pressured. We assessed the ecological integrity of Ampang River in Kuala Lumpur by comparing structural and functional measures between forested and urban sites. We assessed 4 forested, 1 intermediate (deforested, not channelized), and 5 urban, channelized sites. Urbanization altered substrate (concrete at urban sites), riparian vegetation, light, temperature, O-2, conductivity, nutrients, and major ion levels, and simplified food webs. Invertebrate composition shifted from pollution-intolerant taxa at forested sites to tolerant taxa at urban sites. Richness in Surber samples was 56 species at forested sites and 27 taxa at urban sites. Basal food sources at forested sites were leaf litter and biofilm, whereas at urban sites they were a sediment mat comprising organic matter, cyanobacteria, iron bacteria, and algae. Organic matter biomass on ceramic tiles was greater at urban than forested sites, but chlorophyll a was not. Faunal abundance was greater in litter bags at urban (mean = 72.6 animals/bag, 68% chironomids) than at forested sites (27.9 animals/bag; 33% chironomids), but species richness was higher in forested sites. Food webs at forested sites were more complex and differed from those at urban sites, which lacked shredders, and grazers differed in taxonomic composition and diet between urban and forested sites. At forested sites, insect larvae grazed biofilm, whereas at urban sites, snails consumed the organic mat. Leaf decomposition was fastest at the most disturbed site indicating rapid microbial decomposition caused by increased temperatures (+4.5 degrees C) and nutrients, and possibly increased physical breakdown caused by rapid flow carrying abrasive sediment and garbage. Urbanization has had severe impacts on ecosystem function in Ampang River that could be alleviated by preventing pollution, restoring riparian vegetation, and providing natural substrate.

AB  - The Zambezi-Chobe wetlands in Namibia are of great international importance for trans-boundary water management because of their remarkable ecological characteristics and the variety and magnitude of the ecosystem services provided. The main objective of this study is to establish the hydro-ecological baseline for the application of environmental flow regimes (EFR). The specific objectives are: (i) the assessment of environmental flow components (EFC) in the current near-natural hydrological conditions; (ii) the generation of future scenarios for climatic and socioeconomic changes; (iii) the estimation of the area-duration curves and estimated annual habitat during the inundation of the critical habitats for fisheries (mulapos), under the existing conditions and future scenarios; and (iv) to provide a framework for the future application of EFRs, based on hydrological and ecological processes. To make a sound analysis of the ecological implications, first we develop a conceptual framework of the linkages between the hydrological and biological processes concerning fish communities, because of the critical role of fisheries in the region. The EFCs in near-natural hydrological conditions provide the basis for developing interim EFRs in the region, within the framework of an adaptive management of water resources. The future scenarios indicate a mitigation of the flow variability; and, in the worst-case scenario, the reduction of the maximum flow and inundated area of the mulapos would result in a reduction of the estimated annual habitat of 22%. This means a reduction in the spawning habitats for quiet-water species, in the food resources for fry and juvenile fish and a consequent reduction in fish stocks. Furthermore, the habitat loss during low events is similar and greater under both scenarios, at ca. 35%. Here we corroborate that the EFCs and their variability may become the building blocks of flow-ecology models that lead to environmental flow recommendations, monitoring and research programmes and flow protection activities.

AB  - Over the past century, the environment of the Gulf of Mexico has been significantly altered and impaired by extensive human activities. A national commitment to restore the Gulf was finally initiated in response to the unprecedented Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Consequently, there is a critical need for an assessment framework and associated set of indicators that can characterize the health and sustainability of an ecosystem having the scale and complexity of the Gulf. The assessment framework presented here was developed as an integration of previous ecological risk- and environmental management-based frameworks for assessing ecosystem health. It was designed to identify the natural and anthropogenic drivers, pressures, and stressors impinging on ecosystems and ecosystem services, and the ecological conditions that result, manifested as effects on valued ecosystem components. Four types of societal and ecological responses are identified: reduction of pressures and stressors, remediation of existing stressors, active ecosystem restoration, and natural ecological recovery. From this conceptual framework are derived the specific indicators to characterize ecological condition and progress toward achieving defined ecological health and sustainability goals. Additionally, the framework incorporates a hierarchical structure to communicate results to a diversity of audiences, from research scientists to environmental managers and decision makers, with the level of detail or aggregation appropriate for each targeted audience. Two proof-of-concept studies were conducted to test this integrated assessment and decision framework, a prototype Texas Coastal Ecosystems Report Card, and a pilot study on enhancing rookery islands in the Mission-Aransas Reserve, Texas, USA. This Drivers-Pressures-Stressors-Condition-Responses (DPSCR4) conceptual framework is a comprehensive conceptual model of the coupled human-ecological system. Much like its predecessor, the ecological risk assessment framework, the DPSCR4 conceptual framework can be tailored to different scales of complexity, different ecosystem types with different stress regimes, and different environmental settings.

AB  - Sandy beaches comprise one of the most important coastal resources worldwide, providing habitats to threatened vertebrates, supporting underappreciated invertebrate biodiversity, and delivering crucial ecosystem services and economic benefits to mankind. Monitoring of the natural resource condition of sandy beaches and assessments of the ecological impacts of human disturbance are, however, rare on sandy shores. Because a crucial step in developing beach monitoring is to identify and test biological indicators, we evaluated the utility of using population densities of ghost crabs (genus Ocypode) to measure how beach biota respond to human pressures. Densities of crabs-estimated via burrow counts-were quantified at two sites exposed to high and low levels of human disturbance on an urban beach in eastern Australia. Human disturbance consisted of pedestrian trampling and shoreline armouring which led to the loss of dune habitat. Overall, crab numbers were halved in disturbed areas, but contrasts between impact and control sites were not necessarily consistent over time and varied between different levels of the shore: stronger and more consistent effect sizes were recorded on the upper shore than further seawards. In addition to lowering crab densities, human disturbance also caused shifts in intertidal distributions, with a greater proportion of individuals occurring lower on the shore in the impacted beach sections. The number of visible burrow openings also changed in response to weather conditions (temperature and wind). We demonstrate that spatial contrasts of burrow counts are broadly useful to indicate the existence of a human-induced disturbance effect on urban beaches; we also highlight a number of critical, hitherto unknown, issues in the application of this monitoring technique; these encompass three broad dimensions: (1) a need for standardised protocols; (2) unresolved causal links between observed patterns and putative pressures; and (3) uncertainties of how organisms responds specifically to both natural and human changes of environmental conditions on sandy shores.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems provide essential ecosystem services and support biodiversity; however, their water quality and biological communities are influenced by adjacent agricultural land use. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are commonly used as bioindicators of stream conditions in freshwater biomonitoring programs. Sorting benthic samples for molecular identification is a time-consuming process, and this study investigates the potential of ethanol-collected environmental DNA (eDNA) for metabarcoding macroinvertebrates, especially for common bioindicator groups. The objective of this study was to compare macroinvertebrate composition between paired bulk tissue and ethanol eDNA samples, as eDNA could provide a less time-consuming and non-destructive method of sampling macroinvertebrates. We collected benthic samples from streams in Ontario, Canada, and found that community composition varied greatly between sampling methods and that few taxa were shared between paired tissue and ethanol samples, suggesting that ethanol eDNA is not an acceptable substitute. It is unclear why we did not detect all the organisms that were preserved in the ethanol, or the origin of the DNA we did detect. Furthermore, we also detected no difference in community composition for bioindicator taxa due to surrounding land use or water chemistry, suggesting sites were similar in ecological condition.

AB  - Accounting for natural differences in flow variability among rivers, and understanding the importance of this for the protection of freshwater biodiversity and maintenance of goods and services that rivers provide; is a great challenge for water managers and scientists. Nevertheless, despite considerable progress in understanding how flow variability sustains river ecosystems, there is a growing temptation to ignore natural system complexity in favor of simplistic, static, environmental flow "rules" to resolve pressing river management issues. We argue that such approaches are misguided and will ultimately contribute to further degradation of river ecosystems. In the absence of detailed empirical information of environmental flow requirements for rivers, we propose a generic approach that incorporates essential aspects of natural flow variability shared across particular classes of rivers that can be validated with empirical biological data and other information in a calibration process. We argue that this approach can bridge the gap between simple hydrological "rules of thumb" and more comprehensive environmental flow assessments and experimental flow restoration projects.

AB  - P>1. Assessments of flow abstractions in streams often focus on changes to biological communities and in-stream physical characteristics, with little consideration for changes in ecosystem functioning. It is unclear whether functional indicators of ecosystem health may be useful for assessing the impacts of reduced discharge on small streams.
   2. We used weirs and diversions to reduce stream discharge by over 89% in three small New Zealand streams (11-84 L s<SU-1</SU), ranging in water quality from pristine to moderately impaired.
   3. We used both structural (benthic invertebrates) and functional (drifting invertebrates, leaf breakdown, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) retention and primary productivity) measures of ecosystem integrity to compare responses to water abstraction in before-after, control-impact designed experiments during summer 2005.
   4. At the pristine site, the density of invertebrates, taxon richness, Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI), Quantitative MCI, percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera individuals and percentage of filter-feeders decreased in response to reduced flows. Only taxon richness decreased at the mildly impaired stream, and reduced discharge had no effect on the invertebrate community at the stream with the lowest water quality.
   5. We found that reduced discharge had little influence on the breakdown rate of willow leaves in mesh bags over 1 month. Primary productivity was also relatively insensitive to water abstraction. However, CPOM retention increased with decreased flows. Drift propensity of invertebrates increased at two sites but only within the first few days after flow reduction.
   6. Structural measures of ecosystem integrity suggested that the impacts of water abstraction differed among streams of varying water quality, probably because of differences in the sensitivity of invertebrate assemblages in the three streams. In contrast, the three functional measures tested were generally less sensitive to water abstraction impacts, although understanding how stream ecosystems respond to water abstraction clearly requires that both are considered.

AB  - Ant species assemblages have been used as biological indicators of environmental condition in many different ecosystems. To assess the potential of using ants as environmental indicators of agroecosystem condition, ants were collected from a stratified random sample of agricultural fields planted in annually harvested herbaceous crops at 90 sites in North Carolina and Virginia The ants were identified to species and correlations with soil, management and crop variables were examined as the Ist step in developing an environmental indicator of agroecosystem condition. A total of 41 species of ants was found. Ant species assemblages were found to differ significantly between the fields and the field margin. Ant species assemblages were correlated with soil variables, tillage practices, and insecticide use, suggesting that ants have potential as a biological indicator of agroecosystem condition.

AB  - Forests globally are facing an increasing number of threats from modified disturbance regimes, novel stressors and changing environmental conditions. This has ultimately resulted in declines in the ecological condition of many forest and woodland ecosystems, leading to widespread tree mortality and stand dieback. Effective indicators of overall woodland ecological condition are therefore needed for environmental monitoring and to support management responses. To test the effectiveness of different variables that could potentially be used as indicators of woodland condition, 102 variables that describe woodland structure, composition, functioning, edaphic conditions and disturbance regimes were assessed along 12 replicate gradients of beech stand dieback. Results indicated that 35 variables differed significantly between at least two stages of the dieback gradient, indicating their sensitivity to stand dieback. Seven of these indicators related to woodland species composition, two to functional processes, 20 to structural features, four to edaphic conditions, and two to disturbance regimes. These results demonstrate that effective indicators can potentially be identified for each of the ecological categories. Effective composition indicators included species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi, ground flora and epiphytic lichens; functional indicators were soil respiration rate and net nitrification rate; edaphic conditions included soil Na:Ca ratio, exchangeable sodium, total carbon, Ca:Al ratio; structural indicators included canopy openness, litter cover, sward height, and volume of deadwood, and for disturbance the indicator was Equus dung density. Other measures, such as shrub cover and species richness of carabid beetles and spiders, were not found to vary significantly along the dieback gradients, and were therefore not identified as effective indicators. These results demonstrate the value of gradient analysis for evaluating indicators of woodland condition, but also highlight the need for multi-site studies to identify indicators with widescale applicability.

AB  - The problems of economic assessment of natural capital as the most important category of ecological economy are considered in the modern context of sustainable development. It is required to improve the procedures and methods for natural capital accounting in accordance with the international environmental and economic standards in the System of National Accounts. Historical features of transformation of the term "natural capital" are analyzed in terms of the natural resource and ecosystem approaches. The principles of economic assessment of natural resources are proposed. The compliance with these principles is a necessary condition of the quality of information received. The formation of the structure of the natural capital accounts is analyzed in the case-studies of Great Britain as one of the first countries that switched to monetary reflection of ecosystem services in the national wealth and of a region of the Russian Federation in order to identify the structural uniformity of natural capital calculated in monetary terms. Data on the value of the underestimate part of the national wealth generated by forest ecosystems in Russia are obtained.

AB  - Udmurtia located in the European part of Russia was chosen for assessment eco-geomorphological conditions, because it is well-developed region (ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, machine-building and oil production) with a quite high population density. A combined approach, based on standard geomorphological methods (field work, remote sensing and GIS technologies) and the analysis of time-space population distribution, was used. This paper attempts to show the role of relief in forming a living environment. It can both improve and worsen a living environment. Relief influences the modern settlement in Udmurtia. Watersheds are the natural boundary not only between river basins, but also between districts with different density of rural population. The density of the rural population increases from the hilltops and to the valley bottoms in almost all river basins. Udmurtia is located in a relatively comfortable eco-geomorphological conditions, where environment characteristics are safe for a life, formation of an adequate level of health in accordance with sanitary standards and expert assessments. 63% of the total square is comfortable and relatively comfortable conditions. 37% of the square is poorly comfortable and uncomfortable conditions, where the relief worsens ecological conditions. It is mainly southeastern part of Udmurtia. Two out of 15 geomorphological provinces (the Central Udmurt Lowland and the Sarapul Upland) with uncomfortable eco-geomorphological conditions display a high population density. In spite of the prevalence of comfortable and relatively comfortable living conditions, most people of Udmurtia live under uncomfortable conditions.

AB  - Land condition monitoring information is required for the strategic management of grazing land and for a better understanding of ecosystem processes. Yet, for policy makers and those land managers whose properties are situated within north-eastern Australia's vast Great Barrier Reef catchments, there has been a general lack of geospatial land condition monitoring information. This paper provides an overview of integrated land monitoring activity in rangeland areas of two major Reef catchments in Queensland: the Burdekin and Fitzroy regions. The project aims were to assemble land condition monitoring datasets that would assist grazing land management and support decision-makers investing public funds; and deliver these data to natural resource management(NRM) community groups, which had been given increased responsibility for delivering local environmental outcomes. We describe the rationale and processes used to produce new land condition monitoring datasets derived from remotely sensed Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and high resolution SPOT 5 satellite imagery and from rapid land condition ground assessment. Specific products include subcatchment groundcover change maps, regional mapping of indicative very poor land condition, and stratified land condition site summaries. Their application, integration, and limitations are discussed. The major innovation is a better understanding of NRM issues with respect to land condition across vast regional areas, and the effective transfer of decision-making capacity to the local level. Likewise, with an increased ability to address policy questions from an evidence-based position, combined with increased cooperation between community, industry and all levels of government, a new era has emerged for decision-makers in rangeland management.

AB  - The relevance of the article lies in the need to study artificial aquatic ecosystems, as uncontrolled anthropogenic impact is increasingly multifactorial and complex, characterized by a high degree of pollution, leads to irreversible changes in the structure of reservoirs, reducing the quality of the environment. This complicates the lives of all living organisms and has a particularly negative effect on human health and life expectancy. The problem of rational development of transformed water areas is complicated by circumstances of different origin of man-made nature. The load on reservoirs has led to the emergence of specific conditions for the formation of taxonomic composition, production and destruction processes and their quality. Optimizing the potential of artificial aquatic ecosystem systems will improve the quality of water resources and their conservation. Solving this problem requires in-depth research into the adaptive capacity and relationship of fish populations in the reservoir ecosystem. The research was conducted in the research laboratories of the Department of Aquatic Bioresources and Aquaculture of Kherson State Agrarian and Economic University and the Department of Ecology of the Stepan Gzhytskyi National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnologies Lviv. Environmental conditions and influencing factors play an extremely important role in the life of fish. The main factors influencing the formation of parameters of artificial aquatic ecosystems are water volumes and discharge regimes, as well as the degree of pollution from industrial and domestic effluents. The dynamics of physico-chemical indicators of the quality of the aquatic environment during the experiment generally takes place within the normative for traditional breeding of pond fish, which did not significantly affect the course of the experiment. Biological indicators have become a priority in the modern period in the comprehensive ecological assessment of the aquatic ecosystem. The selected models were taken from two groups of yearling and annual carp (Cyprinus carpio), 20 individuals in each group. For the general assessment of the content of fish in the system of the pool type with recirculating water circulation, morphological indicators of blood were determined. When rearing young carp in polyculture, the spectrum of nutrition was taken into account, partially using the water from fish pools, which is enriched with nutrients, in particular various forms of nitrogen. When analyzing the functional status of the body of fish in the experimental group, there was an increase in the quality of indicators that reflect the homeostatic balance in the body, metabolic processes exceeded the values in the control. To ensure high-quality conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use, the proposed methods and technological recommendations can become an effective tool for the development of traditional knowledge of fisheries in our country.

AB  - We investigated the relationship, at local level, between fitness (measured as fish condition) of Pomastoschistus marmoratus and environmental variables of shallow areas in the Mar Menor lagoon (Spain, Mediterranean Sea): water temperature (degrees C), water salinity (parts per thousand), depth (cm), submerged vegetation cover (%), submerged vegetation volume, substrate size, substrate heterogeneity, fish species richness, potential competitor fish species abundance, potential competitor fish species biomass, P. marmoratus abundance and P. marmoratus biomass. The mass-length relationships were used to test differences in fish condition between nine sampling sites. The ecological variable that accounted for most of the variation in condition was the abundance of potential competitor fish species, wich was related to interspecific fish interactions. The condition of P. marmoratus populations may be a good indicator of fish density interactions in coastal lagoons and could be considered when such populations are subjected to recovery plans or any other management programmes.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment is one of the most important causes of ecological impairment in surface waters. More effective management of this problem is constrained by a lack of nutrient criteria that link phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations to levels of biological impairment as defined in management agency regulations. We used a new approach for identifying potential nutrient criteria using diatom assemblages and the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG). We first used diatom count data to assign study sites to BCG impairment categories (levels), then determined P and N concentrations corresponding with the boundaries between those levels. We studied diatom counts and environmental data from 95 river and stream sites throughout the state of New Jersey (NJ), USA. The sites represent five ecoregions, primarily forested uplands and coastal plains, and a wide range of nutrient concentrations (total P range of 15 to > 200 mu g L-1 and total N 0.5 to > 4 mg L-1). Advantages of NJ as a study region are the ready availability of streams with a large gradient in nutrient concentrations and similarity to nutrient-stressed systems in many other geographic regions. BCG levels represent a range of ecological conditions from natural to highly impaired. A panel of experts on use of diatoms as ecological indicators assigned 57 study sites to BCG levels based on diatom assemblage composition. Potential nutrient criteria were subsequently derived by determining the measured TP and TN concentrations associated with the boundary between impaired sites and non-impaired sites (BCG levels greater than 4). Based on this approach, statewide criteria of no greater than 50 mu g L-1 TP and 1.0 mg L-1 TN are indicated for maintaining or restoring sites to unimpaired condition. In some least-disturbed ecoregions, lower concentrations (e.g., 25 mu g L-1 of TP) would be more appropriate to maintain current ecological conditions. Existing diatom TP and TN metric values for the study sites correlate well with BCG level assignments and can be used to determine if nutrient criteria are met. Overall, results demonstrate the usefulness of data derived from diatom assemblages in management of nutrient issues, and the potential widespread applicability of the BCG approach to develop nutrient criteria and to monitor compliance.

AB  - Contemporary patterns of land development mean that suitable reference sites for low-gradient stream and non-wadeable river biomonitoring are difficult to locate, requiring alternative approaches for benchmarking human impacts. We use two strongly harmonised macroinvertebrate data sets for wadeable streams (180 sites) and non-wadeable rivers (30 sites) to (i) quantify metric response differentials across a regional landcover pressure gradient in northern New Zealand; (ii) interpolate reference condition for waterway types lacking comparable reference sites and (iii) inform development of narrative condition bands for data-poor waterway types. Cumulative distribution functions of per cent waterway length indicated that near-shore littoral samples from non-wadeable rivers had fewer total and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxa than wadeable streams, which had higher % EPT abundance and lower % Crustacea abundance. Community composition differed significantly among non-wadeable river and wadeable hard-bottom and soft-bottom stream samples, reflecting factors associated with catchment altitude, slope, rainfall and landuse intensity. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness was the only metric evaluated that significantly reflected landcover across all waterway types. The intercept of the 60th percentile quantile regression line at 100% native vegetation cover provided the best approximation of median EPT taxa richness in an independent reference site data set for hard-bottom streams. Applying the same interpolation to samples from soft-bottom streams and non-wadable rivers that lacked regional reference sites indicated median reference expectations of 9 and 11 EPT taxa, respectively, and a consistent differential across the pressure gradient relative to hard-bottom streams of seven taxa and five taxa, respectively. The derived response differentials enabled the development of narrative bands for directly comparing ecological condition of data-poor stream and river types. Quantification of ecological response differentials can provide an alternative means of benchmarking macroinvertebrate metrics in the absence of suitable reference sites.

AB  - We assess the effects of taxonomic resolution (genus-family levels) on the ecological assessment of 39 highly heterogeneous ponds located in north-western Spain.
   Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) were used to investigate the effects of taxonomic resolution on the macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. The Mann Whitney U-test and discrimination efficiency were used to assess the ability of nine diversity measures (total richness, rarefied richness samples of 25, 50 and 100 individuals, Margalef's index, Pielou's evenness, Shannon-Weaver's index, Simpson's index and percent dominant taxon) to discriminate between acceptable (best available and good conditions) and unacceptable (moderate, poor and very poor) conditions using three levels of taxonomic resolution: (i) family, (ii) family plus subfamilies of benthic non-biting midges and (iii) genus level.
   Based on non-metric MDS, the macroinvertebrate assemblages of ponds of acceptable (A) and unacceptable (N) conditions were statistically undistinguishable, both at genus and family levels. On the other hand, based on several community metrics (total richness, Margalef index, etc.) the two sets of samples were statistically different, although only when the genus or the subfamily level was used and after Bonferroni correction. These results suggest that the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages by itself is more sensitive than the specific composition in distinguishing the fauna living in acceptable and unacceptable conditions. Moreover, dealing with families including many taxa generally showing different tolerance to disturbance may lead to misclassification of ponds. We agree, however, that the two approaches, i.e. assemblage composition and diversity measures, are conceptually different and hence they should be used in combination for a better understanding of the response of single metrics.

AB  - Ecosystems provide multiple services that are necessary to maintain human life. Agroecosystems are very productive suppliers of biomass-related provisioning ecosystem services, e.g. food, fibre, and energy. At the same time, they are highly dependent on good ecosystem condition and regulating ecosystem services such as soil fertility, water supply or soil erosion regulation. Assessments of this interplay of ecosystem condition and services are needed to understand the relationships in highly managed systems. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold: First, to test the concept and indicators proposed by the European Union Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) for assessing agroecosystem condition at a regional level. Second, to identify the relationships between ecosystem condition and the delivery of ecosystem services. For this purpose, we applied an operational framework for integrated mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services. We used the proposed indicators to assess the condition of agroecosystems in Northern Germany and regulating ecosystem service control of erosion rates. We used existing data from official databases to calculate the different indicators and created maps of environmental pressures, ecosystem condition and ecosystem service indicators for the Federal State of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, we identified areas within the state where pressures are high, conditions are unfavourable, and more sustainable management practices are needed. Despite the limitations of the indicators and data availability, our results show positive, negative, and no significant correlations between the different pressures and condition indicators, and the control of erosion rates. The idea behind the MAES framework is to indicate the general condition of an ecosystem. However, we observed that not all proposed indicators can explain to what extent ecosystems can provide specific ecosystem services. Further research on other ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems would help to identify synergies and trade-offs. Moreover, the definition of a reference condition, although complicated for anthropogenically highly modified agroecosystems, would provide a benchmark to compare information on the condition of the ecosystems, leading to better land use policy and management decisions.

AB  - Average soil moisture was spatially modelled for observed periods and climate scenarios using a fuzzy logic approach. Accordingly, a significant decline of soil moisture until 2070 in Germany and the Kellerwald National Park could be evidenced for soils influenced by ground water and by stagnant water and at sites on steep slopes and on southerly slopes.
   Soil moisture is an essential environmental factor affecting the condition of forests throughout time with high spatial variance. To adapt forests to climate change, assessments of ecological integrity and services in forest management and nature conservation need spatio-temporal estimations of current and future soil moisture. Dynamic modelling of soil moisture even with rather simple models needs numerous data which are often not available for areas of large spatial extent.
   Therefore, the objectives of this investigation were to (1) spatio-temporally estimate ecological soil moisture with available data covering the whole territory of Germany, (2) to specify these estimates for the regional scale, (3) to statistically analyse temporal trends of modelled soil moisture for the time period 1961-2070 and (4) to map soil moisture changes (drying-out) at both national and regional levels.
   A fuzzy rule-based model was developed allowing the combination of a pedological and an ecological soil moisture classification. The fuzzy modelling approach was applied for mapping average soil moisture at two spatial scales.
   Soil moisture was modelled and mapped on a scale of 1:500,000 across Germany and regionally specified on a scale of 1:25,000 for the Kellerwald National Park for the time intervals 1961-1990, 1991-2010, 2011-2040 and 2041-2070. The model validation gave a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.86 and a coefficient of determination (pseudo R (2)) of 0.21. Average soil moisture was expected to decline significantly until 2070 concerning soils influenced by ground water and by stagnant water and at sites on steep slopes (> 25%) and on southerly slopes (120-240A degrees).
   The model allows mapping of mean soil moisture at the national and regional scale as shown by the example of Germany and the Kellerwald National Park across observed periods and climate scenarios. It should be combined with available ecological data on forest ecosystem types (Jenssen et al. 2013; Schroder et al. 2015) and tested at the European scale.

AB  - Assessing environmental quality often requires selection of indicators that can be employed over large spatial scales and over long-time periods to assess the health and well-being of species, natural communities, and ecosystems, and to detect changes warranting intervention. Typically, the ecologic environment and the human environment are evaluated separately and selection of indicators and monitoring approaches are not integrated even though ecological indicators may also provide information on risk to human consumers from contaminants (e.g., eco-cultural indicators) or because of disease levels. This paper is a call for ecologists and managers to consider diverse cultural and environmental injustice disparities and health issues when selecting indicators for environmental assessment and monitoring. There is an opportunity for managers and community members to work together to preserve ecological and cultural resources and heritages. We propose a paradigm that selects indicators and monitoring approaches that lend themselves to the integration of human-diversity and uniqueness in the same manner that the selection of ecological indicators and monitoring approaches consider biological species diversity and uniqueness. The proposed paradigm builds on ecological risk assessment techniques, developing analogous endpoints for neighboring communities. For example, identification and protection of human communities, particularly culturally diverse and environmental justice communities, identification of contaminant corridors (e.g., through water or green corridors) into communities, and eco-monitoring of vulnerable communities are not routine at contaminated sites. Green corridors refers to a width of wild habitat (forest, grasslands) that connects other similar habitat paths (usually a corridor runs through an urban or suburban habitat). We coin the term Eco-EJ indicators for these endpoints, including examination of (1) unique cultural relationships to resources; (2) connectedness of on-site and off-site resources and habitats; (3) health of threatened, rare, and unique cultures and communities; and (4) linkages between ecological, eco-cultural, and public health for monitoring and assessment. We also propose that assessment and monitoring include these Eco-EJ indicators, especially for communities near facilities that have extensive chemical or radiological contamination. Developing these indicators to assess risk to culturally diverse and environmental justice communities would be an equivalent goal to reducing risk for significant ecological resources (e.g., endangered species, species of special concern). These Eco-EJ indicators are complementary to the usual human health-risk assessments, would include surveys of neighboring vulnerable communities, and require time and re-organization of current data and additional data collection at site boundaries and in adjacent communities, as well as rethinking the human component of indicators. This approach lends itself to addressing some diverse cultural and environmental justice issues with current indicator selection and biomonitoring, and helps identify specific hotspots of unique ecosystem risk and environmental justice community risk. We briefly discuss ecological and eco-cultural monitoring already on-going at three Department of Energy sites to illustrate how the addition of these indicators might work and add value to environmental management and to their relationships with surrounding communities.
   We recommend that managers of contaminated sites convene people from culturally diverse communities, environmental justice communities, local and federal government, Tribes, resource trustees, managers, and other stakeholders to develop appropriate site-specific indicators to address environmental inequities around contaminated facilities.

AB  - This paper addresses automated mapping of the remaining wall thickness of metallic pipelines in the field by means of an inspection robot equipped with nondestructive testing (NDT) sensing. Set in the context of condition assessment of critical infrastructure, the integrity of arbitrary sections in the conduit is derived with a bespoke robot kinematic configuration that allows dense pipe wall thickness discrimination in circumferential and longitudinal direction via NDT sensing with guaranteed sensing lift-off (offset of the sensor from pipe wall) to the pipe wall, an essential barrier to overcome in cement-lined water pipelines. A tailored covariance function for pipeline cylindrical structures within the context of a Gaussian Processes has also been developed to regress missing sensor data incurred by a sampling strategy folllowed in the field to speed up the inspection times, given the slow response of the pulsed eddy current electromagnetic sensor proposed. The data gathered represent not only a visual understanding of the condition of the pipe for asset managers, but also constitute a quantative input to a remaining-life calculation that defines the likelihood of the pipeline for future renewal or repair. Results are presented from deployment of the robotic device on a series of pipeline inspections which demonstrate the feasibility of the device and sensing configuration to provide meaningful 2.5D geometric maps.

AB  - 1. Benthic macroinvertebrates (MI) are commonly used to assess freshwater ecosystems with the reference condition approach. Such assessments necessitate control for natural community variation, either by categorical typologies or by predictive models that have been widely and successfully developed for running water biota but not previously for lake profundal invertebrates.
   2. We evaluated four modelling techniques [multivariate regression tree (MRT), limiting environmental differences, nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) and River Invertebrate Prediction And Classification System (RIVPACS) and the operative Finnish lake typology for assessing taxonomic completeness (observed-to-expected number of taxa, O/E) of profundal MI assemblages. We used data from 74 and 33 minimally disturbed reference lake basins for calibration and validation of the approaches, respectively, and 72 test basins subject to various anthropogenic pressures to evaluate sensitivity to detect impact. Either all predicted taxa (threshold probability of capture P-t = 0+) or only those predicted to be captured with >= 0.25 probability were used to calculate O/E.
   3. With P-t = 0.25, all four modelling approaches were accurate (mean O/E = 0.966-1.053) but imprecise (SD of O/E = 0.279-0.304) in predicting the fauna actually observed in validation sites. All models were subtly more precise than a null model (mean 1.038, SD 0.343) or the typology (1.046, 0.327). The taxon-specific NPMR model was slightly more precise than the other three models based on site groupings.
   4. The O/E values correlated relatively weakly (r = 0.55-0.86) among the approaches, which thus produced contrasting lake-specific assessments, despite their seemingly comparable performances. Indeed, typology, suggesting that MI assemblages were impaired in 56% of test sites, was more sensitive than the other approaches (26-46%) as an indicator of human-induced deterioration. However, this greater ostensible sensitivity seemed to be biased, as lake morphometry, a main driver of natural community variation, remained uncontrolled by the typology.
   5. Generally, our exercise illustrates the inconclusiveness of the common validation criteria for the assessment methods. The apparent poor predictability of the profundal fauna, irrespective of the method, may partly stem from large observation error, which could be alleviated by more intensive sampling. However, instead of an O/E-taxa index, some other metric encompassing quantitative aspects might be preferable for assessing these species-poor communities.

AB  - Species sensitivity values can be used to trigger management interventions and prioritize areas for conservation, with sensitivity estimation methods ranging from expert opinion to empirical modelling. The opinion and modelling approaches each have strengths and weaknesses, raising questions of how much they (dis)agree or which one to follow in conservation assessments. We compared conservatism values assigned by botanists to modelling estimates of sensitivity (change in abundance between current and reference conditions) for 123 wetland macrophyte species across northern prairie and boreal forest regions of Alberta, Canada. Scores from each method were positively correlated and showed limited differences especially in the boreal region. Conservatism distributions for species were broadly similar between regions whereas model-based score distributions differed between regions, probably because the modelling incorporated site-specific responses of species to environmental conditions prevalent in each region. A few species had large mismatch between conservatism and model -based scores, but these cases resulted from extenuating factors and do not reflect systematic bias in expert opinions or the modelling process. Overall the results indicate potential for general agreement between quantitative and qualitative methods of sensitivity estimation, and a complementary approach of expert opinion and modelling may offer the most valuable currency for conservation assessments.

AB  - Insects have been recognized to be important indicators of the quality elements of ecosystems, among others, because of their rapid response to environmental variability and ease cost-effective capture. In this work we evaluated whether beetles of the Scarabaeoidea superfamily may be used as bioindicators of anthropogenic disturbance of Amazonian terra firme rain forests, in order to provide guidelines for monitoring strategies of the Amacayacu National Park. We considered three different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e. low, medium, high) in 12 transects (four in each intervention level), and caught all beetle species of this superfamily. Three interception traps, two light traps, three pitfalls and four bottle fruit traps were used per transect, as well as manual catch. In total, 593 individuals belonging to 92 species, 44 genera and seven families were collected. Scarabaeidae (n=232, 27 spp.) and Dynastidae (n=161, 26 spp.) were the families with the highest number of individuals and species, while Aphodiidae, Cetoniidae and Geotrupidae exhibited the lowest. The most abundant species per family were Ateuchus sp. (33.2%) from Scarabaeidae, Cyclocephala verticalis (55.9%) from Dynastidae, Astaena sp. (75.8%) from Melolonthidae, Ceratocanthus amazonicus (66.7%) from Ceratocanthidae y Chaetodus asuai (96.8%) from Hybosoridae. Results showed that the number of species and individuals increased with the anthropogenic disturbance. The Margalef and Shannon indexes also revealed that the highest richness and equity occurred in the high-disturbed site, respectively. Dynastidae exhibited the highest number of exclusive species per gradient, while Scarabaeidae shared most of its species. Ten species were recorded in the three disturbance levels, 26 species in two and 56 species were exclusive to one level. The most abundant species Chaetodus asuai (Hybosoridae) presented a significant decrease in the number of individuals as disturbance increased, while an inverse relationship occurred for C. vertical is (Dynastidae). For Astaena sp. (Melolonthidae) and Ligyrus gyas (Dynastidae) a high number of individuals was recorded and were exclusive for one forest site (low and high disturbed forest, respectively). The complete superfamily cannot be used like a single bioindicator element because it displays, in a specific level, very different behaviors in each disturbance condition. We discuss the use of richness and diversity as indicators of disturbance, while we highlight abundance of particular taxa as a better metric for disturbance.

AB  - Effluents are a main source of direct and continuous input of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems. Relating observed effects to specific pollutants or even classes of pollutants remains a very difficult task due to the usually unknown, complex and often highly variable composition of effluents. It is recognized that toxicants interfere with organism integrity at the biochemical level and give rise to effects at the individual level and is manifested in reduced ecologically relevant characteristics such as growth, reproduction and survival, and ultimately at the ecosystem level. By integrating multiple endpoints at different ecologically relevant levels of organization within one test organism, it should be possible to gain understanding in how different levels of organization within this organism respond to toxic exposure and how responses at these different levels are interrelated. This paper presents results from a field study in the Rietvlei Wetland system, Gauteng, South Africa using the freshwater mollusk (Melanoides tuberculata) and freshwater fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) as bioindicator organisms. Active biomonitoring (ABM) exposures were conducted where organisms were exposed for 28 days in an effluent dominated river during high flow conditions in April 2003. The river receives effluent from a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial complex, so that up to 75%, of the total flow of the river is effluent-based. Effects of field exposure were determined using cellular biomarkers e.g. DNA damage, HSP 70, metallothionein, acetylcholine esterase, lactate dehydrogenase and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity. The results clearly indicate that although the traditional mortality-based whole effluent toxicity testing did not indicate any toxicity, the in situ exposed organisms were stressed. A multivariate statistical approach was particularly useful for integrating the biomarker responses and highlighting sites at which more detailed analysis of chemical contamination would be useful. Based on the individual biomarker results' contributing towards the distinct groupings it is possible to conclude that Site I is subjected to organic pollutants, whereas Sites 2 and 3 undergo a combination of metallic and organic pollutant stress. However, it is essential that a rapid and sensitive biomarker that is representative of the responses of a suite of biomarkers be tested before ABM can be implemented as a routine biomonitoring practice in water resource management.

AB  - In view of the European Union (EU) requirements to diagnose and monitor the ecological status of estuarine ecosystems using fish-based indicators, we assessed the effect of the sampling protocol in meeting these objectives. Using three different sampling surveys, we evaluated the impact of four components, i.e. sampling gear, spatial extent, length of time series and temporal window analysed, on the detection of ecological trends in the Gironde estuary, estimated by different types of fish-based indicator. For each component, temporal trends of several fish-based indicators were analysed and for the final diagnosis these temporal trends were combined. The results showed that sampling gear had significant effects on the assessment of ecological trends, as it was determinant in the functional description of the fish community and also in the final diagnosis obtained. When on the one hand the lower estuary and the estuarine plume and on the other hand the upper-middle estuary, were considered, we were able to visualise the spatialized functional organization of the estuary and to assess its ecological status more precisely. Increased length of marine fish species in the lower estuary and increased delta diversity in the middle estuary suggested that larger individuals of marine species had moved from outside the estuary to the middle estuary. These trends, associated with the spatial change in environmental conditions (salinity and temperature) in the Gironde estuarine ecosystem may be indicative of a functional shift, from diadromous to marine migrant-dominated assemblages in that ecosystem. We hypothesized that the Gironde estuary was actually more suited to providing nursery habitats for the juveniles of marine migrants and marine stragglers than providing migratory corridors and nursery habitats for species seeking low salinities for a period in their life cycle. The present study supported the hypothesis of a marinisation of the Gironde estuary. When the four components of the protocol, i.e. gear, space, and time (length and temporal windows of time series), were compared this study also suggested that fish length and notably the "temporal window" on which the analyses were based were the most "sensitive" components of the sampling protocol when assessing fish ecological trends in estuaries. It clearly underlined the fact that long time series were essential for evaluating changes in the ecological functioning of these estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Santos Estuary (SE Brazil) is a coastal ecosystem with a high ecological importance and has been strongly impacted by human activities over the last century. A multiproxy analysis of sediment core dated by 137Cs, 210Pb and 226Ra activities and based on sediment geochemistry and benthic foraminifera is here used to reconstruct the environmental changes and the variations of the Palaeo-Ecological Quality Status (Palaeo-EcoQS) during the last-120 years. The Palaeo-EcoQS was reconstructed by applying the diversity index Exp(H'bc) based on the benthic foraminiferal fauna. Specifically, the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) allowed to assess the Palaeo-EcoQS during the last-120 years using local reference conditions. Based on our data, the pre-industrial period (-1883-1902) represents the reference conditions with "Good" Palaeo-EcoQS. The-1902-1972 period coincides with the beginning of industrial operations and intensification of coastal urbanization leading to a deterioration of the environmental quality and Palaeo-EcoQS shifting to "Moderate" conditions. Dredging operations in 1972 led to increase the influences of adjacent sea that ultimately resulted in a "Good" Palaeo-EcoQS persisting up to the 1990s. Despite the preservation actions and recovery programs, the 1993-2012 period was characterized by an overall deterioration of the environmental conditions. Indeed, the reconstructed "Poor" to "Bad" Palaeo-EcoQS suggest the ineffectiveness of the remediation actions. This work confirmed that benthic foraminifera are reliable to evaluate EcoQS and Palaeo-EcoQS in estuarine ecosystems. Based on the present findings and previous studies showing the potential of fossil foraminifera to define in situ reference conditions, we recommend the inclusion of foraminifera in the list of biological quality elements within legislations concerning transitional and marine habitats.

AB  - Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) have long been implemented across Europe to incentivise farmers to alter their management practices to improve biodiversity and water, air and soil quality. However, the cost-effectiveness of traditional action-based schemes has been questioned, and Result-Based Payment (RBP) schemes have been recommended as an alternative. To evaluate the effectiveness of management actions, RBP approaches often rely on indicator species to monitor changes in environmental conditions. The selection of appropriate indicator species for RBP follows several steps and criteria. One of the mentioned criteria is that the species should react to the farmer?s management choices. Thus, the main objective of this study is to understand how existing lists of indicator plant species (aimed at assessing ecological integrity of grasslands and hedgerows in Ireland) are suitable for RBP schemes, by assessing how different environmental and management variables are related to the presence of the plant species selected. Extensive field surveys were conducted to assess the presence and cover of indicator species in grasslands and hedgerows in two study regions in Ireland. The indicator plant species occurrence and diversity (species richness and Simpson?s Diversity Index) were correlated with variables within farmers? control and variables outside farmers? control. Results showed that grassland indicator species occurrence and diversity was mainly related to grassland semi-naturalness and to the diversity of habitats existing on the farm ? both variables within farmers? control ? and thus were appropriate indicators for assessing the effectiveness of management and suitable for use in RBP schemes. Conversely, the occurrence and diversity of hedgerow indicator species was not strongly related to any of the explanatory variables, making them unsuitable for use in a RBP scheme. For a RBP scheme targeted at hedgerows, clear objectives will need to be established and the farmers? management choices need to be better linked to the selected indicator species. The selection of indicator species needs to undergo scientific scrutiny to develop fair results assessments as shown by the results of this study. The analyses conducted highlight the importance of testing if the species react to the farmers? management choices and should be a key methodological step before final indicator species lists are implemented in RBP schemes. Recommendations for results assessments in RBP approaches are discussed based on the results of this study.

AB  - The spread of human activities into the deep sea may pose a high risk to benthic communities and affect ecosystem integrity. The deep sea is characterized by physical and biological heterogeneity and different habitat types are likely to differ in their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts. However, across-habitat comparisons are rare, and no comprehensive ecological risk assessment has yet been developed. To address this gap in our knowledge, we compared macro-infaunal community structure in four habitats (slope, canyons, seamounts and methane seeps) at depths between 700 and 1500m in the Hikurangi Margin and Bay of Plenty regions off New Zealand. The most striking contrast in community structure was between the two study regions, due to an order of magnitude difference in macro-infaunal abundance that we believe was caused by differences in surface productivity and food availability at the sea bed. We found differences in structural and functional attributes of macro-infaunal communities among some habitats in the Hikurangi Margin (slope, canyon and seep), but not in the Bay of Plenty. We posit that differences between canyon and slope communities on the Hikurangi Margin are due to enhanced food availability inside canyons compared with adjacent slope habitats. Seep communities were characterized by elevated abundance of both symbiont-bearing and heterotrophic taxa, and were the most distinct, and variable, among the habitats that we considered on the Hikurangi Margin. Communities of seamounts were not distinct from slope or canyon communities on the Hikurangi Margin, probably reflecting similar environmental conditions in these habitats. The communities of deep-sea canyon and seep habitats on the Hikurangi Margin were sufficiently dissimilar from each other and from slope habitats to warrant separate management consideration. By contrast, the low dissimilarity between communities of canyon and slope habitats in the Bay of Plenty suggests that habitat-based management is not required in this region, for macro-infauna at least. Although the two study regions share similar species pools, populations of the Hikurangi Margin region may be less vulnerable than the sparser populations of the Bay of Plenty due to the higher availability of potential colonizers and faster population growth. Thus regions, and habitats in some regions, should be subject to separate ecological risk assessment to help identify the key risks and consequences of human activities, and to inform options for reducing or mitigating impacts.

AB  - Based on first-hand data from the forest resources inventory of five representative forest farms in Beijing, this study quantitatively evaluates forest ecosystem health at sub-compartmental level for the years 2004, 2009 and 2014, using GIS technology, spatial statistical methods and mathematical modelling. The spatio-temporal pattern and evolution features of the health conditions of forest sub-compartments are explored, taking into account different forest types, forest age groups and forest categories. Our results indicate that the health condition of forest sub-compartments improved significantly between 2004 and 2014. The area and number of forest sub compartments at the "healthy" level showed obvious increases, and most forest sub-compartments that were classed as "unhealthy" and "morbid" improved to a "sub-healthy" level. Most of the forest sub-compartments above the "healthy" level were part of middle-aged forests, near-mature forests, mature forests and over mature forests, while the sub-compartments below the "unhealthy" level were mainly young forests. The health conditions of the categories shelter forests and special-purpose forests were found to be better than that of economic forests. Further analysis shows that the forest sub-compartments with better health conditions were mainly concentrated in the Ecological Conservation Zone of Beijing, while those in the New Urban Development Zone and the Functional Expansion Zone displayed relatively poor conditions. The spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of forest health in the study area were shown to be mainly affected by geographical location, forest resources, socio-economic development, natural environment and forestry policies. We argue that the research can provide a scientific reference for the sustainable development and scientific management of forest farms in the process of implementing rural revitalization strategy in Beijing.

AB  - Despite extensive anthropogenic degradation of most wetlands and other aquatic habitats associated with large rivers in the Midwest, the region still supports continentally important numbers of waterbirds during autumn and spring migration; however, few data exist to evaluate wetland restoration success and identify thresholds where changes in management may be necessary to meet conservation targets. We tracked waterbird response to restoration of a historical floodplain wetland complex along the Illinois River during 2007-2013 relative to waterbird use of other wetlands and floodplain lakes in the region. Dabbling ducks and other waterbirds showed dramatic responses to restoration, each accumulating more than 3 million use-days/year and comprising more than 30% of the total waterbird use-days in the Illinois River Valley during autumn and spring migrations. We identified use that was strongly disproportionate to availability within the region for several waterbird taxa and documented nesting by several species of conservation concern. Many species and foraging guilds of waterbirds [e.g., American coot (Fulica americana), dabbling ducks (Anatini)] responded rapidly to wetland restoration, continued to use Emiquon Preserve regardless of changing conditions at reference sites, and showed relatively limited temporal variation, thereby demonstrating their utility as indicators of habitat conditions and restoration trajectory.

AB  - A pyruvate-phosphate dikinase (C-4-PPDK) gene was cloned from Suaeda monoica, which had a single-cell C-4 photosynthesis pathway without Kranz anatomy and was functionally validated in a C-3 model plant under different abiotic stress conditions in an ambient and elevated CO2 environment. Overexpression of SmPPDK promoted growth of C-3 transgenic plants, enhancing their photosynthesis (CO2 assimilation) by lowering photorespiration under stress conditions. Transgenic plants also showed an improved physiological status, with higher relative water content (RWC), membrane integrity, concentration of glycine betaine, total soluble sugars, free amino acids, polyphenols and antioxidant activity, and lower electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, free radical accumulation, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), compared to control plants. Moreover, SmPPDK transgenic plants exhibited earlier flowering and higher dry biomass compared to controls. These results suggested that the C-4-PPDK gene was appropriate for improvement of carbon assimilation, and it also played an important role in adaption to salinity and severe drought-induced stress. More intriguingly, an elevated CO2 environment alleviated the adverse effects of abiotic stress, particularly caused by drought through coordination of osmoprotectants and antioxidant defense systems. The molecular, physiological, metabolic, and biochemical indicators ameliorated the overall performance of model C-3 plants overexpressing the C-4-PPDK gene in an elevated CO2 environment, by lowering photorespiration metabolic processes, however, further studies are needed to confirm its precise role in C-3 plants as protection against future climate change.

AB  - To implement the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) it is necessary to establish tools enabling ecological status quantification on the basis of biological indicators, and to assess reference conditions and relevant environmental pressures for the construction of response curves. This study focuses on the Polish sector of the Baltic Sea. A number of statistically significant linear correlations, linking chlorophyll-a concentrations with pressure parameters, were found. Due to the lack of historical data, reference conditions and ecological class boundaries for chlorophyll-a assessment were determined using a simplified mathematical approach.

AB  - We investigated the biophysical environment, invertebrate fauna and ecosystem health of lagoons on the Tully-Murray floodplain in the Queensland Wet Tropics bioregion. These wetlands are biologically rich but have declined in area and condition with agricultural development and are poorly protected, despite being located between two World Heritage areas. Lagoons varied in size, habitats and water quality, with increasing signatures of agriculture (e.g. elevated nutrient concentrations) from the upper to lower floodplain. Zooplankton were abundant, but not diverse, and correlated variously with environmental variables, so were not useful in assessing lagoon condition. Benthic macroinvertebrates were abundant and diverse and correlated strongly with riparian condition, habitats, water quality and degree of agriculture in the catchment, but gradients in assemblage structure were not strong because the flow regime, with multiple annual floods, maintains higher water quality than in some tropical systems. The absence of pristine reference lagoons and the limited availability of replicate sites hamper the development of monitoring systems. Nevertheless, we show that appropriate sampling, analysis and knowledge of comparable systems allow inferences to be drawn regarding ecological condition. This is important because environmental managers need best available and timely advice whatever the opportunities for rigorous study design.

AB  - The Poweshiek skipperling Oarisma poweshiek, Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae is a historically common prairie butterfly with a range extending throughout prairie systems of the upper midwestern United States and southern Manitoba, Canada. Rapid, range-wide declines have reduced the number of verified Poweshiek skipperling locations to one in Manitoba prairie, one in Wisconsin prairie, and four in prairie fens in Michigan. Our objective was to investigate parameter suites with the potential to be biologically relevant to Poweshiek skipperling occupancy with the goal of informing conservation efforts. At 18 prairie fens categorized as occupied (n = 9) or unoccupied (n = 9), we collected information on plant biodiversity, water chemistry, soil chemistry, site geometry, and surrounding current and historical land cover at three spatial scales. To address the complexity of these systems, we used multiresponse permutation procedures and nonmetric multidimensional scaling to explore associations between variable groups thought to be relevant to Poweshiek skipperling (conditions for suspected larval host plants, system integrity, and agricultural influence) and occupancy categories. We used indicator species analysis to understand the relationships between plant biodiversity and Poweshiek skipperling occupancy at whole- and intrafen scales. Multiresponse permutation procedures analysis suggested that conditions for suspected larval host plants differed between occupied and unoccupied prairie fens. At the whole-fen scale, we identified 14 plant species associated with Poweshiek-occupied sites, including two purported larval host plants, Muhlenbergia richardsonis and Schizachyrium scoparium. At the intrafen scale, we identified 52 species associated with unoccupied Poweshiek sites, including many weedy species and those tolerant of inundated conditions. Our results can inform the evaluation of potentially suitable habitat for introduction and reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Monitoring of estuaries in the Louisianian Province was performed annually from 1991-1994 to assess ecological conditions on a regional scale. We found over the four years of monitoring, 25 +/- 6% of Gulf of Mexico estuarine sediments in the Louisianian Province displayed poor biological conditions, as measured by benthic community structure, and 14 +/- 7% of the area was characterized by poor water clarity, the presence of marine debris, and elevated levels of fish tissue contaminants. Using statistical associations to discern relationships between ecological condition and exposure or stressor data has shown that much of this `degraded' condition co-occurs with sediment contamination.

AB  - Herpetofauna are frequently cited as ideal indicators for environmental and restoration monitoring due to their importance to ecological functioning, dominance of vertebrate biomass, and sensitivity to environmental change. Despite this relevance, herpetofauna have yet to be fully integrated into comprehensive, community-scale restoration monitoring methodologies. We tested the applicability of one such method, abundance-biomass comparisons (ABCs), to monitoring restoration success in a longleaf pine ecosystem currently undergoing restoration via prescribed burning. W statistics (a metric of environmental perturbation) for herpetofaunal assemblages in longleaf pine stands managed under varying fire intervals closely tracked forest succession from recently burned longleaf pine stands to those characterized by longer times since last burn and high levels of hardwood encroachment. Our results suggest that ABCs may be an applicable method for terrestrial restoration monitoring that encompasses entire faunal assemblages and allows for generality in restoration or disturbance response. We emphasize, however, that applications of this method and others need to take into account the specific ecological characteristics of study organisms and the natural history of study sites to avoid incorrect interpretations of disturbance response and inappropriate management recommendations.

AB  - 1. Multiple biological invertebrate traits (e.g. body size, body form, dispersal potential) each described through multiple categories (e.g. small, intermediate or large body size) could serve as indicators of particular types of human impacts on large rivers. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is scarcely constrained by taxonomic differences among them, i.e. individual trait categories could be used to discriminate various types of human impacts across large geographic areas, which would require the definition of trait patterns for conditions of relatively low human impact.
   2. Using large databases to link 14 biological traits (described through 66 categories) of invertebrate genera to their occurrence in running water reaches with known environmental conditions, we examined the accuracy of various approaches to predict expected trait variation across least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) of Europe in a stepwise analytical procedure. This procedure included Monte Carlo simulations and ultimately the assignment of test-LIRRs (reaches not used in previous analyses) to the previously defined LIRR conditions.
   3. Distance from the source was an integrative variable capturing some (but not all) landscape features (e.g. altitude) or habitat variables (e.g. reach shear stress). Correspondingly, the relative abundance of many trait categories changed along 13 European running waters, although particularly the intensity of these changes differed among these 13 running waters.
   4. 'Downstream models' (using only distance from the source as predictor) provided the least accurate predictions of expected invertebrate trait patterns when compared with 'landscape models' (using distance from the source in combination with altitude and/or latitude) or 'habitat models' (using reach shear stress, mean annual air temperature and/or pH of the water). Landscape models provided more accurate predictions than habitat models, but the improvement of predictions of expected invertebrate traits patterns obtained using landscape models was negligible in comparison with a simpler 'mean-model' approach, suggesting that defining LIRR conditions through simple descriptions of frequency distributions would be sufficient for the future biomonitoring of large European rivers.
   5. To define these LIRR conditions, we used the average of the relative abundance of each trait category from 68 LIRRs (>= 40 m wide) as expected LIRR values, and computed LIRR frequency distributions that described the deviations of the 68 individual LIRRs from these expected values. Computing such deviations from the expected LIRR values for 57 test-LIRRs (also >= 40 m wide), 57 trait categories correctly assigned > 90% of the test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions if the latter were defined through the entire range of the LIRR frequency distributions. To the 90%-range enveloped by the LIRR frequency distributions, 42 trait categories correctly assigned > 80% and 12 categories > 90% of the test-LIRRs.
   6. Using a framework that required no regionalisation of a large geographic area, no modelling of expected values using environmental information and no standardised invertebrate sampling, the performance of our trait approach to assign test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions encourages future assessments of deviations from these defined LIRR conditions in large European river reaches with different types of human impacts.

AB  - In the last years, scientific and industrial communities have put a lot of efforts into the development of a new framework for the assessment of structural integrity, generally known as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), which should allow real-time, automatic evaluations of the state of the structures based on a network of permanently installed sensors. In the context of mechanical, aerospace and civil structures, several approaches have been proposed to address the SHM problem, yet, it remains often difficult to diagnose damages and estimate the structural health when dealing with varying operating and environmental conditions. Particle Filters have already been proposed as a time-domain-based method in the field of SHM, showing promising results as estimators of hidden, not directly observable states, such as those typically related to damages. At the same time, neural networks-based autoencoders have been proposed for structural damage detection, demonstrating to be capable of capturing damage-related features from vibration measurements. This work aims at exploiting the individual advantages offered by the two approaches by combining them in a novel algorithm for structural damage detection and localization, robust with respect to changing environmental conditions. The algorithm is further equipped with a fault indicator module stemming from the introduction of an automatic threshold and both deterministic and probabilistic fault indicators, thus offering a complete, valuable tool for supporting decision making with limited human intervention. The method is demonstrated with reference to a numerical MDOF system whose parameters are taken from a literature benchmark case study.

AB  - Purpose Mooring chains used to stabilise offshore floating platforms are often subjected to harsh environmental conditions on a daily basis, i.e. high tidal waves, storms, etc. Therefore, the integrity assessment of chain links is vital, and regular inspection is mandatory for offshore structures. The development of chain climbing robots is still in its infancy due to the complicated climbing structure presented by mooring chains. The purpose of this paper is to establish an automated climbing technique for mooring chain inspection.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a Cartesian legged tracked-wheel crawler robot developed for mooring chain inspection. The proposed robot addresses the misalignment condition of the mooring chains which is commonly evident in in situ conditions.
   Findings The mooring chain link misalignment is investigated mathematically and used as a design parameter for the proposed robot. The robot is validated with laboratory-based climbing experiments.
   Practical implications Chain breaking can lead to vessel drift and serious damage such as riser rupture, production shutdown and hydrocarbon release. Currently, structural health monitoring of chain links is conducted using either remotely operated vehicles which come at a high cost or by manual means which increase the danger to human operators. The robot can be used as a platform to convey equipment, i.e. tools for non-destructive testing/evaluation applications.
   Originality/value This study has upgraded a previously designed magnetic adhesion tracked-wheel mooring chain climbing robot to address the misalignment issues of operational mooring chains. As a result of this study, the idea of an orthogonally placed Cartesian legged-magnetic adhesion tracked wheel robotic platform which can eliminate concerns related to the misaligned mooring chain climbing has been established.

AB  - This work aims to assess the spatial and temporal variations of four biomarkers activities and to integrate their biological responses in a battery using the gastropod Phorcus turbinatus. The monitoring was carried out during the period between April 2014 and January 2015 at six stations along the northern and the northeastern coasts of Tunisia. The Fulton condition factor was estimated and the activities of catalase, acetylcholinesterase and glutathione-S-transferase were evaluated by spectrophotometry. A multi-biomarker battery approach was used to assess ecosystems' condition and to identify environmental impacts on the organisms. The results suggest that the enzymatic activities of CAT and GST depend especially on seasons. As for AChE activity, it was similar between seasons and stations. The values of the integrated biological response were maximal at Jarzouna in summer and at Sidi Daoued in winter, indicating the presence of severe stressors suffered by the organisms. This perturbation may be due to the enrichment of the waters by xenobiotics, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, insecticides, phosphate wastes, PCBs and pesticides. Thus, P. turbinatus seems to be a good bioindicator of chemical pollution, constituting an adequate tool for a bio-monitoring program.

AB  - We propose an index of bird detectability that can improve the selection of more suitable species to be used for evaluating habitat integrity. Bird surveys were conducted in a conservation unit, the Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy, southern Brazil. We ranked the bird species according to detectability index, which allowed us to establish two groups: species with low detectability (SLD) and species with high detectability (SHD). We also tested some features that are frequently associated with bird species of high detectability. Sound frequency was the attribute more clearly associated with detectability. We found a negative correlation between sound frequency and detectability, especially within certain groups, i.e. Tyrannidae. In our studied system we recognized Aratinga auricapillus as the best biological indicator among the studied birds, due its high vulnerability and high detectability.

AB  - In recent years, several benthic biotic indices have been proposed to be used as ecological indicators in estuarine and coastal waters. One such indicator, the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), was designed to establish the ecological quality of European coasts. The index examined the response of soft-bottom benthic communities to natural and man-induced disturbances in coastal and estuarine environments. It has been successfully applied to different geographical areas and under different impact sources, with increasing user numbers in European marine waters (Baltic, North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean). The AMBI has been used also for the determination of the ecological quality status (EcoQ) within the context of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).
   In this contribution, 38 different applications including six new case studies (hypoxia processes, sand extraction, oil platform impacts, engineering works, dredging and fish aquaculture) are presented. The results show the response of the benthic communities to different disturbance sources in a simple way. Those communities act as ecological indicators of the 'health' of the system, indicating clearly the gradient associated with the disturbance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, many institutions are conducting or planning large, regional-scale ecosystem assessments of estuarine health. A full, integrated assessment of these environments requires a large suite of biological, physical, and chemical indicators, including sedimentary chemistry, ecotoxicology, benthic community structure, and bioaccumulation. This commitment is beyond the capacity of most organizations, and a simpler approach is required to accommodate limited financial resources. A case is made for the use of sedimentary heavy metals as an easy and inexpensive indicator. The advantages are that sediments identify the "pristine" condition and give baseline information against which future management strategies may be benchmarked, and that they differentiate solely human-induced change from natural variation. Sediment indicators in depositional environments are also less dynamic than those associated with water and biota. Our objective is to demonstrate that sediment-bound heavy metals data provide the spatial extent and magnitude of chemical change, as well as the risk of biological stress attributable to contamination in estuarine ecosystems. An assessment of this scheme involving seven New South Wales (Australia) estuaries suggests that sedimentary heavy-metal indicators used in a weight-of-evidence approach, with data collected during the recent Australian National Land and Water Resources Audit, enhances estuarine condition assessment.

AB  - Ecosystem services can be defined as the ecosystem's contribution to human activities. According to recent assessments, the agricultural sector is one of the most important economic users of ecosystem services in Europe. To assess, value, and account for ecosystem services related to the agri-food system offers the possibility to measure and investigate how agricultural management practices together with changing environmental conditions can affect ecological resilience. However, the accounting of ecosystem services' flows needs to be carefully addressed, because the overlapping of services and benefits and the overlapping of what are considered intermediate and final services could create dangerous misunderstandings about the role and importance of ecosystem services in agriculture. This paper reports on the possible accounting approaches that can be used to assess crop provision, as well as their meanings and implications from an ecological to an economic perspective. The results demonstrate that an economic accounting-based assessment of ecosystem services needs to move from an ecological holistic view to a one-by-one disaggregation of ecosystem services in order to avoid underestimates that would ultimately affect the policy perception of the role of ecosystems with respect to the agri-food systems' resilience.

AB  - Type-specific physico-chemical reference conditions are required for the assessment of ecological status in the Water Framework Directive context, similarly to the biological and hydro-morphological elements. This directive emphasises that natural variability of quality elements in high status (reference condition) needs to be quantified. Mediterranean streams often present a marked seasonal pattern in hydrological, biological and geochemical processes which could affect physico-chemical reference conditions. This study establishes general physico-chemical reference conditions (oxygenation, nutrient, salinity and acidification conditions) for different Mediterranean stream types. 116 potential reference sites located in 23 Mediterranean catchments in Spain were sampled in spring, summer and autumn in 2003. All sites were subjected to a screening method for the selection of reference sites in Mediterranean streams (Mediterranean Reference Criteria) and classified using a pre-established stream typology that establishes five different stream types (temporary streams, evaporite-calcareous at medium altitude, siliceous headwaters, calcareous headwaters and large watercourses). Reference conditions (reference value and reference threshold equivalents to high-good class boundary) were calculated using two different methods according to the availability of reference sites: the reference site 75th percentile approach of all reference sites and the 25th percentile of the population approach. The majority of the studied potential reference sites (76 out of 116) were selected as reference sites. Regarding type-specific reference conditions, only siliceous headwaters could be considered different from the rest of stream types because lower conductivity and pH. All reference stream types presented seasonal differences as regards some parameters, except for temporary streams due to the high natural variation of this stream type. For those parameters which presented seasonal differences in a specific stream type, the least restrictive values were proposed as reference conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mass loss rates of wooden sticks (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) and macroinvertebrate community composition were measured in the Waikato Region of northern New Zealand at 53 running water sites draining native forest catchments (reference), or characterised by urban, industrial, agroforestry or hydrological stressors. Overall wood substrates retained 80% of initial dry mass over 2-3 month incubation periods, equating to average daily decay coefficients (k(d)) of 0.0027 or 0.0002 when adjusted for degree days (k(dd)). There were no statistically significant differences in decay rates between stressor types and native forest reference sites. In contrast, macroinvertebrate richness and compositional metrics varied significantly from reference conditions for several stressor types. Wood decay rates were weakly related to macroinvertebrate community composition, while k(dd) was weakly but significantly related to % worms', %EPT* abundance and Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index. The results indicate weak correspondence between macroinvertebrate indicators and wood decay rates, with spatial and temporal factors potentially masking stressor responses. Before wood decay can be widely used as an indicator of lotic ecosystem health there needs to be an improved understanding of environmental factors affecting breakdown rates.

AB  - We developed ecological indicators of stream macroinvertebrates in two regions of the Midwestern USA dominated by row-crop agriculture. Indicators were identified in a hierarchical fashion. Reach-scale variables related to macroinvertebrate attributes were first identified, and then catchment-scale variables related to those reach-scale variables were identified. Reach-scale indicators common to both regions were % fine sediments, number of habitats, and width:depth ratio. SD of elevation and % commercial land use were selected as catchment-scale indicators in both regions. Our analyses revealed a multi-scale mechanistic relationship between macroinvertebrate attributes associated with degraded conditions (i.e., fewer taxa of Plecoptera and Trichoptera, and a higher proportion of chironomids, burrowers, and depositional taxa) and % fine sediments in stream reaches, which, in turn, was negatively related to catchment characteristics (i.e., SD of elevation) in one region. Understanding how natural variables such as topography influence channel shape and within-channel structure can help guide management options and expectations for different regions. We suggest that developing multi-scale indicators in a mechanistic fashion will be more effective than developing indicators at only one spatial scale for protecting and restoring stream structure and function.

AB  - Port environments are highly dynamic and hotspots for marine bioinvasion. This study investigated the bacterial diversity at two geographically distant ports (Mangalore-marine port; and Haldia-riverine port) using nextgeneration sequencing during southwest monsoon and non-monsoon (Pre-monsoon) seasons. During southwest monsoon, at both marine and riverine ports, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated to bacteria reported to have hydrocarbon degrading ability were observed. Whereas during pre-monsoon, a significant increase in benthic bacterial OTUs was evident at the marine port, and the riverine port was characterized by oceanic species OTUs. Results suggest that the dynamics of prevalent environmental conditions, driven by seasons, led to emergence of ecologically relevant bacteria, many of which have been observed for the first time in Indian coastal waters. Their presence could be used as indicators of prevailing environmental conditions and nature of anthropogenic influence in port ecosystems. Unravelling functional roles of such ecologically relevant species is a way forward.

AB  - The present study performed in Horten Inner Harbor (southern Norway) shows that foraminifera link the present-day Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) to EcoQS of former times and, this way, bridge an important knowledge gap concerning determination of reference conditions, even in naturally stressed environments such as transitional waters and oxygen depleted habitats. In Horten Inner Harbor, geochemical data in the oldest deposits showed stable background concentrations for about 200 years (from about 1600 to 1800) before human activity became noteworthy, reflecting 'good' to 'high' status. Hence, it is reasonable that organisms, which lived in the area during the same nearly un-impacted time interval, represent the biologically defined reference conditions, irrespectively of whether the biotic indices are classified as 'good' or 'bad'. The present paper illustrates, with a conceptual model, how the retrospective foraminiferal biomonitoring method can be used to detect environmental perturbations in estuaries and meet the difficulties of the Estuarine Quality Paradox.

AB  - DNA-derived measurements of biological composition have the potential to produce data covering all of life, and provide a tantalizing proposition for researchers and managers. We used metabarcoding to compare benthic eukaryote composition from five estuaries of varying condition. In contrast to traditional studies, we found biotic richness was greatest in the most disturbed estuary, with this being due to the large volume of extraneous material (i.e. run-off from aquaculture, agriculture and other catchment activities) being deposited in the system. In addition, we found strong correlations between composition and a number of environmental variables, including nutrients, pH and turbidity. A wide range of taxa responded to these environmental gradients, providing new insights into their sensitivities to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Metabarcoding has the capacity to bolster current monitoring techniques, enabling the decisions regarding ecological condition to be based on a more holistic view of biodiversity.

AB  - Riparian Quality Index (RQI): A methodology for characterising and assessing the environmental conditions of riparian zones
   This paper presents a new version of the Riparian Quality Index (RQI). This index serves to assess the ecological status of riparian systems. The paper provides recommended field forms for the collection of the data used to characterise riparian systems prior to their assessment. The RQI considers the main sources of riparian ecological functions and environmental services. It represents a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating the structure of riparian zones, an element of the river morphological conditions considered by the Water Framework Directive. The Index was applied to the Guadiana Basin and other Spanish rivers providing helpful criteria for not only evaluating the present status of riparian systems but also formulating diagnosis and rehabilitation options. It represents a checklist of riparian natural characteristics and possible human-impacted riparian features, and it has valuable potential applications for post-project appraisals.

AB  - Water resource agencies are increasingly confronted with issues of methods and data comparability when assessing inter-jurisdictional waters. The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) is developing an assessment framework for the diverse nontidal monitoring data collected by Potomac basin jurisdictions. The ICPRB's goal is to augment the jurisdictions' water quality assessments with uniform, basin-wide evaluations of habitat and biological integrity. Disparate datasets were integrated and used to select and calibrate a common suite of biological indicators of human disturbance. Aggregated physiographic regions were most effective at grouping streams into site classes with similar attributes. Common elements from states' habitat and water quality assessments were used to define regional reference and impairment criteria. Seven macroinvertebrate metrics distinguished reference from impaired sites in most regions: EPT richness, Hilsenhoff Family Biotic Index, percent clingers, percent collectors, percent dominance, percent EPT, and taxonomic richness. Reference communities in the Piedmont region of the basin were dissimilar from those in Highland and Valley regions, suggesting a need for different reference conditions and metric thresholds in these regions. Results confirm that useful bioindicators of aquatic health can be generated from multiple datasets if the synthesis is done with care. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

AB  - Stress priming is an important strategy for enhancing plant defense capacity to deal with environmental challenges and involves reprogrammed transcriptional responses. Although ultraviolet (UV) light exposure is a widely adopted approach to elicit stress memory and tolerance in plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying UV-mediated plant priming tolerance are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the changes in the global transcriptome profile of wild Arachis stenosperma leaves in response to UV-C exposure. A total of 5751 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with the majority associated with cell signaling, protein dynamics, hormonal and transcriptional regulation, and secondary metabolic pathways. The expression profiles of DEGs known as indicators of priming state, such as transcription factors, transcriptional regulators and protein kinases, were further characterized. A meta-analysis, followed by qRT-PCR validation, identified 18 metaDEGs as being commonly regulated in response to UV and other primary stresses. These genes are involved in secondary metabolism, basal immunity, cell wall structure and integrity, and may constitute important players in the general defense processes and establishment of a priming state in A. stenosperma. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of transcriptional dynamics involved in wild Arachis adaptation to stressful conditions of their natural habitats.

AB  - Livestock activities, mainly those related to livestock rearing, are generally carried out in special and specific environments, susceptible to alterations, with particular and inherent characteristics of soil, vegetation and climate, not conducive to the development of the farming. Paraguay is no exception, because more than half of its territory is made up of semi-arid and wetlands, one of the most representative being the Neembucu wetlands and its areas of influence. In this area, the presence of certain genetic groups made up of local or naturalized bovines and bovines of transnational or exotic genetics stands out. The aim of this work was to assess protein status in cattle during the summer, fall, and winter as an indicator of adaptation to the wetlands of Neembucu, Paraguay. The study compared local and exotic breeds in an extensive cattle farming system, grouped by genotype into Criollo Neembucu; Criollo Pilcomayo; Nelore; Brangus, and Brahman. Blood levels of urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and body condition were analyzed. The local criollo breeds had higher urea concentrations, total protein, and globulin values, most markedly in the summer. The exotic breeds had elevated creatinine levels. Nelore had the lowest marks for body condition both in the summer and winter. The analysis of main components explained over 60 % of the variation. Globulin and total protein integrated the first component in all three seasons. The most dissimilar breed pairs were Criollo Neembucu and Brahman, and also Criollo Pilcomayo and Nelore. The results suggest an adaptation process in the metabolic pathways of nitrogenated compounds and the potential capacity for immune response in local breeds. The results suggest that exotic breeds have mechanisms that compromise tissue protein integrity and renal function in the specific environments particular to the wetlands of Neembucu.

AB  - The use of reference conditions is essential to the monitoring and management of aquatic ecosystems. We examined existing and potential reference sites through historical data, maps, and field data collected from river sites in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. In our study, we applied nine criteria that best reflect the characteristics of South African rivers on 24a prioriselected reference sites. These nine criteria comprised of catchment conditions (flow modification and natural landscape) and site-specific attributes (water quality, human disturbance, river channel, water abstraction, riparian vegetation, riparian zone modification, and instream habitat quality). Thea prioriselected reference sites were subjected to validation using multivariate methods, such as analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), similarity percentages (SIMPER), and non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on the macroinvertebrate fauna by applying a SASS5 threshold considered to be an indicator of undisturbed sites in South African rivers. We identified differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages of the reference conditions for each river group based on their ecoregions, geomorphology and seasonal variations. Ecoregions and river geomorphology were better in the grouping of sites with similar reference conditions than the seasons. Our findings indicated that all of the selected sites could be considered as valid reference sites; however, caution should be taken in applying this method to lowland rivers because of their noticeable seasonal variability and habitat instability which tend to alter their reference states. We recommend that a type-specific reference condition be developed for lowland rivers. Also, statistical validation of reference conditions should be a continuous process in river biomonitoring.

AB  - Validation of the AZTI's Fish Index (AFI), proposed for the Basque Country (northern Spain), in assessing fish quality within the Water Framework Directive (WFD), is under-taken. The response to anthropogenic pressure is investigated, in setting the boundaries between the different quality status classes. Hence, 12 estuaries were sampled, at different frequencies, between 1989 and 2007, by means of a beam trawl. Significant (p < 0.0001) correlations were found between the AFI and oxygen saturation and ammonia. Oxygen quality standards are used to set boundaries between quality classes. Then, the AFIs obtained are compared with different anthropogenic pressures, including urban and industrial discharges, engineering works and dredging. The effects of the removal of some of these pressures are also studied. The total number of pressures within an estuary shows significant (p < 0.009) negative correlation with AFI, explaining between 51 and 62% of the variability in fish quality. The impact of pressures upon fish and demersal assemblages is detected as required by the WFD. Nonetheless, further investigation and intercalibration of the methods used, are necessary.

AB  - Fisheries management programs, such as the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP), urgently need a nationwide spatial framework and database for health assessment and policy development to protect and improve riverine systems. To meet this need, we developed a spatial framework and database using National Hydrography Dataset Plus (1: 100,000-scale); http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus). This framework uses interconfluence river reaches and their local and network catchments as fundamental spatial river units and a series of ecological and political spatial descriptors as hierarchy structures to allow users to extract or analyze information at spatial scales that they define. This database consists of variables describing channel characteristics, network position/ connectivity, climate, elevation, gradient, and size. It contains a series of catchment-natural and human-induced factors that are known to influence river characteristics. Our framework and database assembles all river reaches and their descriptors in one place for the first time for the conterminous United States. This framework and database provides users with the capability of adding data, conducting analyses, developing management scenarios and regulation, and tracking management progresses at a variety of spatial scales. This database provides the essential data needs for achieving the objectives of NFHAP and other management programs. The downloadable beta version database is available at http://ec2-184-73-40-15.compute-1.amazonaws.com/nfhap/main/.

AB  - This paper summarizes sampling results from NOAA's National Status and Trends (NS&T) Program for marine environmental quality in Delaware Bay. A stratified-random design was used to determine the spatial extent of sediment contamination and toxicity in Delaware Bay from offshore stations in the coastal zone, the lower estuary, the upper estuary, the fresh/salt mixing zone, and tidal fresh areas. Sediment samples were taken for chemical analyses of major classes of environmental contaminants, a suite of toxicity bioassays, and benthic macrofaunal community assessment to identify patterns of resident species. The tidal-fresh areas and portions of the mixing zone of the study area were heavily contaminated. Contaminant concentrations were frequently above the 90th percentile of EMAP Virginian Province levels. PAHs in the sediment were higher than previously documented, with a major component of PAHs being pyrogenic in origin. Bioassay results were highly variable. Toxicity and contaminant levels were correlated when aggregated into indices, but were only marginally correlated with benthic community impacts. High and low abundance stations were found in all zones. Most of the tidal fresh stations were dominated by pollution tolerant species. Species diversity and abundance were generally lowest in the fresh/salt mixing zone.

AB  - The Prairie Ecozone contains 5% of Canada's land area and represents 16% of the Great Plains of North America. Current estimates indicate that 25 - 30% of original Canadian grassland habitats remain, largely concentrated in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan with fragments distributed throughout southern Manitoba. The size, distribution and condition of native grasslands serve as valuable indicators of the ecological integrity and the sustainability of those landscape types. With so little native grasslands remaining, areas that conserve grasslands serve as core sites for indicators such as gaps in ecosystem and wildlife habitat protection, i.e. which ecosystems are well-represented, poorly represented or have no representation. Such gap analyses helps to determine where protection efforts need to be placed in the future. Overall, about 3.5% of the Prairie Ecozone of Canada is under some form of conservation area status. This paper reports, relative to the ecoregions and political jurisdictions of the Prairie Ecozone, on the amount and distribution of various types of conservation areas and native grasslands. Relationships between the occurrence of conservation areas and grasslands are presented. Implications for conservation area planning and management are discussed within regional, national and international contexts. The issue of which characteristics of conservation areas should be assessed and monitored to address conservation objectives for sustainability is also discussed.

AB  - Urbanization and its associated stressors such as flow alteration, channel modification and poor water quality is a leading cause of ecological degradation to rivers and streams. Driven by public concern to address this issue, there has been a dramatic increase in urban restoration projects since 1990 using in-stream structures. Attempts at restoring the ecological condition of urban streams using structures have produced varied results, but projects do not often meet planned ecological goals. A major challenge to improving the ecological health of urban streams is to better understand how to incorporate ecological assessments into a 'restoration' design framework with reasonable expectations for ecological recovery. A naturalization design framework was used in a project on a 0.62-km reach of the North Branch of the Chicago River in Northbrook, Illinois. Initial surveys of channel morphology, habitat and biota identified poor pool-riffle bed structure and fish biodiversity, which became the basis for research and development of a pool-riffle structure specifically designed for constrained, low-gradient channels. Habitat and fish surveys were conducted pre- and post-construction. The project improved Enesohabitat structure, and fish abundance, and biomass and diversity were greater for 2 years following construction (2002-2003) compared to 3 years prior to construction (1999-2001). However, the improved fish metrics were in the low range when compared to rural streams in the same ecoregion, and the fish community consisted primarily of tolerant, slow-water species. Absent were intolerant and riffle dwelling species, such as insectivorous cyprinids and darters. Assessment of pre- and post-project ecological condition and the use of species information provided a basis for ecologically informed design and expanded our understanding of the limitations to restoring urban streams.

AB  - Chromosomal non-disjunction in female meiosis gives rise to reduced fertility and trisomy in humans. Human oocytes, especially from aged women, appear especially susceptible to non-disjunction. The oocyte spindle is crucial for high fidelity of chromosome segregation at meiotic divisions, and alterations in spindle morphology are therefore indicators of adverse conditions during oocyte development that may result in meiotic aneuploidy. In the past, oocytes had to be fixed for spindle analysis, precluding direct non-invasive identification of aneugens and adverse maturation conditions that affect spindle integrity and chromosome behaviour. Aneuploidy research for detection of spindle aberrations was therefore mainly focused on in vivo or in vitro exposed, fixed animal oocytes or cytogenetic analysis of spread oocytes. Orientation independent enhanced polarizing microscopy with nearly circularly polarized light and electronically controlled liquid crystal compensator optics is a new tool to study spindle morphology non-invasively in vivo for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. Image generation by polarization microscopy depends on the intrinsic optical properties of the spindle with its paracrystalline microtubule lattice. When polarized light passes through such a lattice it induces a splitting of the beam and shift in the plane of vibration and retardation of light (termed birefringence and retardance). Studies of animal oocytes and follicle-cell denuded human oocytes fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection for assisted conception have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of enhanced polarization microscopy. The method can be employed in aneuploidy research for non-invasive dose-response studies to detect spindle aberrations, for instance, in combination with cytogenetic analysis. Due to the non-invasive nature of the technique it may be employed in routine analysis of human oocytes to assess risks by lifestyle factors, and occupational and adverse environmental exposures.

AB  - Ecologically based farming conserves and improves the soil resource and protects environmental quality by using organic or natural resources without the application of synthetic chemicals. Soil quality assessment indicates the ability of management systems to optimize soil productivity and to maintain its structural and biological integrity. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of ecologically based management on biochemical characteristics of soil [soil quality indicators (SQI)] as an assessment of soil quality. The study was conducted on an ecologically based farming enterprise established on gently sloping soils of Sharpsburg silt loam (fine montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls) in Clay County, Missouri, which was previously under conventional corn and soybean production. The transition to organic farming began in 1995, which included a primary management strategy to restore soil organic matter consisting of the establishment of native prairie plants and the application of composted vegetative residues and litter from horse and laying hen operations. Soils were collected at 0-10 cm depths from sites under organic production (orchard and vegetable), managed prairie/pasture and from adjacent unmanaged fields during 2003-2008 for soil quality assessment. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and water-stable soil aggregates were considerably increased by up to 60 and 72%, respectively, in organic production sites compared with tilled cropland by the fifth year of assessment. Organically managed systems and restored prairie sites significantly increased (P<0.05) soil enzyme activities compared with unmanaged grass and tilled cropland. For example, dehydrogenase and glucosaminidase activities increased by 60 and 73%, respectively, under organic vegetables compared with tilled cropland. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with SOC content (r values up to 0.90, P<0.001). The results of the soil quality assessment suggest that ecologically based management successfully restored biological activity of silt loam soils previously under intensive conventional agriculture. The system practiced at the study sites illustrates how resources internal to the farm (i.e., composts) can be used to manage soil productivity.

AB  - Large hydropower schemes have recently gained renewed interest as a provider of efficient and renewable energy, particularly in developing countries. However, some dams may have widespread effects on hydrological and ecosystem integrity, which reach beyond the scales addressed by typical environmental impact assessments. In this paper we address two main ecological impacts-reduced river connectivity and changes in the natural flow regime-at the scale of the entire Mekong River Basin as an important component of dam evaluations. The goal is to improve our understanding of the effect of individual dams as well as clusters of dams at a very large scale. We introduce two new indices, the River Connectivity Index (RCI) as a tool to measure network connectivity, and the River Regulation Index (RRI) as a measure of flow alteration, and calculate the individual and cumulative impact of 81 proposed dams using HydroROUT, a graph-theory based river routing model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how quantitative weighting, e.g. based on river habitat characterizations or species distribution models, may be included in dam impact assessments.
   A global comparison of large rivers shows that the Mekong would experience strong deterioration in the fragmentation and flow regulation indices if all dams that are currently under consideration in the basin were built, placing it among other heavily impounded rivers in the world. The results illustrate the importance of considering the location of dams, both relative in the network and relative to other already existing dams. Our approach may be used as an index-based ranking system for individual dams, or to compare basin-wide development scenarios, with the goal of providing guidance for decision makers wishing to select locations for future dams with less environmental impacts and to identify and develop potential mitigation strategies.

AB  - Alkyl polyglycosides produced from natural base stocks represent a new and promising nonionic surfactants group for a very broad range of applications. Taking into account their increasing usage in chemical products a comprehensive investigation into their environmental compatibility assessment was conducted encompassing aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability in the aqueous and terrestrial environment as well as ecotoxicological studies in standard tests and model ecosystems. Alkyl polyglycosides proved to be readily and completely biodegradable in all environmental conditions and showed favourable ecotoxicological properties. The environmental risk assessment based upon these data revealed unequivocally that alkyl polyglycosides do not constitute an environmental risk even under unrealistic worst case conditions.

AB  - Incisive inquiry involving indicators of ecological and environmental integrity entails exploration of spatial structure at selected scales from landscape level to regional regimes. Conventional colorization of digital displays provides perspective but is largely lacking for localization, elaboration, and explication. An overall objective for recent research is explicit extraction of spatial structure as hyper-hills and proximal propensity. Shared scripting as a computational configuration affords analytical advantage, adaptability and availability. Conservation context captures challenges of changing conditions for complex components at several spatial scales. Hyper-hill hypotheses, relativized ratings, and post patterned nucleated networks supporting secondary scaling scenarios are current contributions. Computational concerns in indicant informatics are also addressed. Retrospective results are cogent comparators for change. Shared scripting couples R software with Python as R||Python (R in parallel with Python), which is supplemented by strategic sequencing of compilation capabilities in general GIS (geographic information systems). The specific research question(s) is/are what is the particular pattern of placement and propagation in intensification of an indicant of biodiversity (avian species richness), and how does this relate to some other co-located indicants of environmental effects. This is addressed in a legacy dataset for Pennsylvania, USA. Emergent emphasis is on truncated trees of topology and impaneled indicators. Shareable software has HIDN (hexagonal indicant dual networking) as an aggregate acronym with duly drawn disclaimers.

AB  - Excessive fine sediment accumulation (i.e., siltation) in streams and rivers originates from several human activities and globally results in heavy alterations of aquatic habitats and biological communities. In this study the correlation between fine sediment and several benthic invertebrate community metrics was tested through a manipulative approach in alpine streams, where siltation mainly results as a physical alteration (i.e., the clogging of substrate interstices) without the influence of co-occurring confounding factors. We selected 12 candidate metrics, belonging to three different categories: compositional, structural and functional. We first carried out a manipulative experiment where artificial substrates were used to provide standardized conditions of siltation. All candidate metrics were calculated for each artificial substrate and the selection of the best combination of metrics was statistically performed with an information-theoretic approach. All candidate metrics were calculated both at family level and also at a mixed level (family and genus) in order to account for the systematic resolution. Then, data from a field study on alpine streams affected by mining activities were used as independent dataset for testing the performance of the selected metrics. We found that the total taxa richness, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) richness and the abundance of benthic invertebrates associated to rheophilous conditions and coarse mineral substrates were the most sensitive metrics. When these metrics were aggregated into a multimetric index in the validation dataset, we observed high and significant correlations between index values and the quantity of fine sediment for both taxonomic levels, especially for the mixed level. The findings of this study provide useful tools for biomonitoring the effects of fine sediment in low order, mountainous streams and contribute to improve our diagnostic ability on stressor-specific alterations.

AB  - The development of indicators to assess relative freshwater condition is critical for management and conservation. Predictive modeling can enhance the utility of indicators by providing estimates of condition for unsurveyed locations. Such approaches grant understanding of where "good" and "poor" conditions occur and provide insight into landscape contexts supporting such conditions. However, as assessments are conducted at large extents crossing jurisdictional boundaries, combined datasets are likely not suited for traditional assessment approaches which rely on jurisdictionally-specific reference sites. Here, we used a large dataset compiled from multiple providers to assess the condition of fish habitat for non-tidal streams and rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW), USA. We concurrently used community and species-level analyses to provide a more holistic view of habitat conditions by using random forest models to predict selected metrics and species occurrence with landscape data for inland CBW stream reaches. Community analyses included metrics describing composition, tolerances, habitat preferences, and functional traits of fish communities whereas species-level analyses consisted of distribution models for key sensitive and gamefish species. For community analyses, a final index was calculated as the average of selected metric deciles with higher scores inferring less biologically altered (i.e., better) conditions, providing an alternative to using reference sites. For species analyses, species occurrence was predicted for stream reaches, with presence indicating suitable habitat. Uncertainty was calculated for both approaches using model prediction intervals. Results indicated different numbers of suitable metrics for each region, with most in the Northern Appalachian (15) and least in the Southern Appalachian Piedmont (3). Four species (three sensitive) were suitable for modeling. At the CBW scale, predictions did not vary greatly among deciles for the community or species analyses for 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. Most stream reaches did not vary in mean decile rank or in species occurrence between 2001 and 2016; however, the largest community changes occurred in large rivers in the Coastal Plains ecoregion and the largest species occurrence changes occurred in Torrent Suckers in medium-sized rivers. When compared, results from community analyses agreed for one sensitive species (Brook Trout) but not the other three, potentially due to regionally inappropriate tolerance assignment. Comparisons also demonstrated substantial variation among approaches suggesting a lack of redundancy. While each approach traditionally has its targeted audience and respective strengths and weaknesses, concurrent use of these approaches permits direct comparisons and may assuage shortcomings of each approach when considered separately.

AB  - The facultative halophyte Salvadora persica L. grow in arid, semiarid and saline areas. In present study, drought induced alterations in growth, ion homeostasis, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, ROS regulation and antioxidative defense components were analyzed in S. persica with an aim to elucidate the drought tolerance mechanisms. In response to drought, significant reductions in growth, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic pigments were observed in S. persica. However, leaf relative water content (RWC %) did not change significantly. In S. persica seedlings, the growth, photosynthetic pigment contents and photosynthesis were resumed to control level within 7 d, when the drought treated plants were re-irrigated. However, quantum yield of PSII (Phi PSII), rate of electron transport (ETR), maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), and photochemical quenching (qP) remained unaffected under water deficit stress. The results suggest that both non-stomatal as well as stomatal limitations can account for photosynthetic reduction. The ionomics studies revealed no significant alterations in levels of Na+, K+, Ca2+, B, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mo, and Zn2+ in leaf tissue during drought. However, there was increase in levels of Na+,K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in root tissue in response to drought. The activity of different enzymatic antioxidants like SOD, APX, and GR remained unaffected during drought, whereas PDX activity increased and CAT activity declined under drought stress in comparison to control. This result proposes that vital ROS scavenging enzymes like SOD, APX and GR are at threshold levels to maintain the appropriate concentration of ROS. In S. persica, the ratio of AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG (which are the indicators of redox potential of cell) remained steady or increased under drought which indicates that cellular redox level is maintained in this halophyte. Although ROS levels (H2O2 and O-2) increased significantly under drought stress, electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation level remained unchanged in response to water deficit condition which indicates that minimal increase in ROS level under drought stress act in signaling for activation of ROS scavenging enzymes. Our results propose that decline in growth and photosynthesis is a vital energy conservation strategy of S. persica under drought condition. The rapid recovery of growth, photosynthesis and water relations in S. persica following drought seems to be a critical mechanism permitting this plant to withstand and survive under drought environment. In addition, our results implicate that efficient regulations of antioxidative enzymes in leaf tissue contribute in regulating the ROS level and cellular redox status, thereby protecting the plant from drought induced oxidative damage in S. persica. Consequently ion homeostasis, plant water status, and integrity of photosynthetic apparatus is maintained in S. persica subjected to drought. The results of present study propose that S. persica is a drought tolerant halophyte and it can be a potential candidate for restoration of degraded saline lands of coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Fisheries oceanography is the study of ecological relationships between fishes and the dynamics of their marine environments and aims to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological factors that affect the recruitment and abundance of harvested species. A recent push within the fisheries management community is toward ecosystem-based management. Here, we show how physical and biological oceanography data can be used to generate indicators of ocean conditions in an ecosystem context, and how these indicators relate to the recruitment of salmonids, sablefish, sardines, and rockfish in the California Current

AB  - During the last 200 years, many rivers in industrialized countries have been modified by canalization. In the last two decades, the philosophy of river management has changed considerably, and restoration of ecological integrity has become an important management goal. One appealing restoration approach is to create "river widenings" that permit braiding within a limited area. This study presents a new and efficient framework for rapidly assessing such widening projects and offers a novel method to comparing restored sites with near-natural stretches (stencil technique). The proposed framework evaluates spatial patterns of riparian habitat types using landscape metrics as indicators. Three case studies from river restoration (river widening) in Switzerland are presented for demonstration purposes. The method compares restored sites with prerestoration conditions and near-natural conditions, which are assumed to represent the worst and best case states of a river system. To take into account the limited spatial extent of the restored sites, the so-called "stencil technique" was developed, where the landscape metrics of the near-natural reference sites are calculated for both the entire study area and smaller sections (clips). The clips are created by using a stencil that has the exact shape and size of the restored area (random window-sampling technique). Subsequently, the calculated metrics for the restored sites are compared to the range of values calculated for the near-natural data subset. Our studies show that the proposed method is easy to apply and provides a valid way to assess the restoration success of river widenings. We found that river widenings offer real opportunities for establishing riparian habitats. However, they promote mainly pioneer successional stages and the habitat mosaic of the restored section is more complex than at the near-natural reference sites.

AB  - This study investigated the fish fauna of a stream in southeastern Brazil that runs through sugar cane-growing and urban areas that are subject to sewage discharge. It aimed to determine the importance of spatial and environmental factors on fish distributions and to assess the use of fish as indicators of the environmental conditions. A longitudinal pattern of chemical water quality was observed, with more disturbed conditions at the urban sites. Several opportunistic or tolerant and omnivorous species such as Astyanax altiparanae, Poecilia reticulata, and Astyanax fasciatus were numerically abundant at these urban sites, which resulted in a consistent increase in species density and biomass along the stream. Redundancy analysis extracted three axes, identifying a nutrient-productivity gradient associated with different species composition patterns, as also detected by the indicator species analysis. No species could be considered a potential indicator of the agricultural area in the dry season, whereas four different species were judged potential indicators of three urban sites. In order to explain species distribution, variation in species abundance was partitioned into spatial and environmental components. The latter was more important, explaining 25.4% of the variation. We concluded that the fish assemblage of the Guamium stream is undergoing the initial stages of disturbance, with pronounced effects at the urbanized area, but no detectable changes at the sugar cane sites. Therefore, fish assemblages might be used as ecological indicators to detect urban impacts in similar rivers. However, the potential use of fish to diagnose stressors in areas of sugar cane plantations should be complementary to more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the influence of this crop on freshwater resources.

AB  - While the impact of various anthropogenic alterations, e.g. nutrient enrichment, has been documented on leaf litter breakdown-a key process for stream ecosystems-, our objective was to assess the response of this process to pesticides in agricultural streams. We hypothesized the impairment to be correlated with the pesticides contamination gradient, and the invertebrate decomposers to be more affected than microbial ones. Alder total breakdown rate was found to strongly decrease along the pesticide concentration in 12 French streams, only due to invertebrate-driven breakdown (as determined in coarse-mesh bags) since microbial-driven breakdown (fine-mesh bags) remained unchanged. Coherently, litter-associated shredder taxa richness and abundance together with SPEAR(pesticide) (a specific indicator based on invertebrate traits) were greatly reduced, whereas pesticide toxicity did not affect litter-associated fungal biomass and taxa richness. Consequently, the presence of pesticides compromised leaf breakdown, as microbial decomposers did not compensate for the invertebrate decomposers decline. This occurred while pesticides concentrations even in the most contaminated stream were under the European Union's Uniform Principles thresholds for targeted species. Our study showed that litter breakdown, particularly the ratio of total to microbial-driven breakdown rate, is a pertinent proxy to assess the functional integrity of pesticide-contaminated streams.

AB  - A comparative study of macroinvertebrates and bird communities was undertaken to assess the ecological integrity and human impact in Cheffa Wetland, northeastern Ethiopia. The study was undertaken from February to May 2010. Physicochemical parameters of the water, birds, macroinvertebrates and human impact classes were assessed at 10 sites in the wetland exposed to different anthropogenic activities. We have compared Shannon index of diversity of macroinvertebrates and birds along with different habitat classes. Multivariate statistics were used to extract the main driving forces for changes in macroinvertebrate and bird community patterns out of a complex data set. Subsequently, we compared the diversity indices of the macroinvertebrate and bird communities for the detection of human impacts. A total of 2789 inacroinvertebrates belonging to 34 families in 10 orders were collected and 3128 birds belonging to 57 species recorded. Macroinvertebrates belonged to five different orders: Hemiptera (seven families), Coleoptera (five families), Odonata (five families), Gastropoda (seven families) and Diptera (five families), exceeding 77% of the overall sample. Abundance and diversity of the bird and macroinvertebrate communities were related mainly to concentrations of DO, nitrate and chloride, habitat conditions, and human disturbances. Of the 57 species of birds recorded, the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), white-faced whistling ducks (Dendrocygna viduata), Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) and spur-winged lapwing (Vanellus superciliosus) were the most abundant. The physicochemical variables showed great variation among sites. The results revealed that human interference in wetland may result in serious ecological imbalances in the natural life cycle and impact on human welfare. Long-term studies are required to predict changes in wetland ecology and population dynamics, with the objective of developing appropriate measures by federal, regional and local stakeholders to ensure wetland restoration and sustainability.

AB  - Variations in the flow regime lead to changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients entering the estuary area from the river, which causes corresponding changes in the trophic structure of the estuarine food web and ultimately affects the entire ecosystem. Therefore, studying the responses of estuarine food webs to changes in upstream water and sediment conditions is of great significance for protecting the biodiversity, stability, and functional integrity of estuarine ecosystems. This study focused on the world-famous sandy river, the Yellow River, and the south and north shores of the Yellow River estuary and selected sample areas with different environmental characteristics. Typical species were sampled and measured for carbon- and nitrogen-stable isotopes in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Based on community indicators of stable isotopes, the trophic structure patterns of the aquatic ecosystem in the Yellow River estuary at different times and spaces were described. The results showed that the north shore area had greater trophic diversity and lower trophic redundancy than the south shore area. This kind of gap was more obvious in the wet season when water was abundant than in the dry season. The south shore area with lower aquatic productivity had greater reliance to input from terrestrial organic matter than the north shore area. The increase in terrestrial material input during the wet season increased the carbon-stable isotope value of the south shore food web and changed the basic food sources. The north shore food web, which did not depend on a single food source, had more abundant organic matter sources. The trophic diversity increased in the wet season, but the trophic redundancy was reduced. Our research suggests that the trophic structure patterns of estuarine ecosystems vary with the hydrological regime and environmental conditions, especially turbidity, which greatly affect the stability of estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs), such as marine parks and reserves, contain natural resources of immense value to the environment and mankind. Since MPAs may be situated in close proximity to urbanized areas and influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g. continuous discharges of contaminated waters), the marine organisms contained in such waters are probably at risk. This study aimed at developing an integrated environmental risk assessment and management (IERAM) framework for enhancing the sustainability of such MPAs. The IERAM framework integrates conventional environmental risk assessment methods with a multi-layer-DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) conceptual approach, which can simplify the complex issues embraced by environmental management strategies and provide logical and concise management information. The IERAM process can generate a useful database, offer timely update on the status of MPAs, and assist in the prioritization of management options. We use the Cape d'Aguilar Marine Reserve in Hong Kong as an example to illustrate the IERAM framework. A comprehensive set of indicators were selected, aggregated and analyzed using this framework. Effects of management practices and programs were also assessed by comparing the temporal distributions of these indicators over a certain timeframe. Based on the obtained results, we have identified the most significant components for safeguarding the integrity of the marine reserve, and indicated the existing information gaps concerned with the management of the reserve. Apart from assessing the MPA's present condition, a successful implementation of the IERAM framework as evocated here would also facilitate better-informed decision-making and, hence, indirectly enhance the protection and conservation of the MPA's marine biodiversity.

AB  - Adjacent intensive agriculture disturbs the natural condition of wetlands. However, to assess the effect of this agriculture on wetlands, few studies have used indices based on aquatic invertebrates. Multi-metric indices (MMIs) have been successfully used to assess freshwater ecosystems worldwide and are an important management tool, but little is known about their applicability in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. In this study, we developed a MMIs for aquatic invertebrates to assess freshwater wetlands in this region. The aquatic invertebrate assemblages were sampled in 27 wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain that included those in natural reserves and those affected by adjacent, intensive agriculture. Twenty-four candidate metrics were initially reviewed and screened before four core metrics were selected: total number of taxa, number of Hemiptera taxa, proportion of Gastropoda, and proportion of predators. Mann-Whitney U tests, Box and Whisker plots, correlation analyses, and redundant metric tests were used to assess the ability of metrics to distinguish among reference and impaired wetlands. Four ordinal rating categories for wetland were defined: poor, fair, good, and excellent. Of the impaired freshwater wetlands, 76.2% were in poor or fair categories. The MMIs was robust in discriminating reference wetlands from impaired wetlands and therefore have potential as a biomonitoring tool to assess the condition and to guide the restoration efforts of freshwater wetlands in Northeast China.

AB  - Planktonic and periphytic diatom assemblages were investigated as potential biological indicators of ecological conditions in the Ohio, Missouri and Upper Mississippi rivers. Diatoms were analyzed to determine which of the two assemblage types was most appropriate for monitoring environmental conditions. The comparative effectiveness of diatom data format was similarly evaluated, testing relative and absolute abundance data. Stressor gradients for the rivers were created using principal components analysis for suites of water quality variables, landscape disturbance variables, and combined variables. Diatom-based weighted averaging transfer functions were developed for these integrated stressor gradients using each habitat and data format. Representing the diatoms as relative abundance data provided optimal tracking of environmental stress, and both periphyton and phytoplankton showed potential as indicators of disturbance. These results reinforce the use of relative abundance data, often used for diatom water quality monitoring, over more labor intensive data formats. Diatom-based models were also created to infer water quality measures and to compare measured and diatom-inferred water quality to landscape stressors. In most instances, diatom-inferred water quality data were more strongly related to watershed-based stressors. This investigation supports the value of diatoms in assessing landscape stressors in large rivers as well as the more traditionally applied water quality conditions. The findings further suggest both planktonic and periphytic diatom assemblages may be used as bioindicators of river condition and may provide unique stressor response information.

AB  - The coastal environment of the Yucatan Peninsula (SE, Mexico) includes a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from mangroves to coral reefs, resulting in a heterogeneous landscape. Specifically, the marine system is characterized by environmental differences which respond to regional and local forcing functions such as marine currents and groundwater discharges (GD). Such functional characteristics were used here to define four subregions across the Yucatan coast and diagnose the health status of this coastal marine ecosystem. To achieve this goal, we conducted an analysis and integration of water quality variables, an eutrophic assessment, evaluated changes in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and analyzed the community structure and distribution of harmful phytoplankton. The first step was to determine the reference values for each subregion based on data previously collected from 2002 to 2006 along the coast of Yucatan, 200 m offshore. The trophic index (TRIX) and Canadian index for aquatic life (CCMEWQI) were used to diagnose each subregion and then the ASSETS approach was conducted for Dzilam and Progreso, sampling localities on each end of the health status continuum (those with the best and worst conditions). Overall, results indicated that the marine coastal ecosystem of Yucatan is in good condition: however, differences were observed between subregions that can be attributed to local forcing functions and human impacts. Specifically, the central region (zone HZII, Progreso-Telchac) showed symptoms of initial eutrophication due to nutrient inputs from human activities. The eastern region (zone HZ 111, Dzilam-Las Bocas) showed a meso-eutrophic condition linked to natural groundwater discharges, while the other two subregions western (zone HZI Celestun-Palmar) and caribbean (zone HZ IV Ria Lagartos-El Cuyo) exhibited symptoms of oligo-mesotrophic condition. These findings may be considered baseline information for coastal ecosystem monitoring programs in Yucatan, and the approach used could be replicated for other coastal areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Characterizing compositional and structural aspects of vegetation is critical to effectively assessing land function. When priorities are placed on ecological integrity, remotely sensed estimates of fractional vegetation components (FVCs) are useful for measuring landscape-level habitat structure and function. In this study, we address whether FVC estimates, stratified by dominant vegetation type, vary with different classification approaches applied to very-high-resolution small unoccupied aerial system (UAS)-derived imagery. Using Parrot Sequoia imagery, flown on a DJI Mavic Pro micro-quadcopter, we compare pixel- and segment-based random forest classifiers alongside a vegetation height-threshold model for characterizing the FVC in a southern African dryland savanna. Results show differences in agreement between each classification method, with the most disagreement in shrub-dominated sites. When compared to vegetation classes chosen by visual identification, the pixel-based random forest classifier had the highest overall agreement and was the only classifier not to differ significantly from the hand-delineated FVC estimation. However, when separating out woody biomass components of tree and shrub, the vegetation height-threshold performed better than both random-forest approaches. These findings underscore the utility and challenges represented by very-high-resolution multispectral UAS-derived data (~10 cm ground resolution) and their uses to estimate FVC. Semi-automated approaches statistically differ from by-hand estimation in most cases; however, we present insights for approaches that are applicable across varying vegetation types and structural conditions. Importantly, characterization of savanna land function cannot rely only on a "greenness" measure but also requires a structural vegetation component. Underscoring these insights is that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure on the landscape broadly informs land management, from land allocation, wildlife habitat use, natural resource collection, and as an indicator of overall ecosystem function.

AB  - Land-use change is a principal factor affecting riparian vegetation and river biodiversity. In Chile, land-use change has drastically intensified over the last decade, with native forests converted to exotic forest plantations and agricultural land. However, the effects thereof on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Closing this knowledge gap first requires understanding how human perturbations affect riparian and stream biota. Identified biological indicators could then be applied to determine the health of fluvial ecosystems. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of land-use change on the health of riparian and aquatic ecosystems by assessing riparian vegetation, water quality, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, and functional feeding groups. Twenty-one sites in catchment areas with different land-uses (i.e. pristine forests, native forests, exotic forest plantations, and agricultural land) were selected and sampled during the 2010 to 2012 dry seasons. Riparian vegetation quality-was highest in pristine forests. Per the modified Macroinvertebrate Family Biotic Index for Chilean species, the best conditions existed in native forests and the worst in agricultural catchments. Water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly varied across land-use areas, with forest plantations and agricultural land having high nutrient concentrations, conductivity, suspended solids, and apparent color. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was lowest for agricultural and exotic forest plantation catchments, with notable non-insect representation. Collector-gatherers were the most abundant functional feeding group, suggesting importance independent of land-use. Land-use areas showed no significant differences in functional feeding groups. In conclusion, anthropogenic land-use changes were detectable through riparian quality, water quality, and macroinvertebrate assemblages, but not through functional feeding groups. These data, particularly the riparian vegetation and macroinvertebrate assemblage parameters, could be applied towards the conservation and management of riparian ecosystems through land-use change studies.

AB  - Natural hydrogeomorphic characteristics and hydrologic alterations are important ecological drivers, and hydrology is also a common ecological, flood control and navigation system indicator. Hydrologic characteristics change dramatically from one end of the Upper Mississippi River System to the other, and hydraulic characteristics also differ spatially across the river channels and floodplain in response to dams, levees and diversions. Low flow surface water spatial change in response to navigation and flood control has been well known for many years, but little information was available on the spatial distribution of frequent floods. The flow frequency data presented here were developed to better estimate contemporary floods after historic flooding in 1993. Flood stage estimates are enhanced in GIS to help quantify and map potential floodplain inundation for more than 1000 river miles on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Potential flood inundation is mapped for the 50% to 0.2% annual exceedance probability flood stage (i.e. 2- to 500-year expected recurrence interval flood) and also for alternative floodplain management scenarios within the existing flood protection infrastructure. Our analysis documents: (i) impoundment effects, (ii) a hydrologic gradient within the navigation pools that creates repeating patterns of riverine, backwater and impounded aquatic habitat conditions, (iii) potential floodplain inundation patterns for over 2 million acres and (iv) several integrated floodplain management scenarios. Extreme flood events are more common in recent decades, and they are expected to continue to occur at greater frequency in response to climate change. Floodplain managers can use the results presented here to help optimize land management and flood damage reduction on the Upper Mississippi River System. Published 2012.

AB  - Multiple indicators of sublethal stress (bioindicators) were used to assess the health and condition of two important estuarine fish species in the Pamlico Sound estuary following extensive flooding from three sequential hurricanes that occurred during early fall 1999. Bioindicators ranging from the biochemical to the reproductive and organism-level were used to assess the health of southern flounder and spot in Pamlico Sound compared to the health of these same species sampled from a relatively unaffected reference site in lower Core Sound. Many of the physiological, reproductive, immunological, histopathological, and general condition indices suggested that both species, and particularly spot, in Pamlico Sound were sublethally stressed and in poorer condition than fish sampled from Core Sound. The major environmental stressors causing these sublethal stress responses in Pamlico Sound fish appears to be those related to episodic hypoxic exposure or a combination of effects associated with hypoxic conditions such as alterations in preferred habitat and food availability. Although fish populations in Pamlico Sound do not appear to be severely damaged or impaired at this time, organisms that are sublethally stressed can incur increased vulnerability to additional or future stressors such as modified physicochemical regimes, changes in food and habitat availability, and increases in infectious pathogens. Because of the low flushing rate (similar to1 yr) of Pamlico Sound, recovery rate may be exceptionally slow, prolonging any adverse effects of altered nutrient regimes (such as hypoxia) on the health and fitness of resident fish populations. Flooding from the 1999 hurricanes may have contributed to the short-term health and condition of finfish species in Pamlico Sound and also influenced longer-term recovery and ecological status of this system. Longer-term manifestation of effects from flooding may be of particular concern as the frequency of hurricanes is expected to increase over the next few years and the accelerated uses of the coastal zone places further stress on estuarine resources.

AB  - The ecological quality of river habitats is increasingly assessed using multiple taxonomic groups. As widely recognised, assessments should be based on the reference condition approach where potentially impaired sites are compared to pristine or near pristine reference sites. To enable valid comparisons, natural variability of habitat characteristics and biotic assemblages should be controlled for, by using either an a priori river typology as suggested by the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) or by some other reference framework. We examined a simple WFD river typology, based on two broad-scale ecoregions, catchment area, and geology, as a basis for reference conditions of macroinvertebrates and diatoms in Finland. The ability of this a priori typology to account for natural variation in assemblage composition was evaluated by comparing it with null models (no typology) and with a posteriori clusters ('optimal' biological typology). The biological clusters were clearly more effective than the WFD typology in partitioning assemblage variation for diatoms, whereas differences among the groupings were less evident for macroinvertebrates. Similarly, the number of observed versus expected type-specific taxa (O/E-ratio) was more precise with the a posteriori clusters than with the WFD typology for diatoms, while there were no clear differences among the groupings for macroinvertebrates. For diatoms, the typology was virtually inefficient in improving the precision of O/E from that of the null model. Strong biogeographical patterns in assemblage composition of both biotic groups were evident between and within the two ecoregions. Variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was primarily related to geographical location and river size, whereas geographical location and water chemistry were the most important environmental factors for diatoms. Our results suggest that simple a priori typologies could be used as a framework for reference condition in freshwater bioassessment. However, when assessments are conducted using multiple taxonomic groups, typologies should be based on factors important for each individual group.

AB  - Non-perennial rivers and streams (NPRS) cover >50% of the global river network. They are particularly predominant in Mediterranean Europe as a result of dry climate conditions, climate change and land use development. Historically, both scientists and policy makers underestimated the importance of NRPS for nature and humans alike, mainly because they have been considered as systems of low ecological and economic value. During the past decades, diminishing water resources have increased the spatial and temporal extent of artificial NPRS as well as their exposure to multiple stressors, which threatening their ecological integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structural and functional characteristics of NPRS in the European Mediterranean, and discuss gaps and problems in their management, concerning their typology, ecological assessment, legislative and policy protection, and incorporation in River Basin Management Plans. Because NPRS comprise highly unstable ecosystems, with strong and often unpredictable temporal and spatial variability - at least as far as it is possible to assess - we outline the future research needs required to better understand, manage and conserve them as highly valuable and sensitive ecosystems. Efficient collaborative activities among multidisciplinary research groups aiming to create innovative knowledge, water managers and policy makers are urgently needed in order to establish an appropriate methodological and legislative background. The incorporation of NPRS in EU-Med River Basin Management Plans in combination with the application of ecological flows is a first step towards enhancing NPRS management and conservation in order to effectively safeguard these highly valuable albeit threatened ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Effective environmental management requires a sound understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship of species with their environment. Mechanistic explanations linking species and environment are ultimately based on species traits. Many tools for ecological assessment and biomonitoring lack such explanations. Elsewhere, we have defined life-history strategies, based on the interrelations between species traits and their functional implications.
   2. This study tests the hypothesis that life-history strategies represent different solutions to particular ecological problems, thus connecting species and their environment through species traits. Data on aquatic macroinvertebrates in a variety of waterbodies were analysed in terms of life-history strategies. These waterbodies differed in environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Solutions to the ecological problems present in each type of water body were expected to be reflected in the abundance of (species exhibiting) different life-history strategies.
   3. Results show clear differences in strategy composition between the different water types, which could be related to the prevailing environmental conditions through mechanistic explanations. For example, species with a long period of juvenile development and a synchronized emergence of short-lived adults were most dominant in large mesotrophic waterbodies with stable and predictable environmental conditions. In contrast, species that have a rapid development and spread successive reproduction attempts over a longer time period were most abundant in waterbodies with fluctuating and less predictable environmental conditions.
   4. Differences in strategy composition provide insight into the prevailing environmental conditions related to temporal predictability, and habitat favourability, from the perspective of the species themselves. By reducing diverse species assemblages to a small number of strategies, representing easily interpretable relationships, this approach may be useful in environmental quality assessment programmes, including those required by the European Water Framework Directive. Based on mechanistic explanations, life-history strategies may generate testable predictions and guide future research. Further research may focus on expanding life-history strategies to include other species groups and ecosystems.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot face immediate threats through habitat loss and species extinction. Systems to monitor ecological status and trends in biodiversity are therefore crucially needed. Myanmar is part of Indo-Burma but with no past experience of biomonitoring in freshwaters. In this study, we aimed to assess the ecological and biodiversity status of a lowland river network in south-central Myanmar by identifying and quantifying pressures using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Novel data on water quality (nutrients, sediments and metals), hydromorphology (Morphological Quality Index; MQI), habitat quality (Litter Siltation Index; LSI), land use, and macroinvertebrates were collected from 25 river sites. The dominant pressures on rivers were urban land use, inputs of untreated sewage, in-stream and riparian garbage littering, run-off from agricultural fields and plantations, as well as physical habitat degradation. Water chemistry data indicated inputs of sediments and nutrients to degraded streams, but no obvious metal pollution. The LSI and MQI indices indicated high perturbation in agricultural and urban areas, respectively. Ecological status was assessed using a first version of a modified Average Score per Taxon index (ASPT), while biodiversity was assessed by family richness within the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Odonata (EPTCO), which was tested against the pressure gradient by principal component regressions. ASPT had high diagnostic capabilities (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001) and showed that the index can be used to evaluate ecological water quality in this region. Biodiversity, expressed as family richness, also declined along the gradient (R-2 = 0.59, p = 0.041), giving support to the fact that current land-use practices in this area are unsustainable.

AB  - Eutrophication of rivers and streams in agricultural lands is one of the main threats for biodiversity and ecosystem functions. This study was focused on seven subtropical streams where agriculture is the predominant land use. We tested the hypothesis that (i) eutrophication causes a decrease in taxonomic and functional diversity of zooplankton, leading to potential consequences for the ecosystem integrity. Furthermore, given that the temporal variability in the environmental conditions of each stream may influence the species sorting mechanisms, we also hypothesized that (ii) streams with higher temporal environmental variability have greater taxonomic and functional alpha (alpha) and temporal beta (beta (t)) diversity measures regardless of the trophic state. Thus, we characterized the streams according to their trophic state and analyzed the zooplankton composition, alpha and beta (t) by using taxonomic and functional perspectives. We found differences in the zooplankton composition between mesotrophic and eutrophic streams. However, eutrophic streams supported similar taxonomic and functional alpha diversity and similar taxonomic beta (t) diversity to mesotrophic ones. These results were mainly explained by the occurrence of rare species occupying different temporal niches in eutrophic systems. On the contrary, functional beta (t) diversity was lower in the eutrophic streams, being nestedness the ecological mechanisms underlying the variability in the zooplankton functional groups. Streams with higher temporal environmental variability supported greater alpha taxonomic diversity. However, the beta (t) diversity metrics showed no correlation with the environmental variability, suggesting that the environmental filters of the studied systems were the overriding determinants of species turnover. Our study suggests that both taxonomic and functional perspectives should be considered to improve our knowledge on the biotic responses to environmental changes. Also, among all metrics analyzed on the zooplankton community, functional beta (t) diversity was the most sensitive indicator of the eutrophication impact.

AB  - Streams are influenced by watershed-scale factors, such as climate, geology, topography, hydrology, and soils, which mostly vary naturally among sites, as well as human factors, agriculture and urban development. Thus, natural factors could complicate assessment of human disturbance. In the present study, we use structural equation modeling and data from the 2008-2009 United States National Rivers and Streams Assessment to quantify the relative importance of watershed-scale natural and human factors for in-stream conditions. We hypothesized that biological condition, represented using a diatom multimetric index (MMI), is directly affected by in-stream physicochemical environment, which in turn is regulated by natural and human factors. We evaluated this hypothesis at both national and ecoregion scales to understand how influences vary among regions. We found that direct influences of in-stream environment on diatom MMIs were greater than natural and human factors at the national scale and in all but one ecoregion. Meanwhile, in-stream environments were jointly explained by natural variations in precipitation, base flow index, hydrological stability, % volcanic rock, soil water table depth, and soil depth and by human factors measured as % crops, % other agriculture, and % urban land use. The explained variance of in-stream environment by natural and human factors ranged from 0.30 to 0.75, for which natural factors independently accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance at the national scale and in seven ecoregions. Covariation between natural and human factors accounted for a higher proportion of explained variance of in-stream environment than unique effects of human factors in most ecoregions. Ecoregions with relatively weak effects by human factors had relatively high levels of covariance, high levels of human disturbance, or small ranges in human disturbance. We conclude that accounting for effects of natural factors and their covariation with human factors will be important for accurate ecological assessments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed a historical natural community map and a spatially explicit ecological condition model (ECM) to evaluate conditions of the Apalachicola National Forest's longleaf pine habitats. We identified and mapped historical vegetation patterns across the forest and then compared current vegetation structure derived from LiDAR and field surveys to desired conditions for the respective habitat types. In the first example of how these tools may be applied, we show how the natural communities map improved our understanding of wet savanna distribution and how the ECM then revealed opportunities and challenges for managing this unique habitat. In the second example, we show that the ECM scores were closely aligned with red-cockaded woodpecker habitat selection at three nested spatial scales relevant for that species' ecology. Both of these analyses demonstrate how historical data and ecological condition assessments improve our understanding of resource patterns and may inform possible management actions.

AB  - Many natural landscapes that lie in high mountain regions are highly susceptible to geological hazards, and their values and integrity are strongly threatened by the hazards. A preliminary framework was proposed to undertake a quantitative assessment of the impact of earthquake-induced geological hazards on the natural landscapes. Four factors reflecting the aesthetic value, ecological value, integrity of landscapes were selected to assess their vulnerability. The impact of earthquake-induced geological hazards on the landscapes is quantitatively expressed as the product of their vulnerability and resilience. The assessment framework was applied to Jiuzhaigou Valley which was severely struck by the M-s 7.0 earthquake on August 8, 2017. Field survey, satellite image interpretation, high-resolution DEM and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reconnaissance were used to retrieve the values of the assessment factors. Twenty seven World Heritage Sites in the valley strongly influenced by the earthquakeinduced geohazards were evaluated. The impact values of two sites of them (Sparking Lake and Nuorilang Waterfall) are up to 8.24 and 4.65, respectively, and their natural landscapes were greatly damaged. The assessment results show a good agreement with the actual damages of the heritage sites.

AB  - Brazil faces a challenge to develop biomonitoring tools to be used in water quality assessment programs, but few multimetric indices were developed so far. This study is part of an effort to test and implement programs using benthic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators in Rio de Janeiro State. Our aim was first to test the Multimetric Index for Serra dos Orgaos (SOMI) for a different area - Serra da Bocaina (SB) - in the same ecoregion. We sampled 27 streams of different sizes and altitudes in the SB region. Despite the environmental similarities, results indicated biological differences between reference sites of the two regions. Considering these differences, we decided to develop an index specific for the SB region, the Serra da Bocaina Multimetric Index (MISB). We tested twenty-two metrics for sensitivity to impairment and redundancy, and six metrics were considered valid to integrate the MISB: Family Richness, Trichoptera Richness, % Coleoptera, % Diptera, IBE-IOC index, EPT / Chironomidae ratio. A test of the MISB in eleven sites indicated it was more related to land-use and water physico-chemical parameters than with altitude or stream width, being a useful tool for the monitoring and assessment of streams in the bioregion.

AB  - Wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, from habitat provision to pollutant removal, floodwater storage, and microclimate regulation. Delivery of particular services relies on specific ecological functions, and thus to varying degree on wetland ecological condition, commonly quantified as departure from minimally impacted reference sites. Condition assessments are widely adopted as regulatory indicators of ecosystem function, and for some services (e.g., habitat) links between condition and function are often direct. For others, however, links are more tenuous, and using condition alone to enumerate ecosystem value (e.g., for compensatory mitigation) may underestimate important services. Hydrologic function affects many services cited in support of wetland protection both directly (floodwater retention, microclimate regulation) and indirectly (biogeochemical cycling, pollutant removal). We investigated links between condition and hydrologic function to test the hypothesis, embedded in regulatory assessment of wetland value, that condition predicts function. Condition was assessed using rapid and intensive approaches, including Florida's official wetland assessment tool, in 11 isolated forested wetlands in north Florida (USA) spanning a land use intensity gradient. Hydrologic function was assessed using hydrologic regime (mean, variance, and rates of change of water depth), and measurements of groundwater exchange and evapotranspiration (ET). Despite a wide range in condition, no systematic variation in hydrologic regime was observed; indeed reference sites spanned the full range of variation. In contrast, ET was affected by land use, with higher rates in intensive (agriculture and urban) landscapes in response to higher leaf area. ET determines latent heat exchange, which regulates microclimate, a valuable service in urban heat islands. Higher ET also indicates higher productivity and thus carbon cycling. Groundwater exchange regularly reversed flow direction at all sites in response to rainfall. This buffering effect on regional aquifer levels, an underappreciated service of isolated wetlands, was provided regardless of condition. Intensive landscapes may benefit most from the hydrologic services that wetlands provide because that is where certain services (floodwater storage, microclimate regulation) are realized. While the portfolio of wetland services clearly changes with disturbance, our results support a revised approach to wetland valuation that recognizes the services that accrue from sustained or enhanced functions in these working wetlands.

AB  - Ants are often used as ecological indicators in environmental monitoring programs, but rarely in Europe, probably because of a lack of baseline knowledge on the relationship between ant community structure and environmental variation. We present this baseline knowledge for Italian ecosystems that are typical of the Mediterranean climate, in order to assess the value of ants as ecological indicators in this biogeographic zone. Sampling areas were selected inside the Castelporziano Natural Reserve (Rome, Italy). The elevated variety of habitats and diverse ecological conditions, as well as the different levels of human impact in the Reserve, make this area a suitable location to develop and test biological indicators of environmental quality. The ant community structure was compared among several Mediterranean ecosystems using pitfall trapping, multidimensional scaling, the indicator species analysis and the Functional Groups Approach. Key factors for differences in ant community structure seem to be the presence/absence of water, the level of light and microhabitat diversity. Our results suggest that Castelporziano is an informative area in order to develop a study model for the Italian ant fauna and the Functional Group Approach is a promising procedure to associate differences in ant community structures with differences in habitat stress and disturbance.

AB  - Paleolimnological techniques permit the reconstruction of past environmental and biological conditions in aquatic ecosystems. However, more studies that include comparisons with historical and limnological records are needed, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, to validate the links between extant and subfossil indicator communities. We performed a paleolimnological study to reconstruct environmental changes over the last 11 years in Lake Rodo, a subtropical, hypereutrophic shallow lake located in Uruguay (34 degrees 54'4 '' S, 56 degrees 10'01 '' W), which was subjected to rehabilitation measures and from which limnological data were available. Analyses of the composition and abundance of fossil diatoms divided the record into three time periods that coincided with events during the history of Lake Roth!, and its rehabilitation. The most abundant species were Aulacoseira granulata, Synedra acus, Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Stephanodiscus hantzschii and Fragilaria crotonensis. Indices of planktonic/benthic subfossil diatoms and of diversity reflected changes in the transparency of lake water and in the diversity of habitats available for growth. Records of diatom abundances from phytoplankton and sediment samples were highly correlated; these results highlight the value of diatoms as bioindicators for reconstructing environmental conditions even on short time scales (sub-decadal). Our results also show important differences between temperate and subtropical systems and highlight the need for caution when attempting to apply ecological data determined in other regions.

AB  - Many natural phenomena and ecological processes take place extremely slowly, requiring both long-term observations and experiments to investigate them. An alternative is to investigate natural systems that have long-term and stable environmental conditions that are opposed to those of the surrounding ecosystem. Locally extreme environments provide an example of this, and are a powerful tool for the study of slower ecological and evolutionary processes, allowing the investigation of longer term mechanisms at logistically tractable spatial and temporal scales. These systems can be used to gain insight into adaptation of natural communities and their ecological networks. We present a case study and review the literature investigating biological communities at terrestrial mofettes-natural sites with constant geogenic CO2 exhalations and consequent soil hypoxia. Mofettes are often used as natural analogues to future conditions predicted by current climate change scenarios, as model ecosystems for environmental impact assessments of carbon capture and storage systems and for the investigation of physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies of a range of phylogenetically distinct organisms across spatial scales. The scientific power of locally extreme environments is just starting to be harnessed and these systems are bound to provide growing insight into long-term ecological processes, which will be essential for our capacity to adequately manage ecosystems and predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change.

AB  - Persistent stress from anthropogenic metal deposition in lotic ecosystems is a global concern. This long-term selective pressure shapes hyporheic microbial assemblages and influences ecosystem functional integrity. We hypothesized that, even after 100 years of adaptation opportunity, ecosystem function remains inhibited by sediment-associated metal stress and that the Resazurin Resorufin Smart Tracer can be used to quantify this impact. The Resazurin Resorufin Smart Tracer system is applied here in a novel capacity as an indicator of ecosystem function by quantifying ecosystem respiration of microbial communities. Hyporheic microbial communities exposed to differing magnitudes of chronic metal stress were compared to pristine reference sites in controlled column experiments. A Markov chain Monte Carlo technique was developed to solve the inverse smart tracer transport equation to derive community respiration data. Results suggest metals inhibit respiration by 13-30% relative to reference sites and this inhibition is directly related to the level of in situ metal stress. We demonstrate the first application of a hydrologic smart tracer as a functional indicator of ecological integrity within anthropogenically influenced flowing water systems and provide data suggesting resilience is limited in hyporheic ecosystems even after more than a century of microbial adaption to chronic pollutants.

AB  - Assessment of vegetation is an important part of evaluating wetland condition, but it is complicated by the variety of plant communities that are naturally present in freshwater wetlands. We present an approach to evaluate wetland condition consisting of: (1) a stratified random sample representing the entire range of anthropogenic stress, (2) field data representing a range of water depths within the wetlands sampled, (3) nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) to determine a biological condition gradient across the wetlands sampled, (4) hierarchical clustering to interpret the condition results relative to recognizable plant communities, (5) classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to relate biological condition to natural and anthropogenic environmental drivers, and (6) mapping the results to display their geographic distribution. We applied this approach to plant species data collected at 90 wetlands of the U. S. Great Lakes coast that support a variety of plant communities, reflecting the diverse physical environment and anthropogenic stressors present within the region. Hierarchical cluster analysis yielded eight plant communities at a minimum similarity of 25%. Wetlands that clustered botanically were often geographically clustered as well, even though location was not an input variable in the analysis. The eight vegetation clusters corresponded well with the MDS configuration of the data, in which the first axis was strongly related (R(2) = 0.787, P < 0.001) with floristic quality index (FQI) and the second axis was related to the Great Lake of occurrence. CART models using FQI and the first MDS axis as the response variables explained 75% and 82% of the variance in the data, resulting in 6-7 terminal groups spanning the condition gradient. Initial CART splits divided the region based on growing degree-days and cumulative anthropogenic stress; only after making these broad divisions were wetlands distinguished by more local characteristics. Agricultural and urban development variables were important correlates of wetland biological condition, generating optimal or surrogate splits at every split node of the MDS CART model. Our findings provide a means of using vegetation to evaluate a range of wetland condition across a broad and diverse geographic region.

AB  - A knowledge-based system (KBS) for assessing soil condition in agroecosystems is presented. The KBS Was built through expert opinion elicitation and available scientific data using fuzzy logic. The system is structured into three main elements: (1) input variables that represent the physical domain of soil condition assessment and are related to environmental and crop management conditions; (2) primary modules that describe the fuzzy nature of the soil indicators and; (3) secondary modules that represent the elicited knowledge on soil condition assessment from an expert panel. The application of the KBS on data on crop fields from Inland Pampa (Argentina) indicated that soil nitrogen depletion poses a hazard for soil health as no crop was able to accomplish more than 50% of the sustainability criteria elicited for soil nitrogen extraction from the system. Conversely, soil carbon and physical conditions exhibited values closer to the desirable scenarios elicited by the fuzzy if-then rules, with Values of 0.84, 0.71 and 0.74 for maize, soybean and wheat, respectively, where higher indicator values reflect better soil condition assessment. No significant differences were observed in the overall soil degradation module between crops, with values of 0.64 for maize and wheat and 0.67 for soybean. The KBS developed in this work provided an alternative modeling tool for assessing agroecosystem condition when knowledge regarding long-term assessment is imprecise and uncertain.

AB  - Retention forestry is replacing clear-cutting as the dominant silvicultural practice in many parts of the world. Higher retention levels are thought to promote faster, more complete ecological recovery after logging, but this hypothesis is insufficiently tested. We compared plant community dynamics in 0%, 40% and 70% retention stands to unharvested stands for 24 years after logging at the Date Creek Research Forest near Kispiox, BC, Canada. The study has a before-after control-impact experimental design with four replicates of each treatment. For terricolous understory plants, we used the similarity of cover, species richness and composition to pre-harvest and unharvested conditions as indicators of ecological integrity. Changes in cover, richness and composition were greatest at 0% retention. For nonvascular plants, changes were generally intermediate at 40% retention and smallest at 70% retention, and recovery increased with retention. The dominant moss Hylocomiurn splendens responded negatively to harvest in proportion to retention level, while most other species responded positively, shifting community composition. Most vascular plants responded positively to harvest, especially at 0% retention, with the exception of two late seral species, Platanthera orbicuinta and Oplopanax horridus. Generally, understory communities in these largely unfragmented northern cedar-hemlock forests displayed less sensitivity to low retention levels than studies conducted elsewhere. For some vascular plant indicators, changes at 70% retention were equal to or greater than those at 40%. Thus, most-but not all-vegetation responses supported the hypothesis that higher retention enhances ecological recovery after logging. The non-linear results were apparently driven by suppression of understory conifer growth in small gaps at 70% retention and illustrate that evaluating ecological integrity strictly in terms of departure from an un-impacted benchmark system risks oversimplifying complex forest dynamics.

AB  - The relation between environmental conditions and the species composition and individual abundance of crustaceans was investigated in a shallow alluvial aquifer, located in the Danube wetlands (Lobau, Austria). Samples, consisting of groundwater, sediment, and fauna, were taken from permanent installed wells by means of a piston pump five times in a year cycle.
   The results show that the spatial and temporal distribution, individual abundance, and species richness of crustacean fauna is related to hydrological conditions, oxygen concentrations, and geologic structures in the alluvial aquifer. Therefore, crustaceans, divided in stygoxene, stygrophile, and stygobite species, can be used as bioindicators of these environmental conditions in an aquifer. It is suggested that beside physicochemical analyses also the crustacean fauna should be considered to characterise a groundwater ecosystem.

AB  - The forest conditions in the Central Aimag of Mongolia, located in the southern part of the Baikal catchment area, near the southern border of the forest-steppe subzone, were examined within the framework of this study. The field materials collected in the summer 201-2018 at the Zuunmod Model polygon serve as the core of the study. An ecosystem map of the Model polygon with the scale 1:50 000 and the Key plot with the scale 1:5 000 was drawn up using World Vi.w-2 satellite imagery data (2016). The proven method of botanical indication of forest growth conditions is as follows: identification of the ecologic and coenotic groups of plant species, calculation of the moisture coefficient based on the ratio of the number of species included in the groups characterizing the extreme conditions of the moisture gradient and distribution of communities in accordance with the values of the gradient in the ecological series. Communities of stages of ecological series serve as indirect indicators of the forest conditions: Stage I: Ku <1, insufficient humifying for tree growth, Stage II: Ku 1-2, average humifying, Stage III: Ku >2, sufficient humifying for tree growth. The stages also correspond to the landscape conditions and the character of the vegetation cover.

AB  - The environmental conditions and the biotic crisis during the Permo-Triassic (Tr/P) transition received increasing attention in the past decades. Presented herein are the molecular fossil records of cyanobacteria and green sulfur bacteria, the base of the marine ecosystem, to highlight the episodic nature of both the environment and the biotic crisis during this critical period. At least two episodes of cyanobacterial expansion are documented by 2-methylhopanes ranging from C-28 to C-32 in carbon number, indicative of the instable marine ecosystem and the fluctuant aquatic nutrients. Meanwhile, the index of 2-alkyl-1,3,4-trimethylbenzenes (biomarkers of green sulfur bacteria) and the ratio of pristane to phytane (Pr/Ph) witness the fluctuation of sedimentary environmental redox conditions. The above molecular evidence suggests the occurrence of highly fluctuating environmental conditions during the Tr/P transition, which is consistent with, and probably the cause of, the multi-phased biotic crisis and the prolonged faunal recovery.

AB  - The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires ecological status quantification on the basis of biological and physico-chemical parameters, and an assessment of reference conditions and relevant environmental pressures for the construction of response curves. In this study the linking of water transparency, a proposed eutrophication indicator, to environmental pressure parameters was examined in the Polish sector of the Baltic Sea. Statistically significant linear correlations were detected between nutrient concentrations in sea water and Secchi depth, and between nutrient riverine loads and Secchi depth. The magnitude of acceptable deviation from reference conditions is also discussed.

AB  - The hydrolysis pretreatment of abattoir wastewaters (AW), rich in organic suspended solids (fats and protein) was studied in static and stirred batch reactors without aeration in the presence of natural microbial population acclimated in a storage tank of AW. Microbial analysis showed that the major populations which contribute to the pretreatment of AW belong to the genera Bacillus. Contrary to the static pretreatment, the stirred conditions favoured the hydrolysis and solubilization of 80% of suspended matter into soluble pollution. The pretreated AW, in continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days, was fed to an upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) at an HRT of 2 days. The performance of anaerobic digestion of biologically pretreated AW was examined under mesophilic (37 degrees C) and thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions. The shifting from a mesophilic to a thermophilic environment in the UAF was carried out with a short start-up of thermophilic condition. The UAF ran at organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 0.9 to 6g COD/Ld in mesophilic conditions and at OLRs from 0.9 to 9g COD/Ld in thermophilic conditions. COD removal efficiencies of 80-90% were achieved for OLRs up to 4.5 g COD/Ld in mesophilic conditions, while the highest OLRs i.e. 9g COD/Ld led to efficiencies of 70-72% in thermophilic conditions. The biogas yield in thermophilic conditions was about 0.32-0.45 L biogas/g of COD removed for OLRs up to 4.5g COD/Ld. For similar OLR, the UAF in mesophilic conditions showed lower percentage of methanization. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion has been shown to destroy pathogens partially, whereas the thermophilic process was more efficient in the removal of indicator microorganisms and pathogenic bacteria at different organic loading rates.

AB  - The long-term increases in average temperature and intensification of droughts which characterise the current state of the Earth's climate system have a negative impact on forest ecosystems and can lead to a decrease in their area and deterioration of the living conditions of their components. In the conditions of the Ukrainian Steppe an important environmental, antierosion, water-protective and soil-protective role belongs to the ravine forests. The most valuable component of the ravine forests is presented by natural populations of common oak (Quercus robur L.), which are able to tolerate the arid climate typical of the steppe region. But with global warming, the endurance of this species is changing. It is believed that a significant role in plant adaptation to drought and high temperatures may belong to non-structural carbohydrates. Therefore, it is important to study changes in the concentration of these substances in the leaves of this leading species under the action of adverse hydrothermal conditions. The article analyzes the content and dynamics of soluble sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and starch in the leaves of Quercus robur L. under different forest growth conditions of the ravine forest (hygromesophilic (CL2-3), mesoxerophilic (CL1) and xerophilic (CL0)). The research was conducted in the forest in the Viyskove area (steppe zone of Ukraine) in the thalweg and at different levels of slope of southern exposure. Content of glucose, fructose, sugar and starch in Quercus robur leaves was determined. It was found that when exposed to high temperatures and increasing water stress during the vegetation period in xerophilic (CL0-1) and mesoxerophilic (CL1) forest growth conditions, the concentration of both glucose and sucrose in the leaves of Q. robur increases and it becomes much higher than in conditions of more optimal water supply. At the same time, the disaccharide content increases more significantly than that of monosaccharide. The greatest amount of these sugars is observed in the driest months (July, August), when conditions for providing plants with water are the most stressful. When water stress grows the increase in concentration of glucose and sucrose is correlated with reduction of starch content. It has been found that the concentration of fructose in Q. robur leaves in droughty conditions of growing was comparable to more favourable conditions of moisture. In September, there is a decline in the content of all forms of non-structural carbohydrates in the leaves of plants of all variants compared to the previous month, especially in conditions of adverse water supply. Therefore, forest growth conditions do not affect the nature of the dynamics of soluble sugars and starch in the leaves of Q. robur, although they change their quantitative indicators. Based on the protective function of sugars under the action of stressors on plants, we can assume that in conditions of significant lack of moisture in the soil their accumulation in the leaves in areas with mesoxerophilic and xerophilic hygrotopes plays an important role in increasing Q. robur drought resistance.

AB  - In this paper, the warm pre-stress (WPS) effect on the cleavage fracture of an 18MND5 (A533B) RPV steel is investigated. This effect, which describes the effective enhancement of the cleavage fracture toughness at low temperature following a prior loading at high temperature, has received great interest in light of its significance in the integrity assessment of structures, such as nuclear pressure vessels, subjected to thermal transients. Several loading cycles between room temperature (RT) and -150 degrees C are considered: Load-Unload-Cool-Fracture (LUCF), Load-Cool-Fracture (LCF) and Load-Cool with Increasing K-Fracture (LCIKF). All experiments complied with the conservative principle, which states that no fracture will occur if the applied stress intensity factor (SIF) decreases (or is held constant) while the temperature at the crack-tip decreases, even if the fracture toughness of the virgin material is exceeded. The experimental results indicate that an effective WPS effect is present even at small pre-load (K-wps = 40 MPa root m), and that a minimum critical slope (-Delta K/Delta T) in the LCIKF cycle has to be exceeded to induce cleavage fracture between RT and -150 degrees C. Numerical modelling was performed using mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening laws identified on notched tensile (NT) specimens, tested in tension to large strains (up to 40%), followed by large compressive strains. Detailed microstructural investigations on compact tensile (CT) and NT fracture test specimens were performed so as to determine the nature of the cleavage initiation sites, as well as the local mechanical conditions at fracture. Based on this local information, a new cleavage model was calibrated and applied to predict the probability of cleavage fracture after WPS: it is shown that the predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB  - Populations of game are not confined to single ecosystems but function within higher-order units, e.g. ecological landscape. The basis for the establishment of the hunting complexes was the assumption that the existing game hunting grounds, i.e. the basic units implementing game management, are too small and do not cover the natural areas inhabited by game populations. Roe deer are flexible species and easily adapt to various site conditions, so they inhabit many different habitats, from large forest complexes, through small in-field tree stands and shrubs, to treeless grounds and field monocultures. The aim of the study was to determine a possible impact of environmental conditions prevailing in the hunting complexes of the Regional Directorate of State Forests (RDLP in Lublin) on the ontogenetic quality of roe deer. The study was conducted on 518 European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) aged from 4 to 7 years (379 bucks and 139 does) harvested within hunting seasons 2010/2011-2013/2014. The results have shown that animals originating from areas with greater forest cover and denser stands are characterised by lower values of the mean ontogenetic quality parameters (carcase weight, kidney fat index, chest girth, weight of antlers) in comparison with animals from typical agricultural areas with fragmented forest complexes. These results indicate that, even in the case of such a eurytopic species as the roe deer, the ontogenetic quality differs between individual hunting complexes. The study has proved that strategies for hunting management of the roe deer should take into account the impact of the landscape structure, which provides a rationale behind creation of hunting complexes.

AB  - Agriculture has been identified as one of the main drivers of environmental degradation in the European Union (EU). It can have negative impacts on air, water, soil and biodiversity. The condition of agroecosystems is affected by soil degradation, especially by soil erosion, which reduces agroecosystems' capacity to provide essential ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to explore synergies and trade-offs between pressures, ecosystem condition and services to create relevant information for policy and decision-makers to implement sustainable response actions. As part of the EU environmental policy, the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) Working Group developed appropriate concepts to assess and link ecosystem condition and services. This study aims to test the indicators proposed by MAES to assess ecosystem condition and link it with the ecosystem services provision. For this, we applied a suggested operational framework developed in the context of the Biodiversity Strategies 2020 and 2030 for the integrated assessment of agroecosystems and regulating ecosystem service control of erosion rates supply at European scale. We quantified and mapped indicators for ecosystem condition, environmental and anthropogenic pressures and soil erosion control. We explored the relationships between the respective indicators and the capacity of agroecosystems to control soil erosion across the different Environmental Zones (EZ). Our results indicate that, in general, European agroecosystems have a high capacity to control soil erosion with some variations within the EZ. Supply capacity is positively, negatively and not correlated with the various pressure and condition indicators. Management and climate indicators play a significant role in the assessment of this service. These results highlight that conservational management practices are fundamental to reduce soil loss and improve agroecosystem condition. However, the design and implementation of such management practices must consider regional and local landscape characteristics, agricultural practices and the needs and opportunities of stakeholders.

AB  - Estuaries are highly valuable ecosystems that provide various goods and services to society, such as food provision and supporting nursery habitats for various aquatic species. Estuarine habitat quality assessment is thus critical in managing both ecological and economic value. In this work, various biological and non-biological indicators of habitat quality in estuarine nursery areas were determined, encompassing local environmental conditions, chemical contamination, anthropogenic pressures, juvenile Solea senegalensis condition, biomarkers response to contamination and juvenile density. The various indicators provided an integrated view on habitat quality and their responses were broadly concordant. Nursery quality assessment based on anthropogenic pressure indicators and fish biomarker responses were very similar, signaling nursery areas with higher anthropogenic pressure in Tejo and Ria de Aveiro estuaries. Yet, favorable environmental conditions across all sites could have contributed to lessen the potential hazardous biological effects of exposure to anthropogenic stressors, resulting in soles' fairly good condition and generally high juvenile density. Nevertheless, a mismatch between high juvenile density and high estuarine contribution to adult coastal populations was observed in areas with higher anthropogenic pressures. Although a causal relationship cannot be established, the results emphasize the need to fully understand how the estuarine period spent in estuaries and local processes determine the quantity and quality of juveniles exported to marine adult populations, which is critical to achieve the full potential of the fish production service of estuaries and coastal stock replenishment.

AB  - By using the Life Watch database a European e-science infrastructure on native and alien plant occurrence collected from a wide set of Italian terrestrial sites we estimated the occurrence of alien species in a cross habitat framework in relation to propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A) and biotic (B) conditions. The research represents an example of macro-ecological assessment of invasion risk at national scale claimed by the recent European regulation (EU 1143/2014) on invasive alien species. Based on a large vegetation dataset, we estimated alien and native species richness across a set of 19 Italian terrestrial sites. By using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we investigated the relationship between the proportion of alien occurrence across sites and habitat types (EUNIS) at family level with PAB putative drivers derived from Life Watch and other open access geographic databases. Our results support the full model as the best-fitting option, highlighting that plant invasion in the Italian terrestrial ecosystems is a function of the combination of PAB conditions. In the first step of the invasion process, the accessibility time from towns plays a major role. By contrast, the abiotic filter imposed by environmental condition (high temperatures and low precipitations) as well the competition with the native community (high species richness) may pose a limit to the settlement and spread of alien species. Because of the high availability of similar data on PAB conditions worldwide, this study represents an effective and easy tool to design appropriate biodiversity conservation policies focused on the prevention of alien spread.

AB  - Intensive agriculture is the leading perturbation on freshwater ecosystems due to the agrochemical inputs that compromise biodiversity and ecosystem services. The importance of agriculture cannot be neglected nor the fact that freshwater biodiversity is being depleted worldwide owing to anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, a balance between economic and environmental values must be achieved. The present experiment explores the EEC legal limits on the concentration of agrochemicals (nitrate used as fertilizer) and investigates if even when assuming safe limits there are impacts in freshwater ecosystems. The objective is to assess direct and indirect effects of legal toxicant concentrations on the ecological integrity of plankton communities. This information seeks to assist policy makers with more ecological relevant results to establish legal thresholds that neither overestimates nor underestimates environmental risks. Microcosm experiments were set up outdoors with local assemblages of plankton for 8 weeks. Two nitrate treatments were established: (1) a low treatment (L) of 25 mg l(-1) of nitrate, and (2) a high treatment (H) of 50 mg l(-1) of nitrate. In conclusion, firstly, we detected that zooplankton taxa shifted from a cladocera-dominated to a copepod-dominated community as an indirect response to phytoplankton decrease. Secondly, both L and H treatments had a negative effect on the plankton community in spite of being within assumed safe legal limits.

AB  - Microfungi are one of the most neglected groups of organisms in biodiversity studies. Yet, they are overly important in representation and could be one of the best indicators of ecological integrity of old-growth forests. We made an inventory of the microfungi associated with woody aerial parts of Fagus grandifolia in the Boise-des-Muir, an old growth beech-maple forest of Southern Quebec, Canada. Our inventory revealed a remarkable diversity, with 60 genera and 76 species isolated (Ascomycota 31, Hyphomycetes 23, Coelomycetes 20 and Zygomycota 2), including many species never previously found on beech as well as two species never described before. Due to the high biological interest of old-growth forests and their potential for diverse niches for microfungi, we believe that this type of ecosystem should particularly be the focus of microfungi inventories efforts.

AB  - Rivers have been considered for a long time simply as vehicles transporting water and not as ecosystems.  In Italy there has been a massive transformation of the lotic habitats, particularly with regard to the riparian zones and to the quality of waters.  The structure and function of the populations and communities of organisms represent indicators of the changes which take place in the environment.  Numerous indices, based on the study of the macroinvertebrate communities, have been proposed for evaluating the quality of the river environments in Europe.  In Italy, a concrete result of the river monitoring programme, based on analysis of the macroinvertebrate communities, is the biological quality maps of hydrographic networks.  The macroinvertebrate communities play an important role in the process of transforming the organic material input and as indicators of the quality and structural and functional integrity of the lotic environment.

AB  - This study aims to assess the macroinvertebrate communities, diversity and ecological quality (expressed as BMWP-Viet) of rivers on a tropical island. Environmental factors associated with macroinvertebrate communities, diversity and ecological quality were identified to assist conservation planning and management. Biological (macroinvertebrates), chemical, physical and hydromorphological characteristics of 85 river reaches were assessed in Leyte island, Philippines. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and multivariable linear regression (LRM) were performed to relate environmental variables and macroinvertebrates. Several taxa of snails, shrimps, dragonflies, beetles, bugs and caddisflies were found on the island. Although many sites had good to very good ecological quality and high diversity, about 41% had moderate to very bad ecological quality and low diversity. Based on CCA, we can conclude that macroinvertebrate communities were associated with velocity, sediment, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. Particularly, sensitive and tolerant taxa were encountered at high and low flow velocities, respectively. LRM indicated that macroinvertebrate diversity and ecological quality were associated with physical (turbidity), chemical (chlorophyll), hydromorphological characteristics (bank slope & pool/riffle class), habitat degradation (gravel/sand quarrying, erosion) and the presence of logs and twigs. Consequently, this study gives support to the use of invertebrates as indicators of certain environmental conditions and the results of this investigation can serve as a basis to set up dedicated experiments to further prove the causality of these discovered relations. Strikingly, organic pollution, as reflected by biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand, was in general weakly related to invertebrate composition, diversity and ecological quality. This might be linked to the low input in most sites and the relatively short rivers which are closely connected to the marine system. Thus, typical midstream and downstream systems were not encountered and the accumulation of these pollutants along the river is less likely. Although the island is situated in the western Pacific Ocean and encounters intensive natural disturbances (severe typhoons), the taxa (families) are similar to other tropical systems and the effects of the environmental conditions are comparable. Findings of this study are valuable in understanding tropical island systems and provide insights into the effects of environmental conditions on stream invertebrates, which aids in protecting and conserving tropical insular systems.

AB  - This study was intended to estimate the changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) as well as other related data such as statistical data. New environmental protection law and construction strategy of ecological compensation system is studied. The results showed that among the ESVs, the values of climate regulation (CL), water regulation (WA) and waste treatment (WT) were the highest. In combination with the new environmental protection law, which encourages the development of environmental protection industry, emphasizes the government's supervision and management responsibility, guarantees environmental protection information disclosure and public participation, and establishes a sound environmental monitoring system, the scientific compensation scope and compensation standards need to protect ecological integrity. To eliminate the "one size fits all" approach, through the intersection of law, economics and environmental science, divide the types of ecological compensation, and clarify accounting methods and indicator systems.

AB  - Wetland indices of biological integrity (IBIs) are a common component in monitoring the wetland water resources as required by the United States' Clean Water Act (CWA). The effectiveness of an IBI to monitor disturbance is dependent on the metrics being consistently responsive to measures of human disturbance within a described classification category. We present IBIs designed for two types of commonly used wetland classification systems - the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). The metrics making up the IBIs were derived from anuran, avian, macroinvertebrate, and vegetation communities; each representing increasing levels of resources associated with gathering the necessary data. Knowing which communities' data best corresponds to impairment can maximize limited wetland monitoring resources, especially if the response differs based on the wetland vegetation type NWI or HGM position on the landscape. By combining these two classification schemes together, to better define a wetland's form and context on the landscape, more of the variability in community metrics are explained by human impairment. Moreover, when multiple taxa are used within a single wetland classification scheme, the response of the multi-taxa community IBI to the human disturbance gradient is often more sensitive than one-taxa group alone. This approach, a combination of taxa, in hybrid 2-system classification schemes, creates additional utility in measuring the effectiveness of wetland assessments and, or restoration success.

AB  - Ecological data are often collected at small geographic scales. However, analysing data collectively over wider scales can reveal results and patterns not shown in the smaller-scale data. We summarised data for intertidal benthic ecological (physico-chemical and biological) health indicators from New Zealand estuaries and compared the results against thresholds above which ecological impacts are expected to occur. Values for the sediment physico-chemical indicators mud and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus collectively) were above thresholds for at least 50% and at 31% of sites measured respectively. Sediment organic content and metal concentrations were generally low, with only maximum values exceeding the thresholds. Scores for biological indicators were within (or better than) the moderate health category for either at least 50%, or at least 75%, of sites. When compared across estuary types (based on a geomorphic classification system) we found statistically significant differences for thirteen of the sixteen indicators. Differences (among mean values) for highly significant results were relatively large compared to the range of values observed nationally for those indicators. However, the differences, except those for mud, were smaller than their respective ecological health threshold values. Our summary provides a reference for future comparisons of estuary indicators nationally and across estuary types.

KW  - NEW-ZEALAND SOILS
AB  - New Zealand is highly dependent on its soil resource for continued agricultural production. To avoid depleting this resource, there is a need to identify soils and associated land management practices where there is a risk of soil degradation. Environmental integrity and ecosystem services also need to be maintained. Accordingly, to ensure sustainable production, the on- and off site environmental impacts of land management need to be identified and managed. We developed a structural vulnerability index for New Zealand soils. This index ranks soils according to their inherent susceptibility to physical degradation when used for agricultural (pasture, forestry and cropping) purposes. We also developed a rule-based model to assess soil compaction vulnerability by characterising the combined effects of resistance and resilience. Other soil attributes have been appraised using seven chemical, physical and biological indicators of soil quality. These indicators have been applied in a nation-wide project involving data collection from over 500 sites for a range of land uses. These soil quality data can be interpreted via the World Wide Web - through the interactive decision-support tool SINDI. The land-use impact model is a framework to assess agricultural land management and environmental sustainability, and may be applied to land units at any scale. Using land resource data and information the model explicitly identifies hazards to land productivity and environmental integrity. It utilises qualitative expert and local knowledge and quantitative model-based evaluations to assess the potential environmental impacts of land-management practices. The model is linked to a geographic information system (GIS), allowing model outputs, such as the environmental impacts of site-specific best management practices, to be identified in a spatially explicit manner. The model has been tested in New Zealand in an area of pastoral land use. Advantages of this risk identification model include: utilising current knowledge of the causes and effects of land-management practices on soil degradation; linking land management practice to both on- and off-site environmental consequences; identifying important gaps in local knowledge; and providing spatially explicit information on the environmental impact of land-management practices.

AB  - Quantification of the water requirements of an aquatic ecosystem, expressed as design flow regimes, enables identification of potential conflicts between human and ecosystem needs. Design flow regimes provide end-points for predictive modelling and continuous refinement of land and water management strategies to resolve conflicts. To support ecological floe assessment in Canada, a framework is proposed that is integrated, holistic, hierarchical and adaptive. A context setting phase uses multi-disciplinary expert input to qualify cause-response linkages and identify the particular needs of habitat specialists. This focuses subsequent analyses on appropriate ecological processes and determines the hierarchical level of analysis needed. A design flow setting phase combines tools to develop the design regime from a reference regime and tools to quantify flows required to sustain particular ecological processes.

AB  - Rapid, repeatable assessment of ecological condition is critical for quantitative ecosystem monitoring. Soils provide a sensitive, integrative indicator for which sampling and analysis techniques are well defined. We evaluated soil properties as indicators of ecological condition (subjectively classified into minimally/moderately/severely degraded based on vegetative, hydrologic and edaphic cues) at 526 sites within Ft. Benning military installation (Georgia, USA). For each sample, we measured 17 biogeochemical parameters, and collected high-resolution diffuse reflectance spectra using visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS). VNIR spectra have been related to numerous soil attributes - we examine them here for diagnosing integrated response (i.e., ecological condition). We used ordinal logistic regression (OLR) and classification trees (CT) to discriminate between condition categories using both sets of predictors (biogeochemistry and spectra). Sixteen biogeochemical parameters were significantly different across condition categories; however, multivariate models greatly improved discrimination ([calibration, validation] accuracy of [69%, 66%] and [96%, 73%] for OLT and CT models, respectively). Important predictors included total C, total P, and Mehlich K/Ca/Mg. VNIR spectra further improved discrimination ([calibration, validation] accuracy of [74%, 70%] and [96%, 75%] for OLR and CT models, respectively). While spectra were comparably effective at discriminating minimally degraded sites, they were significantly more effective at discriminating severely degraded sites. Error rates across confounding factors suggest that watershed of origin and landscape position were the only important confounders, likely due to imbalanced sampling. We conclude that multivariate diagnosis improves accuracy, and that VNIR spectroscopy, which yields substantial cost and logistical improvements over conventional analyses, provides an effective tool for rapid condition diagnosis.

First, a reference ecological network of a plankton community was built from in situ flow cytometry data. Next, a set of fuzzy ecotoxicological rules to explain impacts from three pollutants were constructed from the scientific literature and expert knowledge. These rules were applied to the plankton network to simulate disturbance and produce an impacted network. Network indices were used to assess the consequences of this simulated disturbance, and a regime shift in the planktonic system was noted. Coastal zone ecosystem managers could use this type of model to anticipate early warnings in disturbance scenarios, allowing estimates of possible impacts to the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Biological diversity is our planet's inheritance from millions of years of evolution. It is nature's "insurance policy" against change, and a rich legacy which will help future generations of humans adjust to change. We squander this inheritance at our own risk, and to the detriment of future generations. Humans have been reducing the earth's biological inheritance for thousands of years, but we now have the knowledge, and hopefully the intelligence, to arrest this historical pattern. The idea has developed in western society that if something looks "nice," it must always be ecologically superior and better for biodiversity than something that is visually undesirable. There is also the idea, which appeals equally to our sensibilities, that there is a "balance of nature," that nature seeks and needs an equilibrium condition, and that change in this condition is bad. Ecosystem disturbance and change are seen as threats to both the survival of nature and to biodiversity. There is no evidence that such generalities are true, and lots of evidence that they are not. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What may be judged to be "beautiful," sustainable and good stewardship by an ecologist or biodiversity expert may be ugly, at least for a peri od of time, to the average citizen. What may be beautiful to a person in the street may nor be sustainable of the very ecological and social values that they desire for their children's children. On the other hand, there are many examples in which visual images do provide an accurate assessment of ecological condition and sustainability. The challenge is to identify when our "gut reaction" to visual images provides a reliable basis for making changes in our relationship to resources and the environment, and when it does not. The key message is that we should let knowledge of the ecological and biological diversity of forests, and the associated values we wish to sustain, play a major role in deciding how the many different kinds of forests in the world should be managed. We must not permit dogma, mythology and untested or disproven ideas to prevent us from attaining our biodiversity and sustainability goals. We must not apply any one single forestry policy or management method everywhere, and we must balance the important aesthetic considerations with the ecology of the values we wish to sustain.

AB  - Coralligenous reefs are typical underwater seascapes of the Mediterranean Sea and are ranked among the most relevant ecosystems of the basin and a pole of biodiversity. For their critical importance for ecosystems conservation, coralligenous reefs are included among the indicators that should be assessed under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). However, information regarding their spatial distribution and the influence of environmental factors on their structure and biological characteristics is still poor. As part of monitoring regional programs for the implementation of the MSFD in Italy, an extensive study was performed along the Latium continental shelf, aimed to define and map the distribution of coralligenous reefs and to assess their environmental status in three different study areas, characterized by different environmental conditions and subjected to different potential levels of human pressure. For each area, a large dataset was collected, including multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar records and ROV video transects. The integrated analysis of geophysical data and ROV videos allowed to identify the morpho-acoustic facies indicative of coralligenous outcrops and to map their distribution across the study areas. In parallel, a quantitative analysis of video transects was carried out, in order to characterize the megabenthic communities in terms of species composition, abundance, health status of structural species, and to evaluate the abundance of marine litter. The environmental status of the coralligenous communities was then assessed through the application of the Mesophotic Assemblages Conservation Status (MACS) index. The results obtained showed a large variability in the distribution and characteristics of coralligenous reefs and associated assemblages along the Latium continental shelf, likely reflecting the different environmental conditions and human pressure in the different areas. Coralligenous reefs were reported from all the investigated areas, hosting a rich and varied associated fauna with dense gorgonian forests, also featuring species of relevance for conservation such as Corallium rubrum. The application of MACS index allowed to distinguish among a wide range of ecological conditions of the coralligenous communities, spanning from high to poor environmental status across different sites. The assessment of the extent and diversity of coralligenous assemblages through the combination of geomorphological analysis, acoustic mapping and quantitative video analysis represents an efficient tool, which may help governments and stakeholders making informed management decisions for future coastal planning and conservation strategies.

AB  - Environmental pollution by organic compounds and metals became extensive as mining and industrial activities increased in the 19th century and have intensified since then. Environmental pollutants originating from diverse anthropogenic sources have been known to possess adverse values capable of degrading the ecological integrity of marine environment. The consequences of anthropogenic contamination of marine environments have been ignored or poorly characterized with the possible exception of coastal and estuarine waters close to sewage outlets. Monitoring the impact of pollutants on aquatic life forms is challenging due to the differential sensitivities of organisms to a given pollutant, and the inability to assess the long-term effects of persistent pollutants on the ecosystem as they are bio-accumulated at higher trophic levels. Marine microalgae are particularly promising indicator species for organic and inorganic pollutants since they are typically the most abundant life forms in aquatic environments and occupy the base of the food chain.
   We review the effects of pollutants on the cellular biochemistry of microalgae and the biochemical mechanisms that microalgae use to detoxify or modify pollutants. In addition, we evaluate the potential uses of microalgae as bioindicator species as an early sentinel in polluted sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of mass-length relationships of 10 populations of Mediterranean barbel from three basins with different environmental conditions showed that there were significant differences (ANCOVA, P <0.05) in relationships between sampling sites, which could imply differences in environmental conditions, Oxygen concentration and riparian cover were found to be the environmental variables that accounted for most variation (83%) in parameter a of the mass-length relationship between populations. Thus, mass-length relationships of barbels can be used to assess environmental conditions in southwestern European streams. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - Here we review the bioindicator potentials of several arthropod groups in forest management. First, we describe the indicator potentials of frequently used arthropod groups in general forest management, and then evaluate ecosystem function and plural taxonomic groups to infer forest biodiversity We then review indicator potentials of arthropod groups to explore the ecological consequences of forest management practices. Different arthropod groups respond differently to forest management. Ants, carabid beetles, and spiders often respond to local-scale, disturbance-induced vegetation development caused by thinning and can be used to infer the ecological suitability of forest management treatments. Dung beetles and moths respond to habitat alterations caused by forest fragmentation and can indicate the suitability of landscape-level forest management techniques. Butterflies and cerambycid beetles respond highly positively to the presence of herbaceous plants and understory trees and can be used to infer the integrity of thinning treatments in forest management. Syrphid flies, which are strong flyers associated with vegetation complexity, can be used as bioindicators of landscape-level forest management practices. Monitoring regulatory service providers may also help when designing forest management practices. We propose using arthropod bioindicator groups to effectively design and assess ecologically sustainable management plans for both natural and plantation forests.

AB  - Current national (e.g. UK Marine and Coastal Access Act) and international (e.g. Water Framework Directive, Habitats and Bird Directives, European Marine Strategy Framework Directive) legislation and the recent UK state of the seas report Charting Progress 2 have focused on the quality and status of the marine environment. To this end, the UK has continued to work on the need to develop indicators which can assist with this process. This work has helped to identify the natural processes and man-made activities that are affecting marine systems. One of the marine descriptors within the MSFD is 'seabed integrity'. This descriptor asks member states to ensure that the structure and function of ecosystems are safeguarded and benthic systems are not adversely affected.
   To date, we have furthered our understanding of the seabed by, for example, studying benthic systems. For this purpose indicator tools, such as a suite of benthic indices, have been employed as measures of the health of benthic systems'. In most cases this information mainly relates to the structure of benthic populations. However, there is a gap in terms of what we can measure with regards to the function of the ecosystem and how individual benthic animals perform their roles within specific ecosystems. There is also a lack of data to assess if the functions of the seafloor are safeguarded. This work has combined two metrics, bioturbation potential (Bpc) calculated from quantitative information and apparent redox discontinuity layer (aRPD) derived from SPI images. Results indicated that both metrics provide valuable complementary information. The aRPD informed on the status of the sedimentary environment and these values were easily related to Bpc values. The Bpc values were used to quantify bioturbation activity and species' identity at each site. The link between aRPD and Bpc can allow characterisation of 4 conceptual areas in relation to a key sediment function such as to carbon and nutrient cycling rates and control areas.

AB  - The demand for freshwater is projected to increase worldwide over the coming decades, resulting in severe water stress and threats to riverine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and services. A major societal challenge is to determine where environmental changes will have the greatest impacts on riverine ecosystem services and where resilience can be incorporated into adaptive resource planning. Both water managers and scientists need new integrative tools to guide them toward the best solutions that meet the demands of a growing human population but also ensure riverine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Resource planners and scientists could better address a growing set of riverine management and risk mitigation issues by (1) using a 'virtual watersheds' approach based on improved digital river networks and better connections to terrestrial systems, (2) integrating virtual watersheds with ecosystem services technology (ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services: ARIES), and (3) incorporating the role of riverine biotic interactions in shaping ecological responses. This integrative platform can support both interdisciplinary scientific analyses of pressing societal issues and effective dissemination of findings across river research and management communities. It should also provide new integrative tools to identify the best solutions and trade-offs to ensure the conservation of riverine biodiversity and ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - More research is needed to properly represent social-ecological system (SES) interactions that support the integrity of biological and cultural, i.e., biocultural, relationships in places experiencing environmental, economic, and social change. In this paper we offer a novel methodology to address this need through the development of place-based indicators and engagement of young people as coresearchers in two communities that rely on resource extraction industries (specifically, oil and gas) in Canada and South Africa. Young people's SES experiences were explored through a suite of participatory qualitative methods, including Q methodology, visioning exercises, ESRI Survey 123, participatory mapping and photography, and spatial image capture via unmanned aerial vehicles, i.e., drones. These methods support a biocultural approach to SES research that seeks to better understand the significant SES relationships at stake in changing environmental, economic, and social context. Here we present our research process and conclude that a focus on place supports the feedback loop between existing SES frameworks and local experiences. We suggest that this methodology can be amended for diverse localities and unique populations to support the development of efficacious policies, SES management, and community efforts toward building resilience, sustainability, and well-being of both humans and natural environments.

AB  - Ecosystem condition assessments were conducted for 12 mangrove sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Nine sites were selected randomly; three were selected a priori based on best professional judgment to represent a poor, intermediate and good environmental condition. During single visits a visual assessment generated numerical scores for each site relative to the reference condition range. Relationships were examined among variables to evaluate relevance of visual observations and empirical data of environmental condition. Sites in poorest visual condition possessed low concentrations of soil contaminants as hydrological attributes that restricted contaminant inflow lowered visual scores. Bacterial abundance related to the greatest number of variables, and was the only indicator that correlated with the visually derived score (0.60, p < 0.05). Soil enzymatic activity ratios within classes provided estimates of microbial nutrient status. Low peptidases/phosphatase and glycosidases/phosphatase ratios supported the conclusion reached from the molar ratios of nutrients, that mangrove soils were phosphorous limited. A positive correlation (0.71, p < 0.05) observed between C:N ratios in leaf tissue and soil from all mangrove sites indicated that relative molar ratios of major nutrients in leaf tissue were reflective of limitations in the soil. Principal components analysis guided a reduction in variables retained for analysis, and provided an ordination of the sites which grouped into three clusters and two outliers. Grouping was primarily influenced by soil C:N. In future studies measuring major nutrients in soil, C:N:P, could possibly function as a single, cost effective indicator to validate rapid visual condition assessments of mangroves.

AB  - Understanding how external pressures impact ecosystem structure and functioning is essential for ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management. We quantified the relative effects of fisheries exploitation and environmental conditions on ecological indicators derived from two different data sources, fisheries catch data (catch-based) and fisheries independent survey data (survey-based) for 12 marine ecosystems using a partial least squares path modeling approach (PLS-PM). We linked these ecological indicators to the total biomass of the ecosystem. Although the effects of exploitation and environmental conditions differed across the ecosystems, some general results can be drawn from the comparative approach. Interestingly, the PLS-PM analyses showed that survey-based indicators were less tightly associated with each other than the catch-based ones. The analyses also showed that the effects of environmental conditions on the ecological indicators were predominantly significant, and tended to be negative, suggesting that in the recent period, indicators accounted for changes in environmental conditions and the changes were more likely to be adverse. Total biomass was associated with fisheries exploitation and environmental conditions; however its association with the ecological indicators was weak across the ecosystems. Knowledge of the relative influence of exploitation and environmental pressures on the dynamics within exploited ecosystems will help us to move towards ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management. PLS-PM proved to be a useful approach to quantify the relative effects of fisheries exploitation and environmental conditions and suggest it could be used more widely in fisheries oceanography.

AB  - Natural capital is increasingly widely discussed and included in corporate and governmental accounts, using a variety of different approaches and metrics. Here I argue that natural capital is fundamentally an emergent feature of structures and functions of the natural environment. Therefore its valuation and metrics for reporting on its condition and the way that it is represented in accounts need to reflect these defining features and not rest solely on measurable flows of goods and services. Natural capital is an asset, and its many contributions to the economy and society, often called ecosystem services, are both malleable and adaptable. Their value changes with time and context as they become more or less important and relevant for particular purposes. Unlike most produced assets, natural assets are multifunctional, adaptable, and resilient, and within limits they have the capacity to regrow or reorganize themselves. Maintaining this capacity is therefore the key priority for a responsible owner or manager of natural assets. Currently most metrics for natural capital are based on the quality or quantity of flows of goods and services, on the geographical distribution of particular ecosystems or land/sea uses, and by reference to ecosystem services delivered by particular ecosystems. The advantages and disadvantages of these different approaches are discussed, but I propose instead using the quality of fundamental ecological processes and functions which properly represent the functioning and capabilities of the natural capital system upon which society and the economy depend.

AB  - Globally, river health is deteriorating due to increased anthropogenic pressures. Accurately assessing river health is crucial for the management of river resources with macroinvertebrates commonly used as biological indicators of ecological integrity. Complex biological data is made more straightforward using indices as they offer the ability to rapidly communicate complex science in a simple form. Management decisions are often based on the results of biological river health assessments, making the identification of the most appropriate, robust and sensitive macroinvertebrate-based index vital when undertaking catchment specific assessments. Selection of a macroinvertebrate-based index should rely on a scientific method rather than arbitrary selection criteria. This study aimed to compare the performance of several macroinvertebrate-based indices to identify the index or indices most appropriate to the Richmond River Catchment (RRC) in northern New South Wales, Australia. River health within the RRC is poor with a clear pollution gradient from upper to lower catchment sites. Six commonly used indices were calculated using family-level identification. The biological assessment supported the physicochemical results with a gradient in river health from upper to lower catchment. Family Richness and Family Richness Percent were assessed as the most usable indices. In studies that have restricted time, budget and expertise they will provide accurate but limited information on river health. SIGNAL2 was identified as the most valid index for assessing river health due to its overall sensitivity to changes in river health, and level of detail on anthropogenic impacts. The poor performance of the AUSRIVAS, EPT and BCI limits or precludes their use for river health assessment in the RRC. While this model for identification and selection of an appropriate macroinvertebrate-based index for catchment scale river health assessments was useful in this context, it needs to be improved with a larger dataset and a greater environmental gradient of river health to make a less subjective evaluation.

AB  - The characteristic high variability and low predictability of coastal lagoons, due to strong changes in marine and freshwater inputs, make these ecosystems an interesting case-study. The small Melides landlocked coastal lagoon in SW Portugal is a paradigmatic example, with a biological community highly stressed by these phenomena. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected in 1998/99 and 2009 and each year, in different seasons and addressing different environmental conditions influenced by the connection to the sea and rainfall regime. Major spatial and temporal patterns in benthic communities were investigated using some invertebrate attributes (e.g. community composition, density, species richness and diversity). A very low taxonomic species richness and diversity was found in the Melides lagoon and only a much reduced number of species occurred along all sampling periods and in both sampling campaigns. Although the colonization events play a crucial role, the persistence of the observed species was mainly associated to abiotic factors, such as salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen. Despite the potential reduction in anthropogenic pressure, by the construction of a sewage treatment plant and a reduction of urban occupation, the ecological status did not improve and the high level of natural environmental variably in the lagoon seems to be the dominant stressor influencing benthic invertebrate communities.

AB  - Biological modeling in system ecology is an effective technology for assessing the biological effects of environmental factors. We provided the conceptual justification for the development of prokaryotic laboratory-analytical models, assessed the advantages and limitations of their experimental use. The classification of prokaryotic test models according to the level of the structural and ecological organization, the properties of the test object (cells, communities, populations, microbiocenosis) and a set of test reactions (bioindicators and biomarkers) is proposed. The definitions of the test model as a unified system including a test organism, a biomarker / bioindicator system, a test procedure in accordance with guidelines of good laboratory practice, a criteria apparatus for qualitative / quantitative assessment of environmental factors are given. The concepts of subpopulation and suprapopulation test models based on the properties of microbial communities as integral biological units regulating vital activity parameters depending on external factors are substantiated. It has been shown that microorganisms are relevant test objects for the development of innovative methods for assessing the impact of the physical, chemical and biological environmental factors on organism, which is based on the structural and ecological organization and the variety of metabolic, dynamic, morphological, molecular-genetic and other properties of microorganisms, integrity microbial culture as a system, cyclical development of populations of microorganisms in environment as well as their complex interaction with environmental factors.

AB  - Forest condition is the baseline information for ecological evaluation and management. The National Forest Inventory of China contains structural parameters, such as canopy closure, stand density and forest age, and functional parameters, such as stand volume and soil fertility. Conventionally forest conditions are assessed through parameters collected from field observations, which could be costly and spatially limited. It is crucial to develop modeling approaches in mapping forest assessment parameters from satellite remote sensing. This study mapped structure and function parameters for forest condition assessment in the Changbai Mountain National Nature Reserve (CMNNR). The mapping algorithms, including statistical regression, random forests, and random forest kriging, were employed with predictors from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 satellite sensors, digital surface model of ALOS, and 1803 field sampled forest plots. Combined predicted parameters and weights from principal component analysis, forest conditions were assessed. The models explained spatial dynamics and characteristics of forest parameters based on an independent validation with all r values above 0.75. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of canopy closure, stand density, stand volume, forest age and soil fertility were 4.6%, 33.8%, 29.4%, 20.5%, and 14.3%, respectively. The mean assessment score suggested that forest conditions in the CMNNR are mainly resulted from spatial variations of function parameters such as stand volume and soil fertility. This study provides a methodology on forest condition assessment at regional scales, as well as the up-to-date information for the forest ecosystem in the CMNNR.

AB  - The backbone of benthic marine monitoring programs is the biological component, traditionally the macrofauna inventory. Such macrofauna-based environmental impact assessments (EIA), however, are very time consuming and expensive. To overcome these shortcomings, we used environmental metabarcoding to test the potential of protists as bioindicators in EIAs. Therefore, we analyzed taxonomic metabarcodes (V9 region of the SSU rRNA), obtained from sediment samples collected along a 400-m transect extending from below salmon cages towards the open sea along the predominant current flow. The obtained genetic data of protistan communities were compared to benchmark data obtained from traditional macrofauna surveys of the same samples. Ciliates emerged as the most powerful indicators mirroring the macrofauna benchmark patterns with statistical significance. Ordination analyses showed that ciliate communities resolved impacted sampling sites below and in immediate vicinity of the salmon cages even better than macrofauna communities. It can be concluded that ciliates allow for a better fine-scale resolution of impact conditions than traditional monitoring methods. Other protistan taxon groups such as diatoms and chrysophytes were not as successful as marine benthic indicators compared to ciliates. We conclude that the implementation of ciliate metabarcoding can substantially improve EIAs. We discuss further mandatory research needs to make ciliate metabarcoding a routine tool in official regulations for EIAs in salmon farming.

AB  - A spatially based, river type-specific approach was used to develop an ecological assessment method for European rivers based on existing sampling data. The methodology comprised two main steps: (1) description of a river and fish assemblage typology based on minimally or slightly impacted sites and (2) analyses of impacted conditions for each type. Hierarchical cluster analysis of fish species assemblages identified 15 homogeneous groups in 11 European ecoregions. Discriminant analyses, based on abiotic characteristics, were used to predict fish types at impacted sites. The latter encompassed both regional (geographic position in Europe) and local factors (longitudinal zonation) influencing the distribution of riverine fishes. To assess ecological status, the responses of more than 400 metrics (species composition, abundance and age-length structure) to human pressures were tested for each river type separately. A maximum of 10 metrics per river type was selected using discriminant analysis. The density of intolerant species and feeding guilds had the highest capacity to predict the intensity of perturbation.

AB  - As a developing country, Thailand has a significant issue with diffuse pollution of the soil ecosystem due to an indiscriminate use of agrichemicals and poorly regulated disposal of a wide variety of hazardous wastes. Practical risk assessment tools based on locally-occurring species are needed to assess the effects of diffuse pollutants on the soil ecosystem in Thailand because reliance on soil criteria developed for overseas conditions may provide inadequate protection. Native soil organisms in Thailand may be more or less sensitive to contaminants compared to overseas test species. This article described a biological indicator approach for ecological risk assessment of diffuse pollution in the soil ecosystem of Thailand from pesticide application with the aim of developing standardized protocols using native species and locally generated data to better evaluate the ecological risks of non-point source soil pollution. It was found that ecotoxicological assessment provided a better understanding of the ecological impacts that diffuse pollution induced on Thai environmental conditions. Thai soil biota species were more sensitive to soil contaminants than similar species overseas. Soil series also had an influence on the ecotoxicology of contaminants to soil biota. Collembolan, Cyphoderus sp., was demonstrated as a useful alternative test species to Folsomia candida (international test species) for terrestrial ecotoxicological testing of Thai soils. In addition, the soil biota activities such as soil respiration and earthworm avoidance including soil biodiversity and the litter bag decomposition technique are also good tools to assess the effects of diffuse pollution by pesticides on the soil ecosystem of Thailand.

AB  - Ecosystem service refers to a wide range of conditions and processes provided by natural ecosystems to help sustain and enhance human life. However, not all ecological conditions or processes are beneficial; some are restrictive or even detrimental under certain circumstances. The nature of the effects depends on time, space and specific target groups. Some locally detrimental phenomena might be beneficial at larger scales, and vice versa. Nature frequently causes detrimental impacts on human beings through disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, ice, sandstorms, flooding, drought, soil erosion, fire, disease and biological intrusion, even though these events might be beneficial to natural evolution. And such natural disasters can in turn be caused by human overuse of natural resources and destruction of the environment. On the other hand, human beings do not always destroy nature, but in fact can play a beneficial role through ecological design, engineering and management - activities which could be considered as the human eco-service contribution to nature. To avoid the misleading point of view that nature is always a servant of mankind, the mono-directional ecosystem service concept should be expanded to one of mutual services. Measurement methods of ecological services were put forward, including space, time, equivalent, pattern and order measuring methods. Case studies of urban land evaluation, ecological space accounting, water and energy equivalents assessment were performed in Changzhou city, Taihu basin and Yangzhou city of PR China applying spatial, pattern and equivalent measurement methods.

AB  - A variety of indices targeting a number of different biological assemblages have been developed to assess aquatic ecosystem condition, identify the drivers of alteration and provide information on possible restoration measures. Fish-based indices, commonly focused on adult assemblages, are capable of indicating declines in condition, but often provide limited information on the ultimate causes for the observed changes. Using young-of-the-year (YOY) fish assemblages has been suggested as a means of improving the sensitivity of fish-based indicators. To verify this assumption, we first model, using boosted regression trees, the occurrence of 16 YOY fish species as a function of twenty two environmental factors in 227 reference (i.e., least disturbed) habitats located in the river Seine (France) and its two main tributaries (i.e., Oise and Marne rivers). We then validate the species models using an independent dataset of 74 reference habitats. Finally, using three independent data sets reflecting different categories of disturbances (i.e., physico-chemical disturbances, physical disturbances induced by navigation and a mix of both disturbances), we measure the deviation between expected and observed species occurrences to evaluate our species models ability in detecting these disturbances. The models are ecologically meaningful and overall perform well in discriminating between reference and disturbed habitats, showing a stable response for all unimpaired habitats and highlighting the main habitat disturbances tested.

AB  - The Salt Lake Specially Protected Area is a unique ecosystem for both agricultural activities and natural life in Turkey. In the present study, an attempt was made to develop a conceptual land use strategy and methodology, taking into account ecological factors for regional development in the Salt Lake Specially Protected Area. A detailed Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis was done to create a comprehensive database including land use, land suitability, and environmental factors (soil, climate, water quality, fertilizing status, and heavy metal and pesticide pollution). The results of the land suitability survey for agricultural use showed that, while 62.6% of the study area soils were classified as best and relatively good, about 15% were classified as problematic and restricted lands, only 22.2% of the study area soils were not suitable for agricultural uses. However, this is not enough to derive maximum benefit with minimum degradation. Therefore, environmental factors and ecological conditions were combined to support this aim and to protect the ecosystem. Excessive irrigation practices, fertilizer and pesticide application, and incorrect management practices all accelerate salinization and degradation. In addition to this, it was found that a multi-layer GIS analysis made it easy to develop a framework for optimum land use and could increase the production yield preserving the environmental conditions. Finally, alternative management and crop patterns were undertaken to sustain this unique ecosystem, considering water, soil, climate, land use characteristics, and to provide guidance for planners or decision makers.

AB  - Postmortem human brain tissue is used for the study of many different brain diseases. A key factor in conducting postmortem research is the quality of the tissue. Unlike animal tissue, whose condition at death can be controlled and influenced, human tissue can only be collected naturalistically. This introduces potential confounds, based both on pre- and postmortem conditions, that may influence the quality of tissue and its ability to yield accurate results. The traditionally recognized confounds that reduce tissue quality are agonal factors (e.g., coma, hypoxia, hyperpyrexia at the time of death), and long postmortem interval (PMI). We measured tissue quality parameters in over 100 postmortem cases collected from different sources and correlated them with RNA quality (as indicated by the RNA Integrity Number (RIN)) and with protein quality (as measured by the level of representative proteins). Our results show that the most sensible indicator of tissue quality is RIN and that there is a good correlation between RIN and the pH. No correlation developed between protein levels and the aforementioned factors. Moreover, even when RNA was degraded, the protein levels remained stable. However, these correlations did not prove true under all circumstances (e.g., thawed tissue, surgical tissue), that yielded unexpected quality indicators. These data also suggest that cases whose source was a Medical Examiner's office represent high tissue quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In most fish exhibiting external fertilization, spermatozoa become motile after release into water, triggered by differences between intracellular and extracellular conditions such as osmotic pressure, ion composition, and pH. The rapid change in osmolarity initiating spermatozoon motility induces osmotic pressure, resulting in active water movement across the cell membrane. Mechanisms of ion and water transport across the plasma membrane and cell volume regulation are important in maintaining structure and functional integrity of the cell. The capacity of the fish spermatozoon plasma membrane to adapt to dramatic environmental changes is an essential prerequisite for motility and successful fertilization. Adaptation to change in external osmolality may be the basis of spermatozoon function and an indicator of sperm quality. The involvement of specific water channels (aquaporins) in cell volume regulation and motility is highly likely. The goal of this review is to describe basic mechanisms of water transport and their role in fish spermatozoon physiology, focusing on osmoresistance, cell volume regulation, motility, and survival.

AB  - The probability that protected areas will deliver their potential for maintaining or enhancing biodiversity is likely to be maximised if they are appropriately and effectively managed. As a result, governments and conservation agencies are devoting much attention to the management of protected areas. In the U.K., the demand for performance accountability has resulted in Public Service Agreements (PSA) that set out targets for government departments to deliver results in return for investments being made. One such target for England is to ensure that all nationally important wildlife sites are in favourable condition by 2010. Here, we tested the hypothesis, of potential strategic importance, that the ecological condition of these sites is predictable from relationships with a range of physical, environmental and demographic variables. We used binary logistic regression to investigate these relationships, using the results of English Nature's 1997-2003 condition assessment exercise. Generally, sites in unfavourable condition tend to be larger in area, located at higher elevations, but with higher human population density and are more spatially isolated from units of the same habitat. However, despite the range of different parameters included in our models, the extent to which the condition of any given site could be predicted was low. Our results have implications for the delivery of PSA targets, funding allocation, and the location of new protected areas.

AB  - Pipe-in-pipes (PIPs) are generally applied to the extreme environments such as deep-sea and next-generation reactors due to their functionality and robustness. Thus, it is important to estimate the fracture behaviors of PIPs for integrity assessment of this unique piping system. In this work, the plastic collapse behaviors of PIPs with circumferential through-wall cracks (TWCs) are investigated based on three-dimensional finite element (FE) limit analysis, where the crack is assumed to be located at the inner pipe of PIPs. As for loading conditions, internal pressure, axial tension, and global bending moment are considered. In particular, the bending restraint effect induced by interconnection between the inner and outer pipes of PIPs is quantified through the FE analyses considering a practical range of geometries of PIPs. Based on the FE analysis results, the tabular and closed-form solutions of the plastic limit loads of the circumferential through-wall cracked PIPs are proposed, and then, validated against numerical simulations.

AB  - Increasing water abstraction is severely degrading the world's wetlands, which is frequently reflected in the condition of flood dependent organisms. Understanding minimum requirements under which thresholds are crossed from desired to undesired states can improve managing for resilience and avoid catastrophic ecological consequences. The Macquarie Marshes, a Ramsar-listed wetland in eastern Australia is located in a catchment with a long history of water resource development. It is also a catchment in Which there has been a strong focus on wetland recovery using environmental flows. We investigated changes in the condition of 212 river red gum trees (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), a long-lived flood dependent species, at 17 sites, over 18 years (1993-2011). Four variables were measured for each tree: crown density, crown size, dead branches and epicormic growth. More than half (56.13%, 119) of the healthy trees first measured in 1993, showed no signs of life by 2011. Using historic inundation mapping, we identified that condition declined with reduced flooding. The probability of inundation in the previous five years had the strongest explanatory power, with strong increasing threshold responses of persistence and recovery associated with probabilities of flooding exceeding 5 years in the previous 10 years. We extended our modelling to the river red gum forests of the Macquarie Marshes floodplain, showing that 37% of the area had a predicted survival probability lower than P = 0.6 while similar probabilities were present in only 12% of the area within the Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve. The condition of river red gum forests, using the relationships identified, provide a useful measure of ecosystem health, particularly if extended to understanding of reproduction, germination and recruitment in relation to different scenarios for environmental flows. Embedding such a monitoring strategy in an adaptive management framework provides considerable promise for ongoing learning and improvement of management, not just for river red gums but also other indicators. There is a possibility that the current poor ecological condition of the Macquarie Marshes can be redressed with increased environmental flows restoring some of the river red gum forests that are a key characteristic of the wetland.

AB  - A limitation of most artificial sweat formulations used for in vitro assessment of chemical release from materials in contact with skin have little biological relevance to human sweat. The purposes of this paper are to provide guidance for preparation of a novel artificial sweat with chemical constituents at concentrations that match human sweat and to characterize chemical stability. The artificial sweat was characterized under conditions of use (with and without sebum at 36 degrees C) and storage (without sebum at -4, 4, and 23 degrees C) over 28 days by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, enzymatic assay kits, and ion-selective electrodes. Seven indicator constituents were tracked: sodium, chloride, glucose, lactic acid, urea, pantothenic acid, and alanine. With or without sebum at 36 degrees C, the sweat solvent was chemically stable for 14 days. Storage by refrigeration at 4 degrees C retained the chemical integrity of the solvent longest. Based on these results, the solvent should be used within 14 days of preparation. The artificial sweat model presented herein is most similar to human sweat and has applications as a dissolution solvent, donor solution in diffusion cells, or vehicle for patch testing. This sweat model may aid researchers in understanding potential release and percutaneous absorption of chemicals in contact with human skin surface liquids. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for leaching of the metribuzin herbicide under natural rain in two soils with contrasting textures, clay and medium sandy soil under field conditions using bioindicator plant. PVC columns were introduced in both soils maintaining the original integrity of the soil during the sampling that occurred after accumulation of precipitation stipulated in the interval in ambient, between 30-40, 60-80 and 100-120 mm of rain. The columns were separated by longitudinal section for the sowing of bioindicator plant (25 plants). After sowing, phytotoxicity evaluations of bioindicator plant were conducted at 5, 7, 10 and 12 days after sowing through a scale from 0 to 100%. The leaching of the herbicide metribuzin was dependent on the precipitation received in the two studied soil types. The effectiveness of the bioindicator plant depends on the type of soil and amount of precipitation. The method using bioindicator plant proved to be efficient for the evaluation of the mobility of herbicide in the soil profile.

AB  - Fires can pose a threat to forest ecosystems when those ecosystems are not fire-adapted or when forest community conditions make them vulnerable to wildfires. Thus, investigating fire-prone environmental conditions is urgently needed to create action plans that preserve these ecosystems. In this sense, climate variables can determine the environmental conditions favorable for forest fires. Our study confirms that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is an essential climate indicator for forest fires, as it is related to maximum temperatures and low humidity, representing the stress conditions for vegetation prone to fires. This study explores the extent to which ENSO phases can modulate climatic conditions that lead to high VPD over Guanajuato, a semi-arid region in central Mexico, during the dry season (March-April-May). Using fire occurrence data from MODIS (2000-2019) and Landsat 5 (1998-1999), we developed a climatic probability model for the occurrence of forest fires using VPD estimated from ERA5 reanalysis for each ENSO phase. We found that VPD and the occurrence of forest fires were higher during El Nino than under Neutral and La Nina years, with a higher risk of forest fire occurrence in Guanajuato's southern region. This study concludes that it is necessary to implement regional and local fire management plans, especially where the largest number of natural protected areas is located.

AB  - The article presents the theoretical prerequisites and their experimental confirmation regarding the search for an environmental complex for the effective evaluation of the pre-breeding and breeding potato material for late blight resistance, as well as the ecological testing of varieties and hybrids. The complicated interspecies potato hybrids, their backcrosses and standard varieties were used as the starting material in the study. Late blight resistance was evaluated in the conditions of natural and artificial backgrounds, including those created in the mountain areas different in vertical zonality. The ecological testinghas been carried out in different ecological zones: southern Polissia, north-eastern Forest-Steppe, southern central Forest-Steppe, Ukrainian Carpathians for three years. Taking into account the opinion of potato scientists and on the basis of our study, the following types of ecological potato testing were identified: zonal ecological testing, specialized ecological testing, and testing in different areas by vertical zonality. It has been experimentally proved that inepiphytotic years with respect to late blight, the evaluation of the manifestation of the sign under the conditions of not only the infectious but natural backgroundis possible. However, the optimal conditions for conducting such study, conditioned by a specific environmental complex, have been created by nature in the Ukrainian Carpathians, especially at an altitude of 1330 m above sea level. While conducting the ecological testing of interspecies hybrids and their backcrosses in the three ecological zones during three years, we managed to determine the potential of the material under study with respect to productivity. The optimal conditions for the maximum productivity of hybrids were determinedin various environmental complexes: zonal, meteorological and their interrelations. The favorable conditions for 55% of hybridsturned to bethe conditions of Sumy NAU, and for ten hybrids in 2017 and one hybrid-in 2015. For nine hybrids, such conditions were found in the Institute of Potato Growing only in 2016. The environmental complex on the territory of UstymivskaExperimental Station has had a negative impact on the manifestation of the indicator. The influenceof both the specificity of the environmental complex and meteorological conditions of potato growing seasonson the hybrid productivityhas been revealed. It has been proved that by the difference in the productivity expression depending on the test area and meteorological conditions of the potato vegetation periods, 65% of the samples was more influenced by the latter set of factors.

AB  - Improvements in remote sensing technologies and the use of geographic information system (GIS), are increasingly allowing us to develop indicators that can be used to monitor and assess ecosystem condition and change at multiple scales. This paper presents global- and regional-level indicators developed by the World Resources Institute and collaborating partners using remote sensing and GIS. Presented as regional and global maps, these spatial indicators are ideal communication tools to raise awareness of the condition of the Earth's ecosystems among different audiences. Global and regional spatial indicators not only inform us about the current condition of, and pressures on, ecosystems, but also about the likely capacity of the ecosystem to continue to provide goods and services to future generations. The increasing focus on integrating socio-economic and biological information with remote sensing and GIS technology can only help to further our understanding and capacity to manage ecosystems in a more sustainable manner.

AB  - Specific DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomal units occurs during programmed cell death (PCD) in both animal and plant cells, usually being regarded as an indicator of its apoptotic character. This internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is demonstrated in tobacco suspension and leaf cells, which were killed immediately by freezing in liquid nitrogen, and homogenization or treatment with Triton X-100. Although these cells could not activate and realize the respective enzymatic processes in a programmed manner, the character of DNA fragmentation was similar to that in the cells undergoing typical gradual PCD induced by 50 mu M CdSO4. This internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was connected with the action of cysteine proteases and the loss of membrane, in particular tonoplast, integrity. The mechanisms of DNase activation in the rapidly killed cells, hypothetical biological relevance, and implications for the classification of cell death are discussed.

AB  - An assessment of the effects of environmental chemicals on the quality of the ecosystems necessitates the consideration of appropriate chemical- and toxicological-ecological aspects. In addition, information on the production levels of the chemicals, their use patterns and environmental distribution, and knowledge of their transformation under environmental conditions is important. The behavior of environmental chemicals under abiotic and biotic conditions provides an indication whether they may be long-term accumulated in the environment as anticipated. These studies also allow possible conversion products to be identified. In contrast to biological degradation pathways and conversion processes of environmental chemicals, of which the course is accompanied by very small amounts of energy, sources with inexhaustible capacity and constant intensity are available for abiotic processes. UV-irradiation is the most important manifestation of the largest energy source of our environment, the sun, whose effects are important during the ecological assessments of chemicals.
   In this paper, recent studies on the degradability of environmental chemicals are summarized. Especially direct and indirect photolysis of important environmental chemicals are discussed to explain their role during conversion in the troposphere, in soil and aquatic systems.

AB  - Wetland assessment tools are being developed and employed in wetland monitoring and conservation based on physical, chemical and biological characterization. In wetland biological assessment, various ecological functions have been described by biological traits of an entire species pool that adapts to different types of wetland environments. Since microorganisms play a key role in wetland biogeochemical processes and respond quickly to environmental disturbances, this review paper describes the different macro indicators used in wetland biological monitoring and expands the potential use of microbial indicators in wetland assessment and management. Application of molecular microbial technologies paves the path to an integrated measure of wetland health conditions. For example, the ratio of ammonia-oxidizing archaeal and bacterial populations has been proposed to serve as a microbial indicator of wetland nutrient conditions. The microbial indicators coupled with physical, chemical and other biological parameters are vital to the development of multi-metric index for measuring wetland health conditions. Inclusion of microbial indicators will lead to a more comprehensive wetland assessment for wetland restoration and management practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scientists and practitioners working on river restoration have made progress on understanding the recovery potential of rivers from geomorphological and engineering perspectives. We now need to build on this work to gain a better understanding of the biological processes involved in river restoration. Environmental policy agendas are focusing on nature recovery, reigniting debates about the use of "natural" reference conditions as benchmarks for ecosystem restoration. We argue that the search for natural or semi-natural analogues to guide restoration planning is inappropriate due to the absence of contemporary reference conditions. With a catchment-scale case study on the invertebrate communities of the Warwickshire Avon, a fifth-order river system in England, we demonstrate an alternative to the reference condition approach. Under our model, recovery potential is quantified based on the gap between observed biodiversity at a site and the biodiversity predicted to occur in that location under alternative management scenarios. We predict that commonly applied restoration measures such as reduced nutrient inputs and the removal of channel resectioning could be detrimental to invertebrate diversity, if applied indiscriminately and without other complementary measures. Instead, our results suggest considerable potential for increases in biodiversity when restoration measures are combined in a way that maximises biodiversity within each water body.

AB  - As sensitive and ecologically relevant measures of environmental conditions, bioindicators can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems which may be compromised by a variety of environmental stressors such as contaminants, sediments, nutrients, and varying temperature, salinity, and hydrologic regimes. The bioindicators approach is a proven bioassessment method that uses responses of key (sentinel) aquatic organisms both as integrators of stress effects and as sensitive response (early-warning) indicators of environmental health. This integrated approach involves measuring a suite of selected biological and ecological responses at several levels of biological organization from the biomolecular and biochemical to the community levels. When properly designed and applied in field situations, bioindicator studies can help identify causal mechanisms between environmental stressors and population and community-level effects, and serve as a basis for which the effectiveness of remedial actions on the health of aquatic organisms can be evaluated. Rapidly-responding sensitive biomarkers, such as biomolecular and biochemical responses, and slower-response ecologically relevant bioindicators, such as population and community responses, can be included in field bioassessment programs to provide measurement endpoints for use in environmental compliance, regulatory decision-making, and ecological risk assessments. This bioindicators approach should be particularly relevant in helping to identify and diagnose sources of stressors in environments impacted by multiple stressors. To demonstrate use of bioindicators in addressing water quality issues, spatial and temporal patters in various biological responses are related to spatial and temporal patterns of contaminants in two aquatic systems compromised by different stressors.

AB  - 1. Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being.
   2. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e. g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems.
   3. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.

AB  - To comprehensively understand the current ecological status of rivers within Three Gorges Reservoir catchment (TGRC), and provide a baseline and tools for the future assessment, macroinvertebrates from 26 tributaries were collected in April, 2010, and a multi-metric index based on macroinvertebrates (SXMMI) and the corresponding rating criteria for assessment were established. Five metrics, including percent model affinity (PMA), percentage of individuals of 1st dominant taxa (Dom01Pct), Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI), total taxa number (TotalTax), and the taxa number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPTTax) were selected to join into the final index system by several steps. A combination of an "a priori'' (experts judgment) and an "a posteriori'' (PMA) approach was used to improve the accuracy of pre-classification. According to the results of assessment, the ecological status of the 26 tributaries in TGRC was not good; the rates high and good were relatively low, and there was a trend the ecological status in most tributaries deteriorates from upstream to downstream. The results of multivariate analysis and relationships among the SXMMI, the latent environment gradient, and abiotic and biotic parameters indicated that our final index was a robust assessment tool. In future, the SXMMI should be refined and verified with additional data.

AB  - Some species of Ganoderma, such as G. lucidum, are well-known as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and their pharmacological value was scientifically proven in modern days. However, G. boninense is recognized as an oil palm pathogen, and its biological activity is scarcely reported. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial properties of G. boninense fruiting bodies, which formed by condensed mycelial, produced numerous and complex profiles of natural compounds. Extract was cleaned up with normal-phase SPE and its metabolites were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). From the disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays, strong susceptibility was observed in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in elute fraction with zone inhibition of 41.08 +/- 0.04 mm and MIC value of 0.078 mg mL(-1). A total of 23 peaks were detected using MS, which were putatively identified based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and eight compounds, which include aristolochic acid, aminoimidazole ribotide, lysine sulfonamide 11v, carbocyclic puromycin, fenbendazole, acetylcaranine, tigecycline, and tamoxifen, were reported in earlier literature for their antimicrobial activity. Morphological observation via scanning electron microscope (SEM), cell membrane permeability, and integrity assessment suggest G. boninense extract induces irreversible damage to the cell membrane of MRSA, thus causing cellular lysis and death.

AB  - Comprehensive ecological risk assessment is of great significance for the restoration of watershed ecosystem health, and the appropriate and effective assessment method is the premise of ecological risk assessment. In this study, the conceptual model of risk response was developed by identification of ecological risk sources, stressors, endpoints and the corresponding response mechanism as well as the improved TOPSIS model based on Canberra distance and the combinatorial weighting method based on AHP and Critic were combined for the assessment. According to the three aspects of agriculture, industrial and urbanization, the occurrence mechanism of comprehensive ecological risk of rivers in semi-arid areas was analyzed. Furthermore, twenty-four indexes were selected to establish the index system and the Wei River Basin was taken as an example to verify the model. The results of comprehensive ecological risk assessment and stressor analysis showed that the deterioration of water quality (enrichment of heavy metals) and the decrease of benthos integrity were the two main risk factors for the increase of comprehensive ecological risk in Wei River Basin. And the regulation of ecological risk for the Wei River Basin is improvement of water quality and biotic integrity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.

AB  - The formation of transgressive aeolian sedimentary systems on hot-spot volcanic islands results in globally sin-gular conditions. The natural attractions and landscape features of these spaces can result in the concentration of urban-tourist developments in their surroundings, altering their physical integrity and their ecological and scenic functionality. This has been the case of the Corralejo dunefield in Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), where the strong pressure exerted by tourism is endangering the area's natural and landscape resources. This study aims to qualitatively assess the landscape heritage through a number of indicators, some of which are developed on the basis of user perception. Four landscape dimensions (substratum, sea, vegetation, and scenic background) were used to analyse the 24 landscape units into which the Corralejo beach-dune system was divided. The results show that this system presents a high landscape value, as do its four different dimensions. This value was found to decrease in areas bordering the urban area or where tourists were commonly present. Recommendations are proposed to improve the area based on user perceptions. This type of research is of interest for future planning, ordinance preparation and management with a view to establishing a balance between the physical medium and anthropic pressure.

AB  - Nine articles in the special issue of Restoration Ecology addressing the subject of site selection for riparian restoration activities were critically examined for this review. The approaches described make significant and original contributions to the field of riparian restoration. All are interdisciplinary to some extent, often combining the fields of hydrology, geomorphology, and biology in the design of restorations. A common component among the articles is that they take a broad view, if not a watershed view, of restoration site selection. The approaches can be generally described as top-down strategic approaches to siting restorations, as opposed to the more methods-and site-driven bottom-up, or tactical, approach. All the articles recognize the importance of developing endpoints related to the ecological function of riparian ecosystems. They succeed in their quest for these indicators of ecological function to varying degrees. The most common indicator used in these papers is riparian vegetation. Several additional elements of scientific investigation, if successfully pursued, could provide vital information and advance our understanding of riparian restoration: developing interdisciplinary approaches more fully; defining endpoints and reference conditions; implementing multiple scale approaches; viewing restorations as experimental ecosystem manipulations; developing a philosophy regarding exotic species; incorporating geographic information systems more often; and integrating science, society, and politics. The foundation provided by the contributions in this issue should provide a strong basis for the rapid advancement of future research in the area of riparian restoration.

AB  - Bioindication is a method to assess environmental conditions using indicator organisms. In Colombia, water quality evaluation is mostly performed following the Biological Monitoring Working Party/Colombia method (BMWP/Col), which uses aquatic macroinvertebrates at the taxonomic family level. Studies on potential bioindicators are important to produce comprehensive information on the requirements of macroinvertebrates and their value for water quality bioindication. We studied the larval ecology of several common genera of Odonata from Colombian freshwater ecosystems and assigned an indicator value to each genus.The physical and chemical water characteristics of 1,022 sites surveyed in Colombia from 2005 to 2016 were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA). The relationship between environmental conditions and Odonata genera found was studied using multiple logistic regressions between sample coordinates of the first three axes of the PCA and occurrence of the respective genus. We assigned an indicator value for each genus using the logistic regression and the water quality of samples. The highest indicator values were assigned to genera, which were mainly explained by the PCA axis associated with water quality, showed a high odds ratio to this axis, and were found in ecosystems with excellent water quality.The indicator values suggested for each taxon are, Brechmorhoga Kirby, 1894, 8; Macrothemis Hagen, 1868, 4; Micrathyria Kirby, 1889, 4 (Libellulidae); Progomphus Selys, 1854, 7 (Gomphidae); Acanthagrion Selys, 1876, 4; and Argia Rambur, 1842, 7 (Coenagrionidae). Differences in water quality preferences in genera of the same family suggest that higher taxonomic resolution may allow more detailed environmental assessments.

AB  - Many individual wetlands are hydraulically interconnected and present a specific network structure, which act as a large wetland system. Understanding the environmental flow allocations for a wetland system, instead of an individual wetland, is important for systems-level water resources management and ecological protection. In the present study, ecological network analysis was introduced as a powerful method for developing insights into the integral functional condition of the Baiyangdian wetland system in northern China. We investigated how 6 network functional indicators react to different environmental flow allocations in 16 sequential seasons of four-stage during the period of 1959-1978. Biological productivity in the Baiyangdian Lake was used to verify the validity of these functional indicators. A deviation index (D), which incorporates input ascendency (A(0)), output ascendency (A(e)) and internal ascendency (A(i)), was adopted to evaluate the reasonability of environmental flow allocations for the wetland system. Results show that the functional indicators of the wetland system declined continuously during the study period. The average deviation index increased from 0.69 to 1.089, indicating the environmental flow allocations for the wetland system were increasingly inadequate and unreasonable in the study period. On the basis of the above results, an adjustment coefficient was developed to direct the environmental flow allocations for the wetland system within the basin. The present study provides an example of how management actions arising out of network analysis might lead to a better understanding of a wetland system functioning and holistic environmental flow assessment.

AB  - In this study, we analyze the changes of indicators of ecosystem services and functions, in order to understand the main cause of grassland degradation due to climatic variation or land use changes in the middle -south Inner Mongolia. The soil nutrient and the water supply of supporting service got recovery during 1988-2008. The loss of net primary production declined, and the quality of the retained unconverted grassland (RUG) even increasingly degraded from 2000 to 2008. Analytical results show that environmental degradation on the land use -changed -area is lower than that on the RUG from 2000 to 2008. It illustrates that climatic variation has more negative impacts on grassland ecosystem service, and which is significantly higher than the so-called "overgrazing" induced grassland degradation. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that those species died out on the RUG due to natural selection or competitive evolution in an evolutionary process under the deteriorative weather condition rather than overgrazing. The positive impacts of human activities such as conservation programs and wildlife protection laws also benefit to regional grassland ecosystem obviously in the study area, so that can delay the environmental degradation even if each planet has its life cycle. It indicates that an integrated regional planning involving the considerations of climatic conditions, geographical characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and ecological functions and biodiversity can benefit to regional grassland conservation based on monitoring and management via scientific methods.

AB  - The usefulness of benthic multi-metric indices when assessing seafloor integrity across broad environmental gradients should be deliberated, as their lack of transparency might hide important sources of variation and fail to identify environmental change. This study compares the performance of two multimetric indices; the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) and the Brackish water Benthic Index (BBI) between three sub-basins in the Baltic Sea. Both indices reflect the salinity-driven gradient in macroinvertebrate diversity and composition as well as changes in bottom water oxygen concentrations. The relative contribution of predictor variables for explaining index variation does, however, differ between sub-basins, resulting in the indices representing different aspects of the benthic community along the environmental gradient. This context-dependency is caused by inherent differences in benthic community characteristics between the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, and how the communities are portrayed by the indices. An increased transparency of the importance of the different predictors for directing index values is needed for coherent classifications over broad environmental gradients, such as those occurring in large estuarine water bodies. Use of a weight of evidence table to combine multiple indicators would preserve transparency and be more likely to provide a robust assessment method that would detect seafloor degradation at an early stage.

AB  - From 1995 to 2000 biological effects were studied in liver of flounder (Platichtys flesus L.) from the German Bight. During the study period deleterious consequences of acute discharges of DDT and PCBs in early spring 1996 and after 1998 due to remobilization of contaminants from riverbed deepening of the River Elbe became evident. As core biomarker which reflects toxically induced liver pathologies and integrates effects of various classes of pollutants we measured the integrity of lysosomal membranes in individual flounder liver. During the study period, twice statistically significant disturbances of lysosomal function was detected in fish from the River Elbe: in summer 1996 and in spring 1999. Yet, the detrimental contaminant effects were not only restricted to individuals from the Elbe but expanded to those flounder inhabiting formerly less polluted reference areas. In contrast to flounder of the Elbe, their ability to recover from the lysosomal disorders were limited. While in autumn 2000 Elbe individuals showed clear signs of recovery, those fish caught in areas more distant to the source of toxicant input still maintained significantly decreased lysosomal membrane integrity. It can be speculated that fish populations which are not continuously exposed to chronic anthropogenic stress may have a lower potential or need a longer period to recover from the effects of pollution.

AB  - Human impacts on stream ecosystems are expected to intensify with population growth and climate change. Decisive information on how stream communities respond to cumulative human impacts is therefore integral for protecting streams draining multi-use catchments. To determine cumulative influences of nutrient enrichment and assess more nuanced approaches for the evaluation of human impacts, we present results from one factorial and two gradient assessment designs applied to benthic algae and macroinvertebrate data from 14 mid-order streams in southern Ontario, Canada with pre-existing human impacts (i.e., sewage effluent and agriculture). We found that among stream variability in ecological indicators measured downstream of sewage effluent outfalls confounded our generalized factorial assessment and provided inconclusive information on a known human impact. Despite our gradient assessment also not having strong statistical support, accounting for the extent of nutrient enrichment associated with differences in sewage effluent and agricultural inputs revealed that larger longitudinal changes in stream communities were associated with increased nutrient enrichment. However, re-weighting our nutrient enrichment gradient based on upstream nutrient concentrations to account for nonlinearities in the response of stream communities to nutrient enrichment produced more robust assessment results that were consistent with predicted effects of nutrients on stream ecosystems. Thus, while our factorial assessment suggests that the communities are resistant to nutrients from cumulative human impacts, our targeted gradient assessment demonstrates that the effects of nutrient enrichment are highly conditional on upstream ecosystem conditions. Future assessments may need to go beyond traditional approaches (i.e., impact presence/ absence) and more explicitly consider the environmental stressors and their associated complexities related to the impact under investigation.

AB  - Effective environmental management requires monitoring programmes that provide specific links between changes in environmental conditions and ecosystem health. This article reviews the suitability of a range of bioindicators for use in monitoring programmes that link changes in water quality to changes in the condition of coral-reef ecosystems. From the literature, 21 candidate bioindicators were identified, whose responses to changes in water quality varied spatially and temporally; responses ranged from rapid (hours) changes within individual corals to long-term (years) changes in community composition. From this list, the most suitable bioindicators were identified by determining whether responses were (i) specific, (ii) monotonic, (iii) variable, (iv) practical and (v) ecologically relevant to management goals. For long-term monitoring programmes that aim to quantify the effects of chronic changes in water quality, 11 bioindicators were selected: symbiont photophysiology, colony brightness, tissue thickness and surface rugosity of massive corals, skeletal elemental and isotopic composition, abundance of macro-bioeroders, micro- and meiobenthic organisms such as foraminifera, coral recruitment, macroalgal cover, taxonomic richness of corals and the maximal depth of coral-reef development. For short-term monitoring programmes, or environmental impact assessments that aim to quantify the effects of acute changes in water quality, a subset of seven of these bioindicators were selected, including partial mortality. Their choice will depend on the specific objectives and the timeframe available for each monitoring programme. An assessment framework is presented to assist in the selection of bioindicators to quantify the effects of changing water quality on coral-reef ecosystems.

AB  - yForest condition and the associated ecological processes vital for forest patch persistence are difficult to judge rapidly and time-consuming to sample. Here we examine the efficacy of epigaeic invertebrate species as ecological indicators of Afromontane forest condition. Epigaeic invertebrates are potentially good ecological indicators because they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, rely almost entirely upon the resources provided by the organic leaf litter layer, are known to be sensitive to environmental changes, and are easily surveyed. Epigaeic invertebrate communities were sampled using pitfall traps for 21 days in each of 11 forests that spanned a gradient from large and relatively undisturbed to small and highly disturbed forest patches. Using canonical correspondence analysis, we identified a suite of potential ecological indicator species (eight out of 140 species) and showed that gradients in their population response (abundance) reflect overall forest condition, as judged from the correlated vegetation indicators and position of the forests of varying condition along this gradient. The abundance of all but two of the eight indicator species (a spider and the landhopper, Talitriator africana [Amphipoda]) decreased with increasing disturbance. As a group, the rove beetles (Staphylinidae) show promise as ecological indicators and comprised four of the eight potential indicators species. A strong case is also made for a single-species ecological indicator in the form of T. afticana, which is a robust and sensitive indicator of poor forest condition.

AB  - Two Arctic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Tarium Niryutait and Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam) have been established in the Western Canadian Arctic, including the first in the Arctic, with conservation objectives directed to protect and maintain healthy beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) populations. The MPAs support the continued access of Inuvialuit (Western Arctic Inuit) to harvest beluga whales for food security and cultural purposes. The land claim and co-management framework for the Inuvialuit Settlement Region support the long term monitoring and management plans for this beluga population. We draw upon over 40 years of monitoring of the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) beluga whale population and consider the utility of biological indicators for MPA management. In particular we focus on the conservation of a beluga population whose home range extends far beyond MPA boundaries (transboundary population with summer core area in excess of 36, 000 Km(2)). We conclude that the EBS beluga whales are effective indicators of environmental change, but that we have limited understanding of the temporal and spatial relationships between beluga responses to processes that drive environmental change. Management bodies are challenged with implementing indicators that measure the impacts of 'non-manageable' stressors such as climate change, and by uncertainty in the mechanistic relationships that drive biological indicators. Given that Inuvialuit continue to be astute observers of the environment and changing conditions, our assessment suggests that Indigenous knowledge will continue to enhance the development and interpretation of beluga whale indicators for use in MPA monitoring and management.

AB  - Starting from the identification of marginal areas, this work presents a possible physical-mathematical approach as a support to landscape planning, based on the pragmatic determination of the predictable environmental effects connected to land use changes (LUC) and related to objective and quantitative ecological indicators for environmental impact assessment.
   "Fringe areas", which are more suitable to change in a medium-short time frame, were determined through a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (S-MCDA) process. Three land use changes scenarios were identified and analysed, namely: the current situation, energy crop cultivation in marginal lands, and the possible abandonment of lands such as these. Energy crop cultivation in marginal lands is widely considered to be a useful opportunity for farmers, against the progressive risk of under-utilization or abandonment; nevertheless, the large areas needed can cause important environmental side-effects. In order to assess the possible variations in environmental components in the ex-ante planning phase, scenarios were assessed in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystems services (using both monetary and indexes approach), focusing also on possible environmental fragmentation analysis by means of landscape metrics, which are simple measures used to deepen landscape configuration and structure.
   The S-MCDA process allowed about 10% of the study area with less favourable environmental conditions to be defined, where land use change is desirable in a medium-short time frame. For the energy crops scenario, the ecosystem services (ESs) approach highlights positive repercussions in terms of habitat quality and biodiversity value. Similar trends are highlighted by different ESs assessment methods adopted (monetary and indexes), confirming themselves. Also, landscape pattern analysis confirmed positive habitat connectivity trends: the delineation of fringe areas has preserved, in energy crops scenario, natural and semi-natural classes, reducing the risk of disturbance with respect to the biodiversity and habitat. This condition assumes that adopted S-MCDA method can contribute positively and significantly to the definition of LUC scenarios and land management.
   In conclusion, marginal lands can become an opportunity to improve socio-economic conditions and to enhance land image, while respecting the environment. LUC scenarios building, and their assessment by means of ecological indicators become a dynamic and structured tool in the land use planning/management process to support decision maker choices and to re-calibrate interventions, with the aim of contributing to sustainable policies of land management (ecological corridors, compensation and / or mitigation measures, etc.), emphasizing land sustainable management benefits (such as climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction).

AB  - This study addressed the potential ability to link landscape indices to stream water quality in a predominately agricultural landscape located in the Mississinewa River watershed, East-Central Indiana. A methodology for developing and analyzing landscape indices using a GIS and remotely sensed and geospatial data was applied to 30 Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 14-digit subwatersheds. Six indices, three representing natural area extent characteristics and three representing natural area disturbance characteristics were developed. The resulting indices were then tested to determine if they could be linked to water quality variables (Total Phosphorus, Nitrate, E.COLI, and macroinvertebrate [EPT/C] Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera/Chironomidae scores). These variables were gathered from a database of diagnostic studies that only called for a single grab sample during a storm event and a base flow. Using this data provided an opportunity to test the quality of using single grab water samples as response variables. Regressions were not found to be significant for any of the four water quality variables. The findings provoked a discussion on the need for managing variation in water quality samples when attempting to develop successful linkages between landscape indices and stream conditions.

AB  - Coralligenous reefs represent one of the most important coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea, and their ecological quality must be assessed under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to evaluate seafloor integrity. An effective standardized monitoring protocol is urgently needed in order to compare data at the Mediterranean scale and to plan efficient management and intervention programmes. This paper aims to: (a) review methods used to study shallow coralligenous reefs to propose a method able to optimize sampling effort; (b) select the most effective ecological descriptors to evaluate the responses of coralligenous assemblages to anthropogenic stress; and (c) synthesize available information in an integrated and standardized procedure. Ninety-five scientific papers dealing with shallow coralligenous reefs were found. Among these, 52 papers reporting detailed descriptions about sampling methods were selected to identify methodologies and ecological descriptors suitable for monitoring purposes. Downstream of the bibliographic review, an integrated and standardized procedure, named STAR (STAndaRdized coralligenous evaluation procedure), was proposed to assess the ecological quality of coralligenous reefs. STAR was tested on coralligenous reefs at 12 sites, six of them subjected to high human pressure and six located in areas characterized by low human pressure. Significant differences between the two conditions were detected for all the ecological descriptors selected, thus confirming the effectiveness of STAR in the assessment of ecological quality of coralligenous reefs.

AB  - Copper is an essential element for the function of metabolic pathways in many living organisms like photosynthesis in plants. But, for the last decades, anthropogenic sources and release of Cu lead to environmental pollution particularly in aquatic ecosystems. The aquatic plant, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, known as a bioindicator of metal pollution, could be used as biomonitor. The aim of this study is to evaluate biomarkers responses of watermilfoil during Cu pollution at high environmental levels (100 mu g l(-1) CuSO4) in controlled conditions. Morphological and anatomical features like a new double endodermis (DE) layer were evidenced in response to Cu treatment. Moreover, physiological parameters like pigments contents, osmotic potential and proline content present a differential response to Cu stress in young and old leaves of watermilfoil. Finally, despite a rapid and strong phytoaccumulation of Cu, only young leaves are slightly affected in their cell membrane integrity as indicated by MDA content. In comparison with the Cu effect on other aquatic macrophytes, M. alterniflorum develops particular protection mechanisms like the ROS scavenging using proline rather than carotenoids, the reduction of water loss with the DE and the heavy metal elimination through senescence to protect preferentially the photosynthetic components of the young leaves and the main-stem elongation. Due to its Cu sensitivity, M. alterniflorum appears as important in the field of environmental studies using plant biomarkers.

AB  - In recent years, the incidence and impact of natural disasters have drastically increased. Schools are responsible for not only teaching disaster management knowledge but also serving as evacuation shelters. Occurrences of disasters are highly unpredictable. If a disaster happens during school hours, schools must consider the risks that students are exposed to and respond early to such an event. Moreover, if schools can implement an all-hazards management approach by comprehensively organising practical environmental preparedness, software plans, and disaster drills, then injuries, deaths, and property damages can be effectively reduced and school resilience to disasters can successfully enhanced. Therefore, this study established an assessment framework for school disaster management involving concepts such as scenario setting, emergency thinking, and disaster psychology. School disaster management plans and the integrity and validity of disaster drills were used as the basis of evaluation. According to the existent schools in Taiwan, this study proposed indicators for five major assessment dimensions, which were environmental context, school capability, school disaster management map, related resource importation, and teaching material development and implementation. Finally, 35 schools were evaluated to verify that the proposed school disaster management indicator system can effectively distinguish and reflect the disaster management condition of each type of school. Additionally, this system can facilitate schools to regularly inspect and verify various disaster management tasks, thereby enhancing their capability in responding to disasters.

The integral indicator of developmental stability, evaluation of the ecological condition parallel to the data of physicochemical analysis was performed. It was found that the variations in genetic homeostasis in the populations of R. ridibunda in a habitat under conditions of anthropogenic pollution occur independently on the type of toxicants, but the degree of violation expression in the form of FA depends on the nature of the pollution.

AB  - The response of vegetation systems to the long-term changes in climate, hydrology, and social-economic conditions in river basins is critical for sustainable river basin management. This study aims to investigate the evolution of natural and crop vegetation systems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) over the past 2000 years. Archived Landsat images, historical land use maps and hydrological records were introduced to derive the long-term spatial distribution of natural and crop vegetation and the corresponding biomass levels. The major findings are that (1) both natural and crop vegetation experienced three development stages: a pre-development stage (before the Republic of China), a rapid development stage (Republic of China - 2000), and a post-development stage (after 2000). Climate and hydrological conditions did not show significant impacts over crop vegetation, while streamflow presented synchronous changes with natural vegetation in the first stage. For the second stage, warmer temperature and increasing streamflow were found to be important factors for the increase in both natural and crop vegetation in the middle reaches of the HRB. For the third stage, positive climate and hydrological conditions, together with policy interventions, supported the overall vegetation increase in both the middle and lower HRB; (2) there was a significantly faster increase in crop biomass than that of native vegetation since 1949, which could be explained by the technological development; and (3) the ratio of natural vegetation to crop vegetation decreased from 16 during the Yuan Dynasty to about 2.2 since 2005. This ratio reflects the reaction of land and water development to a changing climate and altering social-economic conditions at the river basin level; therefore, it could be used as an indicator of water and land management at river basins.

AB  - A wide range of seagrass biometrics as well as environmental variables are currently used for classification of the ecological status of coastal water bodies in accordance with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The use of extensive sets of indicators provides a satisfactory assessment of environmental quality statuses, but also requires substantial amounts of additional laboratory efforts and costs. In this study, typical population-level and individual biometrics of the dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltei (Hornem.) (shoot density, total biomass, above-and belowground biomass, above-to belowground biomass ratio, leaf length and leaf area) were tested and used in the adaptation and validation of a simplified, easy to apply and cost-effective pollution index (ZnoPI) for evaluation of the ecological and environmental quality status of Black Sea coastal waters in accordance with the WFD and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) criteria. Based on the metrics tested, reference conditions were established and ecological quality ratios (EQR) of the studied areas were calculated. The index validation was based on biological sampling and environmental monitoring of Z. noltei meadows in a variety of ecological conditions along the Southern Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. The environmental condition of the study sites was evaluated with an Integrated Pollution Status (I.P.S.), which combined water column variables (nutrients, chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matter, transparency) as well as total organic matter content and concentrations of heavy metals in sediments in a single metric. Significant correlation between ZnoPI EQR values and I.P.S. was found (r = 0.917 p < 0.0001), which validated the index for Bulgarian Black Sea coastal waters, and possibly other areas with similar environmental conditions.

AB  - Among the factors influencing soil quality, biological indicators are reported as critically important because soil organisms directly influence soil ecosystem processes, especially the decomposition of soil organic matter and the cycling of nutrients. Hence, any factor that affects soil microbial biomass, activity and populations would necessarily affect soil quality and sustainability. Presently, a staggering number of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) employed for industrial and environmental applications or formed as by-products of human activity are finding their way into soils. Common ENPs include the metal ENPs (elemental Ag, Au, Fe etc.), fullerenes (grouping Buckminster fullerenes, CNTs, nanocones etc.), metal oxides (TiO2, CuO, FeO2, ZnO, Al2O3, SiO2 etc.), complex compounds (Co-Zn-Fe oxide), quantum dots often coated with a polymer e.g. cadmium-selenide (CdSe) and organic polymers (dendrimers, polystyrene, etc.). The antimicrobial activity of these ENPs has been extensively studied with human pathogenic bacteria. Similarly, studies also exist on the affect of ENPs on beneficial microbes in vitro under controlled conditions. But very little information is available on how these ENPs affect microbial communities in soil under field conditions. The few published literature does suggest that among the ENPs, fullerenes and their derivatives are less toxic, while small size metal and metal oxide ENPs are detrimental to soil microbial communities. However, under field conditions, soil organic matter and related components like humic and fulvic acids could possibly negate the toxic effects of these ENPs through various mechanisms. Also, the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to such perturbations cannot be discounted. The paper also stresses the need for more information on interaction of ENPs with soil microorganisms under field conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parrots housed in inadequate environments can show behavioural patterns that they do not show in their biologically natural context, such as repetitive and nonfunctional activities, potentially indicators of poor welfare. In intensive breeding facilities, birds such as budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) are often pair-housed in cages of limited size for the reproductive period. In this study, the effects of spatial and social restrictions on the behaviour of 18 budgerigars housed in different conditions (pair-housed condition vs social-housed condition) were investigated. Our aim was to compare the presence of species-specific stereotyped behaviours (Oral, Locomotor and Object-Directed) and the time-budget of normal activities between the two experimental conditions. Data were recorded by using video-cameras and, subsequently, a focal sampling technique to score the behavioural repertoire of experimental subjects was adopted. Frequency and duration of stereotyped patterns were significantly higher in pair-than in social-housed condition individuals. A sex-related profile was also found, with "pacing" and "spot pecking" shown more often by males, whereas "wire chewing" and "incessant screaming" were performed at higher levels by females. Moreover, with regard to the time-budget of normal activities, pair-housed conditions showed significantly higher frequencies of locomotion and allo-grooming than social-housed conditions. These findings suggest that limited social and spatial opportunities influence the presence of stereotyped behaviours, as well as the normal activity of Melopsittacus undulatus, and cause a potential decrease of their life quality. Refinement of housing seems to have a direct role in improving the well-being of this species in intensive breeding facilities. Therefore, the dissemination of guidelines and recommendations on accommodation of this species is recommended to make it easier for traders and breeders to provide appropriate housing conditions for birds.

Three different biological parameters were employed to assess the physiological condition of the molluscs after 27, 51, 75, and 90 days of exposure: mortality, reattachment success, and dry weight. Besides the introduced zebra mussels, translocated aquatic mosses, Fontinalis antipyretica, were employed as a second trace metal indicator, though with a different experimental design. The moss tufts were replaced in toto every time the mussels were sampled in order to separately monitor temporal changes in the water metal levels. The biological responses of the mussels and trace metal accumulation in their tissues reflected the successive major anthropogenic impacts on the river. The differences observed in the biological significance of the examined condition parameters suggest the use of several descriptors in combination for an accurate in situ assessment of the biological impact of water pollution. The precise localization of metal input sources (i.e., natural Cd, Pb and industrial Cd, Cr, Cu, Sn) and the assessment of their spatial impact were particularly successful with Dreissena polymorpha. The major factor influencing metal concentrations in the molluscs was the change in dry weight. This source of variability could be eliminated by the calculation of metal body burdens. The comparison of the contamination profiles in mussels and in mosses revealed specific accumulation properties for both indicators. In particular, Cr and Sn were hardly detected in the bryophytes. The coherent data obtained for Cd, Cu, and Pb suggest that the monitoring results in translocated zebra mussels remained reliable even when severe changes in the condition of the molluscs occurred.

AB  - Biomass allocation in Castanea sativa varies according to the environmental conditions. Specifically, leaf-to-sapwood area ratio is higher on sites with good water supplies and lower in water-stressed conditions.
   Ecological plasticity allows organisms to adapt and to cope with environmental conditions. This is a key trait for species with long live span, which will probably be more vulnerable to changing climate because of their lower adaptation potential via natural selection. We studied the case of the sweet chestnut tree, a naturalized forest species in many European mountain areas, where it grows on very different climates and sites. This raises the question of its adaptation capacity to very different environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we applied the pipe model approach for analysing the variation in the leaf-to-sapwood area ratio (A (L):A (S)) in 82 chestnut trees growing in very different site conditions (e.g., water-stressed convex vs. water-rich concave sites). We used linear regression analyses to model the A (L):A (S) relationship to environmental and dendrometric parameters. Results confirm that A (L):A (S) is significantly higher when trees grow on good nutrient- and water-supplied concave sites with respect to water-stressed, convex sites. Chestnut trees are thus able to vary their biomass allocation between sapwood and leaves to adapt their hydraulic characteristics to the site conditions. Trees seem to react to water-stressed conditions by allocating more biomass in the sapwood in respect to the leaves. A (L):A (S) may thus represent a useful indicator of tree species plasticity and their adaptation potential to different environmental and climate conditions.

AB  - Quality assessments are crucial to all activities related to removal and management of sediments. Following a multidisciplinary, weight of evidence approach, a new model is presented here for comprehensive assessment of hazards associated to polluted sediments. The lines of evidence considered were sediment chemistry, assessment of bioavailability, sub-lethal effects on biomarkers, and ecotoxicological bioassays. A conceptual and software-assisted model was developed with logical flow-charts elaborating results from each line of evidence on the basis of several chemical and biological parameters, normative guidelines or scientific evidence; the data are thus summarized into four specific synthetic indices, before their integration into an overall sediment hazard evaluation. This model was validated using European eels (Anguilla anguilla) as the bioindicator species, exposed under laboratory conditions to sediments from an industrial site, and caged under field conditions in two harbour areas. The concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace metals were much higher in the industrial compared to harbour sediments, and accordingly the bioaccumulation in liver and gills of exposed eels showed marked differences between conditions seen. Among biomarkers, significant variations were observed for cytochrome P450-related responses, oxidative stress biomarkers, lysosomal stability and genotoxic effects; the overall elaboration of these data, as those of standard ecotoxicological bioassays with bacteria, algae and copepods, confirmed a higher level of biological hazard for industrial sediments. Based on comparisons with expert judgment, the model presented efficiently discriminates between the various conditions, both as individual modules and as an integrated final evaluation, and it appears to be a powerful tool to support more complex processes of environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Synchrony in ecological systems, the degree to which elements respond similarly over time or space, can inform our understanding of how ecosystems function and how they are responding to global change. While studies of ecological synchrony are often focused on within-species dynamics, synchrony among species may provide important insights into how dynamics of one species are indicative of conditions relevant to the larger community, with both basic and applied implications. Ecological theory suggests there may be conditions under which communities might exhibit increased synchrony, however, the degree to which these patterns are borne out in natural systems is currently unknown. We used long-term breeding success data from a community of Antarctic seabirds to assess the degree of interspecific, community synchrony, and the role that extreme events play in driving these dynamics. We assessed theoretical links between community synchrony, niche separation, and environmental variability using data from this and three other seabird communities as well as a simulation study. Results show that reproductive success for individual species in the Antarctic seabird community fluctuated relatively independently from one another, resulting in little synchrony across this community, outside of extreme years. While an exceptionally poor year for a given species was not necessarily associated with an exceptionally poor year for any other species, one community-wide extreme year existed. When compared to other seabird communities, this group of Antarctic seabirds exhibited lower overall synchrony and higher estimated niche separation, supporting theoretical predictions. Empirical and simulation-derived results suggest that communities where temporal variation is small for conditions in which species respond substantially differently, and large for conditions in which species respond similarly, may exhibit more synchronous dynamics. Identifying where and why synchronous dynamics might be more apparent has the potential to inform how ecological communities might respond to future global change.

AB  - A continuous-variable Bayesian network (cBN) model is used to link watershed development and climate change to stream ecosystem indicators. A graphical model, reflecting our understanding of the connections between climate change, weather condition, loss of natural land cover, stream flow characteristics, and stream ecosystem indicators is used as the basis for selecting flow metrics for predicting macroinvertebrate-based indicators. Selected flow metrics were then linked to variables representing watershed development and climate change. We fit the model to data from two river basins in southeast US and the resulting model was used to simulate future stream ecological conditions using projected future climate and development scenarios. The three climate models predicted varying ecological condition trajectories, but similar worst-case ecological conditions. The established modeling approach couples mechanistic understanding with field data to develop predictions of management relevant variables across a heterogeneous landscape. We discussed the transferability of the modeling approach.

AB  - While the mining industry is steadfastly committed to the goal of increasing extraction of minerals, the failure to recognize the existence of biophysical constraints to extraction results in massive degradation to socio-ecological systems. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for analyzing mineral extraction which links the use and management of natural resources by means of the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model developed by Georgescu-Roegen. Mining is a productive process that not only depletes minerals ores but also affects other natural resources that are needed to maintain life-supporting processes over time. The central claim is the need of recognizing the existence of biophysical limits to extraction in order to manage natural resources as irreplaceable providers of ecosystem services. By providing a new conceptualization for operationalizing the ecosystem services approach based on the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model, we intend to challenge the current extractivist narrative that assumes unregulated practices, monetary indicators, technological advancements and substitutable resources. We argue that limits to mining activities should depend on a biophysical evaluation of the effects of these activities on the environment. Furthermore, social deliberation is required to determine whether extraction should occur and to what extent it is socially acceptable while still maintaining the integrity of socio-ecological systems.

AB  - The focus of this review is to discuss the current uses and developments of macroinvertebrate and fish indicators in riverine ecosystems. Macroinvertebrates and fish are commonly used indicators of stream heath, due to their ability to represent degradation occurring at the local or regional scales, respectively. A total of 78 macroinvertebrate and fish indices were reviewed, and the frequently used macroinvertebrate and fish indices are discussed in detail in the context of aquatic ecosystem health evaluation. This review also discusses several types of common components, or metrics, used in the creation of indices. Following this, the review will focus on the different methods used for macroinvertebrate and fish collection, in both wadeable and non-wadeable aquatic ecosystems. With the basics of macroinvertebrate and fish indices discussed, emphasis will be placed on the application of indices and the different regions for which they are developed. The final section will provide a summary of the benefits and limitations of macroinvertebrate and fish indices. In general, the majority of studies have been performed in wadeable streams; therefore, our knowledge about these indices in non-wadeable streams is limited, which should be the subject of future research.

AB  - One of the serious biological obstacles that must be addressed in any comprehensive revision of rangeland ecological condition assessment is what to do with sites dominated by exotic self-invasive species. In certain cases such species have truncated succession so that with a bare minimum of disturbance, the sites will never return to dominance by native perennial species. Are such sites destined to remain always in what is defined as "poor'' ecological condition. Many communities dominated by exotic annuals are closed to the recruitment of seedlings of native perennial species. At the same time the communities are open to invasion by other introduced species. Should susceptibility to future invasions be a criteria in assessing the ecological condition of rangeland communities. The sustainability of communities dominated by exotic invasive species is assessing the ecological condition of such communities. Deviation from the plant community concepts of range condition and trend judgement involves setting new benchmark standards. This is an endeavor fraught with many perils.

AB  - Human embryonic stem (hES) cells and fetal mesenchymal stem cells (fMSC) offer great potential for regenerative therapy strategies. It is therefore important to characterize the properties of these cells in vitro. One major way the environment impacts on cellular physiology is through changes to epigenetic mechanisms. Genes subject to epigenetic regulation via genomic imprinting have been characterized extensively. The integrity of imprinted gene expression therefore provides a measurable index for epigenetic stability. Allelic expression of 26 imprinted genes and DNA methylation at associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was measured in fMSC and hES cell lines. Both cell types exhibited monoallelic expression of 13 imprinted genes, biallelic expression of six imprinted genes, and there were seven genes that differed in allelic expression between cell lines. fMSCs exhibited the differential DNA methylation patterns associated with imprinted expression. This was unexpected given that gene expression of several imprinted genes was biallelic. However, in hES cells, differential methylation was perturbed. These atypical methylation patterns did not correlate with allelic expression. Our results suggest that regardless of stem cell origin, in vitro culture affects the integrity of imprinted gene expression in human cells. We identify biallelic and variably expressed genes that may inform on overall epigenetic stability. As differential methylation did not correlate with imprinted expression changes we propose that other epigenetic effectors are adversely influenced by the in vitro environment. Since DMR integrity was maintained in fMSC but not hES cells, we postulate that specific hES cell derivation and culturing practices result in changes in methylation at DMRs.

AB  - Ecological assessment of large rivers such as the Danube is a challenging task. Eutrophication was reported as one of the main drivers that structure aquatic communities in the Danube basin. Due to their sedentary nature, relatively slow growth/ long life spans, and engineering role in aquatic ecosystems, macrophytes are widely used in the detection of nutrient enrichment. In this study, macrophyte presence-absence data within the 3 km long reaches obtained from the Joint Danube Survey (JDS3) were used to predict the water quality of the Danube river and its main tributaries. For each water quality variable (dissolved oxygen, nitrate-nitrogen, and orthophosphates), a multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network model (ANN) was constructed using the macrophytes as explanatory variables. Despite the limited number of samples (123) along the wide trophic gradient of the Danube, the model showed good predictive performances for the main river channel. The highest discrepancy between observed and predicted water quality was obtained for the samples collected in the tributaries or downstream from the tributaries' mouth, where the model predicted better trophic conditions compared to measured ones. From 64 analysed macrophyte species, 28 were selected by sensitivity analysis as key water quality indicators (KIS) for at least one environmental variable. KIS mainly belonged to the eutrophic tolerant submerged or emerged species with broad ecological amplitude, which reflects the significance of the developed model for use on rivers subjected to nutrient pollution. However, the use of the developed predictive model is restricted to the river sections having a water velocity suitable for macrophytes growth. The developed ANN architecture represents the modelling approach which could be applied to other lotic systems and biological quality elements.

AB  - One objective of the European Union (EU)'s Water Framework Directive (WFD: Directive 2000/60/EC) is for all European surface waters to achieve 'good status' by 2015. In support of this objective, the EU has facilitated an intercalibration exercise to ensure harmonized definitions of the status of water bodies, reflecting the deviation of their properties (mainly biotic assemblages) from a minimally disturbed state, termed the "reference condition". One of the major challenges of the WFD has been to find common approaches for defining reference conditions and to define the level of anthropogenic intervention allowed in reference sites. In this paper we describe how river reference sites were selected in the Central-Baltic region of Europe. A list of pressure criteria was provided and 14 Member States (MSs) categorized each criterion according to the method (i.e. measured, field inspection, etc.) used for reference site screening. Additionally, reference land-use and water-chemistry thresholds were agreed among countries in order to base reference site selection on objective criteria. For land-use criteria, a reference threshold and a rejection threshold were established. Sites with all criteria below the reference threshold were considered to be reference sites; sites having most criteria below the reference threshold and only some parameters between the reference and rejection threshold were "possible reference sites". These sites were retained only after carefully checking the cumulative effects of the pressures using local expertise, and a posteriori water-chemistry evaluation was necessary. In general, the most widespread method for defining a reference site was the measurement of pressures, followed by field inspections and expert judgment. However, some major pressures (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) were evaluated in a number of different ways (e.g. measured, field inspection, expert judgment). Our meta-analyses reveal a need to reinforce standardization in the application of pressure criteria by Member States. The pressure criteria identified in this exercise should be refined and tested with biological data to help in the further validation of minimally disturbed sites (i.e. the WFD "reference condition") and to provide a firm foundation for ecological status assessment. This in turn would ensure that there is pan-European comparability when evaluating the achievement of environmental objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Black and odorous water bodies are an extreme phenomena that impair ecological integrity, adversely affect the lives of residents and the town's image, and cause unpleasant sensory experiences. Herein, we consider a black and smelly river in Heshan City, Guangdong Province, as a case study. The proposed comprehensive governance process combines the use of pollution control and interception, sediment remediation, aeration oxygenation, a high-efficiency biological contact oxidation/denitrification pond, and ecosystem construction. The project operation results showed that the combined process can effectively improve water quality. The water quality of the river improved to the Class V standard. All indicators met the requirements of the 'China Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard' (GB3838-2002). River water quality indicators monitored for four months revealed that water transparency and dissolved oxygen increased by 5.9 times and 24.5 times, respectively. Dichromate index (CODcr), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) were reduced by 5.8, 4.17, and 5.17 times when compared to the values observed before treatment. The black-odor and eutrophication of the river were successfully eliminated, and the water quality improved significantly. In general, the combined process exhibits a high technical feasibility for implementation, providing a specific reference value for the treatment of black and odorous water bodies in urban settings.

AB  - Given that people are an inseparable part of their environment through their dependence on ecosystems and the services they provide, it is essential to understand the human influences that impact the environment and in turn determine the effects they will have on the existing ecosystem services. This relationship was explored by coupling a habitat vulnerability study with an ecosystem service perception evaluation. A biological survey and a socio-economic study were implemented in western Morocco (Benslimane Province) to identify the vulnerability of different temporary pools and to determine the perceived ecosystem services obtained by local stakeholders. A total of 101 temporary pools were studied and in person interviews were conducted with 110 randomly selected households. For each pool, vulnerability to various land uses, pressures and threats were analyzed. Temporary pools located in forested areas were under less threat than those located in agricultural lands. The nuisances associated with temporary pools were indicated by local stakeholders, increasing the pools' vulnerability. Provisioning and cultural ecosystem services were also perceived, increasing acceptance for conservation measures. The results of this study highlight the need to account for natural science and social sciences to inform future management. This methodology can further be tested and applied in other fragile ecosystems to better target conservation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - As most ecosystems, peatlands have been heavily exploited for different human purposes. For example, in Finland the majority is under forestry, agriculture or peat mining use. Peatlands play an important role in carbon storage, water cycle, and are a unique habitat for rare organisms. Such properties highlight their environmental importance and the need for their restoration. To monitor the success of peatland restoration sensitive indicators are needed. Here we test whether testate amoebae can be used as a reliable bioindicator for assessing peatland condition. To qualify as reliable indicators, responses in testate amoebae community structure to ecological changes must be stronger than random spatial and temporal variation. In this study, we simultaneously assessed differences between the effects of seasonality, intermediate scale spatial variation and land uses on living testate amoebae assemblages in natural, forested and restored peatlands. We expected the effects of seasonality on testate amoebae communities to be less pronounced than those of land use and within site variation. On average, natural sites harboured the highest richness and density, while the lowest numbers were found at forestry sites. Despite small changes observed in taxa dominance and differences in TA community structure between seasons and years at some sites, spatial heterogeneity, temperature, pH, nor water table depth seemed to significantly affect testate amoebae communities. Instead, observed differences were related to type of land use, which explained 75% of the community variation. Our results showed that testate amoebae community monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate impacts of human land use on boreal peatlands.

AB  - Copper phosphate hybrid nanoflowers (HNF) have been widely used in chemical industries and wastewater treatment owing to its excellent catalytic activity and high stability. However, their fate and ecological risks have not received due attention after being discharged into natural environment. The significance of bacteria on the dissolution and fate of HNF and its toxicity to bacteria was evaluated from the perspective of its life cycle. Results showed that in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, HNF was gradually 'disassembled' into smaller nanoparticles (NPs), and then dissolved completely. More than half of the dissolution products (Cu2+) entered biological phase, and PO43- was absorbed and utilized by bacteria as a phosphorus source. The mechanisms of HNF bio-dissolution are as follows: the metabolites of bacteria dissolve HNF through complexation and acidification, in which small molecular organic acids and amino acids play an important role. Bacteria toxicity experiments of HNF in its cycle life show that HNF exhibits lower cell toxicity, but its intermediate (smaller NPs) and final dissolved products (Cu2+) exhibit stronger cytotoxicity by increasing the level of intracellular ROS and membrane permeability of bacteria. This research is helpful to provide ecological risk assessment, develop targeted applications, and rationally design future nanomaterials.

AB  - Because resources are finite, conservation practices can be based on shortcuts (i.e., a quicker way to a desired outcome). For example, indicator species are often used as a shortcut to justify conservation at greater organizational levels (i.e., communities, ecosystems, landscapes). Conversely, "coarse-filter" approaches to protect landscapes are often assumed to conserve organizational levels nested within that landscape. But is conservation biology fundamentally different from other applied sciences, in which shortcuts appear rare or absent? To evaluate this question requires a rarity; much data across organizational levels in numerous well-defined systems. We used data collected in vernal pools (N = 61) in greater San Diego, California and seasonal wetlands (N = 70) in Florida. Data for plant species of concern, plant community diversity, ecosystem function, and landscape integrity were evaluated using partial least-squares structural equation models. Three a priori alternative models for each of the indicator species and coarse-filter approaches were tested, where models varied in complexity and included shortcuts between organizational levels. We found little support for shortcuts connecting distant levels, but species of concern and community diversity were always significantly and strongly interrelated. We conclude that species of concern often predict community diversity (and vice versa) but shortcuts between more distant organizational levels are hard to find. Given that study systems here were numerous, discrete and relatively small (i.e., well-described), we expect that effective shortcuts will be difficult to demonstrate for many other systems that do not share all those attributes. Thus we suggest that regional ensemble conservation goals and approaches will be more often effective than relying on assumed conservation shortcuts with little evidence.

AB  - The Atacama Desert (21-26 degrees S) is currently one of the driest places on Earth and metal(loid) s are of special concern for this region, which hosts the largest-known porphyry copper deposits produced in Chile. Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22 degrees 20'S-68 degrees 35'W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world.

AB  - Successful protection and restoration of Great Lakes nearshore ecosystems will likely rely on management of terrestrial resources along Great Lakes shorelines. However, relationships between biological communities and changing shoreline environmental properties are poorly understood. We sought to begin understanding the potential roles of shoreline geomorphological and land cover properties in structuring nearshore biological communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Despite high variability in densities (benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) and catch per unit effort (CPUE, shallow water and nearshore fish) within and among lake areas, several biological community patterns emerged to suggest that nearshore aquatic communities respond to shoreline features via the influences of these features on nearshore substrate composition and stability. Benthic macroinvertebrate densities were not different between shoreline types, although they were generally lower at nearshore sites with less stable substrates. Shallow water fish CPUE and zooplankton densities were generally lower for nearshore areas adjacent to developed mid-bluff shorelines and sites characterized by less stable substrates. Larger fish CPUE appeared to be unresponsive to local shoreline and substrate properties of nearshore zones. The emergence of these patterns despite significant ecological differences among lake areas (e.g., productivity, community composition, etc.) suggests that shoreline development may have comparable influences on nearshore ecosystems throughout the Great Lakes, providing a terrestrial-based indicator of relative nearshore biological and ecological integrity.

AB  - Groundwater decline is widespread, yet its implications for natural systems are poorly understood. Previous research has revealed links between groundwater depth and tree condition; however, critical thresholds which might indicate ecological 'tipping points' associated with rapid and potentially irreversible change have been difficult to quantify. This study collated data for two dominant floodplain species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum) and E. populnea (poplar box) from 118 sites in eastern Australia where significant groundwater decline has occurred. Boosted regression trees, quantile regression and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis were used to investigate the relationship between tree condition and groundwater depth. Distinct non-linear responses were found, with groundwater depth thresholds identified in the range from 12.1 m to 22.6 m for E. camaldulensis and 12.6 m to 26.6 m for E. populnea beyond which canopy condition declined abruptly. Non-linear threshold responses in canopy condition in these species may be linked to rooting depth, with chronic groundwater decline decoupling trees from deep soil moisture resources. The quantification of groundwater depth thresholds is likely to be critical for management aimed at conserving groundwater dependent biodiversity. Identifying thresholds will be important in regions where water extraction and drying climates may contribute to further groundwater decline. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Programs for evaluating environmental impacts are often carried out with chemical analyses that are inadequate for evaluating ecological aspects of rivers. In recent times there has been a strong movement towards biomonitoring using indices based on the structure of communities of organisms. Less attention has been given to functional parameters (ecosystem level processes such as decomposition, primary production, nutrient cycling, etc.), despite recent work that demonstrates their applicability. The breakdown of leaf material in streams provides a system in which an aspect of ecosystem functioning (decomposition) can be measured along with the community structure of the fauna associated with the leaves.
   We measured rate of leaf processing and the associated macroinvertebrates in 9 streams in 3 categories of environmental impact: Reference (pristine forest), Intermediate (pasture land-use with intact riparian vegetation) and Impacted (pasture land-use with degraded banks and stream-bed). Leaf processing was fastest in the least impacted, "Reference", streams. The abundance and taxon diversity of the associated fauna were not different among categories of impact. Thus this aspect of ecosystem functioning was more sensitive to perturbation than was the structure of the community in this case. We suggest that leaf processing can be a cheap and indicative parameter for biological assessment and monitoring.

AB  - Global climate change is a key driver of change in coastal waters with clear effects on biological communities and marine ecosystems. Human activities in combination with climate change exert a tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and threaten their integrity, structure, and functioning. The protection of these ecosystems is a major target of the 14th United Nations sustainable development goal "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." However, due to the complexity of processes and interactions of stressors, the status assessment of ecosystems remains a challenge. Holistic food web models, including biological and environmental data, could provide a suitable basis to assess ecosystem health. Here, we review climate change impacts on different trophic levels of coastal ecosystems ranging from plankton to ecologically and economically important fish and shellfish species. Furthermore, we show different food web model approaches, their advantages and limitations. To effectively manage coastal ecosystems, we need both a detailed knowledge base of each trophic level and a holistic modeling approach for assessment and prediction of future scenarios on food web-scales. A new model approach with a seamless coupling of physical ocean models and food web models could provide a future tool for guiding ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Global change in its various expressions has impacted the structure and function of ecosystems worldwide, compromising the provision of fundamental ecosystem services and creating a predicament for the societies that benefit from them. Restoration ecology plays a key role in securing ecological integrity and societal well-being, and hence represents a global priority. However, human perception seldom goes back to the beginning of significant ecosystem degradation, making ecosystem assessment and restoration practices difficult. Long-term data, historical records, and paleoecological information can increase our understanding of ecological responses to natural or anthropogenic impacts and can directly contribute to the understanding and design of effective restoration practices. Here, examples from different ecosystems (drylands, grasslands, shrublands, savannas, forests, coastal environments, and wetlands) brought together from around the world illustrate (1) how to develop appropriate restoration references under the current uncertain global change scenario; (2) how long-term perspectives on drivers of change can help to identify critical ecological elements, thus contributing to defining restoration goals; and (3) how to incorporate information from the past as guidance for present interventions and landscape management. The building of community and the specificity of paleoecological and historical records of ecological change over time will be key in facilitating the translation of long-term information into the living process of ecological restoration practice.

AB  - Ephemeroptera is an important group of insects used in the bioassessment and monitoring of freshwater bodies worldwide because of their relative abundance in a wide variety of substrates and their increasing chances of detecting pollution impacts. In this study, their faunistic composition and spatiotemporal variations in density and diversity in River Orogodo (Southern Nigeria) was investigated at five ecologically distinct stations over a 12-month period. The mayfly nymph community responses to environmental variables were evaluated by means of biological measures and multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis [RDA]). Thirteen morphologically distinct taxa belonging to six families were identified. The dominant taxa were Afrobaetodes pusillus (23.1%), Baetis sp. (13.7%), and Caenis cibaria (11.4%). The density of Ephemeroptera differed significantly (p < 0.05) both in space and time. Diversity was influenced by substrate heterogeneity which in turn was influenced by catchment processes such as flooding and anthropogenic activities especially abattoir effluent. Based on the RDA ordination and relative abundance data, Baetis sp. dominated at impacted stations while a more equitable distribution of species were observed in less disturbed sites. Water velocity, canopy cover, nature of bottom sediments, and the amount of dissolved oxygen also accounted for the variations in Ephemeroptera densities at the different stations. Shannon diversity, taxa richness, and evenness were lowest in station 3 (the abattoir discharge site).

AB  - The species composition of fish communities in 15 microtidal estuaries in south-western Australia, ranging from permanently-open to normally-closed, is shown to be related to the geomorphological and hydrological regimes and not to environmental condition. This study then explored the effectiveness of using qualitative taxonomic distinctness and ABC curves for fish data as indicators of the environmental condition in nearshore, shallow waters of these estuaries and, in the case of taxonomic distinctness, also of their offshore, deeper waters. Neither of these indices require spatial or temporal reference data, which may be either prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to collect or unavailable. Taxonomic distinctness, in both nearshore and offshore waters, varied consistently among estuaries in relation to their recorded environmental status, and is thus a good indicator of overall estuarine condition. ABC analyses, however, did not prove a good measure of the environmental condition of the estuaries, because their results largely reflect differences in accessibility of the estuary to marine estuarine opportunist species and especially those that grow to a larger size. It is concluded that taxonomic distinctness indices provide a rapid and cost-effective method for assessing the environmental condition of estuaries, particularly those with limited spatial or temporal reference data.

AB  - The paper presents the proposed proprietary M exhaust emission indicator, which is based on the assumption that CO2 emissions are a measure of the correctness of the combustion process. The measurements were performed using a farm tractor meeting the Tier 3 emission norm, operated in real conditions during plowing work. The tests were carried out for a given land section at three speeds In the analysis of test results, the net engine work was used, as it is carried out in the type approval procedures. When measuring in real operating conditions, the torque read from the OBD system is overstated because it takes into account the engine's internal resistance. In the analysis of test results, the fuel consumption, emission indicators of gaseous compounds and particulates were determined, and the best conditions for conducting agricultural works were indicated in terms of their impact on the natural environment. The aim of the work is to verify the possibility of determining the emission index for an off-road vehicle and a comparative analysis of its values for various operating parameters of a farm tractor. On this basis, it was found that the lowest values of the M identity were recorded for the test characterized by a vehicle speed of 15 km/h.

AB  - The use of indicators is among the most important and popular instruments of environmental control and nature conservation. Within the EU project "Craynet", integrated research projects and general discussions have been presented with the aim of monitoring European native crayfish as indicators of biodiversity. Underlying many presentations on crayfish was the implicit assumption that Austropotamobius species were bioindicators for good water quality. With this as background, the Round-table discussion at the meeting in Kilkenny opened with two general questions, (1) what is a bioindicator and how well do crayfish, and especially Austropotamobius pallipes, match this concept? and (2) are other concepts such as "surrogate species" (sensu CARO and O'DOHERTY, 1999) more appropriate? The suitability of A. pallipes to be classed as a bioindicator was questioned by discussing its general tolerance to pollution, and the roles played by eutrophication and organic enrichment, water chemistry, chemical pollutants, and habitat. The value of A. pallipes as a bioindicator still remains debated; we are aware of many studies and statements of varying objectivity from fairly good to poor examples defining this species as a good to weak bioindicator. It seems that A. pallipes has potential as a bioindicator, however, perhaps only when we are able to narrow and define its tolerance levels. One conclusion of this interesting discussion is that a much better keyword, instead of "bioindicator", would be "flagship species", not least because of their "cultural heritage" value.

AB  - The hypothesis that migratory bird populations are limited during the non-breeding season is increasingly supported by empirical studies that also suggest consequences that carry-over into subsequent seasons. Although variation in food supply is the best supported explanation for non-breeding season limitation, the ecological mechanisms and physiological consequences are not well understood. We both supplemented and reduced Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) food availability on replicate plots in Jamaica in each of 3 years to determine the direct role of food in limiting the physical condition of Ovenbirds. Annual variation in rainfall and food supply created a natural experiment in parallel with manipulations. Sex and age-classes of Ovenbirds did not respond differently in terms of body condition to either food manipulation or natural variation in environmental conditions, suggesting that this population is not structured by strong dominance relationships. Ovenbird body mass, fat, and pectoralis muscle shape were positively and predictably related to manipulated food availability. Feather regrowth rate also responded positively to food supplementation and negatively to food reduction in the drier of 2 years. Prior to manipulation, annual variation in body mass corresponded to annual variation in food supply and rainfall, providing additional, correlational evidence of food limitation. Since multiple intercorrelated body condition indices of Ovenbirds responded directly to food supply, and since food supply influenced body condition independently of other habitat features, we argue that food is a primary driver of non-breeding season population limitation. Moreover, since these effects were observed during the late non-breeding period, when individuals are preparing to migrate, we infer that food availability likely initiates carry-over effects.

AB  - The key driving factor for sustainable agriculture is soil ecosystem, where pivotal services are provided by the soil biota, 'the biological engine of the earth', which can act as early warning signals of ecosystem health, and can be of use in environmental diagnosis. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles offer sensitive reproducible measurements for characterizing the numerically dominant portion of soil microbial communities without cultivating the organisms. The technique gives estimates of both microbial community composition and biomass size, and results represent in situ conditions in the soil. PLFA analysis has been used to detect various environmental stresses in the soil and was found to be more discriminatory than other methods. A set of certain specific PLFAs, viz. trans/cis ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (16: 1 omega 7, 18: 1 omega 7), cyclopropyl (cy17:0 and cy19:0) fatty acids, and fungal PLFA (18: 2w6) were able to distinguish the stressed environmental conditions such as heavy metal addition, tillage, organic compound toxicity, starvation and increased soil temperature. This set of PLFA needs further testing and validation in the wide spectrum of environmental stressed conditions under diverse ecosystems, before its implication as bioindicators of environment monitoring and assessment at the global scale.

AB  - Prior to 1970, little was known of Lake Superior's primary producers. Since then phytoplankton have been studied to track anthropogenic influences that have clearly impacted the other Great Lakes. Most of this work has focused on assessments of diatom assemblages because of their well-known relationships to environmental conditions and because they leave diagnostic fossils in sedimentary records. Some problems with these assessments have included temporally sporadic collections and poor diatom preservation in areas with low sediment accumulation rates, but diatom indicators have nevertheless revealed a long-term record of human influences on Lake Superior's pelagic condition. Trends in diatom assemblages indicate nutrient enrichment, especially during the 20th century, but these impacts appear to be less significant than those observed in the lower lakes. Shifts in the phytoplanktonic species assemblages in recent decades suggest that nutrient reductions have resulted in water quality and biological improvements. However, as has been observed in the adjacent Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, algal abundance has dropped to very low levels, possibly in response to climate influences. It is clear that ongoing monitoring and new paleoecological investigations of diatoms in Lake Superior are needed to provide the necessary detail to explain long-term trends and put recent, rapid changes in a context of natural variability for the lake.

AB  - The dynamics of the dissolved oxygen in water bodies is the result of complex interactions involving physical and biological processes. Understanding how the balance of these influences determines the amount of oxygen available for living organisms is a key factor to interpret the water body conditions, and eventually to use dissolved oxygen as an indicator of the water quality. In this paper we present a Qualitative Reasoning model developed to improve understanding of changes in the amount of dissolved oxygen in different segments of the river Mesta in Bulgaria. Effects on dissolved oxygen result from changes in physical, chemical and biological processes induced both by natural and anthropogenic activities within the watershed. To explore the possibility of establishing a landmark value that may change according to specific conditions, we developed the concept of flexible value mapping, which dynamically captures changes in the dependencies between the landmark value and the values of other quantities as the conditions of the system change during the simulations. The paper also discusses the concept of dominance of a specific process over other competing processes affecting a quantity. With the model described here, we aim to discuss possible solutions to interesting modelling problems and to provide the community of ecological modellers support for educational activities and water resources management.

AB  - We describe development anthropogenic stress indices for coastal margins of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Indices were derived based on the response of species assemblages to watershed-scale stress from agriculture and urbanization. Metrics were calculated for five groups of wetland biota: diatoms, wetland vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, fishes, and birds. Previously published community change points of these assemblages were used to classify each watershed as 'least-disturbed', 'at-risk', or 'degraded' based on community response to these stressors. The end products of this work are an on-line map utility and downloadable data that characterize the degree of agricultural land use and development in all watersheds of the US and Canadian Great Lakes basin. Discrepancies between the observed biological condition and putative anthropogenic stress can be used to determine if a site is more degraded than predicted based on watershed characteristics, or if remediation efforts are having beneficial impacts on site condition. This study provides a landscape-scale evaluation of wetland condition that is a critical first step for multi-scale assessments to help prioritize conservation or restoration efforts.

AB  - 1. Benthic stream animals, in particular macroinvertebrates, are good indicators of water quality, but sampling can be laborious to obtain accurate indices of biotic integrity. Thus, tools for bioassessment that include measurements other than macroinvertebrates would be valuable additions to volunteer monitoring protocols.
   2. We evaluated the usefulness of a stream-dependent songbird, the Louisiana waterthrush (waterthrush, Seiurus motacilla) and the Environmental Protection Agency Visual Habitat Assessment (EPA VHA) as indicators of the macrobenthos community in headwater streams of the Georgia Piedmont, U.S.A. We sampled macrobenthos, surveyed waterthrushes and measured habitat characteristics along 39 headwater reaches across 17 catchments ranging from forested to heavily urbanised or grazed by cattle.
   3. Of the indicators considered, waterthrush occupancy was best for predicting relative abundances of macrobenthic taxa, while the EPA VHA was best for predicting Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) richness. Individual components of EPA VHA scores were much less useful as indicators of EPT richness and % EPT when compared with the total score. Waterthrushes were found along streams with higher % EPT, a lower Family Biotic Index (FBI) values and greater macrobenthos biomass.
   4. While macroinvertebrates remain one of the most direct indicators of stream water quality, stream bird surveys and reach-scale habitat assessments can serve as cost-effective indicators of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Using stream-dependent birds as an early warning signal for degradation of stream biotic integrity could improve the efficacy of catchment monitoring programmes in detecting and identifying perturbations within the catchment.

AB  - Avoidance behavior is a key symptom of most anxiety disorders and a central readout in animal research. However, the quantification of real-life avoidance behavior in humans is typically restricted to clinical populations, who show actual avoidance of phobic objects. In experimental approaches for healthy participants, many avoidance tasks utilize button responses or a joystick navigation on the screen as indicators of avoidance behavior. To allow the ecologically valid assessment of avoidance behavior in healthy participants, we developed a new automated immersive Virtual Reality paradigm, where participants could freely navigate in virtual 3-dimensional, 360-degrees scenes by real naturalistic body movements. A differential fear conditioning procedure was followed by three newly developed behavioral tasks to assess participants' avoidance behavior of the conditioned stimuli: an approach, a forced-choice, and a search task. They varied in instructions, degrees of freedom, and high or low task-related relevance of the stimuli. We initially examined the tasks in a quasi-experiment (N= 55), with four consecutive runs and various experimental adaptations. Here, although we observed avoidance behavior in all three tasks after additional reinforcement, we only detected fear-conditioned avoidance behavior in the behavioral forced-choice and search tasks. These findings were largely replicated in a confirmatory experiment (N= 72) with randomized group allocation, except that fear-conditioned avoidance behavior was only manifest in the behavioral search task. This supports the notion that the behavioral search task is sensitive to detect avoidance behavior after fear conditioning only, whereas the behavioral approach and forced-choice tasks are still able to detect "strong" avoidance behavior after fear conditioning and additional reinforcement.

AB  - The California sage scrub (CSS) community type in California's Mediterranean-type ecosystems is known for its high biodiversity and is home to a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species. Because of extensive urban development in the past fifty years, this ecologically significant community type is highly degraded and fragmented. To conserve endangered CSS communities, monitoring internal conditions of communities is as crucial as monitoring distributions of the community type in the region. Vegetation type mapping and field sampling of individual plants provide ecologically meaningful information about CSS communities such as spatial distribution and species compositions, respectively. However, both approaches only provide spatially comprehensive information but no information about internal conditions or vice versa. Therefore, there is a need for monitoring variables which fill the information gap between vegetation type maps and field-based data. A number of field-based studies indicate that life-form fractional cover is an effective indicator of CSS community health and habitat quality for CSS-obligated species. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing approaches for estimating fractional cover of true shrub, subshrub, herb, and bare ground in CSS communities of southern California. Combinations of four types of multispectral imagery ranging from 0.15 m resolution scanned color infrared aerial photography to 10 m resolution SPOT 5 multispectral imagery and three image processing models - per-pixel, object-based, and spectral mixture models - were tested.
   An object-based image analysis (OBIA) routine consistently yielded higher accuracy than other image processing methods for estimating all cover types. Life-form cover was reliably predicted, with error magnitudes as low as 2%. Subshrub and herb cover types required finer spatial resolution imagery for more accurate predictions than true shrub and bare ground types. Positioning of sampling grids had a substantial impact on the reliability of accuracy assessment, particularly for cover estimates predicted using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) applied to SPOT imagery. Of the approaches tested in this study, OBIA using pansharpened QuickBird imagery is one of the most promising approaches because of its high accuracy and processing efficiency and should be tested for more heterogeneous CSS landscapes. MESMA applied to SPOT imagery should also be examined for effectiveness in estimating factional cover over more extensive habitat areas because of its low data cost and potential for conducting retrospective studies of vegetation community conditions.

AB  - A fuzzy decision analysis method for integrating ecological indicators was developed. This was a combination of a fuzzy ranking method and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The method was capable of ranking ecosystems in terms of environmental conditions and suggesting cumulative impacts across a large region, Using data on land cover, population, roads, streams, air pollution, and topography of the Mid-Atlantic region, we were able to point out areas that were in relatively poor condition and/or vulnerable to future deterioration, The method offered an easy and comprehensive way to combine the strengths of fuzzy set theory and the AHP for ecological assessment. Furthermore, the suggested method can serve as a building block for the evaluation of environmental policies.

AB  - Plants are continuously faced with complex environmental conditions which can affect the oxidative metabolism and photosynthetic efficiency, thus leading to the over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Over a certain threshold, ROS can damage DNA. DNA damage, unless repaired, can affect genome stability, thus interfering with cell survival and severely reducing crop productivity. A complex network of pathways involved in DNA damage response (DDR) needs to be activated in order to maintain genome integrity. The expression of specific genes belonging to these pathways can be used as indicators of oxidative DNA damage and effective DNA repair in plants subjected to stress conditions. Managing ROS levels by modulating their production and scavenging systems shifts the role of these compounds from toxic molecules to key messengers involved in plant tolerance acquisition. Oxidative and antioxidative signals normally move among the different cell compartments, including the nucleus, cytosol, and organelles. Nuclei are dynamically equipped with different redox systems, such as glutathione (GSH), thiol reductases, and redox regulated transcription factors (TFs). The nuclear redox network participates in the regulation of the DNA metabolism, in terms of transcriptional events, replication, and repair mechanisms. This mainly occurs through redox-dependent regulatory mechanisms comprising redox buffering and post-translational modifications, such as the thiol-disulphide switch, glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation. The regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also emerging for the maintenance of genome stability and the modulation of antioxidative machinery under adverse environmental conditions. In fact, redox systems and DDR pathways can be controlled at a post-transcriptional level by miRNAs. This review reports on the interconnections between the DDR pathways and redox balancing systems. It presents a new dynamic picture by taking into account the shared regulatory mechanism mediated by miRNAs in plant defense responses to stress.

AB  - Transitional waters straddle the interface between marine and terrestrial biomes and, among others, include fjords, bays, lagoons, and estuaries. These coastal systems are essential for transport and manufacturing industries and suffer extensive anthropogenic exploitation of their ecosystem services for aquaculture and recreational activities. These activities can have negative effects on the local biota, necessitating investigation and regulation. As a result of this, EcoQS (ecological quality status) assessment has garnered great attention as an essential aspect of governmental bodies' legislative decision-making process. Assessing EcoQS in transitional water ecosystems is problematic because these systems experience high natural variability and organic enrichment and often lack information about their pre-human impact, baseline, or "pristine" reference conditions, knowledge of which is essential to many commonly used assessment methods. Here, foraminifera can be used as environmental sentinels, providing ecological data such as diversity and sensitivity, which can be used as the basis for EcoQS assessment indices. Fossil shells of foraminifera can also provide a temporal aspect to ecosystem assessment, making it possible to obtain reference conditions from the study site itself. These foraminifera-based indices have been shown to correlate not only with various environmental stressors but also with the most common macrofaunal-based indices currently employed by bodies such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this review, we firstly discuss the development of various foraminifera-based indices and address the challenge of how best to implement these synergistically to understand and regulate human environmental impact, particularly in transitional waters, which have historically suffered disproportionate levels of human impact or are difficult to assess with standard EcoQS methods. Further, we present some case studies to exemplify key issues and discuss potential solutions for those. Such key issues include, for example, the disparate performance of multiple indices applied to the same site and a proper assignment of EcoQS class boundaries (threshold values) for each index. Disparate aptitudes of indices to specific geomorphologic and hydrological regimes can be leveraged via the development of a site characteristics catalogue, which would enable the identification of the most appropriate index to apply, and the integration of multiple indices resulting in more representative EcoQS assessment in heterogenous transitional environments. In addition, the difficulty in assigning threshold values to systems without analogous unimpacted reference sites (a common issue among many transitional waters) can be overcome by recording EcoQS as an ecological quality ratio (EQR). Lastly, we evaluate the current status and future potential of an emerging field, genetic biomonitoring, focusing on how these new techniques can be used to increase the accuracy of EcoQS assessment in transitional systems by supplementing more established morphology-based methods.

AB  - The WFD has introduced an international commitment to assess the ecological status of transitional waters (TWs), within which fish communities are a key biological monitoring component. The Transitional Fish Classification Index (TFCI) outlined in this paper uses 10 ecological measures to analyse fish populations caught from various ecological niches using a variety of gear types within the Thames estuary. These reach and method-specific communities are then compared to a reference population created from a 'healthy' population from TWs of a similar type. The results indicate a progressive downstream increase the quality of fish communities, consistent with previous work; variation between methods can be accounted for by gear selectivity. Overall, the TFCI is an effective communication tool for converting ecological information into an easily understood format for managers, policy makers and the general public. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increase in the degradation of wetlands globally has highlighted the need to assess their ecological condition. Hillslope seep wetlands are among the least studied wetland types, yet they the most vulnerable because of their small size and steep slopes. Human pressure and the vulnerable nature of these wetlands requires wetland assessment tools to assess their condition. This study sought to evaluate the performance of the Floristic Quality Assessment Index for all species (FQAIall), the FQAI for dominant species (FQAIdom), and the Floristic Assessment Quotient for Wetlands (FAQWet) in response to the Anthropogenic Activity Index (AAI) and WET-Health in eleven hillslope seep wetlands and used these indices to assess the degree and intensity of disturbance. Vegetation samples were collected in summer 2016 and winter 2017. All assessment indices, FQAIall, FQAIdom, FAQWet and WET-Health, showed that hillslope seep wetlands were impacted by human activities. FQAIall showed the strongest response to AAI in winter, while FAQWet showed the strongest response to WET-Health. To the best of our knowledge, researchers in South Africa have used only WET-Health to assess wetland condition, and this is the first study to assess the condition of hillslope seep wetlands using a combination of indices (FQAIall, FQAIdom, FAQWet, and WET-Health). Overall, the findings of this study suggest that FQAIall and FAQWet are potentially better tools for assessing the biological condition of hillslope seep wetlands in South Africa.

AB  - Assessing the health of ecological components of agroecosystems may be accomplished by examining changes in the drainage basin, which serves as an integrator of the agroecosystem landscape. In this study we examined fish communities in terms of an array of indicators of structure and related these to changes in riparian vegetation and agricultural practice. Evidence suggests management practices designed to foster healthier environments by, for example, reestablishing riparian vegetation were associated with positive impacts on the integrity of the fish community. At the same time, continued intensification of agricultural practices in parts of the drainage basin in recent years likely has had an off-setting influence in overall improvements in agroecosystem health. Assessments of changes in the structure of the fish associations provide the balance sheet by which the counteracting influences can be aggregated and assessed.

AB  - Simple Summary There is limited information on the interactive effects of heat stress (HS) and stocking density (SD) on broiler chickens. Our results indicated that both HS and high SD decreased broiler performance. HS affected intestinal barrier function by increasing intestinal permeability, but this result was not found with high SD. No interactive effects were observed between HS and SD for growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens. The present experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress (HS) and stocking density (SD) on growth performance, breast meat quality, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens. Experimental treatments included two different ambient temperatures (20 degrees C: thermoneutral conditions, or 27.8 degrees C: HS conditions) and two different SD (low: 9 birds/m(2) and high: 18 birds/m(2)) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. A total of 1140 21-day-old broiler chickens were allotted 1 of 4 treatments with five replicates. At the end of the experiment (35 days of age), two birds per replicate were euthanized for sample collections. The results indicated no interactions between HS and SD for all measurements. For main effects, HS decreased (p < 0.05) the growth performance of broiler chickens. Similarly, high SD also decreased (p < 0.05) body weight gain and feed intake. HS decreased (p < 0.01) jejunal trans-epithelial electric resistance (TER), whereas high SD did not affect TER. Neither HS nor high SD affected jejunal tight junction-related gene expressions; however, high SD reduced (p < 0.05) occludin expression. In conclusion, HS and high SD are key environmental factors decreasing broiler performance; however, the interactive effects of HS and high SD are not significant under the current conditions.

AB  - Land use change threatens the ecological integrity of tropical rivers and streams; however, few studies have simultaneously analyzed the taxonomic and functional responses of tropical macroinvertebrates to riparian forest conversion. Here, we used community structure, functional diversity, and stable isotope analyses to assess the impacts of riparian deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities of streams in southern Mexico. Monthly sampling during the dry season was conducted in streams with riparian forest (forest streams), and in streams with pasture dominating the riparian vegetation (pasture streams). Samples were collected for water quality (physical-chemical variables, nutrient concentrations, and total suspended solids), organic matter (leaf litter abundance and algal biomass), and macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. Higher temperature, conductivity, suspended solids, and chlorophyll a were detected in pasture streams, while nitrate concentrations and leaf litter biomass were greater in forest streams. Maaoinvertebrate density was higher in pasture sites, while no differences in taxonomic diversity and richness were found between land uses. Functional evenness was greater in forest streams, while richness and divergence were similar between land uses, despite differences in taxonomic composition. Environmental variables were associated with taxa distribution but not with functional traits, suggesting current conditions still promote redundancy in ecological function. Isotopic analyses indicated consumers in pasture streams were enriched in C-13 and N-15 relative to forest streams, potentially reflecting the higher algal biomass documented in pasture systems. Isotopic niches were broader and more overlapped in pasture streams, indicating more generalist feeding habits. No significant losses of taxonomic or functional diversity were detected in pasture streams. However, changes in trophic ecology suggest landscape-level processes are altering macroinvertebrate feeding habits in streams. The changes we observed in habitat, water quality, and macroinvertebrate community were related to the removal of the riparian vegetation, suggesting the structure and function of the focal systems would benefit from riparian restoration.

AB  - Human activities lead to several impacts on marine ecosystems, among which a massive input of plastic entering the marine environment. This scenario has the potential to threaten ecosystem health and integrity, also reducing the ability of marine ecosystems to provide good and services on which human well-being relies. In this study, the global scientific literature on marine microplastics was explored by combining social network analysis and bibliometrics. Network maps displayed the relationships among keywords, authors, countries, and journals dealing with the issue of microplastics in marine ecosystems. The citation analysis of journals showed that "Marine Pollution Bulletin" resulted the first among the scientific journals publishing articles on this subject. The results also highlighted that most research on the subject is focused on toxicology and environmental chemistry, while ecological studies focusing on the impact of microplastics at ecosystem level are still limited.

AB  - The traditional indicators Escherichia coli (in practice currently, though ecologically inaccurately, represented by 'thermotolerant coliforms' at 44 degrees C) and Enterococcus spp. proved to be suitable for the diagnosis of heavy and frequent faecal pollution observed in potentially dangerous waters, especially those originating from karstic aquifers. On the other hand, natural and treated waters, slightly and inconsistently contaminated, occasionally showed a variable Gram-negative flora, difficult to classify by routine tests. In that case, complete identification of isolates may be necessary to ensure a valid decision on the potability of the supply. At any rate some of the Enterobacteriaceae contained in the 'faecal coliform' group and many other 'coliforms', distinct from E. coli, lack sanitary significance although their presence at certain levels may indicate inadequate disinfection, hiatuses in the integrity of the distribution system or both.

AB  - Urban areas are human-natural systems sustained by fundamental ecosystem services (ESs), which interact in complex ways with the dynamic conditions of cities. To enhance our understanding of urban sustainability, it is important to investigate how the four types of ES (provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services) are integrated with social, economic, and environmental conditions at the city scale. By adopting the concept of ecosystem service bundles (ESBs), this study investigated how the selected ES indicators were correlated with multiple ESs and clusters of conditions from 1995 to 2015 in Ordos, which is a rapidly growing city in northern China. Pearson's parametric correlation test was used to demonstrate the trade-offs and synergies of ESs. Self -organizing maps were used to delineate ESBs and the condition clusters. Overlap analysis demonstrated the spatial relationships of the six obtained ESBs to reveal the co-occurring clusters of conditions. The provisioning services exhibited trade-offs with regulating and supporting services. Synergies exhibited relationships with regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Out of the six acquired ESBs, the provisioning bundles increased from three to four between 2005 and 2015. In comparison, the regulating bundles decreased from three to one between 1995 and 2015. The extent to which the environmental cluster overlapped with ESBs declined from 63.82% to 50.02% between 2005 and 2015. In comparison, the overlap between the social cluster and ESBs increased from 13.25% to 49.98% during the same period. These two clusters represented the main stressors of multiple ESs in the city. Thus, coal mining, solid waste recycling, and pollution control should be integrated in future decision making. The integrative analysis presented here is expected to help improve the current un-derstanding of urban sustainability by combining spatiotemporal variations in ESBs with the socio-economic-environmental conditions of cities.

AB  - This article reports the methodology and results of a data envelopment analysis (DEA) that attempts to identify areas in the country where there is maximum potential for improving the forest and rangeland condition, based on 12 indicator variables. This analysis differs from previous DEA studies in that the primary variables are measures of human activity and indicators of forest and rangeland condition in place of the traditional economic inputs (costs) and outputs. It also involves a different (ecological) production process than traditional DEA analyses, and a statistical preanalysis is developed and applied to homogenize the large and highly diverse landscape where this ecological production process takes place for the purposes of the DEA. It is concluded that, based on this analysis, there are opportunities to improve the forest and rangeland condition without reducing the amount of human activity, but not over large areas, only for some indicators, and typically not for a large number of indicators in the same place. This means that large-scale improvements in environmental condition across many indicators may often not come about without a reduction in human activity.

AB  - Research Highlights: The global Forest Landscape Restoration ambitions could be impaired by projects that ignore key principles such as the engagement of local communities in decision making and implementation, equitable benefit sharing, and monitoring for adaptive management. This entails the danger of continued degradation, disappointed local stakeholders, and ultimately, project failure. Other projects face technical problems related to tree establishment and nursery production. Background and Objectives: There are high hopes for Forest and Landscape Restoration to regain ecosystem integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested and degraded areas. We highlight various problems and success factors experienced during project implementation on a global scale. Materials and Methods: We use data from a global online survey to identify common obstacles and success factors for the implementation of forest restoration. Results: While the majority of respondents reported successful projects, others indicate drastic problems and failed projects. Major obstacles to forest restoration experienced by survey respondents were a lack of local stakeholder involvement and a mismatch between goals of local communities and restoration managers, as well as environmental, anthropogenic, and technical barriers to tree regeneration. Conclusions: When local communities, their goals, and needs are disregarded in project planning and implementation, as reported from various cases in our survey and the limited available literature, there is a risk of project failure. Failed projects and disappointed stakeholders, as well as discouraged funders and policy-makers, could lessen the momentum of global forest restoration ambitions. Adhering to key principles of Forest and Landscape Restoration can promote much-needed community support, with the potential to overcome barriers to forest regeneration and enable communities for the protection, management, and monitoring of the restored forests beyond the limited project and funding periods. Research is needed to gain a better understanding of the perception of local communities towards restoration activities. Further studies on the implementation of forest restoration at the intersection of environmental factors, socioeconomic conditions, forest regeneration/silviculture, and nursery production are needed.

AB  - Coral colony size-frequency distributions can be used to assess population responses to local environmental conditions and disturbances. In this study, we surveyed juvenile pocilloporids, herbivorous fish densities, and algal cover in the central and southern Saudi Arabian Red Sea. We sampled nine reefs with different disturbance histories along a north-south natural gradient of physicochemical conditions (higher salinity and wider temperature fluctuations in the north, and higher turbidity and productivity in the south). Since coral populations with negatively skewed size-frequency distributions have been associated with unfavorable environmental conditions, we expected to find more negative distributions in the southern Red Sea, where corals are potentially experiencing suboptimal conditions. Although juvenile coral and parrotfish densities differed significantly between the two regions, mean colony size and size-frequency distributions did not. Results suggest that pocilloporid colony size-frequency distribution may not be an accurate indicator of differences in biological or oceanographic conditions in the Red Sea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) can address climate change, biodiversity loss, human well-being and their interactions in an integrated way. A major barrier to achieving this is the lack of comprehensiveness in current carbon accounting which has focused on flows rather than stocks of carbon and led to perverse outcomes. We propose a new comprehensive approach to carbon accounting based on the whole carbon cycle, covering both stocks and flows, and linking changes due to human activities with responses in the biosphere and atmosphere. We identify enhancements to accounting, namely; inclusion of all carbon reservoirs, changes in their condition and stability, disaggregated flows, and coverage of all land areas. This comprehensive approach recognises that both carbon stocks (as storage) and carbon flows (as sequestration) contribute to the ecosystem service of global climate regulation. In contrast, current ecosystem services measurement and accounting commonly use only carbon sequestration measured as net flows, while greenhouse gas inventories use flows from sources to sinks. This flow-based accounting has incentivised planting and maintaining young forests with high carbon uptake rates, resulting, perversely, in failing to reveal the greater mitigation benefit from protecting larger, more stable and resilient carbon stocks in natural forests. We demonstrate the benefits of carbon storage and sequestration for climate mitigation, in theory as ecosystem services within an ecosystem accounting framework, and in practice using field data that reveals differences in results between accounting for stocks or flows. Our proposed holistic and comprehensive carbon accounting makes transparent the benefits, trade-offs and shortcomings of NbS actions for climate mitigation and sustainability outcomes. Adopting this approach is imperative for revision of ecosystem accounting systems under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and contributing to evidence-based decision-making for international conventions on climate (UNFCCC), biodiversity (CBD) and sustainability (SDGs).

AB  - Understanding and predicting changes in phytoplankton populations requires knowledge of losses due not only to sedimentation and grazing, but also to intrinsic processes (here, collectively termed 'cell death'). Cell death is poorly understood, especially in freshwater phytoplankton, but experiments in culture often suggest involvement of abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, light, nutrients). The occurrence of cell death was examined in a simple, natural environment: a small, well-mixed, temperate, urban pond during a period of phytoplankton growth, from mid-July to mid-November. Abundances of 18 phytoplankton taxa were measured weekly and fluorescence microscopy and staining was used to detect dead cells (using SYTOX which measures loss of membrane integrity) and cells undergoing cell death (using Annexin-V, which measures lipid inversions of membranes, an early signal of cell death). Dead and dying cells occurred in most phytoplankton taxa, but incidence and timing varied considerably, e.g. species like the chlorophyte Ankistrodesmus spiralis showed 20-30% of cells staining with SYTOX and Annexin in late autumn when the population was decreasing, while the dinoflagellate Peridinium sp. showed staining of up to 50% of cells with STYOX throughout the period, and the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa occasionally showed staining of 100% of cells with SYTOX. Overall, there was some association between cell death staining and growth phase with 10-15% of the total community showing SYTOX and Annexin staining in late autumn, when most populations were declining. Cell death could not be correlated with thresholds or rapid changes in abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature, irradiance) or with indicators of nutrient limitation (e.g. N:P ratios). While abiotic factors have been clearly implicated in cell death within unialgal culture experiments, in natural freshwater ecosystems interactions between biotic factors, such as pathogens or allelopathy, may play greater roles in losses related to cell death and be distinct for different taxa.

AB  - The incidence and dispersal of invasive alien fish species (IAFS) have ecological impacts on biodiversity and environmental health at regional to global scales. We identified links between the presence of largemouth bass (L-b) and bluegill (B-g), and selected indicators of environmental water quality, trophic and tolerance guilds, ecological health factors, and stream order. We used the data collected from national biomonitoring study sites in four major rivers of South Korea. IAFS occurred in eutrophic waters (L-b = total phosphorus: 140 +/- 170 mu g/L, chlorophyll a: 16.7 +/- 27.5 mu g/L; B-g = total phosphorus: 160 +/- 190 mu g/L, chlorophyll a: 19.43 +/- 28.05 mu g/L) and dominated at higher ambient ratios of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN:TP). At TN:TP <= 100, the relative abundance of L-b and B-g was highest (95.3% and 96.0%, respectively). Concerning tolerance guilds, L-b (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.0001) and B-g (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.0001) had positive relationships with tolerant species in all four river watersheds and negative relationships with the percentages of insectivores and omnivores. This indicates the harmful impacts of IAFS on the aquatic food web. These invasive fish species also influenced stream health, particularly in the Nakdong and Yeongsan/Seomjin rivers. Our findings suggest that assessing chemical water quality can help identify the optimal and suboptimal survival and spread ranges of IAFS (L-b and B-g), as they directly influence tolerance and trophic guilds in the aquatic food web. In conclusion, these IAFS could be a major factor in the deteriorating ecosystem health, which had negative relationships with the abundance and occurrence of IAFS. Therefore, approaches that use appropriate water chemistry factors and species tolerance may provide critical insights into the efficient management of river health that has been perturbed by the presence of IAFS.

AB  - Question Savannas are globally widespread and furnish a variety of ecological services through their structural heterogeneity. Unfortunately, those essential ecosystem services are threatened by climate changes including expected increases in duration of drought and nitrogen deposition. The objective of this study was to determine how overall herbaceous production, functional group production and diversity respond in the short-term to interactions between forecasted environmental conditions and prescribed fires.
   Location Western Edwards Plateau, Texas (latitude202f;31 degrees N, longitude 100 degrees W).
   Methods We randomly assigned full-factorial treatment combinations of rainout shelters, simulated nitrogen deposition and prescribed fires to field plots in an herbaceous-dominated area of a semi-arid savanna. Aboveground net primary productivity (assessed via destructive harvest) and diversity (using Shannon's index) were assessed as indicators of ecosystem functioning.
   Results Total aboveground net primary production was reduced by fire in the short-term (4 months), and reduced by drought at 8 months, but drought reductions were later overridden by lagged responses to large precipitation events (12 months). Forb production increased in response to nitrogen addition (8 months) and drought (12 months), but decreased as a result of fire (12 months). Live grass production was consistently reduced by drought. Plant species diversity was positively responsive to nitrogen addition, particularly in the absence of drought.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that the concentrated precipitation events that are forecasted to follow extended droughts may aid rapid recovery of drought-induced production decreases. In addition, the small-scale diversity of this semi-arid savanna may be driven more by resource availability than light-competition in the short-term. Managers and ecologists can use these results to help disentangle the ecosystem functioning that may be observed in the presence of future droughts, nitrogen deposition and prescribed fire. Understanding these processes will be key to protecting the integrity of savannas.

AB  - Ongoing and projected climate change is likely to greatly alter co-occurring stressor mechanisms, yet these potential interactions remain poorly understood in natural freshwater systems worldwide. As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, successful conservation efforts will hinge on developing mechanistic multiple stressor frameworks that have been ground-truthed in natural systems containing complex species dynamics and ecological processes. Our study examined the combined and interacting effects of potential climate and land use stressors on boreal stream fishes using data from over 300 catchments across a broad 250,000 km(2) region. To characterize boreal fish community health, we examined four indicators including species richness, total catch per unit effort, the proportion of lithophilic spawners (fish sensitive to sedimentation), and the assemblage tolerance index which provides a measurement of the overall community tolerance to disturbance. Land use stressors included total anthropogenic land use area and linear disturbance at multiple watershed scales as well as two site-specific habitat degradation indicators (dissolved oxygen and the proportion of fine substrate). Overall community richness and productivity were not negatively related to land use changes indicating potential compensatory dynamics (e.g. where intolerant species are replaced with more tolerant species as habitat quality degrades). In contrast, we observed declines for sensitive species, including highly valued salmonids, that varied depending on interactions between local climate, land use, and stream type. Sensitive species declines were concentrated in regions experiencing increased land use and warming, whereas increases were observed in cooler regions consistent with a subsidy-stress response. In addition, lithophilic spawners declined in watersheds experiencing warmer and wetter conditions owing to potential indirect effects on spawning habitat quality. Results from our study provide novel insight into complex climate and land use interactions occurring across a broad, real-world landscape, and highlight the potential for amplified species declines under future warming and land use scenarios.

TI  - An ecology-based method for defining priorities for large mammal conservation: The tiger as case study
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

KW  - POPULATION
AB  - The disappearance of large vertebrates in the tropical belt may be the next biological insult of the global extinction crisis. Large predators and their prey are at particular risk in Asia, where they are threatened by poaching and habitat loss. To facilitate the best use of limited conservation resources, we created an objective, ecology-based method for identifying priority areas for conservation that incorporates both habitat representation and landscape-level features. Using tigers as an example, our method captures the range of ecological habitats where they occur, accounting for ecological, demographic, genetic, and behavioral differences. Our analysis is hierarchical. We divided the tiger range into distinct bioregions and identified tiger habitat types within each. We then delineated tiger conservation units throughout the bioregions and ranked the units based on habitat integrity, poaching pressure, and tiger population trends. To maintain representation of tiger populations and their ecology in the different tiger habitats, we made comparisons only among tiger conservation units from the same tiger habitat types nested within the same bioregion. We identified 159 tiger conservation units in three bioregions-the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and Southeast Asia. We ranked the units in three categories that reflect the probability of long-term persistence of tiger populations (highest in level I units). Twenty-five tiger conservation units were classified as level I, 21 as level II, and 97 as level III. An additional 16 tiger conservation units for which little information is available were identified for immediate surveys. Levels I, II, and those identified for immediate surveys are the priority areas for immediate funding and for a regional tiger conservation strategy. One feature emerging from the study showed that protected areas cover only small areas of tiger conservation units. If the long-term prospects for tiger conservation are to improve, poaching must be stopped and protected areas increased in number, linked, and buffered by natural habitats. To enhance landscape integrity, the priority tiger conservation units that straddle international borders should be managed as transboundary reserves, giving tiger conservation a stronger regional structure. Like tigers, populations of other wide-ranging mammalian carnivores and large herbivores also are declining due to poaching and loss of habitat. The method we present for tigers can be adapted readily to improve conservation strategies for these species as well.

AB  - The condition of aquatic habitat and the health of species dependent on that habitat are issues of significant concern to land management agencies, other organizations, and the public at large in southeastern Alaska, as well as along much of the Pacific coastal region of North America. We develop and test a set of effectiveness monitoring procedures for measuring change in floodplain channel habitat in southeastern Alaska. Variables include measures of channel morphology, pool size, pool spatial density, and bed surface grain size distribution. These procedures provide methods of data collection and analysis that, in the context of a statistically defensible sampling protocol, allow for determination of rate and direction of change among different intensities of land use, and thereby evaluation of management strategies. Assessment of channel condition can also contribute to evaluation of both restoration needs and success of restoration activities. Information gained from these procedures, together with information, where available, on watershed and riparian condition and processes and land use history will contribute to interpretation of measured change and its linkage to specific disturbances. Relationships among channel condition indicators and salmonid densities as well as opportunities for future research to better understand ecosystem elements that support biologic productivity are addressed in a companion paper in this volume (Bryant and Edwards).

AB  - The accelerated development of urbanization in semi-arid areas is easy to cause varying degrees of disturbance to its fragile aquatic ecosystem. To find a general method for assessing the health status in semi-arid basins in China, and to provide theoretical basis for river health management and sustainable development, this study is that health evaluation index system is established in the Wei River Basin, covering a huge semi-arid area, and analyzed the biological structure of plankton obtained by field sampling and identified in laboratory, chemical conditions including dissolved oxygen, water temperature, ammonia nitrogen, pH, chlorophyll and other water physical and chemical factors determined by field instruments and sediment heavy metals analyzed in laboratory, physical habitat scored on site and social factors including water resource utilization rate and water consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP collected in local water resource bulletin. Based on the idea of game theory, an improved coupling model of set pair analysis with extenics is established to assess and predict health. The results show that Wei River System and Jing River System are healthy, Beiluo River System is sub-healthy, and the whole Wei River Basin is also healthy; most of the cross-sections have a tendency to change to a bad level. Compared with simple weighting, set pair analysis and variable fuzzy set methods based on the corresponding sampling data and the weight in this paper, the coupling model can explain the transition and its trend between levels, reflect the certainty and uncertainty, and get more accurate results. It is suggested that daily monitoring and management should be strengthened in most sections to improve their health. And improve the development level of ecological function and social service function, give priority to the development of downstream water resources economy.

AB  - There is a growing need to assess and monitor forest cover and its conservation status over global scales to determine human impact on ecosystems and to develop sustainability plans. Recent approaches to measure regional and global forest status and dynamics are based on remotely sensed estimates of tree cover. We argue that tree cover should not be used to assess the area of forest ecosystems because tree cover is an undefined subset of forest cover. For example, tree cover can indicate a positive trend even in the presence of deforestation, as in the case of plantations. We believe a global map of forest naturalness that accounts for the bio-ecological integrity of forest ecosystems, for example, intact forests, old-growth forest patches, rewilding forests (exploited forest landscapes undergoing long-term natural succession), and managed forests is needed for global forest assessment.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) analyses the effects of human activity, ecosystem integrity and the quality of the environmental services that can be provided by them. This analysis must be done prior to project execution in order to have a preventive nature. The application of new technologies in EIA needs an adequate structure of the knowledge, so a lot of problems appear because depending of the country, different terminologies are used. This paper describes a proposal of ontology for EIA to establish a conceptual framework and the building process. In addition, we have developed a friendly web interface in order to provide easy access to the knowledge and the possibility to suggest changes in the ontology to environmental experts. The objectives are gathering and providing the EIA terminology and facilitating structuring and the development of EIA methodologies. Finally, the paper describes how the ontology can be used in EIA applications with knowledge mobilization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recolonisation by crab species and sediment-infauna taxa (at class level) in artificially regenerated mangrove stands of Avicennia marina, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba (5 yr old) were studied using respective bare sites (open without mangroves or denuded) and natural sites (relatively undisturbed) as controls. The controls were chosen based on site history, physical proximity and tidal inundation class in reference to the particular reforested mangrove stand and samples randomly taken. A number of environmental variables were measured; interstitial water salinity and temperature (measured at low tide) were lower, whereas sediment organic matter content was higher in the areas with mangrove cover, with the natural sites having the highest content. The bare sites were generally sandier, whereas the areas with mangrove cover had higher proportions of clay and silt. Generally, there was a higher crab density in the reforested sites than in the bare sites, whereas crab species diversity (Shannon diversity index) did not vary from one site to another for any of the mangrove species. In terms of crab species composition, the reforested sites were more similar (Sorensen similarity coefficient) to the natural sites and less to the bare controls. For sediment-infauna, the reforested sites had a significantly higher density than the respective bare controls, while the natural sites had the highest density. The number of sediment-infauna taxa in both the reforested and natural sites of all the mangrove species was similar and higher than in the comparable bare sites. The results suggest that the reforested sites are supporting more faunal recolonisation, and therefore becoming more akin to the natural mangrove sites in terms of the investigated functional indicators. The findings seem to support the use of artificial mangrove regeneration (in areas where natural regeneration has been impeded by physical conditions or otherwise) as an effective management tool in the restoration and conservation of the functional integrity of degraded mangrove habitats.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate benthic communities are one of the key biological components considered for the assessment of benthic integrity in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, under moderate contamination scenarios, the assessment of macrobenthic alterations at community level alone could be insufficient to discriminate the environmental quality of coastal and transitional waters. Keeping this in view, sediment quality of moderately contaminated sites in a coastal lagoon (Obidos lagoon, Portugal) was assessed by the combination of sediment metal levels, Carcinus maenas biomarkers (accumulated metals and oxidative stress responses) and macrobenthic communities. Two sites were selected in confined inner branches (BS and BB) and a third one in the middle lagoon (ML). The site BB presented slightly higher levels of metals in sediment but biological variables calculated for macrobenthic data were not significantly different between sites. The biotic index M-AMBI that is being applied to assess environmental quality of transitional waters in the scope of the WFD pointed either to high (site ML) or good quality status (BS and BB) in the selected sites. However, crabs from BB site presented significantly higher levels of Ni in hepatopancreas than those from ML and macrobenthic community structure was significantly different between BB and ML. Additionally, spatial differences were obtained for oxidative stress parameters suggesting that BB site presented stressors for crabs (higher GST and lower GSH(t) at BB site). Factor analysis (PCA) integrating sediment contamination, biomarkers in crabs and macrobenthic data also distinguished BB site as the most environmentally disturbed. On the other hand, at ML site, some macrobenthic variables (equitability and polychaetes' diversity) were found to be enhanced by current environmental conditions, suggesting the existence of a better sediment quality. Current results pointed to the usefulness of integrating macrobenthic community alterations with responses at organism level (bioaccumulation and biochemical endpoints) in order to increase the accuracy of environmental quality assessment in lagoon systems. Moreover, the application of different statistical methods was also found to be recommendable.

AB  - Benthic infaunal species and communities have been extensively used to evaluate quality of the marine environment. Within the MSFD, community composition is addressed most commonly through Descriptor 6 (Seafloor integrity), criterion 6.2 (Condition of benthic communities). At the same time, the Directive has stipulations for addressing and assessing indicators linked with pressures in an explicitly spatial manner At larger scales, achieving this through point sampling may be impractical or unfeasible; hence predictive methods are being increasingly employed to produce the large scale spatial data that are often required for marine spatial planning and management. The aim of the current work was to develop statistical and spatial modeling tools that can predict the distribution of soft-sediment benthic polychaetes in the Aegean coast of Turkey. To do that, we employed Species Archetype Models (SAMs), a novel analytical and modeling framework which uses mixture models to cluster species responses to the environment, producing a number of "archetypal" responses assumed to represent species with similar ecological/physiological tolerances. Polychaete presence/absence data were obtained from the literature and modeling was performed against environmental variables reflecting the main natural and anthropogenic gradients in the region. The resulting models are interpreted in light of the sensitivity/tolerance classification scheme for benthic invertebrates. Three Species Archetypes were identified through the analysis. In brief, Species Archetype 1 consists of the most prevalent species in the dataset and primarily follows the salinity and temperature gradients. Species Archetype 2, present in the central and southern Aegean, is dominated by sensitive and indifferent species and responds negatively to chlorophyll a, whereas Species Archetype 3 represents mostly tolerant and opportunistic polychaetes with increased probability of occurrence in eutrophic, shallow, inshore areas throughout the region. Predictive performance was constrained by the information contained in our data. These results from a limited data set show promise that SAMs as a modeling tool can offer valuable insights into patterns of benthic species distribution and coexistence and increase our capacity to provide predictive advice.

AB  - Among the amphibians, the most sensitive group to climate change are salamanders (e.g., Salamandra infraimmaculata and Neurergus derjugini). In Iraq, these species are considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) RED List (2020). Apart from their important role in forest ecosystems stability and integrity, they are useful indicators for ecosystems functions. These species occur only in the mountain forests of the northeast, the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI), and information on their distributions is limited and poorly understood. Using the maximum entropy modeling and geospatial techniques, we aimed to: (i) map current distributions of the two species, and predict potential habitat distributions; (ii) model impact of the future climate change on their distributions; (iii) map overlapping habitat range for the species; and (iv) determine the main environmental variables shaping their distributions.
   Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.62070 and RCP8.5 2070 climate change scenarios, the overall expansion magnitude of the habitat for the species would be smaller than the contraction magnitude. For S. infraimmaculata and N. derjugini, the habitat would contract by 1751.58 km(2) (3.42%) and 2127.22 km(2) (4.16%), whereas expand only 226.77 km(2) (0.44%) and 1877.49 km(2) (3.67%), respectively. Climate change would significantly reduce the habitat ranges of the two species in Iraq. Habitat reduction for S. infraimmaculata would be more than N. derjugini. The potential distribution of the species would be toward the mountain forests of the east mainly and southeast of the KRI. Conservation actions should concentrate on the mountain forests (mixed oak) by establishing national parks, protected areas, and developing forest management policy. Current emphasis for conservation priority should focus specifically on areas where the species overlap by 1583.71 km(2) (3.09%). Our study provides baseline information for further investigation of the mountain forest ecosystems, and biodiversity conservation actions in Iraq.

Natural biogeochemical processes and diverse communities of aquatic biota regulate freshwater quantity and quality in ways that are not sufficiently acknowledged nor appreciated by the water resources management community. The establishment and enforcement of environmental flow requirements offer promising means to improve and care for these critical environmental services. This Special Issue provides new insights and novel techniques to determine, protect and restore ecologically and socially sustainable flow regimes, and thereby help achieve the water-related goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.

Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows' left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains.
   3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA).
   4. Advances in the allocation of flood flows along the River Murray in Australia, an Ecosystems Function Model (HEC-EFM) for the Bill Williams River restoration programme in Arizona ( U. S. A), the European Water Framework Directive, and improved management of hydroelectric dams demonstrate the potential for significant ecological recovery following partial restoration of natural river flow regimes. 5. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, the action agenda of the 2007 Brisbane Declaration on environmental flows and the wider literature, we propose an invigorated global research programme to construct and calibrate hydro-ecological models and to quantify the ecological goods and services provided by rivers in contrasting hydro-climatic settings across the globe. A major challenge will be to find acceptable ways to manage rivers for multiple uses. Climate change intensifies the urgency. Environmental flows help to preserve the innate resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and thereby offer the promise of improved sustainability and wellbeing for people as well as for ecosystems.

AB  - Catchments constitute logical units for management of the water cycle. Patterns of development uninformed by sustainability concerns have degraded catchment integrity and associated ecosystem functions, imposing largely unquantified costs. Ecosystem functions are central to sustainable social and economic progress; their protection or restoration may be the only sustainable form of investment in catchments. Despite growing use of catchment functions in some policy areas, a shortfall in awareness and pragmatic tools limits progress with policies and practical tools to support sustainable development in catchments, perpetuating damaging practices. This paper reviews methods of economic valuation of riverine systems. Valuation of ecosystem functions is revealed as particularly pertinent to sustainable development, as an indicator of the benefits of ecological processes to social and economic progress. A range of practical projects, targeted at restoration of riverine habitat in the UK with the intent of improving both river ecology and the social and economic advantages that flow from it, is also reviewed. Emerging principles and themes are discussed in terms of their potential contribution to policies and practices that promote sustainability. Review of these projects highlights the importance of planning at adequately broad scales-spatial, temporal and disciplinary-to identify integrated solutions, and to maximise community 'buy-in' and total benefits. In several cases, economic analyses demonstrate strongly positive benefit-cost ratios stemming from habitat improvement. However, major reform of regulatory and economic instruments is needed to promote sustainable catchment development, since prevalent 'perverse' incentives continue to degrade ecosystem functions. Measures to recognise I and reward ecosystem service as legitimate outputs from agricultural land use constitute a particular priority. There is a need simultaneously to address both 'big picture' structural adjustments and locally-appropriate solutions, from which clear local benefits flow. Pragmatic measures that contribute to systemic outcomes must also be attractive to local decision-makers and land managers, and yield benefits that ensure they are sustained once intervention ceases. Cost need not be a barrier, as current environmentally-damaging subsidies may instead be redirected towards sensitive land use and/or measures to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, particularly where targeted upon habitat of disproportionate importance to functioning of catchments as whole systems. Internalisation of the costs of damage to ecosystem functioning will promote valuation of the natural capital of catchments as a primary resource for social and economic progress.

AB  - Introduction: Lichen diversity, community structure, composition and species abundance have been used as indicators of the integrity and ecological continuity of tropical forest ecosystems. Objectives: To assess corticolous lichen species composition, diversity, and ecological importance of three forested stands differing in time of abandonment as indicators of how passive restoration influences the lichen community assemblage. Methods: We surveyed individual lichens on tree stems of a reference old secondary forest and a young secondary forest (50 and 14-year-old natural regeneration after pasture abandonment, respectively), and in a 35-year-old exotic cypress tree plantation, in the oriental Central Valley, in Orosi, Costa Rica. Standard diversity, similarity indexes, and the importance value index were calculated. An NMDS analysis was performed on the community structure parameters and in a presence-absence matrix. Results: We found 64 lichen species in 25 families with 42, 21, and 23 species, and 20, 10, and 15 families, in the young and old secondary forests, and the cypress plantation, respectively. Cryptothecia sp. possessed the highest importance across sites. More than 87 % of the species are rare. The combined IVI of the top three families were: 36, 48.5, and 74.8 % in the young and old forests and the Cypress plantation sites, respectively. Overall, Arthoniaceae is in the top three families. The young forest had the highest species richness, but the old forest presented the best evenness. Similarity and diversity indexes suggest a particularly low resemblance in the lichen communities but a smooth gradient differentiation between the three forests, which was confirmed by the NMDS test. The homogeneity test identified great differences in ecological importance and composition. Conclusions: This region contains a distinctive assemblage of species resulting in a strong community differentiation by site, reflecting the influence of ecophysiological and microclimatic factors that define lichen establishment and survival and suggesting a great regional beta diversity, within a fragmented landscape. Greater connectivity and passive restoration strategies resulted in greater diversity and a more heterogeneous community structure on both forests than the corticolous community of the abandoned plantation. Protection of forest fragments will maximize the integrity of future forests.

AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined ( canyon) river reaches while unconfined ( floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river - riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

AB  - During the summer of 2003, we studied a series of potential indicators of biological integrity on various sites in an intensively managed forest landscape in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada, to provide empirical testing of ecological requirements described by earlier researchers. Pitfall traps were used and each individual was identified to the species. Of the 54 ground beetle species identified, seven species were either new records for the province (n = 3: Harpalus solitaris, Patrobus foveocollis, and Trechus crassiscapus) or rarely reported (n = 4: Agonum superioris, Pseudamara arenaria, Scaphinotus bilobus, and Sphaeroderus nitidicollis brevoorti).

AB  - Spring ecosystems are keystone habitats, providing refugia and supporting high levels of ecological biodiversity and productivity. However, they are often overlooked, overdeveloped, or destroyed altogether. Protocol and inventory methods exist that provide detailed and quantified data collection that enable land managers to monitor and assess their ecological indicators. These methods typically require expertise from many fields, which limits the ability of land managers with lower economic and human resources to implement them on landscape scales. This study presents the Adapted Springs Ecosystem Assessment Protocol (A-SEAP), a simple adaptation of well-established methods as a preliminary, low cost method to evaluate ecological indicators of springs and identify areas of concern. Findings are used to prioritize regions and springs for monitoring and restoration using the rigorous established methods. For this study, a total of 72 springs were evaluated on Mount Tamalpais in Marin County California, a managed wildland surrounded by urban developments. Our assessment showed that spring geomorphology was distributed as follows: hillslope (56) rheocrene (10) > helocrene (3) ? limnocrene (3). Of those, 20 have anthropogenic influences due to roads or trails. Vegetation inventories revealed that springs supported 96% native species, 3% invasive species, and 1% rare and endemic species. Nearly 10% of all native species, as well as 10% of wetland species known in the area of interest were found in only 0.005% of the landscape. Among these springs, slope was negatively correlated to habitat area (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) and was positively related to discharge (r = 0.614, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between discharge and vegetation cover (r = -0.007, p = 0.8). A-SEAP demonstrated that the majority of springs in this region have fair ecohydrologic integrity relative to other spring studies, with a mean value of 3.62 out of 6. A-SEAP indicators identified springs located in Mt. Tamalpais State Park as lower ecohydrologic integrity than springs in the protected Marin Municipal Water District. A-SEAP indicators also successfully identified springs in need of restoration that fit the goals of the local land management agencies. Our results demonstrate that Mount Tamalpais springs are ecologically significant and require further inventory, monitoring, and conservation attention.

AB  - As the center of human activities and social civilization, cities have developed at the cost of serious environmental degradation and huge eco-environmental pressure, which further lower human living standards and impede the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. Current urban dynamic methods have broader views and focus more on ecological aspects, e.g., the impact of emissions and resource consumption, but they lack a rigorous thermodynamic framework. Consequently, there is a need to modify existing processes and develop new technologies that minimize environmental impact while stimulating ecological flow. This paper describes the development of a forecasting model, named the emergy-based urban dynamic model, capable of accurately simulating the observed resource consumption, economic growth, and environmental impact of Beijing from 1999 to 2039. This model differs from previous urban emergy models by monitoring the negative effects to human well-being and ecosystem integrity in the developing urban system. A fresh perspective focuses on urban comprehensive performance, linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation (including ecological service supply, ecological and economic losses, and investment for treatment). In this introductory paper, we present the conceptual considerations of the most important components of the emergy-based urban dynamic model: the urban assets, lands, capitals, population, water resources, and economic and environmental loss. Each subsystem in this model will enrich the feedback dynamics, policy levers, and post-scenario analyses. Statistical information and calibration were also considered in this dynamic emergy accounting. The simulation revealed that water resources will be the most important limiting factor for the sustainable development of Beijing. A better approach would not be more engineering projects to deliver new supplies but to curb demand through efficiency improvements in water supply and consumption using the rule of law and economic incentives. The results of the simulation revealed that after the year 2015, many emergy indicators will collapse. The results of our study will enable urban policy planners to understand these inter-linkages by addressing specific damages to human health and the ecosystem's integrity, as well as by linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation.

AB  - Mongolia is subject to regular peaks of livestock winter mortality called dzuds. Several kinds of dzud exist and the white dzud', characterized by heavy stochastic snowfalls preventing livestock to access forage, is considered the most common. Droughts and high livestock densities are thought to be part of the dzud process by affecting body condition, which increases vulnerability to snowfalls. Guided by the equilibrium/nonequilibrium framework, we studied how rainfall, animal numbers and pasture health (defined as the integrity of ecological processes sustaining grass growth) impact livestock body condition in a case study of West Mongolia. We studied this parameter through livestock productivity (LP) as a proxy, defined as the annual number of newborns per breeding-age female. We found no significant impact of rainfall or livestock numbers, alone or combined. We found through the study of pasture use, defined as the ratio forage consumed/forage available, an impact of the combined effect of rainfall, animal numbers and pasture health. We observed in addition sharp LP decreases prior to dzuds, which suggests that the above-mentioned drivers interact to weaken livestock which increases its vulnerability to winter hazards. This tends to show that in our case study, dzuds are not the simple consequence of stochastic hazards striking randomly, but instead, the final stage of a chain of events that involves dry years, high livestock densities and pasture degradation. This also indicates that dzud early warning indicators could be designed based on LP monitoring.

AB  - Freshwater systems have increasingly been subjected to a multitude of human pressures and the re-establishment of their ecological integrity is currently a major worldwide challenge. Expected future climate and socioeconomic changes will most probably further exacerbate such challenges. Modelling techniques may provide useful tools to help facing these demands, but their use is still limited within ecological quality assessment of water resources due to its technical complexity.
   We developed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) framework for modelling the ecological quality of rivers and streams in two European river basins located in two distinct European climatic regions: the Odense Fjord basin (Denmark) and the Sorraia basin (Portugal). This method enabled us to integrate different data sources into a single framework to model the effect of multiple stressors on several biological indicators of river water quality and, subsequently, on their ecological status. The BBN provided a simple interactive user interface with which we simulated combined climate and socioeconomic changes scenarios to assess their impacts on river ecological status.
   According to the resulting BBNs the scenarios demonstrated small impacts of climate and socioeconomic changes on the biological quality elements analysed. This yield a final ecological status similar to the baseline in the Odense case, and slightly worse in Sorraia. Since the present situation already depicts a high percentage of rivers and streams with moderate or worse ecological status in both basins, this means that many of them would not fulfil the Water Framework Directive target in the future. Results also showed that macrophytes and fish indices were mainly responsible for a non-desirable overall ecological status in Odense and Sorraia, respectively. The approach followed in this study is novel, since BBN modelling is used for the first time for assessing the ecological status of rivers and streams under future scenarios, using an ensemble of biological quality elements. An important advantage of this tool is that it may easily be updated with new knowledge on the nature of relationships already established in the BBN or even by introducing new causal links. By encompassing two case studies of very different characteristics, these BBN may be more easily adapted as decision-making tools for water management of other river basins.

AB  - Variation in the content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Fe has been analyzed in the needles of 19 spruce species growing in the natural and urbanized ecosystems of Siberia and Central Asia. The results have shown that similarity in the content of biophilic elements in one-year-old needles of different species is conditioned by biochemical processes, which confirms the status of these species as passive bioindicators of environmental quality. The contents of trace elements in perennial needles, except color variations of chlorophyll, deserve further study as prospective indicators of environmental quality.

AB  - Under certain conditions, sediment cores from coastal settings subject to hypoxia can yield records of environmental changes over time scales ranging from decades to millennia, sometimes with a resolution of as little as a few years. A variety of biological and geochemical indicators (proxies) derived from such cores have been used to reconstruct the development of eutrophication and hypoxic conditions over time. Those based on (1) the preserved remains of benthic organisms (mainly foraminiferans and ostracods), (2) sedimentary features (e.g. laminations) and (3) sediment chemistry and mineralogy (e.g. presence of sulphides and redox-sensitive trace elements) reflect conditions at or close to the seafloor. Those based on (4) the preserved remains of planktonic organisms (mainly diatoms and dinoflagellates), (5) pigments and lipid biomarkers derived from prokaryotes and eukaryotes and (6) organic C, N and their stable isotope ratios reflect conditions in the water column. However, the interpretation of these indicators is not straightforward. A central difficulty concerns the fact that hypoxia is strongly correlated with, and often induced by, organic enrichment caused by eutrophication, making it difficult to separate the effects of these phenomena in sediment records. The problem is compounded by the enhanced preservation in anoxic and hypoxic sediments of organic microfossils and biomarkers indicating eutrophication. The use of hypoxia-specific proxies, such as the trace metals molybdenum and rhenium and the bacterial biomarker isorenieratene, together with multi-proxy approaches, may provide a way forward. All proxies of bottom-water hypoxia are basically qualitative; their quantification presents a major challenge to which there is currently no satisfactory solution. Finally, it is important to separate the effects of natural ecosystem variability from anthropogenic effects. Despite these problems, in the absence of historical data for dissolved oxygen concentrations, the analysis of sediment cores can provide plausible reconstructions of the temporal development of human-induced hypoxia, and associated eutrophication, in vulnerable coastal environments.

AB  - The diversity of native plant species comprising of natural vegetation is closely related to patterns of soil processes controlled by environmental conditions. This study developed a logistic model integrating the relationship between spatially distributed vegetation patterns and ecological conditions of soil explicitly based along heavy metal contamination gradients. A quadrat size of 1 x 1 m was used to analyze herbaceous plant species in the vicinity of industrial area Islamabad that has been contaminated with wastewater effluents. We identified two dominant communities comprising of Desmostachya bipinnata and Trifolium alexandrinum as initial colonizers. The canonical correspondence analysis revealed that grass species were more tolerant to soil Pb concentration that ranged from 1.03 to 3.44 mg kg(-1) soil. The analysis of rhizosphere soil samples indicated that spots that were rich in Cd concentration were mainly occupied by Parthenium hysterophorus along with Malvastrum coromandelianum. We further interpolated the spatial patterns of soil properties in which pH and organic matter contents emerged as significant indicators. In areas where topography was uneven and natural depression created sinks for soil water, relatively higher soil heavy metal concentrations were observed. The vegetation-soil interaction (e.g. root proliferation and phytoextraction potential) has influenced the ability of plants to maintain cover on contaminated sites and thus ecological conditions were modified accordingly. We therefore stress upon considering topographic aspects and native plants of an ecosystem into one continuum system to address the restoration processes on degraded lands.

AB  - In a cultural landscape located in the lowlands of northeast Germany the diversity of fern and flowering plants was recorded, and some biological-ecological characteristics of plant species, for example, time and degree of establishment, adaptation in relation to climatic conditions and to nutrient conditions of sites, were determined. These characteristics were used to describe the current status of the vegetation in relation to land uses and environmental factors. Based on historic records and recent investigations, changes in the naturalness of the vegetation, the loss of diversity of natural vegetation and the impact of human activities on the establishment of indigenous and non-indigenous species, could be detected. Most of the currently endangered plant species are adapted to nutrient-poor sites. Vegetation analysis formed the basis for the selection of those plant species, which may be suitable as indicators of environmental changes. Population sizes and dispersal patterns were mapped precisely according to the local occurrences of the species. As an example, the distribution of the ecological group of plant species favouring oligo-/mesotrophic sites was plotted as a grid map. The maps were used for the evaluation of the vegetation under the present environmental conditions and as a basis for a monitoring program. Changes in the dispersal patterns may allow the notion of effects of specific environmental factors on the vegetation if repeated recordings are performed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We studied captive Balkan Whip Snakes (Hierophis gemonensis) to determine blood biochemical parameters that are useful indicators of physiological status during different periods of the biological cycle, including pre- and posthibernation, hibernation, sexual activity, and normal activity. In addition to classic statistical analyses, six machine-learning methods using 10 times 10-fold cross-validation evaluation were used to determine the best classification model for the blood biochemistry data. Results of the machine-learning models indicated that using three of the blood biochemistry variables simultaneously-urea, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase-is enough to discriminate accurately between different physiological conditions during the biological cycle. This approach clarifies the role and importance of physiological processes, which show diversity of functional characteristics of various biochemical parameters in ecological relation to snakes held under laboratory conditions mimicking natural environmental changes.

AB  - Despite the fact that landscape level processes dominate wetland ecosystem development and sustainability, restoration decisions (including those for compensatory mitigation) are typically made on a project-by-project basis. Watershed planning designed to strategically restore wetlands has the potential to provide dramatic benefits by restoring ecosystem-level processes (functions) that maintain water resource integrity. We developed a GIS-based model to predict the suitability for wetland restoration for all locations in the Cuyahoga River watershed (2107 km(2)), in northeastern Ohio (U.S.A.). The model offers a useful tool to focus and set goals for wetland restoration efforts in a spatially explicit way. A two-phase approach was used: the first is to develop criteria, or environmental indicators, to identify the total population of sites suitable for wetland restoration. Locations are identified where restoration has a high likelihood of success and will be sustainable over the long term. Criteria used include hydric soils, land use, topography, stream order, and a saturation index based on slope and flow accumulation in each grid cell in the model. The second phase "filters" the total population of available sites in order to prioritize them according to their potential to contribute to water resource integrity once restored. We generated three versions of the suitability model depicting restoration potential. All versions rely on the same criteria but vary in how the factors were weighted or the hydrology criterion was calculated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs), such as Nevado de Toluca in central Mexico, have been created to protect forest and aquatic resources. PAs have been established in regions inhabited by rural and indigenous populations, based on political and technical criteria, and through top-down processes. PAs face challenges such as deforestation and biodiversity loss, inadequate management and unsustainable use of natural resources, and often insecurity of water access. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ecological status of streams within the Protected Area Nevado de Toluca, and to explore the relations between local communities and their protected rivers and streams. Stream ecological status was evaluated using physical, chemical and biological indicators, such as macroinvertebrates and algae, whereas local perspectives and relations to streams were explored through the analysis of data from a survey conducted in various communities. The results show that socio-economic diversity and ecological conditions challenge the current generalized conservation policies, even within the same geo-graphic area. People inhabiting the studied communities are in a situation of generalized poverty; in such conditions, survival is the main objective. Degradation of local water bodies is caused by canalization, drainage from domestic use and removal of riparian vegetation. Water use and management are poorly addressed by PAs regulation and activities, while degradation of freshwater water sources in three of the studied communities has compromised water access, positioning water management as a central issue for ecological quality. Development of participatory community-specific protection and management programs for streams are needed, involving local communities, environmental professionals, and the federal government. Despite the current scenario, there is potential for adequate management of water bodies and monitoring of water quality by community people, through easily recognizable biological indicators, such as macroinvertebrates and algae.

AB  - Distinct assemblages of testate amoebae can be correlated to a variety of environmental and climatic parameters. Among these factors, the substrate type, trophic status, dissolved oxygen and water table fluctuations are crucial for the proliferation of testate amoebae. Most of the research on testate amoebae has long been focused on a variety of ecosystems at mid-high latitudes; there is little data from the tropics in comparison. The purpose of this research is to contribute to this insufficient database by documenting testate amoebae in lake associated with Eichhornia crassipes macrophyte affected by annual extreme conditions of desiccation during summers in northern part of India. Fifteen species of testate amoebae belonging to six genera were identified. Centropyxis laevigata are in abundance and are excellent indicators of lake ecosystem stressed by seasonal desiccation and expansion facilitated by excess evapotranspiration from aquatic macrophyte mat over the lake surface. Arcella artocrea, A. vulgaris from the sediment-water interface beneath the Eichhornia mat shows its hydrophilous nature and hence are the markers of permanently wet oligotrophic conditions. Testate amoebae are one of the detrivores that indicate the trophic status of aquatic ecosystem, climate induced ecology and therefore, have potentials for monitoring (paleo) environmental conditions. It is inferred C. laevigata is cosmopolitan and not restricted geographically but may be distinguished by its ecological preferences and the biotope in the high seasonality region.

AB  - A diel biogeochemical study was performed to assess the influence that periods of elevated biological activity have on the biogeochemical cycling of macronutrients and redox-sensitive elements in a natural estuarine environment. High-resolution data (15 min sampling) illustrates periodic extreme variations in dissolved oxygen (DO) in the shallow waters of Azevedo Pond, Elkhorn Slough, California. During periods of low tidal hushing, DO values can range from highly oxic (> 560 mu M O-2: > 250% saturation) during sunny days to suboxic conditions (< 5 mu M) at night. Nutrient cycling and redox-sensitive trace element biogeochemistry were evaluated in response to the extreme daily DO fluctuations. A diel sampling study was conducted over a 26-h period, where O-2 concentrations ranged from 346 mu M to sustained non-detectable levels in the night hours. In concert with the DO fluctuations, diel phosphate cycling was on the order of 4 mu M in response to tidal flushing events and biological assimilation and regeneration. The IO3-/I- redox couple quickly responded to suboxic conditions in the water column by a marked increase in I- concentrations and corresponding depletion of IO3-. The extreme fluctuations of the pc in the water column resulted in diel dissolved Mn2+ variations of nearly 5 mu M, with observed dissolved Mn removal rates on the order of 1 mu M h(-1). The elevated biogeochemical cycling of oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, iodine, manganese, and iron found in this shallow estuarine environment suggest that tidal restrictions and anthropogenic nutrient enrichments can amplify diel variations and potentially hinder the functional and ecological stability of these systems. These data suggest that accurate chemical monitoring of the health of an estuarine ecosystem must account for the diel variability inherent in these highly productive environments.

AB  - The conservation level of rare waterbirds reflects the quality of the regional ecological environment and wetlands, and suitable habitat patches and good environmental conditions are bases to support the activities of rare species in habitats. Establishing these conditions is also an important goal of habitat landscape and functional restoration. However, lack of these conditions limits population protection and habitat restoration of rare species. Based on the random forest (RF) algorithm and threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), this paper performed habitat suitability assessment and environmental variable threshold analysis of rare waterbird species in Yancheng coastal wetlands. The results showed that the suitable area proportion of three waterbird species at different habitat sites was less than 20%. The unsuitable area proportions of red-crowned cranes and oriental storks at the CA habitat site were the highest, reaching 86.73% and 85.17%, respectively. In addition, analysis of the importance of environmental variables showed that the main influencing variables affecting the suitable habitat distribution of the three rare waterbirds were habitat type (T_hab), habitat area (A_hab), vegetation coverage (P_fvc), distance to farmland (D_far), distance to reeds (D_ree), ponds density (Ponds), distance to water surface (D_wat) and distance to main roads or seawalls (D_swa). These variables covered the type, area, coverage and distance indicators. With the exception of D_far, Ponds and D_swa, rare waterbirds had response thresholds to each environmental indicator, and these results supported the restoration of landscape structure and function of each habitat site. This study emphasized the importance of foods, water resources and hidden conditions for habitat selection in rare waterbirds. Finally, we proposed the maintenance and restoration patterns of the landscape structure and function of rare waterbird habitats, which are available for other coastal tidal wetlands.

AB  - Recent management initiatives within Parks Canada have highlighted the need to identify indicators of ecological integrity that are sensitive to local and regional environmental stressors. Within Elk Island National Park, Alberta, intensive year-long herbivory by native ungulates has caused a major shift from native to exotic plant species, particularly within grasslands. Although once historically dominant in the region, plains rough fescue (Festuca hallii [Vasey] Piper) is currently rare within the park, possibly, in part, because of herbivory. To assess the use of this species as an indicator of ungulate herbivory and evaluate its ability to survive within the park's remaining grasslands, fescue plants were experimentally transplanted inside and outside newly established ungulate exclosures at each of four locations during May 1999. Changes in fescue survival and growth were subsequently monitored for two growing seasons. Grazed plants had 15% greater mortality. and were 48% and 50% smaller than their protected counterparts in height and basal area, respectively. Protection from herbivory appeared to have the greatest and least effect on rough fescue growth at sites where utilization was relatively high and low, respectively. These results indicate that although plains rough fescue is capable of short-term survival within Elk Island National Park, it is sensitive to current levels of ungulate herbivory, particularly where local fescue utilization during spring is high. Achieving an increase in fescue or its re-establishment may be contingent on reducing grazing impacts.

AB  - This study aimed to assess spatial and temporal ecosystem health variability of coral reefs in the Tamandare open embayment, located in Northeast Brazil, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, using water and sediment parameters and benthic foraminifera as bioindicators. Sediment samples were collected during the summer and winter of 2005 at the reef base, generally built over beachrock structures. The FORAM index (FI, a foraminiferal functional group, community-based water quality assessment), and the FORAM Stress Index (FSI, which is more related to ecological affinities than to functional groups and assesses sediment or substrata quality) together with geochemical data were interpreted using uni- and multi-variate analysis. This is the first application of FSI outside of Mediterranean waters. The dominance of the Quinqueloculina and Textularia, along with negligible numbers of living specimens, low counts of symbiont-bearing foraminifera (and thus low FI), high turbidity and high phosphorus concentrations confirm the anthropogenic influence of river inputs. All parameters suggest that the water and sediment of the Tamandare embayment are marginal for coral population settlement, although the FSI, which presents higher values at unpolluted ecosystems, suggests more sustainable conditions during summer than winter, as found for FI. The FI indication of marginal environmental health is not in agreement with the FSI and the currently stable coral population found over the underlying beachrock, especially at the established no-take zone where good conditions have been described. The central transect, influenced by the no-take zone, presents the most favorable sedimentary sector for conservation initiatives, as indicated by foraminifera and other variables, preferentially on the summer season due to low river discharge of sediments. Local scientific and community-based coral conservation initiatives have improved ecosystem health. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the bryophytes and lichens used as environmental bioindicators of three Oriented Nature Reserves of the Ionian coast of Sicily (Italy) is presented. For this purpose, ecological and bio-ecological indices (Ellenberg indices, life form, life strategy, human impact, poleotolerance) were considered. Comparing the ecological data, the bryophytes result more tolerant than lichens of shaded condition, moist substrate, conversely, lichens reveal higher resistance to xericity and eutrophication and a preference towards the conditions of photophily. Relating to the bio-ecological parameters, bryophytes and lichens agree in revealing a more marked anthropic disturbance in the ONR Oasi del Simeto, a moderate disturbance in the ONR Fiume Fiumefreddo and even more moderate in the ONR La Timpa, the best preserved Reserve.

AB  - Knowledge of natural variability in aquatic ecosystems is vital for assessing the nature and amplitude of human-induced change, and for predicting future anthropogenic impacts. Distinguishing between naturally and anthropogenically caused variability in lake sediment records can be problematic, however, because both drivers can produce similar ecological effects. Standard sediment-based approaches for reconstructing past environmental changes tend to focus on qualitative and quantitative variations in palaeoenvironmental indicators, with little significance attached to their complete absence. We used multiple variables in radiometrically dated sediment cores collected from two sites in Lough Mask, a lake in western Ireland. Results suggest that the Lough Mask sediment record has been a sensitive recorder of past climate variability, especially changing precipitation, since the middle Holocene. Variations in the presence of aquatic siliceous microfossils and calcareous macrofossils, and changing sediment lithology and geochemistry, indicate a quasi-cyclic response to oscillations in climate conditions that correspond generally with palaeoclimate findings from elsewhere in NW Europe, including other sites in Ireland. We conclude that during much of the middle to late Holocene, prolonged periods of relatively high rainfall in the catchment reduced nutrient inputs to the lake, particularly silica and calcite. Diatom productivity consequently declined, whereas dissolution of frustules was enhanced. During relatively dry climate periods, availability of these nutrients increased, diatom productivity was higher, and dissolution was reduced. Relatively early human impacts are evident in the sediment record beginning ca. 1,000 BP. The results highlight the aquatic and taphonomic effects of complex interactions among past variations in catchment conditions, climate and water chemistry. The complexity of these interactions and their effects, mediated through the characteristics of Lough Mask and its catchment, pose problems for conventional interpretation of palaeolimnological data and their use in computer-based simulations of future changes in stresses on aquatic ecosystems and their consequent impacts.

AB  - Characterizing the response of ecosystems to global climate change requires that multiple aspects of environmental change be considered simultaneously, however, it can be difficult to describe the relative importance of environmental metrics given their collinearity. Here, we present a novel framework for disentangling the complex ecological effects of environmental variability by documenting the emergent properties of eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems across similar to 225 km of the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, representing gradients in temperature, light, sediment properties, and water motion, and evaluate the relative importance of different metrics characterizing these environmental conditions (e.g., means, extremes, variability on different time scales) for eelgrass bioindicators using lasso regression and commonality analysis. We found that eelgrass beds in areas that were warmer, shallower, and had low water motion had lower productivity and resilience relative to beds in deeper, cooler areas that were well flushed, and that higher temperatures lowered eelgrass tolerance to low-light conditions. There was significant variation in the importance of various metrics of temperature, light, and water motion across biological responses, demonstrating that different aspects of environmental change uniquely impact the cellular, physiological, and ecological processes underlying eelgrass productivity and resilience, and contribute synergistically to the observed ecosystem response. In particular, we identified the magnitude of temperature variability over daily and tidal cycles as an important determinant of eelgrass productivity. These results indicate that ecosystem responses are not fully resolved by analyses that only consider changes in mean conditions, and that the removal of collinear variables prior to analyses relating environmental metrics to biological change reduces the potential to detect important environmental effects. The framework we present can help to identify the conditions that promote high ecosystem function and resilience, which is necessary to inform nearshore conservation and management practices under global climate change.

AB  - Using a temporal-dynamic calibrated Ecosim food web model, we assess the effects of future changes on marine resources and ecosystem conditions of the Israeli Mediterranean continental shelf. This region has been intensely invaded by Indo-Pacific species. The region is exposed to extreme environmental conditions, is subjected to high rates of climate change and has experienced intense fishing pressure. We test the impacts of a new set of fishing regulations currently being implemented, a continued increase in sea temperatures following IPCC projections, and a continued increase in alien species biomass. We first investigate the impacts of the stressors separately, and then we combine them to evaluate their cumulative effects. Our results show overall potential future benefits of fishing effort reductions, and detrimental impacts of increasing sea temperature and increasing biomass of alien species. Cumulative scenarios suggest that the beneficial effects of fisheries reduction may be dampened by the impact of increasing sea temperature and alien species when acting together. These results illustrate the importance of including stressors other than fisheries, such as climate change and biological invasions, in an ecosystem-based management approach. These results support the need for reducing local and regional stressors, such as fishing and biological invasions, in order to promote resilience to sea warming.

AB  - Over the last 40 years, a growing number of restoration projects have been implemented to improve the ecological conditions of highly degraded rivers and their floodplains. Despite considerable investment in these projects, information is still limited about the effectiveness and the success of such river restoration measures, mainly due to a lack of standardised and interdisciplinary assessment approaches. During the project 'Wilde Mulde-Restoration of a dynamic riverine landscape in Central Germany', we implemented hydromorphological restoration measures (installation of large wood, removal of rip-rap, reconnection of a former river side-arm) along a lowland river in Central Germany. We carried out intensive scientific monitoring of biodiversity, hydromorphology, ecosystem functions and services, as well as socio-economic aspects. A Before/After-Control/Impact (BACI) design was used to identify the spatial and temporal effects of the restoration measures and to distinguish them from changes caused by background variation. For this, we used a comprehensive set of indicators, including abiotic (flow velocity, diversity of riverbed topography, and flow resistance), biological (ecosystem respiration, macroinvertebrates, fish, carabids, vegetation, and birds) and socio-economic (acceptance and public awareness) indicators as well as the ecosystem service indicator aesthetic quality of the landscape. To meet the inherent challenges of such a large-scale field experiment, like unpredictable environmental conditions, we used an experimental approach that allowed us to demonstrate a measurable success of the implemented restoration measures. The majority of the abiotic and some of the biological and socio-economic indicators at the restored sites approached values of a natural reference site while already deviating from values of a nonnatural reference site two years after restoration. In addition to the applied interdisciplinary approach, multiple scales of field investigations and data analyses are essential as key components for evaluating successful river and floodplain restoration projects.

AB  - The Campeche Sound is the major offshore oil producing area in the Southern Gulf of Mexico (SGoM). To evaluate the impact of oil related activities in the ocean floor sediments, we analyzed the geochemical (major and trace element, organic carbon and hydrocarbon concentrations) and biological (benthic foraminifera) composition of 62 superficial sediment samples, from 13 to 1336 m water depth. Cluster and Factor analysis of all the variables indicate that their distribution patterns are mainly controlled by differences between the ter-rigenous and carbonate platforms in the SGoM. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages were abundant and diverse, and their distribution patterns are mainly determined by water depth and sedimentary environment. However, most of the abundant species are opportunistic and/or low-oxygen tolerant, and many of their tests show oil stains and infillings, characteristic of oil polluted locations, suggesting the environment has been modified by natural seepage or oil-related activities. To determine if these conditions are natural or anthropogenic in origin, pre - industrial settings should be studied. Organic carbon (Corg) content (0.6-2.9%) and total hydrocarbon concentrations (PAHs 1.0-29.5 mu g kg(-1)) were usually higher around the oil platforms area, the natural hydrocarbon seeps ("chapopoteras") area and offshore rivers, but there is no accumulation of oil related trace elements in these areas. However, the comparison with international sediment quality benchmarks indicates that Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations are above the threshold effect level, and also As, Ba and Cu are above the probable effect level benchmarks, which indicate that these element concentrations might be of potential ecological concern. Comprehensive studies involving different proxies, and assessing pre-industrial conditions, must be undertaken before assessing environmental health of marine benthic ecosystems.

AB  - Traditionally overlooked by foresters as unproductive and ecologists as disorganized, naturally regenerating forests in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) are perhaps the least understood forest condition in the region. More recently, concerns over the rarity of this forest condition have sparked interest in identifying ecological characteristics unique to forested sites after a canopy-opening disturbance and before the re-establishment of a closed conifer canopy. Here we review the literature to identify the plant and animal associates of early-seral pre-forests in the PNW in order to provide baseline information pertaining to the recognition and conservation role of early-seral pre-forest ecosystems. We describe a number of bird, mammal, insect, amphibian and reptile species associated with PNW early-seral pre-forests either by empirical observation or inferred through life-history characteristics in an attempt to formally identify unique species indicators of naturally regenerating pre-forest communities. For Washington, Oregon, and northern California, we also review the state lists of endangered, threatened, monitored or otherwise conservation-listed species (664 unique species or subspecies for the combined region) to assess the proportion of protected species that rely on the structural attributes of early-seral pre-forests. Here, we found that these proportions are comparable to the proportions reliant on mature or late-seral forest. In addition, greater than 50% of all listed species for each of the three regions were partial or facultative users of early-seral pre-forest ecosystems. This assessment suggests that naturally structured early-seral pre-forests in the PNW provide key habitat for many species, including obligates and near-obligates, and that future research should seek to refine our understanding of the specific structural and compositional attributes that form the basis of these associations.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach has gained broad interest in regulatory and policy circles for use in ecological risk assessment. Whilst identifying several challenges, scientific experts from European regulatory authorities, the chemical industry and academia considered the approach applicable to all chemical sectors and potentially contributing to greater ecological relevance for setting and assessing environmental protection goals compared to current European regulatory frameworks for chemicals. These challenges were addressed in workshops to develop a common understanding across stakeholders on how the ecosystem services concept might be used in chemical risk assessment and what would need to be done to implement it. This paper describes the consensus outcome of those discussions. Knowledge gaps and research needs were identified and prioritised, exploring the use of novel approaches from ecology, ecotoxicology and ecological modelling. Where applicable, distinction is made between prospective and retrospective ecological risk assessment. For prospective risk assessment the development of environmental scenarios accounting for chemical exposure and ecological conditions was designated as a top priority. For retrospective risk assessment the top priority research need was development of reference conditions for key ecosystem services and guidance for their derivation. Both prospective and retrospective risk assessment would benefit from guidance on the taxa and measurement endpoints relevant to specific ecosystem services and from improved understanding of the relationships between measurement endpoints from standard toxicity tests and the ecosystem services of interest (i.e. assessment endpoints). The development of mechanistic models, which could serve as ecological production functions, was identified as a priority. A conceptual framework for future chemical risk assessment based on an ecosystem services approach is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metals and metalloids are persistent pollutants that are distributed in abiotic and biotic reservoirs. In the ecosystems, these elements can proceed from natural and/or anthropogenic activities. Nevertheless, it has been documented that human activities generate the enrichment of these elements in the different reservoirs. Metals and metalloid may exhibit different degrees of toxicity in organisms depending on certain physicochemical conditions and biological factors. The accumulation and transfer of metals in different reservoirs can have adverse impact on ecosystems under certain conditions, and thus it is necessary to know the metals and metalloids impact extent. An appropriate tool to determine the degree of impact caused by metals and metalloids to the environment is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which through a series of steps, identify and weigh up environmental impacts.

AB  - Human societies rely on water to fulfill multiple needs. Paradoxically, our dependency on water has brought fundamental changes to freshwater ecosystems that may manifest as abrupt transitions in water quantity and quality indicators associated with conditions that can no longer fulfill human needs. Of particular concern amidst a time of environmental changes are tropical streams and their linked riparian zones, particularly in islands, given their role in the provisioning of water-derived ecosystem services. Focusing on a watershed that has become a key player in the water economy of Puerto Rico we investigated the spatiotemporal variation of water quality and socio-economic indicators, including links between them. The analyses of two unique datasets showed that 1) water quality indicators exhibited three distinctive behaviors, 2) in a small number of stations biological and chemical variables tended to decrease over time, 3) socio-economic indicators were spatially discontinuous, and 4) water quality and socio-economic indicators were related in counter-intuitive ways yet scale became a critical factor revealing the nature of the relationships. Our results raise questions about the causes underlying the observed variability in water quality and socio-economic conditions, the resilience of tropical watersheds, and ultimately the sustainable delivery of water-derived ecosystem services.

AB  - The increasing impairment of lotic ecosystems has promoted a growing effort into assessing their ecological status by means of biological indicators. Community-based approaches are a valuable way of assessing ecosystem changes, but reflect local extirpation and long-term changes and might not be suitable for tracking and monitoring short-term and sub-lethal events. Responses to rapid changes in environmental conditions have been rarely studied under natural conditions. Here we used a field experiment to test how the synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and haemoglobin (Hb) in laboratory-reared larvae of Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Chironomidae) were influenced by short-term changes to water temperature and oxygen concentration in a lowland stream. Our aim was to determine whether HSP70 mRNA expression and Hb content could be used as an in situ "early warning system" for freshwater habitats undergoing environmental change. HSP70 exhibited a clear response to changes in temperature measured over a one-day period, confirming its suitability as an indicator of environmental stress. Hb concentration was related to oxygen concentration, but not to temperature. Our findings support the hypothesis that depletion in oxygen induces Hb synthesis in C. riparius larvae. Because tolerance to low oxygen is not only related to total Hb, but also to a more efficient uptake (binding to Hb, e.g. Bohr effect) and release of oxygen to the cell (Root effect), we cannot discern from our data whether increased efficiency played a role. We suggest that C. riparius is a suitable model organism for monitoring sub-lethal stress in the field and that the approach could be applied to other species as more genomic data are available for non model organisms.

AB  - Conservation of communities of wildlife may conflict with forestry due to the impacts of habitat alteration to wildlife and desire by the public for economic development. Identification of thresholds to disturbance and habitat conditions may improve our ability to find compromises between conservation and resource development, while also identifying sensitive indicators. We used the multivariate Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to assess the response of a wildlife community to disturbance from forest harvest, roads, and forest habitat affected by forest management. Significant thresholds were evident among birds, amphibians and mammals, and patterns in positive and negative responses appeared to vary in relation to life history adaptations. Birds typically had the strongest relationships to environmental gradients and provided good representation of a range of forest conditions useful in assessing sustainability in forestry. We found that negative indicator responses to forest habitat gradients were often more precise and synchronous among species than positive responses, potentially affected by the diversity of habitat niche space among species. Stronger responses among a greater range of species were evident for resource-providing habitat conditions than direct measures of disturbance (i.e. forest cuts and roads). Our approach demonstrates the value of identifying ecological community thresholds that can serve to set targets for conserving biodiversity and to characterize community dynamics in response to habitat change mediated by natural resource management.

AB  - We present regression models for estimating the status of fish and aquatic invertebrate communities in all second to fourth-order streams (1: 100 000 scale; total stream length = 6476 km) throughout the Willamette River Basin, Oregon (USA). The models project fish and invertebrate status as a function of physiographic, land-use/land-cover, and stream flow variables, with the latter two sets of variables subject to change under historical and alternative future scenarios of human development. Models are developed using sample data collected between 1993 and 1997 from 149 wadeable streams in the basin. Model uncertainties are propagated through model projections and into aggregated estimates of regional status. The projections show no significant change in basin-wide status in year 2050, relative to Circa 1990, for scenarios either of increased human development or continuation of current development trends, because landscape change under these scenarios is dominated by conversion of agricultural land to rural residential and urban uses, and because these changes affect only a small percentage of the basin. However, under a scenario of increased conservation, regional medians of biotic status indicators are projected to improve by 9-24% by year 2050. None of the changes projected between Circa 1990 and year 2050 is as large in magnitude as the decline in status projected to have occurred between the time of pre-European settlement and Circa 1990.

AB  - In Canada, the Minister of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has the federal authority to develop a national approach on marine environmental quality (MEQ). The minister is given this authority by federal legislation entitled the Oceans Act. The department recently published an integrated management framework document under the Oceans Act that situates MEQ within the context of ecosystem-based management. That approach is described here, with suggestions for future options. The history of federal interdepartmental cooperation in developing MEQ concepts is chronicled.

AB  - Background Betulin, a natural pentacyclic triterpene with the lupane structure that is present in significant amounts in the outer bark of birch, is known for its broad array of biological and pharmacological properties. Betulin has attracted attention as a potential, natural-origin antimicrobial substance. The literature describes it as selectively toxic to neoplastic cells but safe for normal cells. The research aim was to evaluate the basal cytotoxicity of betulin towards fish (BF-2) and murine (NIH/3T3) fibroblasts. We used four colorimetric tests that provide a preliminary evaluation of possible mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of a compound to assess the degree of the toxicity of betulin after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation with cells: the MTT assay (mitochondrial activity assessment), the NRU assay (lysosomal membrane integrity assessment), the LDH assay (cellular membrane integrity assessment) and the SRB assay (total cellular protein content determination). Results The results revealed an exceptionally high sensitivity of mitochondria to the effect of betulin, with the other endpoints being less sensitive. Although murine fibroblasts were more vulnerable to the toxic effect of betulin than fish fibroblasts, the betulin CC50 values for both cell lines were comparable with analogous IC50 values determined by other researchers in studies involving cancerous cells. Conclusions The results indicate the need to verify the claim about the selective toxicity of betulin towards malignant cells and to conduct safety/toxicity tests before any potential therapeutic use of betulin in veterinary medicine.

AB  - Effects of anthropogenic stream degradation on fish assemblages in coastal plain streams of Maryland were investigated by using data from 1989-1993. Fish assemblages, stream physical habitat, and water quality were assessed concurrently at 69 sites. Through the use of habitat and water quality information, two groups were selected from the data set to represent least-impacted streams (N = 16) and most-impacted streams (N = 22). Impacts ranged from agricultural activities involving channelization and riparian destruction to altered hydrologic regime and channel modification related to urban development. Differences in fish assemblages between the two groups indicated that the degraded streams were less diverse and were dominated by a few tolerant taxa, whereas higher-quality sites were characterized by a more balanced assemblage structure and trophic composition, as well as by higher indigenous cyprinid richness and abundance. Various metrics, based on assemblage structure and function under a guild approach, were tested for differences between the high- and low-quality stream groups. The metrics that exhibited the greatest discrimination between groups reflected greater diversity and abundance, a balanced trophic structure, and lower abundance of species considered tolerant to environmental degradation. The most effective metrics included the number of intolerant species present, the number of shiner species, the proportion of silt-intolerant spawners in the assemblage, the proportion of tolerant fishes, and the proportion of insectivorous cyprinids. The metrics that demonstrated ability to discriminate high- and low-quality streams are proposed for development into biological indicators for this region.

AB  - Background. Guanylurea is the main transformation product of the antidiabetic drug metformin, which is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals worldwide. Due to the high rate of microbial degradation of metformin in sewage treatment plants, guanylurea occurs in higher concentrations in surface waters than its parent compound and could therefore affect aquatic wildlife. In this context, data for fish are scarce up to now which made us investigate the health of brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) in response to guanylurea.
   Methods. In two experiments, eggs plus developing larvae and juvenile brown trout were exposed to three different concentrations of guanylurea (10, 100 and 1,000 m g/L) and, as a negative control, filtered tap water without this compound. Low internal concentrations were determined. The investigated parameters were mortality, length, weight, condition factor, tissue integrity of the liver and kidney, levels of stress proteins and lipid peroxides, as well as behavioural and developmental endpoints. It was found that guanylurea did not significantly change any of these parameters in the tested concentration range.
   Results. In conclusion, these results do not give rise to concern that guanylurea could negatively affect the health or the development of brown trout under field conditions. Nevertheless, more studies focusing on further parameters and other species are highly needed for a more profound environmental risk assessment of guanylurea.

AB  - Rivers and related freshwater ecosystems are facing increasing natural disturbance and anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the key ecological processes that govern the riverine biota in aquatic ecosystems under multiple pressures has crucial importance. However, there is still insufficient knowledge in quantifying of stressors interactions. Moreover, the understanding of the responses of riverine phytoplankton to multiple stressors is still scarce from catchment aspect. As an interdisciplinary study, the catchment hydrological processes were linked to ecological responses in this study, and we chose phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs) instead of taxonomic classifications of algae to examine their responses to land-use pattern (L), hydrological regime (H), and physicochemical condition (P) across two contrasting hydrological periods (dry, wet). The traits-based phytoplankton functional groups are highly suggested as robust bio-indicators for better understanding the current ecological status. The hydrological regime was described by a matrix indices of hydrological alteration based on the outputs of a well-established ecohydrological model (SWAT). The results from variation partitioning analysis showed that P and H dominate during the dry period and P in high flows. Structural equation models (SEM) showed that the skewness of 7 days discharge emerged as a key driver of H, and had always an indirect effect on functional group TB (benthic diatoms) during both hydrological periods. The functional group M (mainly composed by Microcystis) has directly related to phosphorous in both periods, while indirectly to L of urban area in high flow period, and water bodies in low flow period. This study emphasized that climate change and anthropogenic activities such as altering flow regime and land-use pattern affect directly or indirectly riverine phytoplankton via physicochemical conditions. In addition, our findings highlighted that biomonitoring activities require detailed investigation in different hydrological periods. SEM is recommended for improved understanding of phytoplankton responses to the changing environment, and for future studies to fulfill the increasing demand for sustainable watershed management regarding aquatic biota.

AB  - We have conducted experiments quantitatively investigating electroporative uptake kinetics of a fluorescent plasma membrane integrity indicator, propidium iodide (PI), in HL60 human leukemia cells resulting from exposure to 40 us pulsed electric fields (PEFs). These experiments were possible through the use of calibrated, real-time fluorescence microscopy and the development of a microcuvette: a specialized device designed for exposing cell cultures to intense PEFs while carrying out real-time microscopy. A finite-element electrostatic simulation was carried out to assess the degree of electric field heterogeneity between the microcuvette's electrodes allowing us to correlate trends in electroporative response to electric field distribution. Analysis of experimental data identified two distinctive electroporative uptake signatures: one characterized by low-level, decelerating uptake beginning immediately after PEF exposure and the other by high-level, accelerating fluorescence that is manifested sometimes hundreds of seconds after PEF exposure. The qualitative nature of these fluorescence signatures was used to isolate the conditions required to induce exclusively transient electroporation and to discuss electropore stability and persistence. A range of electric field strengths resulting in transient electroporation was identified for HL60s under our experimental conditions existing between 1.6 and 2 kV/cm. Quantitative analysis was used to determine that HL60s experiencing transient electroporation internalized between 50 and 125 million nucleic acid-bound PI molecules per cell. Finally, we show that electric field heterogeneity may be used to elicit asymmetric electroporative PI uptake within cell cultures and within individual cells.

AB  - Soil fertility and associated nitrogen (N) status was a key ecosystem attribute, and surveys of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities via epigeous fruiting bodies could provide an effective biotic indicator of forest soil productivity. We explored the utility of aboveground EMF communities in this regard by surveying sporocarps over a 3-year period from contrasting plant associations of southern old-growth boreal forests of British Columbia (Canada). Cumulative richness ranged from 39 to 89 EMF species per plot (0.15 ha) and followed a skewed parabolic correlation with foliar N concentrations and soil N availability. EMF species composition was consistently distinct in ordinations and strongly correlated to the increasing rates of N mineralization aligned with soil productivity. Approximately 40 EMF species were specialists, as they collectively indicated oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic nutrient regimes, while the remaining species were categorized as broadly tolerant (distributed over 100% of the N gradient), partially intolerant (approximately 70%), or satellites (rare). The functional organization of EMF communities reflected by distribution classes could help define the ecological integrity of forests, which was characterized in this boreal landscape by an average allotment of 20 broadly tolerant, 25 partially intolerant, 15 specialist, and ten satellite species per plot. Epigeous fruiting bodies provided a disparate yet complementary view to the belowground assessment of EMF communities that was valuable in identifying indicators for ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - Biotic integrity assessment of a stream subject to acid mine drainage (AMD) indicated that a number of the expected taxa were absent. Acute and chronic toxicity assessment of water sampled in a stream subject to AMD impact indicate that even at near neutral pH the metal concentration in the water dominates the toxicity toward Daphnia pulex. Extending the observation period to the death of test cohort in an otherwise standard sub-chronic toxicity test, allowed for generating a life table for the D. pulex. The probability of population extinction was estimated from the statistical characteristics of a bootstrap estimation of the dominant eigenvalue of a Leslie matrix based on the life table. At the current concentration levels of metals, notably manganese and zinc, in the water, a high risk to aquatic life exists. It is suggested that the metal content of the stream water also be addressed in an AMD water treatment plan. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

AB  - The complex and dynamic nature of transitional ecosystems pose problems for the assessment of the Ecological Quality Status required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC). In six Adriatic lagoons, Ecological Quality Status was studied by comparing a biotic index based on macrophytes (MaQI), and three indices based on invertebrates (M-AMBI, M-bAMBI, and ISD). Ecological Status evaluated though MaQI and ISD resulted in quite degraded ecosystems (moderate/poor/bad), with only opportunistic algae and macrobenthic communities dominated by small size classes. Those results were supported by physico-chemical parameters, indicating high nutrients inputs, and anthropogenic pressures related with agriculture and fishery activities. Ecological Status obtained with M-AMBI and M-bAMBI was higher, with some sites reaching even the "good" status. The best response to anthropogenic pressures, in terms of a pressure index, was obtained by M-AMBI and M-bAMBI. Nevertheless, the response of used metrics (such as AMBI and bAMBI) to environmental variables not related to anthropogenic impact, and the high heterogeneity of physical-chemical conditions within lagoons, represent potential problems for the correct evaluation of Ecological Status of transitional waters. When different metrics give different responses it becomes a problem for managers who cannot easily make a decision on the remedial measures. The disagreement among indices arose because of the different response of biological elements to different stressors, and because the different indices based on macroinvertebrates focused on different aspects of the community, providing complementary information. So urge the need to find alternative approaches for a correct assessment of Ecological Status, with the combination of different biological elements, and considering the development of new indices (e.g. M-bAMBI) or refinement of the existing ones.

AB  - Ecological quality assessment of non-natural water bodies is, in contrast to natural systems, less developed and requires determining biological indicators that reliably reflect environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressures. This study was motivated to propose fish indicators appropriate for assessment of reservoir ecosystems in central Europe. We analysed changes in water quality, total biomass and the taxonomic, trophic and size composition of fish communities along the longitudinal axes of four elongated, deep-valley reservoirs. Due to high nutrient inputs from their catchments, the reservoirs exhibited pronounced within-system gradients in primary productivity and water transparency. Although fish communities were similar among the reservoirs and dominated by few native species, the community structure and biomass systematically changed along the longitudinal axes of the reservoirs. The biomass and proportion of planktivores/benthivores in the fish community were highest at eutrophic sites near the river inflow and declined substantially towards deep, more oligotrophic sites close to the dam. The biomass and proportion of piscivores significantly increased downstream within the reservoirs alongside improving water quality. At species level, perch Percafluviatilis and bream Abramis brama responded most sensitively, although in opposite directions, to the longitudinal environmental gradient. The major longitudinal changes in fish community characteristics were found to be consistent between pelagic and benthic habitats. The results of this study suggest that fish communities are appropriate indicators of eutrophication and can be used for ecological quality assessment of non-natural lentic water bodies, such as reservoirs. Moreover, our results underline the necessity to consider within-system gradients in water quality and the fish community when planning sampling programmes for deep-valley reservoirs.

AB  - Anthropogenic and natural disturbances can cause degradation of ecosystems, reducing their capacity to sustain biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Understanding the extent of ecosystem degradation is critical for estimating risks to ecosystems, yet there are few existing methods to map degradation at the ecosystem scale and none using freely available satellite data for mangrove ecosystems. In this study, we developed a quantitative classification model of mangrove ecosystem degradation using freely available earth observation data. Crucially, a conceptual model of mangrove ecosystem degradation was established to identify suitable remote sensing variables that support the quantitative classification model, bridging the gap between satellite-derived variables and ecosystem degradation with explicit ecological links. We applied our degradation model to two case-studies, the mangroves of Rakhine State, Myanmar, which are severely threatened by anthropogenic disturbances, and Shark River within the Everglades National Park, USA, which is periodically disturbed by severe tropical storms. Our model suggested that 40% (597 km(2)) of the extent of mangroves in Rakhine showed evidence of degradation. In the Everglades, the model suggested that the extent of degraded mangrove forest increased from 5.1% to 97.4% following the Category 4 Hurricane Irma in 2017. Quantitative accuracy assessments indicated the model achieved overall accuracies of 77.6% and 79.1% for the Rakhine and the Everglades, respectively. We highlight that using an ecological conceptual model as the basis for building quantitative classification models to estimate the extent of ecosystem degradation ensures the ecological relevance of the classification models. Our developed method enables researchers to move beyond only mapping ecosystem distribution to condition and degradation as well. These results can help support ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting, and restoration planning and provide quantitative estimates of ecosystem degradation for new global biodiversity targets.

AB  - Past studies have argued that macroalgae serve as useful bioindicators that herald possible environmental changes to reef ecosystems because they are often opportunistic, having high growth rates and responding quickly to environmental changes, such as increased nutrient availability, grazing pressures, or storm activity. In this study, we test their usefulness as reef monitoring management indicators. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the relative abundance of macroalgae (RAM) at the genus level in the Mariana Archipelago between two surveys in 2003 and 2005. Islands vary drastically across the archipelago (carbonate vs volcanic, populated vs unpopulated, small vs large) and often experience considerable storm activity. We showed that the diversity of macroalgal genera was generally highest at the southern end of the archipelago, probably because of increased habitat heterogeneity around these geographically larger islands. At the northern end of the archipelago, only Pagan and Mang were large enough or contained enough environmental diversity to exhibit macroalgal diversity similar to that of the southern carbonate islands. Despite the ubiquitous nature of turf algae, crustose coralline red algae, and the green alga Halimeda (Bryopsidales) across the archipelago, multivariate analyses revealed RAM to differ among islands with northern, unpopulated, volcanic islands grouping together and differing from southern, populated, carbonate islands. Also, RAM showed significant variability at the local scale (among sites within an island) and over time. We hypothesize that this variability results principally from differing oceanographic conditions such as sea surface temperature, human impacts such as fishing and pollution, typhoons, and volcanic activity across the archipelago. These results provide a baseline for future monitoring studies in the Mariana Archipelago and suggest that rapid ecological assessments of macroalgae in the field at the genus level are a reliable indicator that can be used to monitor change over time.

AB  - Diversity, sporulation rates, and biomass of aquatic hyphomycetes (Kingdom Fungi) on leaf litter were examined to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment and flow regulation on the ecological integrity of the Saint John River, New Brunswick, Canada. Leaf decomposition rate was used as an indicator of ecological function, whereas fungal abundance and diversity were chosen as structural indicators. Leaf-litter bags of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) were deployed at 8 sites, periodically retrieved, and analyzed during 2 consecutive years in unregulated and regulated reaches. The interaction between nutrient enrichment and flow regulation regime significantly affected leaf decomposition rate and fungal sporulation during summer and autumn and fungal diversity during autumn. Flow regulation regime was the primary driver for fungal diversity during summer. In contrast, nutrient enrichment significantly affected fungal biomass. In general, this large 7(th)-order river responded to flow regulation and nutrient enrichment in the same manner as smaller rivers. Both factors increased decomposition rates, but only nutrient enrichment increased fungal biomass, diversity, and sporulation. Within the regulated reach, leaves in constantly covered litter bags had faster decomposition rates and more aquatic hyphomycete species, spore release, and biomass than in intermittently covered litter bags. Nutrient enrichment, flow regulation, and their interactions decreased ecosystem integrity by altering diversity and biomass of aquatic hyphomycetes and their function in the Saint John River.

AB  - Small pelagic fish are key planktivores and prey in marine ecosystems, and their population abundances undergo strong temporal and spatial variability. Top-down (predator controlled) and bottom-up (prey-driven) processes during early life history are important for determining forage fish survival and recruitment. We examined biological and environmental factors hypothesized to influence age-0 Pacific herring Clupea pallasi in the Strait of Georgia (SOG), British Columbia, Canada. Primarily bottom-up processes affected interannual variability in age-0 herring abundance and condition, with some evidence of top-down effects on condition. Age-0 herring abundance increased with increasing adult spawning biomass and peaked when most adults spawned about 20 d prior to the peak spring primary production bloom. This timeline would temporally align first-feeding herring larvae with their prey, such as small copepods. Age-0 herring abundance also increased with increasing juvenile salmon abundance, indicating that conditions favourable for herring were also favourable for their predators and competitors. Age-0 herring condition decreased with increasing spawning biomass, increased when most adults spawned closer to the peak spring bloom, increased with increasing temperatures above 8.2 degrees C, and increased then stabilized with increasing prey zooplankton density. Age-0 herring condition had a dome-shaped relationship with predator abundance, indicating that high predator abundances negatively affected fish condition. Study results suggest that density-dependent processes, such as intraspecific competition, may be important in the SOG. A positive correlation between age-0 herring abundance and subsequent age-3 recruit abundance may provide a leading indicator of low recruitment years.

AB  - Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 calls EU Member States to map and assess ecosystem conditions and services. In line with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the Reports of the Working Group on Mapping and Assessment on Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Bulgaria developed a National Methodological Framework and Methodology for grassland assessment and mapping. We used this methodology to broadly assess the ecosystem condition of semi-natural grass-lands that are located outside the Natura 2000 network in Bulgaria. Given the important role of vegetation in natural ecosystems, we focused on five indicators of ecosystem structure and processes: plant species richness, vegetation cover, number of red list plant species and invasive alien plants and plant biomass. The assessment of these indicators was applied to polygons that represent distinct grassland ecosystems. Polygons were mapped using aerophoto images with a minimum mapping unit of 0.25 ha. Whenever possible, we matched polygons to vegetation data, extracted from phytosociological databases. Additional field sampling was conducted in 2016. We filled data gaps for polygons through geospatial and statistical modelling. A total of 123,152 grassland polygons (sum of area: 634,518.23 ha), representing dry, mesic, wet and seasonally wet, alpine and subalpine grasslands and inland salt steppes were mapped and assessed. Our results show that 32% of the grassland polygons outside Natura 2000 were in 'very good' condition regarding 'plant species richness', with another 49% being in 'good' condition. Polygons with 'bad' and 'very bad' scores were located in close proximity to large agricultural systems and heavily populated areas. Alpine and subalpine grasslands and inland salt steppes were usually in 'good' and 'very good' condition mostly due to a low degree of agricultural use. Wet and seasonally wet grasslands might be the most fragile of the assessed grassland ecosystems; 10% of their polygons were found to be in 'bad' condition regarding 'plant species richness'. Biomass analysis revealed that more than 75% of the assessed polygons were in 'good' and 'very good' condition, which indicates high fodder value for grazing animals. We conclude that grasslands outside the Natura 2000 network represent good examples of semi-natural ecosystems. These areas are still in relatively 'good' condition and have the capacity to provide valuable ecosystem services. Our results could serve as a solid foundation for regional planning and policy development.

AB  - As a developing and archipelago country, Indonesia is expected to assess its coastal ecosystem services to unleash Indonesia's coastal potential and to drive Indonesia's economic development. With this line of reasoning, it is indeed to apply the concept of Ecosystem Services (ES) and its condition to measure how much natural potential we have in coastal ecosystems. However, there has been no comprehensive framework on how ES and its condition are holistically conducted. For that purpose, we pioneered integrated research to assess the spatial distribution of the ES (coastal protection and recreation) across districts of East Nusa Tenggara province and its condition toward habitat by applying integrated InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) models. InVEST model would acknowledge the potential ES that is available in the coastal ecosystem and its condition. Additionally, we also suggest the form of coastal management policy in East Nusa Tenggara that needs to be applied based on the available ES data. Our result indicated that West Manggarai and Southwest Sumba have the highest and lowest ES for coastal protection and tourism services. The HRA models showed that the condition of the coastal ecosystem in West Manggarai is at moderate risk; however, most of the seagrass is at high risk. The results suggested that conservation areas in West Manggarai intensified the existing ES provided there, whereas it also brings pressures to habitat conditions. Therefore, there is indeed to achieve an ideal coastal management practice in East Nusa Tenggara. It is also needed to consider ecological, social and economic aspects and involve all government levels to establish synergistic and inclusive policies. Simultaneously, it is also notable in paying attention to each area's carrying capacity that can affect ecological functions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A central aspect of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC addressed to Member Countries is to proceed to type-specific ecological assessment and classification by establishing typology systems. Sixty-four permanent stream sites distributed throughout mainland Greece and islands were assessed with macroinvertebrate indicators to evaluate their ecological quality. Local and catchment scale parameters were determined and recorded to obtain an integrated assessment of the main factors affecting stream integrity and macroinvertebrate communities. Twenty-three sites were classified as reference or good status in terms of biological, chemical and hydromorphological quality with the use of various metrics. Multivariate statistical techniques were performed (MDS, BIOENV, correlation analysis and PCA) to investigate the main environmental factors structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities and to select candidate environmental variables for establishing a biotic typology for Hellenic rivers. The results revealed relatively distinct macroinvertebrate communities within defined abiotic zones of the country. Assemblages of macroinvertebrate fauna were most strongly associated to differences in geographical position, altitude, slope, catchment area, current velocity, conductivity and water temperature. In view of the lack of sufficient data at the country level on the three last variables and after considering cause-effect relationships between large scale variables and the latter, it has been demonstrated that a number of catchment scale variables could be used as robust surrogates.

AB  - This paper discusses projections of emerging geographic areas of concern with regard to forest and rangeland condition, as indicated by a model based on a set of independent econometric production functions tor condition indicators at the national scale. These production functions reflect two special characteristics: (1) the independence of ecological systems from human control, and (2) the broad scale spatial nature of environmental and ecological processes. The emphasis in this paper is the model projections themselves, which are presented and discussed using national-scale maps.

AB  - River health monitoring traditionally has made use of structural measurements (water quality or taxonomic composition of aquatic organisms). We argue that a more complete assessment of river health should include functional metrics, such as rates of organic matter decomposition and ecosystem metabolism. Leaf breakdown links the characteristics of riparian vegetation with the activity of both aquatic invertebrates and microbial organisms and is affected by natural and human-induced variation in a wide range of environmental factors. Measurement of leaf breakdown is relatively simple and has modest equipment requirements. River metabolism (gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration) measures the rates of production and use of organic C in river ecosystems as a whole, providing a direct estimate of the food base that determines life-supporting capacity. Metabolism measurements require more sophisticated equipment than do measurements of leaf breakdown, but improvements in technology have made metabolism measurements relatively easy. We review the factors that influence leaf breakdown and river metabolism and pay particular attention to the effects of human-induced environmental stressors. We also describe how measurements can be standardized and suggest criteria for interpreting functional measures in terms of river ecosystem health. Last, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of both methods as functional measures and provide recommendations for their use as biomonitoring tools.

AB  - The condition of coral reefs in the Cuban Archipelago is poorly known. We aimed to analyse coral assemblages across 199 reef sites belonging to 12 localities. Crest and fore reefs were assessed using six metrics: species richness, density, coral cover, mortality, coral size and reef complexity. The condition of reefs varied across the archipelago from healthy to depleted reefs. The localities with best scores were Cienfuegos, Bahia de Cochinos and Cazones. These reefs have values of living coral cover (>20%) and complexity (>50cm) similar to the best preserved Caribbean reefs. However, the majority of crest biotopes suffered important deterioration with old mortality of Acropora palmata populations and moderate coral cover (15%); although crest reefs still maintained their structural complexity. Despite moderate levels of coral cover in fore reefs (18%), their condition was alarming because 25% of the sites had cover below the recovery threshold of 10%, accumulated mortality and structural flattening. Compared with the 1980s, the species richness was roughly the same (42) for crest and fore reefs, although dominance has changed to widespread tolerant species. Coral reef assemblages varied at local and regional scales in similar magnitude, suggesting the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers.

AB  - Cost-effective, ecologically relevant, sensitive, and standardized indicators are requisites of biomonitoring. DNA metabarcoding of macroinvertebrate communities is a potentially transformative biomonitoring technique that can reduce cost and time constraints while providing information-rich, high resolution taxonomic data for the assessment of watershed condition. Here, we assess the utility of DNA metabarcoding to provide aquatic indicator data for evaluation of forested watershed condition across Canadian eastern boreal watersheds, subject to natural variation and low-intensity harvest management. We do this by comparing the similarity of DNA metabarcoding and morphologically derived macroinvertebrate metrics (i.e. richness, % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, % chironomid), and the ability of DNA metabarcoding and morphological metrics to detect key gradients in stream condition linked to forested watershed features. Our results show consistency between methods, where common DNA metabarcoding and morphological macroinvertebrate metrics are positively correlated and indicate the same key gradients in stream condition (i.e. dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and conductivity) linked to watershed size and shifts in forest composition across watersheds. Our study demonstrates the potential usefulness of macroinvertebrate DNA metabarcoding to future application in broad-scale biomonitoring of watershed condition across environmental gradients.

AB  - In the context of widespread ecological changes, land managers and policymakers confront the need to prioritize ecosystem restoration and fuel management activities across large areas to sustain ecosystem services. Reference conditions inform prioritization efforts by providing a baseline from which to measure where and how vegetation and fuels have changed, but until recently the USA lacked a complete set of reference conditions. We describe the ongoing development of a comprehensive set of vegetation reference conditions based on over 900 quantitative vegetation dynamic models and accompanying description documents for terrestrial ecosystems in the USA. These models and description documents, collaboratively developed by more than 800 experts around the country through the interagency LANDFIRE Program, synthesize fundamental ecological information about ecosystem dynamics, structure, composition, and disturbance regimes before European-American settlement. These products establish the first comprehensive national baseline for measuring vegetation change in the USA, providing land managers and policymakers with a tool to support vegetation restoration and fuel management activities at regional to national scales. Users have applied these products to support a variety of land management needs including exploring ecosystem dynamics, assessing current and desired conditions, and simulating the effects of management actions. In an era of rapid ecological change, these products provide land managers with an adaptable tool for understanding ecosystems and predicting possible future conditions.

AB  - As part of an environmental monitoring and assessment effort, we developed a conceptual model for measuring and assessing the condition and sustainability of agroecosystems. An agroecosystem is a field, pasture, or orchard and the associated border areas. We focused on ecological sustainability and defined the goals for agroecosystems in terms of the values people place on them. The purpose of an agroecosystem is to produce food and fiber. Other desired outcomes can be considered as goals for the larger landscape and the rest of the world, and they sometimes function as constraints on production. Condition is defined by agroecosystem productivity and the degree to which farmers use management and stewardship practices that conserve and protect valued natural resources in the landscape and the rest of the world. An agoecosystem in good condition is productive and is managed to conserve valued resources. Sustainability is the maintenance of good condition over time. We developed indicators that link system condition and sustainability to societal values and goals. These indicators measure productivity, management practices that promote sustainability at the agroecosystem scale, and management practices that promote sustainability at landscape and global scales. Our initial efforts focused on annually harvested herbaceous crops; however, the concepts we used can be adapted to other plant and livestock systems. Our conceptual approach may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of several major programs now being implemented, including the USDA's Environmental Quality Incentive and Conservation Reserve Programs.

AB  - The lakes across China's middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River system have a long history of sustaining human pressures. These aquatic resources have been exploited for fisheries and irrigation over millennia at a magnitude of scales, with the result that many lakes have lost their ecological integrity. The consequences of these changes in the ecosystem health of lakes are not fully understood; therefore, a long-term investigation is urgently needed. Gastropods (aquatic snails) are powerful bio-indicators that link primary producers, herbivores, and detritivores associated with macrophytes and grazers of periphyton and higher-level consumers. They are sensitive to abrupt environmental change such as eutrophication, dehydration, flooding, and proliferation of toxicity in floodplain lake systems. The use of the remains of gastropod shells (subfossils) preserved in the sedimentary archives of the floodplain lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River system holds high significance, as their potential in environmental change has not been studied in detail in the past. Here, we aim to test the hypothesis that modern and sub-fossil gastropods in the sediments of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River floodplains systems have significant value as bioindicators, as they have the ability to reveal health-gradients of lake-ecosystem change in the region.

AB  - Arc welds and their heat affected zones are heterogeneous due to the nature of the involved welding process. Nevertheless, the complexity of weld integrity assessments is often reduced by assuming homogeneous properties for weld metal and for heat affected zone metal. To evaluate this simplification, the authors aim to examine the effect of weld metal heterogeneity on the structural integrity of welded connections. As a part of this examination, the presented paper describes the characterization of heterogeneity in a selection of multi-pass steel arc welds. An extensive set of micro tensile tests has been performed. Significant differences in strength and yield-to-tensile ratio are observed between as-deposited and grain refined weld metal. Stress strain curves of local microstructures are defined using a stress strain model that describes two-stage strain hardening. This approach allows to quantify variations in stress strain curve shape. The magnitude of the observed heterogeneity justifies the incentive for further research in the field of weld metal heterogeneity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sandy beaches are central economic assets, attracting more recreational users than other coastal ecosystems. However, urbanization and landscape modification can compromise both the functional integrity and the attractiveness of beach ecosystems. Our study aimed at investigating the relationship between sandy beach artificialization and the landscape perception by the users, and between sandy beach visual attractiveness and biodiversity. We conducted visual and biodiversity assessments of urbanized and semiurbanized sandy beaches in Brazil and Uruguay. We specifically examined meiofauna as an indicator of biodiversity. We hypothesized that urbanization of sandy beaches results in a higher number of landscape detractors that negatively affect user evaluation, and that lower-rated beach units support lower levels of biodiversity. We found that urbanized beach units were rated lower than semiurbanized units, indicating that visual quality was sensitive to human interventions. Our expectations regarding the relationship between landscape perception and biodiversity were only partially met; only few structural and functional descriptors of meiofauna assemblages differed among classes of visual quality. However, lower-rated beach units exhibited signs of lower environmental quality, indicated by higher oligochaete densities and significant differences in meiofauna structure. We conclude that managing sandy beaches needs to advance beyond assessment of aesthetic parameters to also include the structure and function of beach ecosystems. Use of such supporting tools for managing sandy beaches is particularly important in view of sea level rise and increasing coastal development.

AB  - The use of indicator species has become a standard monitoring approach in environmental risk assessment; however, pollutant bioavailability and its geographical distribution as well as species-sensitiveness could be affected by different factors. The present study investigated the potential use of the land snail Cornu aspersum as bioindicator of industrial air pollution by using cytological and biochemical responses and trace element levels in individuals caged in proximity to an industrial setting. Eleven sites were selected based on wind direction and distance. Snails were placed in holed plastic cages, transplanted to each site and maintained for 30 days fed at libitum and under constant humidity. Several oxidative stress responses including catalase (CAT) and glu-tathione-s-transferase (GST) activities, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total metallothioneins (MTs) content were determined in snail hepatopancreas while lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and loss of DNA integrity through micronuclei frequency (MN) were assessed in haemocytes. Trace elements were also analysed in snail whole soft tissues. Multi-model inference used to predict snail's biological responses in relation to trace elements levels and distance from the industrial setting was able to disentangle the relative contributions of different influencing predictors and could be successfully applied in environmental risk assessment by using land snail as bioindicator species.

AB  - The use of bioassays for environment contamination assessment, in particular for aquatic ecosystems, has gained topicality and found extensive applications over the past decades. The methodologies are well established, but the standardization of bioassay conditions needs to be better defined in order to assure applicability as an efficient analytic tool and that results are ecologically relevant. This paper addresses the analysis of the current international situation and the specifics of Russian practice in culturing and use of test organisms for freshwater bioassays. Standardization of bioassays calls for the utilisation of pertinent sources of test cultures and the provision of appropriate cultivation conditions. The paper discusses and reviews recommendations for the selection of test species and their culturing in the context of established ecotoxicological targets and the assessment of sensitivity to various reference toxicants. The significance of the quality of water utilized for test cultures and sample dilution is highlighted. Strict water quality requirements and synthetic media options are analyzed and due consideration is given to temperature and illumination conditions. Toxkit microbiotests are discussed as an alternative to toxicity bioassays alleviating the need for continuous stock test culturing and maintenance.

AB  - Benthic algal communities were assessed in an agriculturally dominated landscape in the Central Columbia Plateau, Washington, to determine which environmental variables best explained species distributions, and whether algae species optima models were useful in predicting specific water-quality parameters. Land uses in the study area included forest, range, urban, and agriculture. Most of the streams in this region can be characterized as open-channel systems influenced by intensive dryland (nonirrigated) and irrigated agriculture. Algal communities in forested streams were dominated by blue-green algae, with communities in urban and range streams dominated by diatoms. The predominance of either blue-greens or diatoms in agricultural streams varied greatly depending on the specific site. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated a strong gradient effect of several key environmental variables on benthic algal community composition. Conductivity and % agriculture were the dominant explanatory variables when all sites (n = 24) were included in the CCA; water velocity replaced conductivity when the CCA included only agricultural and urban sites. Other significant explanatory variables included dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), orthophosphate (OP), discharge, and precipitation. Regression and calibration models accurately predicted conductivity based on benthic algal communities, with OP having slightly lower predictability. The model for DIN was poor, and therefore may be less useful in this system. Thirty-four algal taxa were identified as potential indicators of conductivity and nutrient conditions, with most indicators being diatoms except for the blue-greens Anabaena sp. and Lyngbya sp.

AB  - A prototype parenteral manufacturing facility based on isolation technology was designed, constructed, and commissioned at Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ, with emphasis on its application to research and development (R&D) settings. The facility contains closed isolators for holding, transferring, and manufacturing sterile products. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) was used for sanitization of the isolators. Various factors were evaluated to ensure complete distribution of VHP inside the isolators. VHP sanitization validation of the isolators was performed using chemical and biological indicators, and by swab resting the inside surfaces of the isolators. On the basis of these studies, operating conditions for routine VHP sanitization of the various isolators were established Performance qualification of the manufacturing facility was conducted via media fills, which demonstrated sterile integrity of the manufacturing process. The media fills revealed certain deficiencies ira handling procedures of filled product, which were subsequently corrected. The Warner-Lambert isolation technology-based parenteral facility proved to be a reliable and cost-effective alternative to standard clean room technology. The facility is ideally suited for manufacturing small batches. Closed isolator technology has its limitations when used for production-size batches involving automated processing.

AB  - Metazoan parasites and their hosts experience the environmental influence of the seasonal presence of Western and Eastern subzones with different oceanographic conditions on the Yucatan continental shelf (YS). In addition, natural seeps and oil transport in the area lead to the presence of hydrocarbons. We hypothesized that the parasite infrapopulations and infracommunities of Haemulon aurolineatum will respond to environmental variability related with ongoing oceanographic subzone conditions of the YS. Spatial and multivariate statistical analyses were used to test this hypothesis. For 17 sampling sites along the YS, 55 parasite morphospecies were recovered from 146 fishes. There were significant differences in the number of parasite species between Western and Eastern subzones, but not in the number of parasite individuals. Spatial autocorrelation on environmental variables as a consequence of the Yucatan current was found. Overall, the parasite metrics suggested a region with a good ecosystem health condition naturally influenced by oceanographic processes.

AB  - The 'state' of British forests is evaluated in an ecosystem approach using selected Indicators Of Sustainable Management. These include forest damage, crown condition, growth, nutrition, biodiversity, soil and water quality. Reference to relevant datasets derived from research or monitoring programmes demonstrates that, in general, British forests are in a satisfactory condition. Forest productivity has been maintained, and may be increasing. Tree crown condition, used in many monitoring programmes as an indicator of vitality or health, has remained relatively stable since monitoring began in the mid 1980s. British forests seem to be nutritionally well balanced, and reliance on fertilizer inputs is very low. Despite significant atmospheric deposition inputs to many forests, soil and water appear within understandable and tolerable quality limits. The biodiversity of British Forests, both semi-natural and plantation, is surprisingly rich. The implications of further environmental change are briefly discussed.

AB  - A criterion of the degradation/oxidation susceptibility of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in aqueous solutions was proposed for the first time. The criterion was derived based on calculating the limit of the ratio value of the polarization resistance of an OPV cell in aqueous solution (Rp(s)) to the polarization resistance of the OPV cell in air (Rp(air)). In other words, the criterion lim(Rp(s)/Rp(air)) = 1 was applied to determine the degradation/oxidation of the OPV cell in the aqueous solution when Rp(air) became equal (increased) to Rp(s) as a function of time of the exposure of the OPV cell to the aqueous solution. This criterion was not only used to determine the degradation/oxidation of different OPV cells in a simulated operational environment but also it was used to determine the electrochemical behavior of OPV cells in deionized water and a polluted water with fine particles of sand. The values of Rp(s) were determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at low frequency. In addition, the criterion can be applied under diverse test conditions with a predetermined period of OPV operations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - The composition and diversity of parasite communities are useful tools to characterise ecosystem health and integrity. Environmental disturbances may affect parasite infection in fish directly, by their effects on the free-living stages, or indirectly, on the intermediate hosts. Slimy sculpins,Cottus cognatus, a small fish inhabiting cold waters of North America, have been considered as sentinels due to their limited mobility, often occupying relatively small areas throughout their lives and thus reflecting the local environment. Ninety-six specimens ofC. cognatuswere sampled from four tributaries of the Athabasca River to assess patterns of helminth parasite community structure in this fish and to study the composition and diversity of its parasite communities in relation to water quality. The localities included single samples from High Hills, Horse and Dunkirk rivers, and two from the Steepbank River. Twelve metazoan parasite species were found, most of them being larval forms. Significant differences occurred in the structure and composition of parasite assemblages of sculpins from the tributaries, although similarities were observed in connected and nearby sites. Parasite communities were influenced mainly by a combination of local environmental conditions, distance and connectivity, and were separated based on the distribution and abundance of autogenic and allogenic parasites. Water quality appeared to influence the distribution of trematode species that use gastropods as intermediate hosts, while proximity and connectivity of sites led to sharing allogenic parasite species in slimy sculpin.

AB  - Invasive alien organisms can impact adversely on indigenous biodiversity, while riparian invasive alien trees (IATs), through shading of the habitat, can be a key threat to stream invertebrates. We ask here whether stream fauna can recover when the key threat of riparian IATs is removed. Specifically, we address whether IAT invasion, and subsequent IAT removal, changes benthic macroinvertebrate and adult dragonfly assemblages, for the worse or for the better respectively. Natural riparian zones were controls. There were statistically significant differences between stream reaches with natural, IAT-infested and IAT-cleared riparian vegetation types, based on several metrics: immature macroinvertebrate taxon richness, average score per macroinvertebrate taxon (ASPT), a macroinvertebrate subset (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata larvae; EPTO), and adult dragonfly species richness. Reaches with natural vegetation, or cleared of IATs, supported greater relative diversity of macroinvertebrates than reaches shaded by dense IATs. Greatest macroinvertebrate ASPT and EPTO were in reaches bordered by natural vegetation and those bordered by vegetation cleared of IATs, and the lowest where the riparian corridor was IATs. Highest number of adult dragonflies species was along streams cleared of dense IATs. Overall, results showed that removal of a highly invasive, dense canopy of alien trees enables recovery of aquatic biodiversity. As benthic macroinvertebrate scores and adult dragonfly species richness are correlated and additive, their combined use is recommended for river condition assessments.

AB  - The cumulative effect of land-use changes is one of the most important factors contributing to the continuous deterioration of river ecosystems. We used ecological exergy to evaluate the impacts of land-use changes on functional guilds of benthic macroinvertebrates. We classified 353 sampling sites into 3 groups based on land-use types: forested, agricultural, and urban rivers. For each sampling site, we calculated ecological exergy based on 5 trophic groups of macroinvertebrates. Differences in exergy, specific exergy, and structural metrics (i.e. species richness and Shannon index) suggested that land-use type was an important determinant of the composition of macroinvertebrate communities. Exergy values of the functional feeding groups and trophic groups were used as input data to train self-organizing maps unsupervised artificial neural networks. The results showed that functional guilds responded differently to different land-use types: scrapers and carnivores dominated the forested rivers, whilst predators and omnivores, and gatherer-collectors and detritivores dominated agricultural and urban rivers, respectively. These results suggest that ecological exergy can be used as a functional bioassessment indicator to evaluate river condition. A generalized additive model and random forest also highlighted that a combination of both conventional structural indicators (e.g. species richness and Shannon index) and novel functional indicators (e.g. exergy and specific exergy) can be used to assess biotic integrity.

AB  - Sound water policy and management rests on sound hydrometeorological and ecological data. Conversely, unrepresentative, poorly collected, or erroneously archived data introduce uncertainty regarding the magnitude, rate, and direction of environmental change, in addition to undermining confidence in decision-making processes. Unfortunately, data biases and errors can enter the information flow at various stages, starting with site selection, instrumentation, sampling/measurement procedures, postprocessing and ending with archiving systems. Techniques such as visual inspection of raw data, graphical representation, and comparison between sites, outlier, and trend detection, and referral to metadata can all help uncover spurious data. Tell-tale signs of ambiguous and/or anomalous data are highlighted using 12 carefully chosen cases drawn mainly from hydrology ('the dirty dozen'). These include evidence of changes in site or local conditions (due to land management, river regulation, or urbanization); modifications to instrumentation or inconsistent observer behavior; mismatched or misrepresentative sampling in space and time; treatment of missing values, postprocessing and data storage errors. Also for raising awareness of pitfalls, recommendations are provided for uncovering lapses in data quality after the information has been gathered. It is noted that error detection and attribution are more problematic for very large data sets, where observation networks are automated, or when various information sources have been combined. In these cases, more holistic indicators of data integrity are needed that reflect the overall information life-cycle and application(s) of the hydrological data. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Discerning fish-habitat associations at a variety of spatial scales is relevant to evaluating biotic conditions and stressor responses in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Ordination analyses identified strong, geographically organized associations among anthropogenic stressors and water clarity, vegetation structure, and fish composition at both whole-wetland and within-wetland spatial scales. Lacustrine-protected wetlands were generally internally homogeneous in fish composition, whereas riverine or barrier-beach lagoon wetlands could be more heterogeneous, especially if they had large tributaries and complex morphology or if the mouth area was more directly exposed to the adjacent lake than were other areas. A tendency towards more turbidity-tolerant fish but fewer vegetation spawners, nest guarders, or game and panfish differentiated both more-disturbed from less-disturbed wetlands and open-water from vegetated areas within wetlands. Variation in vegetation structure related to wetland hydromorphology and anthropogenic impacts makes standardizing fish sampling protocols by microhabitat impractical across broad spatial or disturbance gradients. We recommend distributing sampling effort across available microhabitats and show that both fish and habitat can be adequately characterized with a single field day of effort.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether ammonia emissions from industrial composting of organic waste may influence the surrounding environment, using lichens as bioindicators. To this purpose, samples of N-tolerant and N-sensitive lichens, namely Xanthoria parietina and Evernia prunastri, were transplanted for 1-3 months along transects at increasing distance (0-400 m) from a composting facility in Tuscany, Italy. Atmospheric concentrations of ammonia were measured using passive samplers. The physiological response of lichen transplants was investigated by means of the photosynthetic efficiency (measured as chlorophyll a fluorescence emission), the integrity of cell membranes (measured as electrolyte leakage), and sample viability (measured as enzymatic activity of dehydrogenase). Epiphytic lichen communities were investigated using biodiversity indices. The results showed decreasing concentrations of ammonia, from 48.7 mu g/m(3) at the composting facility to 2.7 mu g/m(3) at 400 m. The N-tolerant X. parietina was not affected and some physiological parameters even showed a higher performance, while the N-sensitive E. prunastri showed a reduced performance with increasing atmospheric concentrations approaching the source. A shift from lichen communities composed by meso-acidophilous species (actual condition) to more nitrophilous communities in the near future, approaching the composting facility is suggested. It is concluded that lichens can provide useful data for decision-makers to establish correct science-based environmentally sustainable waste management policies.

AB  - There is a growing need for strategic assessment of environmental conditions in river basins around the world. In spite of the considerable water resources, Brazil has been suffering from water quality decrease in recent years. Pardo River runs through Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, two of the most economically important states in Brazil, and is being currently promoted as a future drinking water source. This study aimed at integrating three different tools to conduct a hydromorphological assessment focused on the spatial complexity, connectivity, and dynamism of the Pardo River, Brazil. Twelve sampling stretches were evaluated in four sampling campaigns, in dry and rainy seasons. In each stretch, permanent preservation areas (PPAs), hydromorphological integrity by rapid assessment protocol (RAP), and physicochemical parameters were qualified. The kappa coefficient was used to assess statistical agreement among monitoring tools. The PPA analysis showed that in all stretches, the vegetation was modified. RAP results revealed environmental deterioration in stretches located near human activities and less variability of substrates available for aquatic fauna and sediment deposition as well. Low values for dissolved oxygen in the river mouth were noted in the rainy season. Electrical conductivity was higher in stretches near sugarcane crops. The poor agreement (k<0.35) between the RAP and physicochemical parameters indicates that the tools generate different and complementary information, while they are not replaceable. Potential changes of the hydromorphological characteristics and variations in physicochemical indicators must be related to extensive PPA modification.

AB  - In this paper the concept of resilience is discussed on the base of 13 case studies from the German branch of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Program. In the introduction the resilience approach is presented as one possibility to describe ecosystem dynamics. The relations with the concepts of adaptability and ecological integrity are discussed and the research questions are formulated. The focal research objectives are related to the conditions of resilient behaviour of ecosystems, the role of spatio-temporal scales, the differences between short- or long-term dynamics, the basic methodological requirements to exactly define resilience, the role of the reference state and indicators and the suitability of resilience as a management concept. The main part of the paper consists of 13 small case study descriptions, which demonstrate phase transitions and resilient dynamics of several terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at different time scales. In the discussion, some problems arising from the interpretation of the time series are highlighted and discussed. The topics of discussion are the conceptual challenges of the resilience approach, methodological problems, the role of indicator selection, the complex interactions between different disturbances, the significance of time scales and a comparison of the case studies. The article ends with a conclusion which focuses on the demand to link resilience with adaptability, in order to support the long-term dynamics of ecosystem development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural land use poses a significant threat to the ecological integrity of rivers in Europe. Particularly in the Mediterranean, water abstraction and nutrient application are anthropogenic pressures that have a significant impact on aquatic habitats and biodiversity. In this article, we assessed the effects of agricultural management practices on benthic macroinvertebrates in a large river basin of central Greece using simulated data based on the application of SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model. Physicochemical and hydrological output variables of the model were used as predictors of the ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon) metric based on a correlated component regression analysis (CCR) built on empirical data. The estimation of ASPT was performed for the wet and dry seasons within a 20-year period for a total of 47 subbasins under the baseline conditions and after implementing three management scenarios that reduced: a) irrigation water applied to crops by 30%, b) chemical fertilization applied to crops by 30% and c) both irrigation and fertilization by 30%. The results revealed that application of the reduced irrigation resulted to a slight increase of the simulated dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN), which in turn decreased the mean ASPT in 21 of the 47 subbasins implying a negative effect on the macroinvertebrate communities. On the contrary, the reduction of fertilization as well as the combined scenario decreased both the simulated DIN and phosphate concentration causing an increase of the mean ASPT for a total of 40 of the 47 subbasins. Based on these results, we suggest that the best management option is a combined practice of deficit irrigation and fertilization reduction since it improved water quality, increased ASPT values and saved a considerable amount of water. Overall, this work demonstrates a simple methodology that can efficiently assess the effects of agricultural management practices on biotic indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wadi El-Rayan Protected Area (WERPA) is considered a model protectorate and an ecological restoration success. Development and mismanagement of Wadi El-Rayan vulnerable water resources could lead to the depletion of two artificial lakes and large scale deterioration of ecosystem health. We quantify the environmental value of preserving WERPA by applying the water-food-energy nexus approach and the concept of nonmonetary opportunity cost. Three output indicators: agriculture, aquaculture and net energy production are selected to assess the value of different ecosystem health conditions under three water management scenarios. STELLA object oriented modeling environment has been used to simulate the scenarios that led to favorable, satisfactory, and critical ecosystem health conditions. The results demonstrated that the economic output that could be realized by reaching the favorable condition has twice the value of the acceptable condition.

AB  - The inspection of underground sewer defects plays a considerable role in estimating the structural integrity and avoiding various unforeseen functional failures. However, the conventional sewer defect inspection approaches suffer from the blurry and vaporous environment inside the sewer pipes, which significantly lowers the performance. Besides, it is challenging to achieve efficient and accurate condition assessment by the common manual inspection. Therefore, this manuscript introduces an automatic instance segmentation-based defect analysis framework. The main contributions include 1) a novel defect segmentation model called Pipe-SOLO is firstly presented to segment six common types of defects at the instance level by proposing an efficient backbone structure (Res2Net-Mish-BN-101) and designing an enhanced BiFPN (EBiFPN), 2) a GAN-based dehazing model is applied to effectively solve the image blurring problem, and 3) a publicly available sewer defect segmentation dataset. The experimental results show the proposed Pipe-SOLO achieved an improvement of 7.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in terms of the mean Average Precision (mAP). Therefore, the proposed defect segmentation method is promising to be integrated with real-life applications that require defect localization and estimation.

AB  - We analyze the mechanism of degradation of pearlitic steels depending on the operating conditions, such as, first of all, the temperature, stresses and hydrogenation. Microstructural, mechanical, and electrochemical indicators of the in-service degradation of structural steels and its main stages are systematized. As its most typical feature, we can mention the decrease in brittle-fracture resistance, which increases the hazard of the loss of structural integrity. Special attention is given to the stage of development of dissipated damage on the nano- and microscales and the corresponding mechanical effects. We also analyze the existing laboratory methods intended for the accelerated degradation of steels. A special role of hydrogenating media in the process of degradation of steel is demonstrated and the nondestructive methods of its evaluation are analyzed. The prospects of subsequent research in the problems of in-service degradation of steels intended for the hydrogen power-generating industry in the case of application of the existing networks of gas transit and distribution pipelines for the transportation of hydrogen and its mixtures with natural gas are discussed.

AB  - We report an investigation aimed at improving the understanding of the relationships between hydromorphology and land cover, and in particular aimed at identifying the spatial scale on which land cover patterns best account for the hydromorphology at a stream reach. This investigation was carried out in the Adour-Garonne basin. Several key findings emerged from the use of a new modeling procedure called "Random Forests". Firstly, we established a typology of sites showing an upstream/downstream gradient structured by geographical descriptors and catchment hydromorphological features. Secondly, we found that the relationships between hydromorphology and the different spatial scales of land cover responded to a longitudinal gradient. Upstream, no noticeable difference was observed whatever the land cover pattern considered, whereas downstream, larger scales were strongly related to the hydromorphology. Thirdly, a specific land cover effect on each hydromorphological type was seen. Along the gradient, the contribution of the land cover variables structuring the hydromorphological types decreased and become homogeneous. Fourthly, stronger correlations were established with individual hydromorphological variables using the larger scales of land cover. This paper contributes to a better understanding of landscape ecology and fits well with the European Water Framework Directive that requires long-term sustainable management. In the context of natural conditions, we advise that the catchment scale should be given high priority when connected with land cover/uses; local and riparian environments being more valuable and complementary in the case of impacted sites.

AB  - The Cappadocia region, with its very distinct culture, is one of the attractive tourist sites of Turkey due to its spectacular and unique landforms and historical heritage. In this region, the structures carved into thick and soft tuffs have survived and kept their integrity for about 12-13 centuries. The Zelve Open Air Museum, consisting of three valleys, is one of the oldest antique semi-underground settlements in the region and is designated as a World Heritage Site in Turkey. Although it was closed to human habitation due to collapses, which occurred within some of the rock-hewn structures and resulted in three casualties in 1950s, it is open to tourists. Particularly in the first valley, there are a lot of rock-hewn openings of different sizes and several churches with some geo-engineering problems. This study aims to assess the geo-engineering characteristics of the soft tuffs surrounding the rock-hewn historical structures and environmental conditions in the first valley of the Zelve Open Air Museum and their possible effects on the geo-engineering problems observed in this museum. The results mainly suggest that the strength of rock is reduced drastically under saturated conditions, and the processes of freezing-thawing and wetting-drying accelerate further degradation of rock under saturated conditions. Over a period of about five years, the amount of erosion, which mainly resulted from the two strong agents of rainfall and wind, ranged between 1.07 and 6.21 mm. Assuming that the erosion is homogeneous, determined annual average erosion ranges between 0.21 and 1.24 mm/yr. These observations suggest that erosion is an important phenomenon in this site and increases particularly in the winter and spring seasons. The failure modes, such as falling, sliding, bending, spalling, and slabbing, observed in the valley are considered to be mainly associated with deterioration and erosion of tuffs near vertical and laterally persistent discontinuities generally oriented perpendicular and parallel to the valley, and property changes due to cyclic freezing-thawing and wetting-drying processes. Spalling and slabbing occurring in cliffs and semi-underground openings are the indicators of yielding of rock. These phenomena result in the formation of slabs with different thicknesses, and consequently cause a change in geometry of the openings in the valley to trigger failures.

AB  - The Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP) is a popular tool used for the assessment of air quality in polluted urban areas, on the basis of phytosociological data of epiphytic lichen communities. We hypothesized that this indicator could also be used in less polluted forest areas to determine the quality of ecological conditions for lichens. The aim of the present study was to verify the use of IAP method in the assessment of environmental pollution, and alternatively for the assessment of general ecological conditions in protected mountain forests of Gorce National Park (Polish Western Carpathians) based on the epiphytic lichen biota associated with Picea abies. The spatial distribution of IAP values on monitored sites in GNP was compared with: 1) spatial distribution of accumulated sulfur, nitrogen, selected heavy metals, and total heavy metals in Hypogymnia physodes thalli in 1993 and 2018 (30 sites), 2) mean ecological indicator values characterizing species requirements for light (L), substrate reaction (R) and nutrients (N), in 1993, 2013 and 2018 (33 sites). Generalized linear model and redundancy analysis were performed for disclosing most influencing factors affecting lichen communities. The study revealed a few negligible relationships between IAP values and accumulation of such elements as Ni, Mn, Cd, and Cr in both monitoring periods. Simultaneously, IAP can be useful for the identification of forest areas with a high degree of naturalness.

AB  - Different approaches based on macrophytes have been proposed in recent years to implement the European Water Framework Directive. However, their application to transitional environments presents difficulties as a consequence of the natural gradients of environmental conditions in these ecosystems. Three of the most widely used methodological approaches, the EEI, E-MaQI and BENTHOS index were applied under different stress conditions in order to evaluate their suitability for detecting anthropogenic pressures in coastal lagoons. For this purpose, 12 representative sampling stations were selected, including sites that suffer the greatest pressures in the Mar Menor (agricultural and urban wastes that reach the lagoon through the principal watercourses, and pleasure harbours) as well as sites considered to be in good ecological condition. Species respond not only to eutrophication and nutrient concentration gradients, but also to natural environmental stress and confinement. The assessment of stations according to substrate type differed between EEI and E-MaQI, the correlation between the scores assigned by each index being very low. Moreover, the explanatory variables selected by the regression models (GLM) show that the tested indices mainly respond to natural environmental stress and, only after excluding these variables from the analyses, did the relationship of the indices with eutrophic parameters, such as chlorophyll a or ammonium concentration, become evident.

AB  - Mechanical damage in transportation pipelines is a threat to their structural integrity. Failure in oil and gas pipelines is catastrophic as it leads to personal fatalities, injuries, property damage, loss of production, and environmental pollution. Therefore, this issue is of extreme importance to pipeline operators, government and regulatory agencies, and local communities. As mechanical damage can occur during the course of pipeline life due to many reasons, appropriate tools and procedures for assessment of severity is necessary. There are many parameters that affect the severity of the mechanical damage related to the pipe geometry and material properties, the defect geometry and boundary conditions, and the pipe state of strain and stress. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of geometry, material, and pressure variability on strain and stress fields in dented pipelines under static and cyclic pressure loading using probabilistic analysis. Most of the published literature focuses on the strain at the maximum depth for evaluation, which is not always sufficient to evaluate the severity of a certain case. The validation and calibration of the base deterministic model was based on fullinstrumented full-scale tests conducted by Pipeline Research Council International as part of their active program to fully characterize mechanical damage. A total of 100 cases randomly generated using Monte Carlo simulation are analyzed in the probabilistic model. The statistical distribution of output parameters and correlation between output and input variables is presented. Moreover, regression analysis is conducted to derive mathematical formulas of the output variables in terms of practically measured variables. The results can be used directly into strain based assessment. Moreover, they can be coupled with fracture mechanics to assess cracks for which the state of stress must be known in the location of crack tip, not necessarily found in the dent peak. Furthermore, probabilities derived from the statistical distribution can be used in risk assessment. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4002860]

AB  - 1. The European Council Water Framework Directive requires reference conditions to be determined for all water body types including lakes. We examined the role of palaeolimnology, specifically the diatom record, as a tool for assessing eutrophication and for defining lake reference conditions and ecological status.
   2. Sediment cores (representing c. AD 1850 to present day) were taken from 26 Scottish freshwater loch basins. Radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-137) established a chronology for each core. Two levels of diatom analysis were employed: a relatively high resolution (15-20 samples) at 21 lochs considered of high interest, and a lower resolution (four to five samples) at the remaining sites.
   3. Detrended correspondence analysis and dissimilarity measures were applied to the core top (present day) and bottom (reference state, c. AD 1850) samples to assess floristic change at each site. Significant floristic change, indicative of nutrient enrichment, occurred in 18 lochs along a broad trophic gradient.
   4. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) was applied to the bottom (c. AD 1850) samples to classify the 'reference' diatom assemblages and thereby characterize the reference floras of the different lake types. TWINSPAN identified four site end-groups, each with a characteristic diatom assemblage, although there was some overlap in the taxa present in the four groups. Water depth and productivity were key factors that explained the groupings.
   5. Diatom transfer functions that reconstructed total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were used to evaluate eutrophication. Nineteen lochs had increases in diatom-inferred (DI) TP of > 5 mug l(-1) (five of these > 20 mug l(-1)), six lochs had no change or negligible increases in DI-TP (<2 mug l(-1)), and there was evidence of a decline in DI-TP in one loch over the period represented by the sediment cores. The inferred increases were significant at 12 lochs.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our data indicate that it may be difficult to find minimally impacted waters to act as reference sites, particularly for shallow, lowland lake types, in the current population. The derivation of site-specific reference conditions from the sediment record is a particularly valuable approach in such cases. Ordination, clustering and dissimilarity measures applied to palaeodata, combined with transfer functions, offer powerful techniques for characterizing lake types, defining ecological and chemical reference conditions, and assessing deviation from the reference state.

AB  - Excessive inputs of fine-grained sediment can damage aquatic ecosystems both by degrading habitat condition and by directly impairing biota. Recent research has improved our understanding of how benthic macroinvertebrates respond to fine-grained sediment stress, leading to the development of a variety of bioassessment indices based on changes in taxonomic composition and biological trait composition. Use of biological traits as indicators of stress has been advocated on the basis of a better mechanistic understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors acting on benthic communities. We quantified changes in the macroinvertebrate biological trait assemblage from a large number of river reaches spanning a national-scale gradient of increasing agricultural fine sediment delivery and retention, having first factored out variation associated with the natural environmental gradient, with the aim of robustly testing predictions of trait response. We found strong support for 2 of 18 predictions of how macroinvertebrate traits would respond to fine sediment stress. Furthermore, using an independent dataset, we were able to confirm the response of 5 of 6 trait classes that partial RLQ-fourth corner analysis found to be significantly associated with the fine sediment gradient. Prevalence of eggs as a resistant form, in combination with either an adult aquatic life stage or crawling, provided the best indication of fine sediment conditions in streams, approaching the performance of taxonomic composition-based sediment indices, CoFSIsp and EPSImtl. This study has robustly confirmed the potential of macroinvertebrate biological traits as indicators of fine sediment impacts.

AB  - Managing multiple ecosystem services (ES) in agricultural landscapes is a challenging task, especially in regions with complex topographical and agro-ecological conditions. These challenges require ES assessment approaches that go beyond the case study level and provide multi-temporal information at a transnational level. We used a spatiotemporal approach to examine the impact of specific land use/land cover (LULC) trajectories on eight ES for the past 150 years. We show how a spatially explicit ES upscaling procedure, from case study to an Alpine-wide level, based on topographical, agro-ecological and socioeconomic parameters, can improve our understanding of ES dynamics and bundles. Our results indicated that the provision of multiple ES was not stable during the 150 years surveyed, mainly depending on the prevailing land management type and the biophysical conditions. ES bundle mapping enabled us to identify landscapes with consistent socioecological characteristics that are most likely to either enhance or diminish the provision of specific types of services. By introducing a spatiotemporal perspective into ES assessment, we provide clear evidence of the dynamic nature of ES provision and contribute to identifying processes and drivers behind these interactions. Our results emphasize that mountain ES supply is particularly sensitive to long-term LULC change, to biophysical characteristics and to regional socioeconomic conditions. They indicate the benefit of integrating of ES bundles into environmental policies at national and transnational level.

AB  - Management of recreational water development is based on knowledge of local recreational practices, resources and demand. Non-resort inland regions are very specific. In those of them, where the space is large and the sphere of recreation is underdeveloped, it is impossible to measure the real values of these indicators in situ and in monetary terms. In this study is shows how to conduct a non-monetary assessment of ecosystem services (ESs) in atypical conditions of recreational water use (RW). To solve the problem in Siberia, an approach is proposed to assess the degree of satisfaction of the demand for water recreation by ecosystem proposals of the territory from the point of view of donor capabilities of the environment and its sustainability. Demographic and economic statistics, sociological Analytics, standards of permissible anthropogenic load on ecosystems are used as initial quantitative data for the calculation of supply and demand. The availability of recreational ESs is estimated in relative terms (percent) and shows the share of the resource potentially used by consumers from the available ecosystem supply. In three river basins with different socio-economic conditions and ecosystem proposals, a wide diapason of availability was revealed: 0.3-72.0% - on the coast and 1.0-369.1% - on the water area. Peak values indicate a high potential for land-use conflicts and help identify areas for deeper analysis. The method is suitable for any other region, regardless of natural, social and economic conditions.

AB  - We reviewed 219 papers and built an inventory of 532 items of ecological evidence on multiple stressor impacts in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, as well as groundwaters. Our review revealed that, despite the existence of a huge conceptual knowledge base in aquatic ecology, few studies actually provide quantitative evidence on multi-stress effects. Nutrient stress was involved in 71% to 98% of multi-stress situations in the three types of surface water environments, and in 42% of those in groundwaters. However, their impact manifested differently along the groundwater-river-lake-transitional-coastal continuum, mainly determined by the different hydro-morphological features of these ecosystems. The reviewed papers addressed two-stressor combinations most frequently (42%), corresponding with the actual status-quo of pressures acting on European surface waters as reported by the Member States in the WISE WFD Database (EEA, 2015). Across all biological groups analysed, higher explanatory power of the stress-effect models was discernible for lakes under multi-stressor compared to single stressor conditions, but generally lower for coastal and transitional waters. Across all aquatic environments, the explanatory power of stress-effect models for fish increased when multi-stressor conditions were taken into account in the analysis, qualifying this organism group as a useful indicator of multi-stress effects. In contrast, the explanatory power of models using benthic flora decreased under conditions of multiple stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of the reference condition approach (RCA) in environmental assessments is becoming more prevalent. Although the RCA was not explicitly described in Green's (1979) book on statistical methods for environmental biologists, we expanded his decision key for selecting an appropriate environmental study design to include this approach. The RCA compares the biological community at a potentially impacted 'test' site to communities found in minimally impacted 'reference' sites. However, to implement the RCA there are a number of assumptions and decisions that must be made. We compare several common multimetric and multivariate bioassessment methods to illustrate that four key decisions inherent in the RCA framework (i.e., criteria used for reference site selection, for grouping similar reference sites, for comparing test and reference sites, and for evaluating the cause of impacts) can markedly affect test site appraisals. Specific guidelines should be developed to select appropriate reference sites. Based on analyses of real and simulated data, we recommend a minimum of 20, but preferably 30 to 50 reference sites per group, and verification of groupings with more than one classification method. New approaches (e.g., test site analysis) incorporating the strengths of both multimetric and multivariate methods can be used to compare test and reference sites. Additional ecological information, models relating degree of impact to a stressor or habitat gradient, and variance partitioning can also be used to isolate the probable cause of impairment, and are particularly valuable when appropriate reference sites are unavailable.

AB  - The study of the composting process is a very urgent task. The rapid growth in food production leads to the formation of waste, which should be safely disposed of in a natural way - composting. Composting the vegetable component of food waste can significantly reduce the proportion of waste falling into landfills and utilize the food waste from the hotel and restaurant industry. Additional enrichment of the compost mixture of food waste with the "Baikal EM" microbiological additive accelerates the maturation process and enhances the efficiency of the finished compost. Such compost does not contain viable weed seeds or pathogenic microflora and can be used as a fertilizer. In contrast to the control, a sufficient level of germination index is observed for the studied samples and they are not phytotoxic. The finished compost can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture for growing crops. The results obtained indicate that the index of germination of radish seeds increases along with the duration of fermentation of the composted mixture. Communities of microorganisms contained in the "Baikal EM" additive accelerate the natural process of composting, taking an active part in the destruction of the components of the vegetable mixture. The pH value of the finished compost, both under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions, is close to neutral indicators. High values of CO2 emissions from reactors were recorded in the second week under thermophilic and for 3 weeks under mesophilic conditions. The finished compost that fermented under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions can be used as fertilizer, but considering that additional energy is required to create thermophilic conditions, it is advisable to compost the food waste mixture with the addition of the microbiological additive "Baikal EM" under mesophilic conditions.

AB  - In the past 30years, several studies have proved that the river flow regime is fundamental in structuring biotic communities. The condition of the ecosystem results not only from the occurrence of extreme events, such as floods and droughts but also from habitat availability and from its temporal variation. Describing the relationships between macroinvertebrate community characteristics and environmental gradients of flow, temperature, nutrient supplies, and habitat conditions is fundamental to understand ecological dynamics. This is the basis for predicting changes within the communities and in ecosystem functions and ultimately to properly manage and conserve the riverine ecosystems. Seven sites, along a 20-km river sector, were surveyed for macroinvertebrates and water chemistry seasonally, from 2012 to 2016. Habitat conditions were assessed along a 500-m stretch in each site. The river discharge was continuously monitored by two water level recorders and used to reconstruct various hydrological indices specific for each sampling location. During the sampling period, numerous high flow events and some prolonged periods of low flow were observed. Quantile regression was used to describe the effects of potential limiting factors on macroinvertebrate community, which were primarily driven by antecedent flow conditions and season whereas habitat conditions and water chemistry played only a minor role. Quantitative models have been developed to predict structural and functional characteristics of macroinvertebrate community as a function of antecedent flow conditions, habitat, and physicochemical water characteristics. Those models allow to identify the main drivers and predict the effect of different water management strategies to riverine ecosystem.

AB  - Alligators and crocodiles integrate biological impacts of hydrological operations, affecting them at all life stages through three key aspects of Everglades ecology: (1) food webs, (2) diversity and productivity, and (3) freshwater flow. Responses of crocodilians are directly related to suitability of environmental conditions and hydrologic change. Correlations between biological responses and environmental-conditions contribute to an understanding of species' status and trends over time. Positive or negative trends of crocodilian populations relative to hydrologic changes permit assessment of positive or negative trends in restoration.
   The crocodilian indicator uses monitoring parameters (performance measures) that have been shown to be both effective and efficient in tracking trends. The alligator component uses relative density (reported as an encounter rate), body condition, and occupancy rates of alligator holes; the crocodile component uses juvenile growth and hatchling survival. We hypothesize that these parameters are correlated with hydrologic conditions including depth, duration, timing, spatial extent and water quality. Salinity is a critical parameter in estuarine habitats. Assessments of parameters defined for crocodilian performance measures support these hypotheses.
   Alligators and crocodiles are the charismatic megafauna of the Everglades. They are both keystone and flagship species to which the public can relate. In addition, the parameters used to track trends are easy to understand. They provide answers to the following questions: How has the number of alligators or crocodiles changed? Are the animals fatter or thinner than they should be? Are the animal:3 in the places (in terms of habitat and geography) where they should be?
   As surely as there is no other Everglades, no other single species defines the Everglades as does the American alligator. The Everglades is the only place in the world where both alligators and crocodiles exist. Crocodilians clearly respond to changes in hydrologic parameters of management interest. These relationships are easy to communicate and mean something to managers, decision makers, and the public. Having crocodilians on the list of system-wide, general indicators provides us with one of the most powerful tools we have to communicate progress of ecosystem restoration in Greater Everglades ecosystems to diverse audiences.

AB  - P>1. Hong Kong streams are subject to aggressive water extractions but the downstream water needs of ecosystems - i.e. environmental flow (e-flow) requirements - have not yet been addressed. This study investigated hydro-ecological relationships that could be used to establish e-flow allocations for streams in monsoonal Hong Kong.
   2. Data were collected during the wet and dry seasons from 10 unpolluted streams experiencing a gradient of flow reductions (c. 0-98%). Relationships between flow conditions (percentage discharge reduction and absolute discharge volume) and responses of macroinvertebrate composition and periphyton condition were established for each season.
   3. Declines in richness of Ephemeroptera and abundance of hydropsychid caddisflies, as well as increases in the proportion of predators, were linearly related to percentage discharge reduction during both seasons. Relationships were also recorded for eight other macroinvertebrate richness or compositional metrics during the dry season only. Relationships between macroinvertebrate assemblage attributes and absolute discharge volume across downstream reaches were also evident. Periphyton was relatively insensitive to flow reductions and did not provide useful hydro-ecological relationships, although declines in autotrophic index were related to percentage discharge reduction during the dry season.
   4. Using hydro-ecological relationships established for macroinvertebrates, two levels of e-flow were proposed: a 'threshold' intended to maintain near-natural conditions and a 'degradation limit' that allowed no more than 25% of the maximum indicator response to flow reduction. Calculated threshold e-flows required downstream allocation of >= 74% of natural flows; degradation limit e-flows were >= 12% (wet) and >= 27% (dry). The discharge needed to maintain threshold conditions was 30-105 L s-1 (wet) and 5-14 L s-1 (dry), with degradation limit e-flows of 19-57 L s-1 (wet) and 3-6 L s-1 (dry), relative to natural mean discharges of 77-303 L s-1 (wet) and 3-18 L s-1 (dry).
   5. The proposed e-flow allocations are indicative only, and significant obstacles to implementation have yet to be surmounted. Any such implementation requires monitoring of outcomes in order to refine the allocations and inform adaptive flow management for Hong Kong streams.

AB  - Nowadays, the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems due to the intensification of farming practices is happening very fast, and therefore, stopping or slowing it down should be a priority for conservation. To detect changes in these environmental contexts, one approach contemplates focusing on a limited set of indicator species that can alert us to ongoing changes in progress. In this research, we aimed to measure the biodiversity of vertebrates using a multi-taxa approach in an intensively cultivated and highly inhabited area located in northern Italy. We investigated the relationships between biodiversity and environmental characteristics and we identified the taxonomic groups that can be used as indicators of biodiversity. Data collection was carried out in 2016 with different methods depending on the taxonomic group, in 131 sampling units chosen using a Tessellation Stratified Sampling. Then we calculated for each sampling unit a standardized Biodiversity Index, which was related to environmental variables concerning the land use and the landscape configuration using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis and Information-Theoretic approach. We used correlation analyses and the Indicator Species Analysis (IndVal) to identify the taxonomic groups and species that can be used as indicators of biodiversity. Biodiversity was positively related to the number of patches of natural vegetation, whereas it was negatively affected by the number of patches of artificial surfaces and by habitat diversity. Our findings agree with those obtained by many other researchers, which pointed out that agroecosystems provide adequate shelters, suitable foraging habitats and nesting sites. The negative effect of habitat diversity was explained by the areaheterogeneity trade-off. Therefore, sites with high heterogeneity will not contain enough cover of residual natural vegetation, essential to maintain high biodiversity, because increasing compositional heterogeneity within a fixed area simultaneously reduces the surface of each cover type. The analyses showed that birds and reptiles might be used as biodiversity indicators of vertebrates. Eurasian Magpie and Green Whip Snake, both generalist species, were associated with sites of low biodiversity, whereas seven birds, both generalists and farmland specialists, were associated with sites of medium biodiversity. In high biodiversity sites there were not indicator species. To conclude, in less natural environments, such as urban and agricultural landscapes, a combination of specialist and generalist indicator species seems adequate to monitor biodiversity changes. Our findings increase the knowledge of these very dynamic ecosystems, being important both to plan strategies for biodiversity conservation and to guarantee ecosystems services useful for humans.

AB  - Floodplain systems are among the most complex ecosystems. To assess their ecological condition, several indicator systems have been developed. However, none of them quantifies environmental factors related to the dynamics of water levels,which is a major driver for the occurrence and distribution of species in floodplains. We present a new bioindicator system for the duration of inundation per year and mean depth of groundwater during the vegetation period. The new indicator system is based on carabid beetles, Molluscs, and plants. The indicator system generally proved to be precise as well as temporally and spatially transferable within the same river system, the Elbe River in Germany. The indication based on plants was clearly most precise and transferable. The results are discussed in terms of application of the indicator system.

AB  - The use of biomarkers for monitoring aquatic environmental quality has gained considerable interest worldwide. The effects of the environmental conditions of Rio Champoton, Mexico, in the hotspot of Mesoamerica, were assessed in Astyanax aeneus, a native fish of the tropics of southwestern Mexico. Pollution from agrochemical residues is a major problem in Rio Champoton. Three study sites along the freshwater portion of the river were monitored in April, July, and November 2007 and February 2008. This study includes a water quality index, a set of biomarkers (hepatic glycogen levels and lipid peroxidation in liver, gills, and muscle) to assess the integrated biomarker response, and population bioindicators (gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and Fulton's condition factor). Although the water quality index suggested low level of contamination in the Rio Champoton, biomarkers indicated that A. aeneus is exposed to stressors that impair biological responses. The integrated biomarker response showed stress periods with higher biomarker response and recovery periods with decreasing biomarker values. The somatic indices did not indicate severe effects at the population level. This study illustrates the usefulness of lipid peroxidation evaluation in the assessment of aquatic health conditions and corroborates the suitability of A. aeneus as a sentinel species.

AB  - Groundwater and subsurface water have important roles in river ecosystems: e.g., stabilizing flow regime and water temperature, supplying nutrients, and increasing biodiversity. However, detection of springs and quantitative estimation of groundwater contribution to the surface water ecosystems are not easy in the field. Although some indirect measurements combing simulations and models have been widely used to estimate the groundwater flow, they require certain assumptions, thus it is rather difficult to estimate the discharge of groundwater on a local scale. Direct field-scale measurement of groundwater flow is also difficult particularly for researches of ecology and environmental science.
   In this study, we present biological indicators of benthic invertebrates to evaluate the contribution of groundwater to surface water bodies. Because the benthic invertebrates show distribution patterns reflecting habitat scale environmental conditions in a sensitive manner, they are expected to serve as a biological indicator of groundwater spring sites. We collected data of benthic invertebrates from literature in a global scale and additional field research in Japan. By analyzing their taxonomic features and biological habits, we identified spring indicator taxa of benthic invertebrates based on the degree of dependency to groundwater environment.
   A total of 1,448 aquatic invertebrate species representing 58 orders were found from 249 research sites. The spring indicators were identified as spring dependent species including groundwater species (Stygobites and Stygophiles), cave species (Troglobites and Troglophile), and stenothermal species. Considering the geographical distribution patterns of the spring indicator taxa, stenothermal species were classified into "cold stenothermal species" which evolutionarily originate in more boreal regions and "warm stenothermal species" derived from more tropical regions. Ecological interpretation of these stenothermal species was discussed in relation to climatic zones and altitude of the basin concerned. Based on the variations of spring contribution into river ecosystems suggested by the spring indicator species, we proposed an application procedure of the spring indicators for environmental assessment and nature conservation works in river management.

AB  - Ongoing climatic change and anthropogenic pressure highlight the importance of reliable assessment of the ecological status of freshwaters. Bioindicators are used widely in ecological assessments as biotic assemblages reflect the environmental conditions in current ecosystems. However, the robustness of bioindicators relies on the transferability of indices and models outside the regions they were derived from. We tested the reliability of stream diatom assemblages as indicators of water chemistry and climatic factors in a cross-regional assessment by developing a predictive model with diatom assemblage data from Sweden and using it to model stream conditions in Finland. The inference models and predictions were performed using the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) method, separately in species and genus levels. The predictive performance of the calibration models in Sweden were good or moderate for both water chemistry and climatic variables, both at species and genus levels. The most important climatic (growing degree days, r(2) = 0.57) and water chemistry variables (pH, r(2) = 0.65; and total phosphorus (TP), r(2) = 0.52) could be inferred from diatom assemblages relatively well. However, predictive performances of the cross-regional models were low (r(2) <= 0.13). Nevertheless, water chemistry variables, conductivity (r(2) = 0.13) and TP (r(2) = 0.12), were predicted the best. The most important diatom indicators for climatic and environmental variables varied between Sweden and Finland. The study showed that diatom assemblages can be robust indicators of water chemistry and climatic variables within the region where the inference models are calibrated. However, their indicator ability may be weak between regions. The reason for the low transferability of the diatom inference models may stem from between-region differences in species realized niches, species pools and/or ecosystems, local adaptation or species identification. Hence, models should only be used with caution in geographical contexts other than the one where they were developed. The calibration data should cover as large geographical area as possible to give reliable predictions when applied in smaller regions.

AB  - Modem environmental risks and threats relate with the negative impact of anthropogenic and natural factors on ecosystems, man-caused negative impact of industrial and potentially hazardous objects, pollution of drinking water sources, agricultural land, atmospheric air, deviation of the geological environment and subsoil on the safety of life in certain areas. Coal enterprises are one of the objects of high ecological danger and critical infrastructure. Today, environmental safety in the east of Ukraine should be considered in close connection with the ecological and man-made threats associated with combat operations in these territories. The authors carried out an analysis of scientific researches of past years and provided an assessment of environmental risks in the territories of coal mining enterprises in the present conditions considering the structural-geological, geofiltration and mining-geological parameters typically for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. The article considers the location of mines in Donetsk and Lugansk regions as zones of high ecological danger. The existing ecological threats and risks are determined, recommendations for minimization threats and risks in case of anthropogenic and environmental disasters are provided. The equation of calculating the coefficient of filtration in rocks is made, mineral-technical parameters of coal mines are analyzed. It is shown that one of the most probable factors of the transition of the territory into a zone of an emergency situation of a regional scale is the emergence of real threats to the life of a large number of people in the conditions of mass flooding of mines due to the termination of power supply of drainage and ventilation systems. Also in the article scientifically substantiated the provision of an acceptable level of environmental safety of the constituent parts of the environment (water environment) for the population living within the mining and agglomeration, taking into account the environmental factors of the negative factor-forming factors, as well as forecasting the hydrodynamic situation.

AB  - Fuelled by the generalized degradation of freshwater ecosystems, the development of tools to assess their ecological status has been the focus of intensive research in the last decades. Although fish are one of the key biological quality elements used to describe the ecological status of rivers, fish metrics that accurately respond to disturbances in Mediterranean trout type streams are still lacking. In these systems, multimetric indices are not optimal indicators because of their low species richness and abundances, thus alternative approaches are needed. Since carrying capacity defines the potential maximum abundance of fish that can be sustained by a river, its relationship with actual density (D/K ratio) could be an accurate indicator of population conservation status and consequently of the ecological status of the river. Based on this rationale, we modeled carrying capacity dynamics for 37 brown trout populations during a 12-year study period. We analyzed the response of the D/K ratio to a gradient of increasing environmental harshness and degradation in order to assess its suitability to accurately measure brown trout conservation status. Our results showed that the D/K ratio was highly sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in environmental conditions and the levels of human-induced environmental degradation. Variations in the environmental and human degradation factors included in the best explaining regression models developed for the whole population and by age classes accounted for between 58 and 81% of the variation in the D/K ratio. Likewise, the D/K ratio was sensitive to both general and life stage specific disturbance factors. Further analyses helped identify the factors limiting population abundance. Therefore, the D/K ratio could be an interesting indicator to consider when defining objective management plans and corrective actions in degraded rivers and streams subject to Mediterranean climatic conditions.

AB  - Departing from the pedocentric approach, the Estonian soil classification (ESC) is used as a baseline in studying the adequacy of alternative (treating other ecosystems compartments) classifications (forest site types, natural grasslands types, humus cover types). The interrelationships of different classifications are analysed in relation to normally developed mineral soils (forming 72.4% of Estonian soil cover) by means of these soils' pedoecological schema. On this genetic-functional schema the pedo-ecological position of soils is characterized by (1) eight-stage litho-genetic scalar and (2) six-stage moisture and aeration conditions scalar. In evaluation of the coinciding extent the total classification units' number, the coinciding percent of unit borders and variability of mean units' accordance was taken into account. The mean accordance of soils units to forest sites, natural grasslands and humus covers types is accordingly 2.2, 3.3 and 1.5. Very good coincidence with soils is seen in natural grasslands and good, in humus covers. The matching of forest site types' classification with soils is imperfect. The mean accordance of forest site types to soils and humus cover units is accordingly 0.50 and 0.74; of humus covers units to soils and forest site types, accordingly 0.68 and 1.35. The humus form (humus cover), formed in the course of mutual interrelationships of plants and soils, reflects more precisely the existing pedoecological conditions and is therefore a good indicator for the characterizing of soils' biological activity and productivity. Plant associations of natural grasslands and forests are in long-time scale more changeable (in connection to anthropogenic and environmental pressure) as compared to soil cover properties. Based on soil properties, an ecosystem approach to management, classification and protection of natural resources is highly recommended. The ecosystems management should be developed in accordance with the dominant soil varieties of the soil cover. As a natural body between plant and soil covers, the humus cover merits much more attention.

AB  - Freshwaters are among the most endangered ecosystems worldwide, due predominantly to excessive anthropogenic practices compromising the future provisioning of ecosystem services. Despite increased awareness of the role of multiple stressors in accounting for ecological degradation in mixed land-use stream systems, risk assessment approaches applicable in field settings are still required. This study provides a first indication for ecological consequences of the interaction of organic and inorganic chemical stressors, not typically evaluated together, which may provide a missing link enabling the reconnection of chemical and ecological findings. Specifically, impaired ecological conditions - represented by lower abundance of meiobenthic individuals - were observed in the hyporheic zone where a contaminant groundwater plume discharged to the stream. These zones were characterized by high xenobiotic organic concentrations, and strongly reduced groundwater (e.g. elevated dissolved iron and arsenic) linked to the dissolution of iron hydroxides (iron reduction) caused by the degradation of xenobiotic compounds in the plume. Further research is still needed to separate whether impact is driven by a combined effect of organic and inorganic stressors impacting the ecological communities, or whether the conditions - when present simultaneously - are responsible for enabling a specific chemical stressors availability (e.g. trace metals), and thus toxicity, along the study stream. Regardless, these findings suggest that benthic meioinvertebrates are promising indicators for supporting biological assessments of stream systems to sufficiently represent impacts resulting from the co-occurrence of stressors in different stream compartments. Importantly, identification of the governing circumstances is crucial for revealing key patterns and impact drivers that may be needed in correctly prioritizing stressor impacts in these systems. This study further highlights the importance of stream-aquifer interfaces for investigating chemical stressor effects in multiple stressor systems. This will require holistic approaches for linking contaminant hydrogeology and eco(toxico)logy in order to positively influence the sustainable management of water resources globally.

AB  - A high biodiversity is essential to guarantee the stability and functioning of coastal marine ecosystems. In this perspective, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive provides prescriptions to maintain (or restore) marine biodiversity in order to achieve a Good Environmental Status (GES). Eutrophic conditions-as determined by the accumulation of sedimentary organic matter (OM) are often associated with biodiversity loss, so that eutrophic conditions are often considered a pre-requisite or a proxy for degraded ecological conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the combined use of benthic trophic status and nematode biodiversity as integrated indicators of the environmental status of marine coastal ecosystems. To achieve this objective, we investigated nematode species diversity and assemblage composition in three areas of the Adriatic Sea, characterised by different OM quantity and biochemical composition (as proxy of sedimentary trophic status) and affected by different levels of anthropogenic impact. We show that, on the basis of OM quantity and biochemical composition, the investigated sites can be classified from oligo-to meso-trophic, whereas the analysis of nematode biodiversity indicates that the ecological quality status (EQS) ranged from bad to moderately impacted. This result provides evidence that trophic status and environmental quality assessments are not interchangeable tools for the assessment of marine ecosystems EQS. Rather they should be considered as complementary proxies for the overall assessment of the (good) ecological status. Data reported here also indicate that the loss of benthic biodiversity, whatever the source of disturbance, may be associated to a decrease of the functional diversity (either as feeding and life strategies traits), which might have important consequences on ecosystems functioning. Our results suggest that the GES cannot be defined uniquely in terms of sedimentary trophic status, especially when many other multiples stressors can contribute to determine the overall environmental quality of the investigated ecosystems. Nematode biodiversity is highly sensitive to differences in ecological conditions at different spatial and temporal scales and it can provide reliable and complementary information for the assessment of the environmental status in marine coastal sediments.

AB  - Fish assemblages are reckoned as indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, which has become a key feature in water quality management. Under this con-text, guilds of fish are useful for both understanding aquatic community ecology and for giving sound advice-to decision makers by means of metrics for-indices of biotic integrity. Artificial neural networks have proved useful in modelling fish in rivers and lakes. Hence, this paper presents a back-propagation network (BPN) for modelling fish guilds composition, and to examine the contribution of five environmental descriptors in explaining this composition in the Garonne basin, south west France. We employed presence-absence, data and five variables: altitude, distance from the river source, surface of catchment area, annual mean water temperature,and annual,mean water flow. We found that BPN performed better for predicting species richness of guilds than multiple regression models. The standardised determination coefficient of observed values against estimated values was used to characterise model performance; it varied between 0.55 and 0.82. Some models showed high variability which was presumably due to spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability or sampling uncertainty. Surface of catchment area and annual mean water flow were the most important environmental descriptors of guilds composition. Both variables imply human influence (i.e. land-use and flow regulation) on certain species which are of interest to environmental managers. Thus, predicting guilds composition With a BPN from landscape variables may be a first step to assess metrics for water quality indices in the Garonne basin. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenically driven changes in upstream watershed conditions strongly influence the hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes within downstream riverine and deltaic ecosystems. The goal of our study was to examine temporal trends and spatial patterns in ecologically relevant hydrological variables within the Athabasca River watershed and the downstream PeaceAthabasca Delta (PAD), located in northwestern Canada. Temporal trends for a suite of indicators of hydrologic alteration, appropriate for cold regions environments, were explored using non-parametric MannKendall trend analysis. Results in the Lower Athabasca River (LAR) watershed were placed in a watershed-scale context. Across the two study periods (A 1958-2009 and B 1974-2009), results indicated decreasing trends in several key drivers of deltaic system hydrology, including short-term and long-term maximum and minimum runoff. In addition, an increasing trend in hydrograph variability was observed within the watershed. A spatially discrete pattern was apparent from the data, with a greater number of significant trends noted within the headwater region as compared with other areas of the watershed. Although earlier dates of annual freeze-up were observed across the watershed, there were few observable patterns in ice-on/ice-off conditions on the river. If these historical trends in freeze-up continue on the LAR, water levels in the PAD channels and inland wetlands could be affected, leading to reduced habitat diversity and altered ecosystem productivity. The study illustrates significant natural variability in the hydrological regime within the LAR that should be considered in future water management frameworks to ensure the preservation and maintenance of this Ramsar wetland site, particularly in the context of projected climate change and the increased water demands arising from upstream development associated with the Alberta Oil Sands.

AB  - Metacommunity theory emphasizes that local communities are jointly affected by environmental filtering and spatial processes. However, the roles of spatial processes are often given insufficient attention in bioassessment practices, which may bias the assessments of ecological status based on biotic metrics. Here, we quantified the relative importance and the seasonal stability of spatial processes, natural conditions and human-induced factors in structuring variation in different bioassessment metrics based on macroinvertebrate communities. Our study systems were two extensively sampled large and shallow lakes with strong nutrient gradients related to human disturbance. The roles of different drivers were examined for three kinds of indicators: general diversity, trait-based and taxonomic distinctness metrics, and their performance in characterizing human disturbance was evaluated. Overall, human-induced and spatial factors were all important in explaining variation in the three types of bioassessment metrics. Contrary to our expectations, however, we found that the importance of spatial processes on bioassessment metrics can be comparable to the effects of local environmental conditions at the within-lake scale. Furthermore, the results showed substantial seasonal variability in the relative roles of different drivers, which might be linked to life-cycle seasonality of macroinvertebrates. As expected, trait-based metrics generally were best associated with human-induced variables in both lakes, whereas general diversity and taxonomic distinctness metrics performed poorly. The low effectiveness of taxonomic distinctness metrics might due to low species richness associated with high nutrient levels. To conclude, our results suggest that bioassessment cannot exclusively rely on the idea of environmental filtering even if we focus on fine spatial scales. We hence strongly urge that spatial processes, natural drivers and temporal variability should be better considered in combination in the development and application of bioassessment approaches. In addition, taxonomic distinctness measures should be used with caution, especially for the ecosystems and organism groups typically characterized by low species richness.

AB  - Emission of ionizing radiation (IR) in the environment is a natural phenomenon which can be enhanced by human activities. Ecosystems are then chronically exposed to IR. But environmental risk assessment of chronic exposure suffers from a lack of knowledge. Extrapolation of data from acute to chronic exposure is not always relevant, and can lead to uncertainties as effects could be different between the two irradiation modes, especially regarding reproduction endpoint, which is an ecologically relevant parameter. In the present study, we decided to refine the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in response to acute and chronic gamma-irradiation by a global proteome label free LC-MS/MS analysis. C elegans were exposed to 3 common cumulated radiation doses for acute or chronic exposure condition and global modification of the proteome was studied. This analysis of protein expression has demonstrated the modulation of proteins involved in regulatory biological processes such as lipid transport, DNA replication, germ cell development, apoptosis, ion transport, cuticle development, and aging at lower doses than those for which individual effects on reproduction have been previously observed. Thus, these proteins could constitute early and sensitive markers of radio-induced reprotoxicity; more specifically HAT-1, RPS-19 in acute and VIT-3 for chronic conditions that are expressed in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, to focus on reproduction process, this analysis showed either repression or overexpression of 12 common proteins in organisms exposed to acute or chronic irradiation, respectively. These proteins include the vitello-genin cluster notably involved in lipid transport and oocyte maturation and proteins involved in cuticle development and molting i.e. COL-14, GLF-1, NOAH-1, NOAH-2, ACN-1. These results show that protein expression modulation is a sensitive and predictive marker of radio-induced reproductive effects, but also highlight limitation of data extrapolation from acute to chronic exposure for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Soil organisms play a crucial role in the terrestrial ecosystem. Plant protection products (PPPs) are known to affect soil organisms and might have negative impacts on soil functions influenced by these organisms. Little research has been performed to date on the impact of PPPs on tropical soil ecosystems. Therefore, in this study it was investigated whether the effects of the fungicide benomyl (chosen as a model substance) differ between tropical and temperate regions and whether data generated under temperate conditions can be used for the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in tropical regions. The effect of benomyl on earthworms was evaluated in acute and chronic laboratory tests modified for tropical conditions. These tests were performed at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and with two strains (temperate and tropical) of the compost worm Eisenia fetida. The fungicide was spiked in two natural and two artificial soils. In addition to the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) artificial soil, a tropical artificial soil (TAS), containing a tropical fern product (xaxim) instead of peat, was developed in this study. The results from the laboratory tests and a literature review showed that the effects of benomyl were, on average, lower under tropical conditions (LC50: 450-630 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/kg; EC50: 0.8-12.9 mg a.i./kg) than under temperate conditions (LC(5)0: 61-67 mg a.i./kg; EC50: 1.0-1.6 mg a.i./kg) by a maximum factor of 10.3 (acute tests) and 12.9 (chronic tests). This result might be caused by an increased degradation of benomyl, and/or its first metabolite carbendazim, at higher temperatures, but a different sensitivity of the two worm strains cannot be ruled out. Despite the lower toxicity under tropical conditions and assuming comparable application rates, a preliminary assessment confirms the risk of benomyl to soil invertebrates under both conditions.

AB  - Atmospheric acid deposition affects many streams worldwide, leading to decreases in pH and in base cations concentrations and increases in aluminum (Al) concentration. These changes in water chemistry induce profound changes in the diversity, structure and activity of biological communities and in ecosystem processes. However, monitoring programs rely only on chemical and structural indicators to assess stream integrity. Nevertheless, the ability of ecosystems to provide services rely on their functional integrity and thus ecosystem processes should be considered in monitoring programs. We assessed the potential for leaf litter decomposition, a fundamental ecosystem process in forest streams, to be used as a bioassessment tool of acidification effects on stream ecosystem functioning. In a field study in the Vosges Mountains (North-eastern France), using three leaf litter species (Alms glutinosa, Acer pesudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica) enclosed in fine and coarse mesh bags and incubated in streams flowing over granite or sandstone bedrock along an acidification gradient, we assessed if the response of litter decomposition to acidification depended on litter species, mesh size, parent lithology and acidification level. In a meta-analysis of 17 primary studies on the effect of acidification on leaf litter decomposition, reporting 67 acidified - reference stream comparisons, we assessed the consistency in the response of litter decomposition to acidification cross studies and the robustness of litter decomposition to be used as a bioassessment tool. Both the field study and meta-analysis revealed an overall strong inhibition (> 60%) of leaf litter decomposition in acidified streams likely resulting from previously well described altered decomposer community structure and activity. No effect of leaf species was found in the field study, while in the meta-analysis inhibition of leaf litter decomposition in acidified streams was stronger for Fagus than for Acer, Quercus and Liriodendron. However, differences among leaf species in the meta-analysis might have been confounded by other differences among studies. The response of leaf litter decomposition to acidification was stronger in coarse than in fine mesh bags, indicating strong impairment of detritivore community structure and activity. The magnitude of inhibition also depended on parent lithology, but this is likely related to differences in the degree of acidification. Indeed, the magnitude of the inhibition of leaf litter decomposition increases with increases in H+ in Al concentration. Litter decomposition has the potential to be used as a bioassessment tool of acidification effects in streams since it shows consistent response to acidification across regions and is robust to experimental choices.

AB  - Indicators of redox conditions; oxygen, sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, iron and manganese, and in addition, bicarbonate and total organic carbon were studied in groundwater samples contaminated by leachate emanating from Revdalen Landfill (Norway). Based on these variables, the study aimed to deduce the redox conditions in the aquifer. Literature on landfill leachate contamination of confined aquifers is scarce and to the best of our knowledge, this study, which describes long-term analysis of redox chemistry, is the first of its kind in such an environment. Groundwater samples were monitored for a period of 24 years, enabling us to describe redox conditions on both short-term and long-term bases. Levels of measured parameters in the contaminated aquifer varied spatially and with time, but were generally elevated except oxygen; pH (4.9-8.8), oxygen (0-11.3 mg/L), sulphate (0-28 mg/L), nitrate (0-16 mg N/L), ammonium (0.02-40 mg/L), iron (0-99 mg/L), manganese (0.06-16 mg/L), bicarbonate (22-616 mg/L) and total organic carbon (1.3-47 mg/L). From the result, levels of iron, manganese, nitrate and ammonium violated the Norwegian drinking water norms. However, iron, ammonium, total organic carbon and bicarbonate showed strong attenuation along the groundwater flow path. By contrast, oxygen, nitrate and sulphate increased farther out in the plume. The redox conditions that developed in the aquifer were similar to those previously reported for phreatic aquifers, structuring by proximity to the landfill as sulphate-reducing, iron-reducing, manganese-reducing, nitrate-reducing, and finally aerobic condition. Eventually, there was an apparent breakdown of this system due to ecosystem shift in the landfill when leachable reduced ions were depleted and the landfill became aerobic. Overall, the redox framework provided remarkable attenuation to contaminants, and thus prevented potential degradation of ecological health due to the landfill leachate. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Remnant forests in urban areas are hotspots of urban biodiversity. However, the survival and integrity of many remnant forests are currently at risk. Better knowledge of the interactions between remnant forests and urban environments is urgently needed for guiding the conservation effort. In this study, we intend to answer the question: how do patch attributes and landscape patterns of surrounding environments affect the taxonomic diversity of woody plants in urban forest remnants? We surveyed the woody plant species in 240 sample plots in 54 remnant forest patches in Guiyang City, China. We analyzed the taxonomic diversity of woody plants and the effects of influencing factors using multi-level taxonomic diversity indicators and the generalized dissimilarity modeling. The results showed that shrubs had higher within-patch alpha-diversity than that of trees. However, adult trees had higher among-group beta-diversity than those of shrubs and saplings/seedlings. The vegetation type of the patch had more influence than other factors on the compositional dissimilarity of adult trees and sapling/seedling among patches. The patch size had the highest impact on the compositional dissimilarity of shrubs. Besides, small patches had a higher rate of compositional turnover in all woody plants. The percentage of impervious surfaces in surrounding areas and the spatial distance from each other were the main influencing factors for adult trees and saplings/seedlings, respectively. Based on our results, we recommend that more attention should be paid to preserve the small remnant forest patches and protect sampling/seedlings to maintain the taxonomic diversity of urban remnant forests.

AB  - In North Carolina and elsewhere, there is concern that excessive nutrient loading and resulting hypoxic conditions in coastal ecosystems are adversely affecting the native fauna, but quantifying the effects on fish can be difficult. Hypoxia may reduce fish growth via direct exposure or indirectly (e.g., cost of low-oxygen avoidance, reduced food availability, and density-dependent effects in oxygenated refuges). Given the fine spatial and temporal scale of oxygen dynamics in estuarine habitats, evaluating the impacts of hypoxia on fish growth requires short-term growth indicators that integrate the effects of rapidly changing environmental conditions. To address this need, we experimentally determined the sensitivity and response time of a suite of bioindicators of recent growth (RNA: DNA ratio and RNA concentration in muscle tissue; insulin-like growth factor-I messenger RNA expression in the liver; hepatosomatic index; and Fulton's condition factor K) to changes in the specific growth rate of juvenile Spot Leiostomus xanthurus. A model based on multiple bioindicators was better at estimating growth rate than models based on single indicators. We used this model to estimate recent growth rates of juvenile Spot collected from the Neuse River estuary and related them to recent dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Estimated growth rates of Spot collected after a week of good DO conditions were almost twice those of Spot collected after a week of poor DO conditions. Using these results and DO data from the Neuse River estuary in 2007-2010, we estimated that hypoxia dynamics reduced Spot growth over the summer by 6-18% in these years relative to growth under constant good DO conditions. This approach can be used to evaluate impacts of observed or modeled scenarios of water quality dynamics on growth of juvenile Spot and serves as a template for development of predictive growth models for other species.

AB  - A new method is proposed to assess Biological Orders (BO) of river sites and to compare biological structures of watercourses using two general ecological traits (typological preferendum and typological amplitude) of 187 species of aquatic insects (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera) specified in a previous database (Verneaux et al., 2003).
   A community is defined as an arrangement of species which have various abundances, typological preferenda (tp) and typological amplitudes (ta). In the field, any species assemblage was considered possible, and a river site community was analyzed using two descriptors: its relative species richness and its Biological Order, calculated using the abundance and the ecological traits ( tp, ta) of the recorded species. The BO of a river site, with a range from 0 to 10, constitutes a mean community point which plots the site on a theoretical upstream-downstream gradient defined by a species continuum ( Verneaux et al., 2003).
   The grounds and the BO assessment are presented, followed by the method applied to a site of the upper course of the Loue River ( French Jura). Community changes which occurred between 1975 and 2000 are specified. The Loue pattern was then plotted with other watercourses in a typological graph where biological structures of rivers are compared using a biological templet. This method, showing differences to the templet, allows to estimate biological changes referable to different levels of disturbance.
   Biological Orders and the significance of the biological templet are then discussed. The proposed typological analysis, giving both the Biological Order of a river site and its distance from the biological templet, constitutes a useful tool for running waters diagnosis and biological integrity assessment.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pressures often jeopardize ecosystem integrity and policy-relevant conservation management in protected areas. To harmonize nature conservation with human well-being, EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 suggests Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) as the key concept for environmental planning and management in EU Member States. Applying this procedure is challenging due to its data-demanding and multidisciplinary nature, resulting in the ecoystem services (ES) approach being scarcely used in protected areas management. Increased data availability under EU biodiversity-related inventories and monitoring projects, as well as theoretical and empirical research advances developed during the last decade, should be put into practice to guide Member States towards local management frameworks and scenario building under the ongoing changes in the EU socio-economic environment. This study aims at filling this gap by embodying into the MAES operational framework a scenario-based approach and demonstrates this in a challenging case study of a Natura 2000 site, Lake Stymfalia, in Greece. The present management strategy, an ecological-friendly management practice, a water-efficient management practice and a non-environmentally friendly option (e.g. ecosystem destruction) are examined for current and future water demand under current and future climatic scenarios. The proposed methodological framework for ES operationalization is based on the available data (derived by EU Directives and/or modelling), expert judgment and stakeholder involvement. Therefore, this work applies and tests the importance of the MAES approach as a management and coordination platform. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens have been used as indicators of environmental quality around a municipal solid waste landfill in C Italy. An integrated approach, using the diversity of epiphytic lichens, as well as element bioaccumulation and physiological parameters in the lichen Flavoparmelia caperata (L.) Hale was applied along a transect from the facility. The results highlighted the biological effects of air pollution around the landfill. The Index of Lichen Diversity (ILD) increased and the content of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn) decreased with distance from the landfill. Clear stress signals were observed in lichens growing in front of the facility, i.e. discoloration, necrosis, membrane lipid peroxidation, lower ergosterol content, higher dehydrogenase activity. Decreased photosynthetic efficiency, altered chlorophyll integrity and production of secondary metabolites were also found. The results suggested that lichens can be profitably used as bioindicators of environmental quality around landfills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental indicators must have a predictable relationship with stressors to be of value in ecological assessments. We evaluated the information provided by commonly implemented monitoring indicators as a means of assessing of the level of ecological impact experienced by coastal lagoons in New South Wales, Australia. Existing data for environmental variables in coastal lagoons were correlated with independent estimates of catchment disturbance. There were few relationships between the monitoring variables (particularly water chemistry) and nutrient loads and catchment land use. Data from NSW catchments and lagoons were compared to analogous data from published northern hemisphere studies and it was clear that stressor variables were up to one to two orders of magnitude smaller in NSW, potentially explaining the lack of relationships with recognised indicators.
   Our study has highlighted the importance of using a range of indicators to assess trends in ecological condition of an estuarine ecosystem, particularly where stressor levels are not great. Using water quality as the sole means of determining lagoon condition was simply inadequate in NSW lagoons. We recommended that ecological outcome indicators such as algal abundance (macro and micro) and turbidity were most likely to show interpretable patterns at low to moderate nitrogen loadings (<40 kg Ha(-1) yr(-1)) and that these should form the basis of estuarine trend monitoring in NSW lagoons. The demonstrated value of seagrass and macroalgal monitoring in estuaries with moderate to high nutrient loadings suggests that these indicators should not be overlooked when planning monitoring programs, recognising, however, they will not have strong discrimination at lower catchment loadings.

AB  - Forest ecosystems can be greatly affected by multiple interacting disturbances, with outcomes that may range from degraded and poorly-functioning to novel but productive ecosystems. We assessed the vulnerability of boreal biotic indicators (epigeic beetles, understory plants, ectomycorrhizal fungi) to compound soil disturbances at 20 years post-logging in northcentral British Columbia (Canada) to examine these issues of ecological integrity. The study was a full factorial experiment with 3 levels of organic matter removal (tree boles only; tree boles + logging slash; tree boles + logging slash + forest floors) and 3 levels of soil compaction (0, 2, 4 cm impression), with a tree species split-plot of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii). There was little effect of soil disturbance on ground-dwelling beetles, particularly beneath pine. Removal of forest floors and, to a lesser degree, compaction significantly altered plant and fungal communities. There was no effect of retaining logging slash but a consistent influence of tree species on biotic communities likely due to initial differences in conifer growth rates. Average community dissimilarity of the 3 guilds from a least disturbed baseline (tree bole removal, no compaction) increased linearly by a small amount (4-6%) with each level of disturbance severity. Some degree of soil disturbance across landscapes can be acceptable in creating regeneration niches for rare and functionally important pioneer species, but we also see losses in ecological integrity, such as the spread of invasive plants, that merit concern in managing these ecosystems.

AB  - Although anthropogenic degradation of riverine systems stimulated a multi-taxon bioassessment of their ecological integrity in EU countries, specific responses of different taxonomic groups to human pressure are poorly investigated in Mediterranean rivers. Here, we assess if richness and composition of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages show concordant variation along a gradient of anthropogenic pressure in 31 reaches across 13 wadeable streams in central Italy. Fish and invertebrate taxonomic richness was not correlated across sites. However, Mantel test showed that the two groups were significantly, albeit weakly, correlated even after statistically controlling for the effect of environmental variables and site proximity. Variance partitioning with partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that the assemblages of the two groups were influenced by different set of environmental drivers: invertebrates were influenced by water organic content, channel and substratum features, while fish were related to stream temperature (mirroring elevation) and local land-use. Variance partitioning revealed the importance of biotic interactions between the two groups as a possible mechanisms determining concordance. Although significant, the congruence between the groups was weak, indicating that they should not be used as surrogate of each other for environmental assessments in these Mediterranean catchments. Indeed, both richness and patterns in nestedness (i.e. where depauperate locations host only a subset of taxa found in richer locations) appeared influenced by different environmental drivers suggesting that the observed concordance did not result from a co-loss of taxa along similar environmental gradients. As fish and macroinvertebrates appeared sensitive to different environmental factors, we argue that monitoring programmes should consider a multi-assemblage assessment, as also required by the Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Understanding ecosystems within and around airports can help to determine the causes and possible mitigation measures for collisions between aircraft and wildlife. Small mammal communities are an important component of the semi-arid savanna ecosystems of Namibia, its productivity and its ecosystem integrity. They are also a major direct attractant for raptors at airports. The present study compared the abundance and diversity of small mammals between Namibia's 2 main airport properties (Hosea Kutako International Airport and Eros Airport), and among areas of land used for various purposes surrounding the airports. A total of 2150 small mammals (3 orders, 11 species) were captured over 4 trapping seasons. Small mammal abundance was significantly higher at the end of the growing season than during the non-growing season. The grass mowing regimen in current management plans at the airports resulted in a significant reduction of small mammal abundance at Hosea Kutako during the non-growing season only, thus indicating that annual mowing is effective but insufficient to reduce the overall abundance of mammal prey species for raptors. Small mammal numbers were significantly higher at Hosea Kutako Airport compared to the cattle and game farming land surrounding the airport, while no differences in small mammal densities or diversity were found for areas with different land uses at and surrounding Eros. The study suggests that the fence around Hosea Kutako provides a refuge for small mammals, resulting in higher densities. It also indicates that different surrounding land use practices result in altered ecosystem function and productivity, an important consideration when identifying wildlife attractants at airports.

Better suitability of diatom indices in investigating the quality of eutrophic, organically enriched waters compared to oligotrophic waters is demonstrated. More robust data sets on taxonomy and autecology of a great number of diatom species are required to make the indices more powerful tools in monitoring water quality and ecological integrity of streams in the region.

AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is an efficient approach to address the challenge of megacities forest landscape degradation. However, a holistic FLR planning framework economically reconciling human development needs with the integrity of our environment is still lacking. Using the ordered weighted averaging operator, one of the multicriteria evaluation methods, integrated with geographic information system and participatory techniques, this study aims to explore the FLR planning and prioritizing issues for the Miyun Reservoir Catchment, the local strategic surface water source area of Beijing City. A set of planning frameworks was established to flexibly and visually plan the priority areas (subwatersheds) using aggregation operators for weighted biophysical and socioeconomic criteria. As such, a complete spectrum of alternative FLR plans represents the different tradeoffs among criteria and further indicates the complicated interactions between conservation and development objectives. The optimal FLR plans fully considering the local environmental challenges led by severe water crisis should focus more on conservation rather than development with the available resources. The resulting spatial distribution of priority subwatersheds suggests that future FLR activities should be extended more to upstream Hebei Province. Both the conservation plans and sensitivity analysis indicate that the biophysical criteria regarding catchment conservation, particularly the water purification service, should be further emphasized in future FLR planning. Finally, to better balance the objectives of conservation and development, local well-functioning markets of Payment for Ecosystem Services should be fostered step-by-step based on the view of natural capital to achieve the desired win-win outcomes.

AB  - Here we show that verrucomicrobial community structure and abundance are extremely sensitive to changes in chemical factors linked to soil fertility. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint and real-time quantitative PCR assay were used to analyze changes in verrucomicrobial communities associated with contrasting soil nutrient conditions in tropical regions. In case study Model I ("Slash-and-burn deforestation") the verrucomicrobial community structures revealed disparate patterns in nutrient-enriched soils after slash-and-burn deforestation and natural nutrient-poor soils under an adjacent primary forest in the Amazonia (R = 0.819, P = 0.002). The relative proportion of Verrucomicrobia declined in response to increased soil fertility after slash-and-burn deforestation, accounting on average, for 4 and 2 % of the total bacterial signal, in natural nutrient-poor forest soils and nutrient-enriched deforested soils, respectively. In case study Model II ("Management practices for sugarcane") disparate patterns were revealed in sugarcane rhizosphere sampled on optimal and deficient soil fertility for sugarcane (R = 0.786, P = 0.002). Verrucomicrobial community abundance in sugarcane rhizosphere was negatively correlated with soil fertility, accounting for 2 and 5 % of the total bacterial signal, under optimal and deficient soil fertility conditions for sugarcane, respectively. In nutrient-enriched soils, verrucomicrobial community structures were related to soil factors linked to soil fertility, such as total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sum of bases, i.e., the sum of calcium, magnesium and potassium contents. We conclude that community structure and abundance represent important ecological aspects in soil verrucomicrobial communities for tracking the changes in chemical factors linked to soil fertility under tropical environmental conditions.

AB  - Caging is an active biomonitoring strategy that employs a sentinel species, sometimes a species naturally absent from the studied site, in the surveillance of water bodies to verify whether biota may be at risk. The main advantage of caging is the possibility to standardize several biotic and abiotic parameters. However, little knowledge is available about the effects of confinement on physiology and metabolism of caged organisms. The aim of this study is to characterize confinement and food access restriction effects, induced via caging experiments using a multi-biomarker approach (biometric data, immunity, antioxidant, metabolic detoxication, and digestive enzymes). The study has been undertaken using the same experiment conducted in ecosystem conditions using three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) during two different periods: one in April, corresponding to breeding season, and the other in October, outside breeding season. Fifteen fish were maintained for 21 days in different conditions (caged or uncaged and with or without food supply). The main result was that confinement stress had little impact on the biological markers of sticklebacks. However, the stressors seemed to increase the negative effects of food restriction on these biomarkers, when sticklebacks needed more energy, that is, during their breeding period. Outside breeding period, most investigated biomarkers were not impacted by caging. This study showed a way to specify the conditions of application and interpretation of biomarkers during active monitoring to ensure an effective, reliable diagnosis of water body quality.

AB  - Boreal forest ecosystems are adapted to periodic disturbance, but there is widespread concern that conventional forest practises degrade plant communities. We examined vegetation diversity and composition after clearcut logging, mechanical and chemical site preparation in eight 5- to 12-yr old studies located in southern boreal forests of British Columbia and Quebec, Canada to find useful indicators for monitoring ecosystem integrity and to provide recommendations for the development and testing of new silvicultural approaches. Community-wide and species-specific responses were measured across gradients of disturbance severity and the results were explained in terms of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and a simple regeneration model based on plant life history strategies. Species richness was 30 to 35% higher 5 to 8 years after clearcut logging than in old forest. Total and vascular species diversity generally peaked on moderately severe site treatments, while non-vascular diversity declined with increasing disturbance severity. On more-or-less mesic sites, there was little evidence of diversity loss within the range of conventional silvicultural disturbances; however, there were important changes in plant community composition. Removing soil organic layers caused a shift from residual and resprouting understory species to ruderal species regenerating from seeds and spores. Severe treatments dramatically increased non-native species invasion. Two important challenges for the proposed natural dynamics-based silviculture will be 1) to find ways of maintaining populations of sensitive non-vascular species and forest mycoheterotrophs, and 2) to create regeneration niches for disturbance-dependent indigenous plants without accelerating non-native species invasion.

AB  - Using the approach established by EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), a shoreline monitoring survey was conducted in August and September 1999, encompassing the Florida Panhandle from Perdido Key, Florida to Port St. Joe, Florida. The objective of this survey was to demonstrate the use of a probabilistic survey for monitoring and estimating the condition of swimmable beach areas. Thirty stations were sampled using a probabilistic sampling design. Hydrographic data were collected in addition to samples for water chemistry. Bacterial indicators, enterococci and fecal coliforms, were enumerated from the water according to the EPA Beaches Environmental Assessment Closure and Health (BEACH) Program and Florida state guidelines. Additional criteria for site condition included the presence or absence of primary and secondary dunes, anthropogenic debris and vegetation. Based on EMAP evaluation guidelines and Florida state criteria, a baseline assessment of the condition of the Gulf of Mexico beach resources surveyed is presented.

AB  - In connection with the increasing negative impact of invasive alien species on biodiversity and the environment in general, their research, as well as throughout the world, is relevant. The distribution of the Heracleum sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum of the secondary range on the example of the Kyiv agglomeration is investigated in the work. In our study we aimed to evaluate the possibility of spontaneous spread of giant hogweeds in the secondary range, adaptation of the species to the new conditions of the environment that favor to control of these species' expansion and reduce the threat to the urban ecosystems and citizens' health. We hypothesise that in the secondary range H. sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum settle sites with relatively high temperature (Tr), lightening (Lc), and soil moisture conditions similar to that in their natural range. 17 populations and four localities (sites) of H. sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum were studied. They were found within forest, meadow, riverine and ruderal plant communities. It is indicated that the advent species fully adapted to the conditions of the environment. The difference by ecological indicators Lc2 and Tm1 is pointed out. According to the results of our research, for the area of Kyiv urban agglomeration the growth of H. sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum is indicated in the plants communities of six classes. They spread most in ruderal plant communities of the: Robinietea, Artemisietea, Epilobietea classes. The studied species belong to invasive plant species in Ukraine and are characterized by extremely high effect on the environment and high invasive potential.

AB  - The impact of ozone on forest ecosystems in Italy is monitored within the CONECOFOR programme. Ozone levels are measured in 30 plots using passive samplers. Response parameters used are: crown condition (transparency), BAI (basal area increment), and visible symptoms on spontaneous vegetation. Levels of AOT40 are above the concentration-based critical level of 5 ppmh in all sites, but the evidence of impact on forest vegetation remains limited. Ozone is a predictor of crown transparency residuals in beech sites over two consecutive years, but the variance explained amounts to less than 10%. The relation between BAI reduction and ozone is even less certain. Transparency and BAI are more readily explainable in terms of ecological conditions of the site and climate fluctuations. The interpretation of visible symptoms is doubtful, and is conditioned by the prevailing ecological factors in the areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding community assembly patterns with regard to functional traits, which may be common to different species, allows us to compare ecological communities in a wider range of environmental and phytogeographic conditions. Moreover, a functional approach may facilitate the comprehension of the relation between biotic changes and ecosystem functions in complex systems such as tropical forests. Considering the lack of information in relation to the influence of environmental conditions on lichen functional traits, on lichen functional patterns in tropical forests and the potential usage of this approach in bioindication studies, this paper aims at (i) determining the functional structure of the lichen communities along the forest succession gradient, (ii) assessing the relation of lichen functional traits to this gradient and (iii) verifying the potential of using lichen functional traits as indicators of successional stages in tropical rainforests. Lichens were sampled in 24 sampling units of three successional stages (6-10; 12-20; and 40-60 years of recovering). The results corroborated our main hypothesis that the functional structure of the lichen communities responds to structural changes along a forest regeneration gradient. Growth forms (foliose, fruticose and crustose) as well as some reproductive trait states (lirella, isidia and perithecia) were the most suitable lichen traits to be used as indicators of forest succession in the southern edge of the Atlantic Rainforest. Lirella, fruticose and foliose were more related to earlier successional stages; isidia was more related to intermediate stages, while perithecia and crustose were more related to older stages. These results reinforce the ability of lichens to be used as bioindicators of forest conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are common across Europe and dominate some Mediterranean river networks. In all climate zones, IRES support high biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. As dynamic ecosystems that transition between flowing, pool, and dry states, IRES are typically poorly represented in biomonitoring programmes implemented to characterize EU Water Framework Directive ecological status. We report the results of a survey completed by representatives from 20 European countries to identify current challenges to IRES status assessment, examples of best practice, and priorities for future research. We identify five major barriers to effective ecological status classification in IRES: 1. the exclusion of IRES from Water Framework Directive biomonitoring based on their small catchment size; 2. the lack of river typologies that distinguish between contrasting IRES; 3. difficulties in defining the 'reference conditions' that represent unimpacted dynamic ecosystems; 4. classification of IRES ecological status based on lotic communities sampled using methods developed for perennial rivers; and 5. a reliance on taxonomic characterization of local communities. Despite these challenges, we recognize examples of innovative practice that can inform modification of current biomonitoring activity to promote effective IRES status classification. Priorities for future research include reconceptualization of the reference condition approach to accommodate spatiotemporal fluctuations in community composition, and modification of indices of ecosystem health to recognize both taxon-specific sensitivities to intermittence and dispersal abilities, within a landscape context.

AB  - Food production processes may have both positive and negative environmental sustainability impacts. This makes decision-making challenging in the transition towards more sustainable food production systems. In this paper, a new method for presenting environmental impacts in the context of planetary boundaries is demonstrated. This will help food and agricultural producers compare the magnitudes of various environmental impacts.
   The environmental sustainability impacts of an organic sheep farm in the boreal climate zone in Finland are studied herein first using a life cycle assessment method. The results are then normalized and presented in a planetary boundary framework to ascertain the extent of different environmental impacts.
   The results show that in the planetary boundary context, there are positive impacts of sheep grazing on biosphere integrity (genetic diversity) and biogeochemical flows and negative impacts on climate change, land use or freshwater use. Magnitudes of the impacts greatly dependent on the assumptions made especially regarding biosphere integrity impacts. In the future, it is crucial that decision-making be based on the evaluation of various environmental impacts and that the focus be more on complex sustainability thinking, rather than on one single environmental impact.
   This research demonstrates that results from a life cycle assessment can be modified and presented in a planetary boundaries context. A planetary boundary framework approach similar to that proposed herein could be further used to identify different environmental sustainability perspectives and to help one better recognize the multifunctional aspects of the ecosystem processes.

AB  - Developing scientifically credible tools for measuring the success of ecological restoration projects is a difficult and a non-trivial task. Yet, reliable measures of the general health and ecological integrity of ecosystems are critical for assessing the success of restoration programs. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (Task Force), which helps coordinate a multi-billion dollar multi-organizational effort between federal, state, local and tribal governments to restore the Florida Everglades, is using a small set of system-wide ecological indicators to assess the restoration efforts. A team of scientists and managers identified eleven ecological indicators from a field of several hundred through a selection process using 12 criteria to determine their applicability as part of a system-wide suite. The 12 criteria are: (1) is the indicator relevant to the ecosystem? (2) Does it respond to variability at a scale that makes it applicable to the entire system? (3) is the indicator feasible to implement and is it measureable? (4) Is the indicator sensitive to system drivers and is it predictable? (5) Is the indicator interpretable in a common language? (6) Are there situations where an optimistic trend with regard to an indicator might suggest a pessimistic restoration trend? (7) Are there situations where a pessimistic trend with regard to an indicator may be unrelated to restoration activities? (8) Is the indicator scientifically defensible? (9) Can clear, measureable targets be established for the indicator to allow for assessments of success? (10) Does the indicator have specificity to be able to result in corrective action? (11) What level of ecosystem process or structure does the indicator address? (12) Does the indicator provide early warning signs of ecological change? In addition, a two page stoplight report card was developed to assist in communicating the complex science inherent in ecological indicators in a common language for resource managers, policy makers and the public. The report card employs a universally understood stoplight symbol that uses green to indicate that targets are being met, yellow to indicate that targets have not been met and corrective action maybe needed and red to represent that targets are far from being met and corrective action is required. This paper presents the scientific process and the results of the development and selection of the criteria, the indicators and the stoplight report card format and content. The detailed process and results for the individual indicators are presented in companion papers in this special issue of Ecological indicators. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The assessment of the nutritional status of fish is a central requirement of fisheries management. However, there has been little consensus on the appropriate indicator to use, and even less effort toward defining biological thresholds and reference points. With current efforts to manage fisheries in an ecosystem context, environmental effects and trophic relationships need to be considered and appropriate indicators developed. To address this concern, we compiled five different studies in which multiple indicators of nutritional status were applied to Striped Bass Morone saxatilis of different age-classes, geographical origins, and environments (cultured and wild). Proximate composition analysis was used to compare measured lipid concentrations in the anterior dorsal muscle against selected indicators, including Fulton's condition factor, relative weight, percent moisture, and an index of visceral body fat. The results suggest that weight-at-length indices are less sensitive than proximate analysis and poorly related to lipid concentration. However, models developed for both moisture and the body fat index adequately represent tissue lipids and offer clear thresholds of lipid depletion. We propose the use of the proportion of Striped Bass with anterior dorsal muscle composed of more than 80% moisture, or classified as having no observable visceral body fat, as a working protocol for thresholds of poor condition in ecosystem approaches to Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass management. Further, based on historical data we propose an interim target condition of 75% of individuals containing less than 80% moisture as a management goal. Received May 3, 2011; accepted December 19, 2012

AB  - The term biodiversity describes the array of interacting, genetically distinct populations and species in a region, the communities they comprise, and the variety oi ecosystems of which they are functioning parts. Ecosystem health, a closely related concept, is described in terms of a process identifying biological indicators, end points, and values. The decline of populations or species, an accelerating trend worldwide, can lead to simplification of ecosystem processes, thus threatening the stability and sustainability of ecosystem services directly relevant to human welfare in the chain of economic and ecological relationships. The challenge of addressing issues of such enormous scope and complexity has highlighted the limitations of ecology-as-science. Additionally biosphere-scale conflicts seem to lie beyond the scope of conventional economics, leading to differences of opinion about the commodity Value oi biodiversity and of the services that intact ecosystems provide. In the face of these uncertainties, many scientists and economists have adopted principles that clearly assign burdens of proof to those who would promote the loss of biodiversity and that also establish ''near-trump'' (preeminent) status for ecological integrity. Electric utility facilities and operations impact biodiversity whenever construction, operation, or maintenance of generation, delivery, and support facilities alters landscapes and habitats and thereby impacts species. Although industry is accustomed to dealing with broad environmental concerns (such as global warming or acid rain), the biodiversity issue invokes hemisphere-wide, regional, local, and site-specific concerns all at the same time. Industry can proactively address these issues of scope and scale in two main ways: first, by aligning strategically with the broad research agenda put forth by informed scientists and institutions; and second, by supporting focused management processes whose results will contribute incrementally to the broader agenda of rebuilding or maintaining biodiversity.

AB  - The effect of controlled sub-surface CO2 emissions on edaphic ciliate communities was examined in experimental mesocosms and then compared with the effect of natural CO2 emissions from natural vents on edaphic ciliate communities to analyse the potential of ciliates as bioindicators of soil CO2 increments. The relative abundance of each taxonomic family formed the basis for developing the metrics of the ciliate assemblages in order to obtain a quantitative soil quality bioassessment, the edaphic ciliate bioindex. Twenty-four mesocosms filled with soil and equipped with controlled CO2 injection were built for the experiment. To evaluate the potential of soil ciliates as bioindicators, the same CO2 fluxes were analyzed in both study conditions, from 0 to more than 150 ml CO2 d(-1). Several diversity indices and other group ratios and percentages of community structure were calculated.
   Biodiversity of ciliates (Equitability, Margalef and Shannon indices) decreased with the increase in CO2 fluxes, and Colpodid/Polyhymenophorean ratio increased. This indicated adverse conditions for the ciliates in the soil. There was a positive significant relationship between the observed CO2 values measured in the test set and the values expected according to their inhabiting ciliate community. The weighted averaging of taxonomic group indicator method supported the experimental results attesting to the potential of edaphic ciliates as bioindicators of CO2 flux increments. The ecological profiles estimated within the training test, based on the taxonomic level of family, were reliable and provided a basis for the use of ciliates to monitor soil CO2 flux increments in a wide range of ecological conditions.

We studied the diets of herring gulls Larus argentatus and great black-backed gulls L. marinus on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, a remote colony which has shown high levels of contaminants in herring gull eggs and which has experienced significant ecological and anthropogenic change in its surrounding marine region over the past 40 yr. Analysis of regurgitated pellets suggested that current gull diets have proportionally less offshore prey (e. g. fish) and terns and tern eggs, and proportionally more molluscs, rock crabs Cancer borealis, and seal Halichoerus grypus carrion than diets sampled 40 yr ago. The composition of recent diets observed from pellet analysis is supported by stable isotope mixing models of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), which revealed that great black-backed gulls had high proportions of seals and crab in their diets, whereas herring gulls had high proportions of crab, sand lance Ammodytes sp., and terrestrial invertebrates. Isotopic analyses also identified dietary variability through seasonal, age-specific and body condition relationships for each species. Biometric-isotope relationships showed that larger great black-backed gulls fed at higher trophic levels, and that higher trophic level foraging in herring gulls was associated with better body condition. Collectively, these results indicate dietary partitioning within this community of sympatrically nesting gulls, and broad-scale dietary shifts since the early 1970s.

AB  - 1. Pollution of mangrove ecosystems puts their future and that of local communities at risk. Only the use of informed and integrative approaches will successfully maintain and restore these valuable ecosystems.
   2. Biochemical indicators of organism physiological condition have been widely used to evaluate habitat quality and for early detection of the impact of stressors. Mangrove crabs may be useful bioindicators of the quality of mangrove habitats, as they are characteristic and ecologically important organisms in mangrove environments.
   3. The physiological condition (evaluated by the RNA/DNA ratio) of Perisesarma guttatum (Grapsidae) and Uca annulipes (Ocypodidae) was assessed to determine its potential as an indicator of habitat quality in one polluted and two relatively unpolluted Mozambican mangroves, during the rainy and dry seasons.
   4. Both species showed seasonal effects on RNA/DNA ratio, but only U. annulipes was significantly affected by pollution. RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes may thus be a useful indicator of pollution and seasonality in mangrove habitats. There was a synergistic negative effect of the rainy season and pollution on the RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes. Due to higher DNA, rather than lower RNA contents, the RNA/DNA ratio of P. guttatum was always significantly lower than that of U. annulipes.
   5. The knowledge gathered in this study can be used in integrative strategies, policies and programmes aiming to sustain, maintain and restore mangrove areas, and for the evaluation of mangrove habitat quality. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiversity footprints quantify the impacts on ecosystems caused by final consumption in a region, accounting for imports and exports. Up to now, footprint analyses have typically been applied to analyze past or present consumption patterns. Here, we quantify future land-based biodiversity footprints associated with three diverging Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), using loss in Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) as an indicator of biodiversity loss. For each SSP, we retrieved socio-economic and land use projections to 2100 from the IMAGE-MAGNET model and calculated associated biodiversity footprints for seven aggregated world regions. We then compared these with the functional diversity component of the biosphere integrity planetary boundary. Our results indicate that the global land-based biodiversity impact stays below the boundary (tentatively set at 90% of original BII) in all scenario-year combinations. Contrastingly, the per capita boundary is transgressed in one, four and five out of the seven world regions in 2100 for SSP1 ('sustainability'), SSP2 ('middle of the road') and SSP3 ('regional rivalry'), respectively. These results indicate a strong difference in the biodiversity impact of final consumption between the regions and between SSPs. Even in the 'sustainability' scenario, the per capita biodiversity footprint of consumption in North America needs to be reduced to meet the per capita boundary. Thus, policy-making to safeguard the environment would benefit from adopting region-specific strategies: focusing on realizing agricultural efficiency gains in regions with unexploited potential, while focusing on promoting dietary changes towards less animal-based consumption in regions with limited potential for additional efficiency gains.

AB  - Large, migratory predators are often cited as sentinel species for ecosystem processes and climate-related changes, but their utility as indicators is dependent upon an understanding of their response to environmental variability. Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.

AB  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the potential use of the aquatic lichen Dermatocarpon hiridum as bioindicator of copper pollution. Lichen thalli were exposed to 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mM copper in synthetic freshwater to solve the problems of metal bioavailability. The mineral composition of this media was prepared so that it corresponded to the ion composition of natural waters in D. luridum ecosystems. Sequential elution procedures using NiCl2 or Na-2-EDTA (20 mM) were used to determine the distribution of metals at different cellular sites. The copper concentration extracted from thalli was correlated with pollution intensity, the greater correlation being with the Na2-EDTA extractant. The malondialdehyde concentration in thalli can be used as indicator of copper pollution, however, similar membrane degradation was observed for 0.25 and 0.50 mM copper and for 0.75 and 1.00 mM copper.

AB  - Vertebrate and invertebrate taxa that serve as forage for predators play a critical role in coastal ecosystems by linking lower trophic levels to ecologically and economically valuable predators in upper trophic levels. We analyzed long-term data from multiple monitoring surveys in Chesapeake Bay and its major tributaries to evaluate patterns and relative abundances of forage at two spatial scales and to identify drivers of forage availability. Time series of forage abundances showed positive spatial correlation, becoming increasingly similar with declining distance between tributaries and regions of Chesapeake Bay. Statistical models were fit to identify relationships among forage taxa and climatic, biological, and environmental variables. Annual abundance indices of many forage taxa were higher in years when spring water temperatures warmed slowly, as indicated by an annual 5 degrees C degree-day warming index that represented the rate of warming during late winter/early spring. Forage indices also were related (in taxon-specific ways) to winter-spring chlorophyll concentration and freshwater discharge, and to three summer water quality variables: dissolved oxygen, salinity, and water temperature, in addition to a broad-scale climate indicator (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation). Our findings broadly demonstrate that bottom-up climate forcing acts to control at least some taxa at lower trophic levels in Chesapeake Bay. Ongoing phenological changes in regional climate and evidence of spatial dependence in responses of forage to environmental conditions underscore the likelihood that spatiotemporal foraging conditions for predator species will change under projected climate conditions.

AB  - Expanding human population and urbanization alters freshwater systems through structural changes to habitat, temperature effects from increased runoff and reduced canopy cover, altered flows, and increased toxicants. Current stream assessments stop short of measuring health or condition of species utilizing these freshwater habitats and fail to link specific stressors mechanistically to the health of organisms in the stream. Juvenile fish growth integrates both external and internal conditions providing a useful indicator of habitat quality and ecosystem health. Thus, there is a need to account for ecological and environmental influences on fish growth accurately. Bioenergetics models can simulate changes in growth and consumption in response to environmental conditions and food availability to account for interactions between an organism's environmental experience and utilization of available resources. The bioenergetics approach accounts for how thermal regime, food supply, and food quality affect fish growth. This study used a bioenergetics modeling approach to evaluate the environmental factors influencing juvenile coho salmon growth among ten Pacific Northwest streams spanning an urban gradient Urban streams tended to be warmer, have earlier emergence dates and stronger early season growth. However, fish in urban streams experienced increased stress through lower growth efficiencies, especially later in the summer as temperatures warmed, with as much as a 16.6% reduction when compared to fish from other streams. Bioenergetics modeling successfully characterized salmonid growth in small perennial streams as part of a more extensive monitoring program and provides a powerful assessment tool for characterizing mixed life-stage specific responses in urban streams.

AB  - Land reclamation is disproportionate of areas that are diverted to mining, despite the requirements of environmental legislation. This creates an arena for the process of mine dumps overgrowth, which is similar to the renaturation abandoned sites. In a variety of the environmental conditions and with a wide amplitude of changes in factors, young ecosystems on the mine dumps and abandoned sites (after 30-70 years) form a spectrum of development pathways, which is characteristic of the adaptive self-organization of complex natural systems. Studying the various environmental restoration pathways of disturbed lands gives an understanding of the renaturation stages and rates, which allows moving to a controlled technology of plant and soil cover reproduction. The organic carbon accumulation values comparison in a comparable soil thickness showed that the efficiency of soil restoration in the forest-steppe with the postindustrial mine dumps renaturation compared to the restoration of the abandoned sites in the steppe zone were twice as high. This is due to the higher bioclimatic potential of the renaturation conditions; in particular, the sum of annual precipitation in the forest-steppe is more by 275 mm than in the steppe. However, the quantitative and qualitative indicators of pedogenesis (morphological structure, accumulation of organic carbon) show themselves similar to various bioclimatic conditions both in the renaturation of post technogenic and in the lands' ordinary mechanical disturbances, which would help to implement the universal technologies for the controlled renaturation of the disturbed lands. The established rates for the environmental rehabilitation of degraded land will be useful in implementing an irrecoverable conservation scenario where the most necessary types of ecosystems and aesthetic rehabilitation badlands can be formed.

AB  - While a significant effort has been made to understand how human activities influence biodiversity, less attention has been given to the consequences of tropical forest disturbance on belowground functional processes and its linkages with environmental drivers. Here, we demonstrate how selective logging influenced dung beetle communities and two associated ecological processes - namely, dung consumption and incidental soil bioturbation - in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, using a robust before-and-after control-impact design. We tested hypotheses about logging-induced changes on environmental condition (canopy cover, leaf litter and soil texture), community metrics (e.g. dung beetle species richness and biomass) and beetle-mediated faecal-detritus processing; and on the importance of the environment for beetle communities and functional processes. We show that post-logging changes in canopy openness do not necessarily mediate logging impacts on dung beetle diversity and biomass, which were directly influenced by reduced impact logging (RIL) operations. Although neither environmental condition (leaf litter or soil sand content) nor faecal consumption and incidental soil bioturbation were directly affected by RIL, the relationships between environmental condition and biological components were. By showing that selective logging alters the linkages among belowground ecological processes and environmental drivers, we provide support that logged forests can retain some important functioning processes, in particular faecal consumption, even when the dung beetle diversity and biomass are impoverished. These results provide support for the resistance of functional processes to logging-induced changes in biodiversity.

AB  - Aquatic and riparian plants play a crucial role in the functioning of riverine ecosystems. Hence, analyzing multiple facets of plant diversity could be extremely useful for assessing the ecological integrity of lotic ecosystems. The main objective of this study was to investigate the response of multiple facets of aquatic plant diversity, such as species richness, taxonomic distinctness and compositional dissimilarity, to environmental factors (i.e. nutrient pollution and hydromorphological alteration) in 72 stream reaches of mainland Greece. We employed Generalized Additive Models to identify the variables with the highest influence and examine the response of species richness and taxonomic distinctness to environmental gradients. The relationship between compositional dissimilarity and the environment was examined with Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling. Our results supported our hypothesis that human disturbances play a considerable role in shaping macrophyte assemblages. In particular, phosphates and hydromorphological modification were significant predictors of species richness, whereas taxonomic distinctness was unaffected by indicators of anthropogenic stress but it was influenced mostly by elevation, water temperature and pH. Concerning the compositional dissimilarity, geographic distance, elevation, temperature and total inorganic nitrogen were the most important environmental parameters. Our findings suggest that human stressors, such as hydromorphological modification and nutrient enrichment, affect the plant species richness at stream reach scale, but when considering community composition or taxonomic distinctness, environmental factors associated with the natural variability (e.g. elevation, temperature and geographic distance) are of higher importance. Overall, our results emphasize the advantage of examining multiple aspects of diversity when designing conservation schemes and management plans for riparian areas.

AB  - River managers in Australia are managing in the face of extremes to provide security of water supply for people, production and the environment. Balancing the water requirements of people, environments and economies requires that water security is viewed holistically, not just in terms of the water available for human consumption. Common definitions of water security focus on the needs of both humans and ecosystems for purposes such as drinking, agriculture and industrial use, and to maintain ecological values. Information about achieving water security for the environment or ecological purposes can be a challenge to interpret because the watering requirements of key ecological processes or assets are not well understood, and the links between ecological and human values are often not obvious to water users. Yet the concepts surrounding river health are inherently linked to holistic concepts of water security. The measurement of aquatic biota provides a valuable tool for managers to understand progress toward achieving ecological water security objectives. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the reference condition approach to river health assessment, using the development of the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS) as a case study. We make the link between the biological assessment of river health and assessment of ecological water security, and suggest that such an approach provides a way of reporting that is relevant to the contribution made by ecosystems to water security. The reference condition approach, which is the condition representative of minimally disturbed sites organized by selected physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, is most important for assessing ecological water security objectives.

AB  - Routine monitoring of benthic biodiversity is critical for managing and understanding the anthropogenic impacts on marine, transitional and freshwater ecosystems. However, traditional reliance on morphological identification generally makes it cost-prohibitive to increase the scale of monitoring programmes. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA has clear potential to overcome many of the problems associated with traditional monitoring, with prokaryotes and other microorganisms showing particular promise as bioindicators. However, due to the limited knowledge regarding the ecological roles and responses of environmental microorganisms to different types of pressure, the use of de novo approaches is necessary. Here, we use two such approaches for the prediction of multiple impacts present in estuaries and coastal areas of the Bay of Biscay based on microbial communities. The first (Random Forests) is a machine learning method while the second (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and quantile regression splines) is based on de novo identification of bioindicators. Our results show that both methods overlap considerably in the indicator taxa identified, but less for sequence variants. Both methods also perform well in spite of the complexity of the studied ecosystem, providing predictive models with strong correlation to reference values and fair to good agreement with ecological status groups. The ability to predict several specific types of pressure is especially appealing. The cross-validated models and biotic indices developed can be directly applied to predict the environmental status of estuaries in the same geographical region, although more work is needed to evaluate and improve them for use in new regions or habitats.

AB  - In spatial planning and management of protected areas, increased priority is being given to research that integrates social and ecological data. However, public viewpoints of the benefits provided by ecosystems are not easily quantified and often implicitly folded into natural resource management decisions. Drawing on a spatially explicit participatory mapping exercise and a Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) analysis tool, the present study empirically examined and integrated social values for ecosystem services and environmental conditions within Channel Islands National Park, California. Specifically, a social value indicator of perceived biodiversity was examined using on-site survey data collected from a sample of people who visited the park. This information was modeled alongside eight environmental conditions including faunal species richness for six taxa, vegetation density, categories of marine and terrestrial land cover, and distance to features relevant for decision-makers. Results showed that biodiversity value points assigned to places by the pooled sample of respondents were widely and unevenly mapped, which reflected the belief that biodiversity was embodied to varying degrees by multiple locations in the park. Models generated for two survey subgroups defined by their self-reported knowledge of the Channels Islands revealed distinct spatial patterns of these perceived values. Specifically, respondents with high knowledge valued large spaces that were publicly inaccessible and unlikely to contain on-ground biodiversity, whereas respondents with low knowledge valued places that were experienced first-hand. Accessibility and infrastructure were also important considerations for anticipating how and where people valued the protected land and seascapes of Channel Islands National Park.

AB  - Background. Stream ecosystems reflect human impacts on the environment. An understanding of the threats affecting these ecosystems and the development of tools to assess them is key for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. Puerto Rico is an oceanic island with dense human presence and strong pressures over freshwater resources that result in the degradation of water bodies. Aquatic macroinvertebrates respond to pollution and are good indicators of anthropogenic impacts on streams. Goals. To describe major threats to the ecological condition of streams in Puerto Rico and introduce two biomonitoring indices based on macroinvertebrates that allow for the assessment of stream condition on the island. Methods. We proposed a standardized methodology for the use of the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and Family Biotic Index (FBI) modified for Puerto Rico. Results. Major threats to aquatic ecosystems in Puerto Rico are associated with urbanization, water extraction, and untreated water discharges. For the elaboration of the indices, a tolerance value was assigned to each of the 87 taxonomic groups reported for Puerto Rico. Based on stream sampling, impact scales were developed for the BMWP-PR and FBI-PR. In addition, a standardized methodology is proposed to avoid sampling biases. Conclusions. The conservation status of rivers in Puerto Rico is relatively good compared with other tropical regions. The indices proposed (BMWP-PR, FBI-PR) are the first developed for the island with the goal of evaluating the ecological condition of streams. The indices are proposed as a starting point, future efforts should focus on the development of additional tools.

AB  - Landscape, in this paper, is defined as ''a complex of geographically, functionally and historically interrelated ecosystems'' (also: ''organised land''). For its planning and management, mapping of geomorphological, hydrological, and climatic conditions is crucial to understand the ecological patterns. To warrant the landscape's sustainability, its ecosystems' multiple and interdependent functions should be carefully identified on macro-, meso- and micro-level. It is argued that, whereas a natural ecosystem is homogenous, the landscape ecosystem is heterogeneous, for example in a mosaic or zoned way.
   Like evolution in organisms, succession in ecosystems tends do develop toward increasing independency from environmental fluctuations (increasing autonomy of the systems). On the contrary, landscape ecosystems have increasingly lost their regional autonomy over the last decades, as external input technologies became favoured. However, theories and practices of ecological (organic) agriculture, low external input oriented as they are, tend to re-enforce the local ecosystems' autonomy together with the regional identity. In the Netherlands intensive and widespread land reclamation (polders and floodplains) made hydro-ecology a major landscape-ecology determinant. Distribution patterns of floristic species are found to reflect the hydro-dynamic conditions in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Provided that suitable knowledge on local conditions is available, they can be used as indicators of potential sites for nature regeneration and indicate landscape degradation as well. Even though potentially favouring agro-ecosystems diversity and regional autonomy, ecological types of agriculture, as currently defined by law, do only promote nature on the farm when the farmer dedicates special attention it as an additional objective of his (organic) farming.

AB  - Monitoring changes of anthropogenic impacts from a broad scope of species in biodiversity research require practical, easy-to-use and efficient assessment as well as monitoring methods. Odonates (Insecta: Odonata) are a valuable tool for assessing freshwater systems' quality and have been used as bioindicators of environmental variety. The agueda watershed, located in the central west of the Iberian Peninsula, shows an exponential increase in the last 60years of natural resource exploitation coupled with alterations in consumer habits, causing significant environmental changes and deferred direct effects on the natural habitats. Fourteen river sites, selected a priori, were sampled. Adult odonates were collected using standardized methods. Selected environmental variables and water quality parameters were evaluated in situ. Precipitation and altitude were the most important physical, environmental variables in explaining the assemblage structure. Meaningful abiotic-biotic as well as biotic-biotic relationships were set up. Furthermore, situations in the urbanized watershed area showed to be highly impacted and closely related with damselfly Ischnura graellsii, which should be targeted as a possible vulnerability indicator for polluted fresh waters. A probability map for Ischnura graellsii distribution was performed using indicator kriging with external drift and spatial uncertainty obtain through the calculation of two categorical maps (binary), corresponding to the mean (0.485) and the trimmed mean by discharging the 10% lower distribution tail (0.533). The subsequent overlapping of both categorical maps (binary) allowed the definition of the higher spatial uncertainty map for surface water contamination. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The fluvial system has been under strong human pressure, due to a lack of urban planning, which has triggered a potentially dangerous potable water problem for human consumption and irrigation. These changes in the quality of the fluvial systems have promoted important microclimatic changes, within the niche of special aquatic fauna, macroinvertebrates, that have a susceptible population dynamics to habitat disturbances. For sustainable development it is necessary to consider aquatic atmosphere conservation and to propose an adequate management plan, which includes bioindicators as a potential tool, to evaluate the perturbation grade and monitor the fluvial system within the water conservation plan. A bioindicador is defined as a set of species, with specific requirements in relation to physical or chemical variables, so that the significant changes of these variables indicates for the species that the system is perturbed and the species are close to tolerance limits. The assemblages of macroinvertebrates are the best bioindicators of contaminated water, because they are very abundant, are present in all the fresh water ecosystems, easy to collect and monitoring is low cost. The taxa to consider for environmental quality are: Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plecoptera, Diptera, Odonata and Coleoptera. In this work we suggest the use of these aquatic macroinvertebrates as biological bioindicators, and their utility as biotic indices to estimate the tolerance of benthos to the polluting agents (BMWP, IBMW, BMWQ, IBF, EPT, the percentage of scrapers and the abundance of Chironomidae) as well as the functional response of these organisms to the polluting agents. Increasing studies of biomarkers leads to a better understanding of how fresh water is affected by a pollutant.

AB  - Marine constructions modify physical conditions by interfering with water circulation and increasing sedimentation and pollution, leading to biological homogenization. However, they also increase the availability of hard substrata for larval recruitment, resulting in the development of a diverse sessile community and associated fish fauna. To describe how the modifications caused by a floating marina affect reef fish assemblages at Sdo Sebastiao Channel, SW Atlantic, a multiparameter probe and a visual census methodology were used to compare the abiotic conditions and the diversity and abundance of fishes between two areas: the area inside the marina where boats are moored and the breakwater, an area more similar to nearby natural rocky shores. The area inside the marina presented more turbid and productive waters, while the breakwater was more turbulent. The abundance of fishes inside the marina was greater than at the breakwater throughout the study, but species richness was higher inside the marina only during the hot and wet period (Austral Summer and Spring). Fish assemblages were strictly different, between areas. Species dominance for each area and at nearby natural rocky reefs was also different. This study shows that artificial habitat causes micro-spatial modifications to local fish assemblages. As spatial variations were related to the behavioural and ecological aspects of fishes, marine facilities should be carefully planned, and engineering principles should be combined with ecological processes to better resemble natural habitats, thereby reducing environmental impacts.

AB  - The pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae), has successfully been employed as an indicator species to evaluate acute biological changes in polluted human-living environments after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Here, we quantitatively examined the field sampling efficiency of the butterfly and its associated sexual sampling bias under different conditions, which may provide important information for environmental risk assessment. Sampling data were obtained in 2014 and 2015 from 87 localities across Japan. Across the localities, the mean capture rate was 17 individuals per hour per person, and males represented approximately 80% of the collected butterflies. No significant difference was detected in the capture rate under different weather conditions. Among the four habitats, the riverside showed a significantly higher capture rate than the city park. A shorter sampling time tended to yield a higher capture rate. Comparisons among prefectures and districts of collection localities revealed that the Kanto district had significantly higher percentages of collected males than 4 other districts. Fukushima prefecture also had high percentage, although not significant. A generalized linear mixed model indicated that the capture rate was significantly negatively affected by the agricultural village, the city park, the rainy weather, and latitude and positively by longitude. Together, the present study showed high sampling efficiency and versatility of this butterfly as an indicator for environmental risk assessment but simultaneously suggested preferable conditions for a field sampling design. This study also suggested a possibility that the Fukushima nuclear accident or other factors might have affected behavioral or population dynamics of the butterfly.

AB  - Although public and financial support for stream restoration projects is increasing, long-term monitoring and reporting of project successes and failures are limited. We present the initial results of a long-term monitoring program for the Lower Red River Meadow Restoration Project in north-central Idaho, U.S.A. We evaluate a natural channel design's effectiveness in shifting a degraded stream ecosystem onto a path of ecological recovery. Field monitoring and hydrodynamic modeling are used to quantify post-restoration changes in 17 physical and biological performance indicators. Statistical and ecological significance are evaluated within a framework of clear objectives, expected responses (ecological hypotheses), and performance criteria (reference conditions) to assess post-restoration changes away from pre-restoration conditions. Compared to pre-restoration conditions, we observed ecosystem improvements in channel sinuosity, slope, depth, and water surface elevation; quantity, quality, and diversity of in-stream habitat and spawning substrate; and bird population numbers and diversity. Modeling documented the potential for enhanced river-floodplain connectivity. Failure to detect either statistically or ecologically significant change in groundwater depth, stream temperature, native riparian cover, and salmonid density is due to a combination of small sample sizes, high interannual variability, external influences, and the early stages of recovery. Unexpected decreases in native riparian cover led to implementation of adaptive management strategies. Challenges included those common to most project-level monitoring-isolating restoration effects in complex ecosystems, securing long-term funding, and implementing scientifically rigorous experimental designs. Continued monitoring and adaptive management that support the establishment of mature and dense riparian shrub communities are crucial to overall success of the project.

AB  - We propose a framework in which thresholds of potential concern (TPCs) and limits of acceptable change (LACs) are used in concert in the assessment of wetland condition and vulnerability and apply the framework in a case study. The lower Murrumbidgee River floodplain (the 'Lowbidgee') is one of the most ecologically important wetlands in Australia and the focus of intense management intervention by State and Federal government agencies. We used a targeted management stakeholder workshop to identify key values that contribute to the ecological significance of the Lowbidgee floodplain, and identified LACs that, if crossed, would signify the loss of significance. We then used conceptual models linking the condition of these values (wetland vegetation communities, waterbirds, fish species and the endangered southern bell frog) to measurable threat indicators, for which we defined a management goal and a TPC. We applied this framework to data collected across 70 wetland storages', or eco-hydrological units, at the peak of a prolonged drought (2008) and following extensive re-flooding (2010). At the suggestion of water and wetland mangers, we neither aggregated nor integrated indices but reported separately in a series of chloropleth maps. The resulting assessment clearly identified the effect of rewetting in restoring indicators within TPC in most cases, for most storages. The scale of assessment was useful in informing the targeted and timely management intervention and provided a context for retaining and utilising monitoring information in an adaptive management context.

AB  - Stress in animals has been linked to behavioural and physiological changes in response to environmental, social and anthropogenic stimuli. Hence, stress-related responses in animals, especially in rodents, have been used as biological indicators of ecosystem health. This study aimed to establish an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for monitoring adrenocortical activity in free-ranging Namaqua rock mice Micaelamys namaquensis (Rodentia: Muridae) using faeces as a prerequisite for assessing the effects of anthropogenic land use and season on faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentration. Rodents were live-trapped seasonally across four land use types: an agricultural crop farm, an agricultural livestock farm, a human-populated site and a nature reserve; all situated in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Determined fGCM concentrations from capture and recapture events were used for biologically validating an EIA detecting steroids with a 5 alpha-3 beta-11 beta-diol structure. Recapturing resulted in a significant overall 40% elevation of individual fGCM concentrations demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen EIA to reliably detect glucocorticoid output in the study species. Neither land use type nor season affected fGCM concentrations in the species, suggesting that land use and season-related environmental changes do not necessarily act as stressors for M. namaquensis, presumably due to their adaptive and resilient nature. Such species can be used to identify ecosystems affected by human-mediated disturbances and allow insights into the management and restoration of these threatened ecosystems and their associated species.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between environmental factors and aquatic communities at the large scale is important for conserving freshwater biodiversity and sustaining ecological integrity. In this study, we evaluated the ecological status of the Han River watershed in Korea with the predictive distribution maps for EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa. From large-scale surveys, environmental and biological data for 360 sites in 189 streams and rivers in the Han River watershed in 2012 and 2013 were analyzed. Based on correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis, the factors influencing EPT richness were altitude, percent of coarse substrate, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total phosphorus (TP). DPI (distribution prediction index), indicating the distribution probability of EPT assemblages, was calculated by using a frequency ratio model. This index was high in the mountainous area where altitude and percent of coarse substrate were high, but low in the urbanized area where BOD and TP were high. Verification of the model indicated high reliability of DPIs as demonstrated by the low root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values between the predicted and observed values. This study provides a basis for the sustainable management of stream ecosystems as well as paves the way for future studies such as those on environmental assessment techniques using aquatic insect communities.

AB  - The diatoms are an ecologically important group of algae that have been extensively studied by ecologists and taxonomists. However, the large-scale patterns of diatom distribution and the factors underlying this distribution are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to identify the large-scale spatial patterns of benthic diatom assemblages in Korean streams and rivers, and to assess the importance of numerous environmental factors on diatom distribution. We classified 720 study sites based on diatom flora. Benthic diatoms, water chemistry, altitude, and riparian land cover and use were characterized by multivariate analyses, Monte Carlo permutation tests, and indicator species analysis. In total, we identified 531 diatom taxa. Diatom assemblages were mostly dominated by species of the genera Achnanthes, Navicula, Nitzschia, Cocconeis, Fragilaria (Synedra included), Cymbella, Gomphonema, and Melosira. Cluster analysis partitioned all 720 sites into eight groups based on diatom species composition. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that altitude, land cover and use, current velocity, electrical conductivity, and nutrient levels explained a significant amount of the variation in the composition of assemblages of benthic diatoms. At the national scale, a downstream ecological gradient was apparent, from fast-flowing, mostly oligotrophic highland streams to slow-flowing, mostly eutrophic lowland rivers. Our data suggest that spatial factors explain some of the variation in diatom distribution. The present investigation of the spatial patterns of benthic diatoms, the ecological determinants of diatom occurrence, and the identification of diatom indicator species contributes to development of a program for assessing the biological integrity of lotic ecosystems in Korea.

AB  - Although biomonitoring approaches are being increasingly used in the measurement of stream and river health, critical assumptions about the nature of biological populations and communities that underpin them are often ignored. Many approaches based on pattern detection in plant and animal communities assume high temporal persistence in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. However, this has been rarely tested with long-term data sets and there is evidence that this assumption is not true in some river systems. Biological processes, such as predation and recruitment, can account for considerable spatial and temporal variation in the structure of some stream communities. These processes may prevent the development of robust predictive models or indices based on pattern detection. Measurements of population or community attributes also are often used to infer ecosystem processes, yet the link between pattern and process has rarely been demonstrated. Many goals of river management relate to the maintenance of natural ecological processes and ecosystem function; direct measurement of these processes is, however, often neglected in assessment programs. Such measures are often sensitive to causal factors that are known to affect river health and it is possible to develop simple but powerful predictive models. Perhaps more importantly, should an impact to be detected, strategies for remediation are more obvious as the causal processes are generally better known. The ultimate success of biomonitoring approaches depends on how well we understand the biophysical processes that influence the structure and dynamics of stream and river systems, and the way they function.

AB  - Discussions of the coastal environment and its health can be improved by more precise use of terms and clarification of the relationship, if any, between the health of ecosystems and the risks to human health. Ecosystem health is seldom defined and, in any case, has to be regarded in different terms than human health. Ecosystem health should embody both the structure and function of the ecosystem. One attractive concept is to define the health of ecosystems in terms of their vigor, organization and resilience. From that perspective, the health of an ecosystem is reduced if it becomes a less vigorous producer of valuable living resources, less diverse and organized, and more susceptible to and slower to recover from stress. Useful indicators of ecosystem health should reflect these properties, but also be supported by understanding of cause and effect relationships generated through research. Significant challenges remain in the integration of indicators in terms of both their interrelationships and holistic significance. There is also a need to develop indicators that are relevant to emerging threats to coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Ecological networks are a useful tool to study the complexity of biotic interactions at a community level. Advances in the understanding of network patterns encourage the application of a network approach in other disciplines than theoretical ecology, such as biodiversity conservation. So far, however, practical applications have been meagre. Here we present a framework for network analysis to be harnessed to advance conservation management by using plant-pollinator networks and islands as model systems. Conservation practitioners require indicators to monitor and assess management effectiveness and validate overall conservation goals. By distinguishing between two network attributes, the 'diversity' and 'distribution' of interactions, on three hierarchical levels (species, guild/group and network) we identify seven quantitative metrics to describe changes in network patterns that have implications for conservation. Diversity metrics are partner diversity, vulnerability/generality, interaction diversity and interaction evenness, and distribution metrics are the specialization indices d' and H'(2), and modularity. Distribution metrics account for sampling bias and may therefore be suitable indicators to detect human-induced changes to plant-pollinator communities, thus indirectly assessing the structural and functional robustness and integrity of ecosystems. We propose an implementation pathway that outlines the stages that are required to successfully embed a network approach in biodiversity conservation. Most importantly, only if conservation action and study design are aligned by practitioners and ecologists through joint experiments, are the findings of a conservation network approach equally beneficial for advancing adaptive management and ecological network theory. We list potential obstacles to the framework, highlight the shortfall in empirical, mostly experimental, network data and discuss possible solutions.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate metrics are helpful tools for the assessment of water quality and overall aquatic ecosystem health. However, their degree of sensitivity and the most reliable metrics for the bioassessment program development are very poorly studied in Togo. This study aimed to test the sensitivity of metrics calculated at the family and genus levels. A total of 21 water quality parameters and macroinvertebrates' data were collected during three periods at 20 sampling sites within the Zio River. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), factor analysis (FA), and Spearman's correlation analysis were conducted on water quality parameters and macroinvertebrates' data. The results reveal that macroinvertebrate structure and composition were affected by water quality parameters related to human disturbances. In this study, three groups of macroinvertebrate communities were identified including sensitive taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata (EPTO) taxa; the resistant or resilient taxa such as Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Diptera, and Pulmonates (OHDP) taxa; and tolerant taxa such as Prosobranchia, Bivalvia, Lepidoptera, Heteroptera, and Coleoptera (PBLHC). All the 13 macroinvertebrate-based metrics were found to be sensitive in the detection of water quality and human disturbance gradients. However, metrics related to EPTO and the tolerance measure [multimetric index of the Zio River basin (MMIZB), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), and Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP)] are the most robust in discrimination of pressure gradients. This study reveals that macroinvertebrates are sensitive and can be used for the bioassessment program development at the order, family, or genera taxonomic level.

AB  - We evaluated the adequacy of an indicator of benthic community health to assess trawling disturbance by sampling epifauna at 6 sites subjected to variable fishing intensity in the Mediterranean: from no fishing, in an area associated to a marine reserve, to high fishing intensity, in trawling grounds. The proposed indicator is based on the biological traits composition of epifaunal species that determine vulnerability to trawling: mobility, fragility, position on substrata, average size and feeding mode. Five groups defined by the combination of these biological traits represented different levels of vulnerability to trawling. Results based on analysis of the relative abundance of these groups at each site showed that the biological traits significantly reflected ecosystem disturbance, with the less disturbed communities having the highest abundance of groups considered vulnerable to trawling. According to these findings a Trawl Disturbance Index (TDI) was proposed as a tool for fisheries managers to assess the ecosystem health. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There have been considerable advances in our understanding of the tolerance of species interaction networks to sequential extinctions of plants and animals. However, communities of species exist in a mosaic of habitats, and the vulnerability of habitats to anthropogenic change varies. Here, we model the cascading effects of habitat loss, driven by plant extinctions, on the robustness of multiple animal groups. Our network is constructed from empirical observations of 11 animal groups in 12 habitats on farmland. We simulated sequential habitat removal scenarios: randomly; according to prior information; and with a genetic algorithm to identify best- and worst-case permutations of habitat loss. We identified two semi-natural habitats (waste ground and hedgerows together comprising <5% of the total area of the farm) as disproportionately important to the integrity of the overall network. Our approach provides a new tool for network ecologists and for directing the management and restoration of multiple-habitat sites.

AB  - The sensitivity of eleven metrics using macroinvertebrate assemblages were evaluated in an environmental gradient in a tropical river in south-cast Brazil. Eight sites were sampled in an altitudinal range of 160-650 m.a.s.l. during 1999 (April and August) and 2000 (February). Four substrates were sampled at each site: riffle litter, pool litter, stony substrates and sediment. Correspondence Analysis indicated that assemblages were primarily more influenced by physical changes (like deforestation and erosion processes) than the water chemistry. The sensitivity of each metric was evaluated through the application of box-and-whisker plot method by its power to assess impairment (metrics should be able to discriminate reference sites from impaired sites) and natural variability (metrics should not discriminate two reference sites). Metrics that failed in at least one of the above premises were not considered as sensitive. In this study, the most sensitive metrics were Shannon index, BMWP-ASPT, %-EPT, and relative abundance of EPT to Chironomidae.

AB  - Worldwide forests have been impacted by broad-scale anthropogenic pressures, such as fire and logging, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems. The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of passerine bird communities in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) stands as a response to the changes induced by fire occurrence. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. The case of the pine stands of central Portugal was used to test the StDM performance in the scope of the wildfire problems. The datasets used in the dynamic model construction included the main gradients of environmental and biological characteristics of the studied maritime pine stands over space and time. The ecological integrity of the pine stands can be partly assessed by the observation of the occurrence of passerine indicators. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between conceptually isolated key-components of the studied ecosystems. The final model provided some basis to analyse the responses of selected passerine indicators to fire scenarios that characterize the region. In this context, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the passerine community dynamics by predicting the behavioural pattern of indicators roughly associated with their structural and functional composition and habitat main characteristics.

AB  - Ecological indicators have gained increasing attention within the scientific community over the past 40 years. Several taxonomic groups have been used successfully as indicators including most prominently fish, invertebrates, plants, and birds because of their ability to indicate environmental changes. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, there has been recent concern over the applicability of using indicators on a basin-wide scale due to species range restrictions and lake-based differences. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of the Index of Marsh Bird Community Integrity (IMBCI) to indicate land use disturbance surrounding coastal marshes of Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario. To meet this objective, we surveyed birds and vegetation at 14 marshes in Georgian Bay (low land use disturbance) and Lake Ontario (high land use disturbance). Even though Lake Ontario marshes were surrounded by significantly more altered land than Georgian Bay marshes, and had poorer water quality, we found significantly fewer birds in Georgian Bay marshes (mean = 8.2) compared to Lake Ontario (mean = 13.7) and no significant difference in IMBCI scores. This inconsistency could be due to vegetation differences affecting the strength of the index, because Georgian Bay wetlands had significantly more bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) and floating vegetation, while Lake Ontario wetland vegetation was taller and cattail-dominated (Typha spp.). These findings suggest that the IMBCI may not be useful on a basin-wide scale in the Great Lakes region in detecting human disturbance surrounding wetlands. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The importance of transfers of marine derived nutrients (MDN) in salmon between stream ecosystems and terrestrial riparian systems is a subject of much recent research which has established that MDN subsidies support populations of many animal species, affect riparian zone productivity and may control the biodiversity of riparian plant communities. Numerous biophysical processes are involved in the transfer of MDN between aquatic and riparian zones of streams but, the largest proportion of MDN transport across the aquatic-terrestrial interface appears to depend on the actions of a predator-scavenger complex (PSC) that in British Columbia includes at least 23 species of mammals and birds. Consequently, the role of salmon in maintaining riparian ecosystem integrity depends not only on spatial and temporal variations in salmon abundance but also on variations in the composition and strength of linkages between salmon and other PSC species. Measuring these linkages with traditional methods using direct observation would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. In the current paper laser activated camera systems, salmon carcass manipulation and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of hair samples were employed to (1) identify large vertebrate members of the PSC of riparian zone ecosystems and (2) quantify the strength of linkages of these PSC vertebrates to spatial and temporal changes in salmon abundance. Techniques developed and applied here to gain insights into the salmon PSC have several advantages over traditional survey methods. These include semi-automated capture of large volumes of data, identification of diurnally and nocturnally active PSC members, ready inclusion of experiments in field survey design, reduced impacts of unintentional human interference on survey results, and greatly reduced cost relative to direct observational studies. Results reported here confirm black bears (Ursus americanus), pine marten (Martes americana), cougar (Fells concolor), wolverine (Gulo luscus), eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), ravens (Corvus corox), and vultures (Cathartes aura) as large vertebrate members of the regional salmon PSC. However, the composition and strength of linkages between salmon and these PSC members vary so much in space and time that most appear unsuitable as generally useful indicators of the potential magnitude of salmon-dependent, MDN-transport from aquatic to riparian-zone ecosystems. Black bears however, given their high relative abundance, broad geographic distribution, and strong linkages to salmon represent a superior candidate for further development in combination with salmon, as indicators of the maintenance of MDN transport potential in future assessments of riparian ecosystem integrity of salmon bearing streams.

AB  - A Abstraction, diversion, and storage of flow alter rivers worldwide. In this context, minimum flow regulations are applied to mitigate adverse impacts and to protect affected river reaches from environmental deterioration. Mostly, however, only selected instream criteria are considered, neglecting the floodplain as an indispensable part of the fluvial ecosystem. Based on essential functions and processes of unimpaired temperate floodplain rivers, we identify fundamental principles to which we must adhere to determine truly ecologically-relevant environmental flows. Literature reveals that the natural flow regime and its seasonal components are primary drivers for functions and processes of abiotic and biotic elements such as morphology, water quality, floodplain, groundwater, riparian vegetation, fish, macroinvertebrates, and amphibians, thus preserving the integrity of floodplain river ecosystems. Based on the relationship between key flow regime elements and associated environmental components within as well as adjacent to the river, we formulate a process-oriented functional floodplain flow (ff-flow) approach which offers a holistic conceptual framework for environmental flow assessment in temperate floodplain river systems. The ff-flow approach underlines the importance of emulating the natural flow regime with its seasonal variability, flow magnitude, frequency, event duration, and rise and fall of the hydrograph. We conclude that the ecological principles presented in the ff-flow approach ensure the protection of floodplain rivers impacted by flow regulation by establishing ecologically relevant environmental flows and guiding flow restoration measures.

AB  - The insects of the order Odonata have an aquatic larval stage and land-dwelling adults. These insects play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are excellent bioindicators. The present study was based on a scientometric analysis of the research available on the Odonata, which aimed to identify the principal trends and gaps in the database on these organisms, compiled online from databases of the Institute for Scientific Information - ISI, Scielo and journals Odonatologica and International Journal of Odonatology. A total of 2317 papers were analyzed, permitting the detection of the following tendencies: a gradual increase in the number of papers occurred over time, most of the papers had an ecological perspective, most focused primarily on the adult stage and species level, and 49 studies focused on bio-indication by examining variation in the composition of the community, fluctuating asymmetry, bioaccumulation, species richness and abundance, and odonate habitat index (OHI). The increase in the ecological studies of odonates may reflect the dynamic characteristics of this order, and its relatively well-defined systematics, principally in the case of the adults. Despite the increase in the number of publications, there are still many gaps, such as biogeography, parasitism, competition within and among species, evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships, as well as studies of the larval stages of these organisms. Given the sensitivity of the members of this order to environmental variables, they may be used for the evaluation of aquatic systems, given their roles as detectors, exploiters or accumulators, depending on the type of response to environmental modifications.

AB  - Human activities, both established and emerging, increasingly affect the provision of marine ecosystem services that deliver societal and economic benefits. Monitoring the status of marine ecosystems and determining how human activities change their capacity to sustain benefits for society requires an evidence-based Integrated Ecosystem Assessment approach that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem functioning and services). Although, there are diverse methods to assess the status of individual ecosystem components, none assesses the health of marine ecosystems holistically, integrating information from multiple ecosystem components. Similarly, while acknowledging the availability of several methods to measure single pressures and assess their impacts, evaluation of cumulative effects of multiple pressures remains scarce. Therefore, an integrative assessment requires us to first understand the response of marine ecosystems to human activities and their pressures and then develop innovative, cost-effective monitoring tools that enable collection of data to assess the health status of large marine areas. Conceptually, combining this knowledge of effective monitoring methods with cost-benefit analyses will help identify appropriate management measures to improve environmental status economically and efficiently. The European project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) specifically addressed these topics in order to support policy makers and managers in implementing the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, we synthesize our main innovative findings, placing these within the context of recent wider research, and identifying gaps and the major future challenges.

AB  - Establishing nutrient reference condition (baseline environmental condition) of lakes in ecoregion is a critical consideration in the development of scientifically defensible aquatic nutrient criteria. Three methods were applied to determine reference conditions in Yungui Plateau ecoregion lakes with respect to total phosphorus, total nitrogen, planktonic chlorophyll a (chl a) and Secchi depth. First, minimally developed lake/catchment units were identified based on existing geographical database and visual basin survey. Lakes in these catchments were considered minimally disturbed reference lakes. Second, the frequency distribution of all of the lake data presently available by each variable was plotted, and the lower 25th percentile was selected as the reference condition for each value. Third, median nutrient, chl a and Secchi depth values were determined for the best one-third of lakes and applied as indicators of reference condition. The result of model prediction and data from historical record were used to test three techniques for determining reference condition. Reference conditions, as determined by these three methods, broadly agreed for all parameters. Overall, the data suggest that multiple methods can be used to determine reference condition, and that in Yungui lakes, reference condition corresponds to oligotrophicmesotrophic status.

AB  - Biological diversity is the basis for, and an indicator of biosphere integrity. Together with climate change, its loss is one of the two most important planetary boundaries. A halt in biodiversity loss is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Current changes in biodiversity in the vast landmass of Siberia are at an initial stage of inventory, even though the Siberian environment is experiencing rapid climate change, weather extremes and transformation of land use and management. Biodiversity changes affect traditional land use by Indigenous People and multiple ecosystem services with implications for local and national economies. Here we review and analyse a large number of scientific publications, which are little known outside Russia, and we provide insights into Siberian biodiversity issues for the wider international research community. Case studies are presented on biodiversity changes for insect pests, fish, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and steppe vegetation, and we discuss their causes and consequences.

AB  - We analyzed trends in a 23-year period of water quality and biotic data for Chesapeake Bay. Indicators were used to detect trends of improving and worsening environmental health in 15 regions and 70 segments of the bay and to assess the estuarine ecosystem's responses to reduced nutrient loading from point (i.e., sewage treatment facilities) and non-point (e.g., agricultural and urban land use) sources. Despite extensive restoration efforts, ecological health-related water quality (chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, Secchi depth) and biotic (phytoplankton and benthic indices) metrics evaluated herein have generally shown little improvement (submerged aquatic vegetation was an exception), and water clarity and chlorophyll-a have considerably worsened since 1986. Nutrient and sediment inputs from higher-than-average annual flows after 1992 combined with those from highly developed Coastal Plain areas and compromised ecosystem resiliency are important factors responsible for worsening chlorophyll-a and Secchi depth trends in mesohaline and polyhaline zones from 1986 to 2008.

AB  - Reservoirs are built mainly for public supply and power generation. However, water quality is almost always compromised by discharge of domestic and industrial sewage, as well as by agricultural residues. Several ecological indices are currently used to analyze different impacts in this environment. The aim of this study was to develop a zooplankton index for tropical reservoirs. Limnological data were obtained from seven Brazilian reservoirs (Atibainha, Broa, Barra Bonita, Salto Grande, Rio Grande, Itupararanga, and Igarata). Weighted values of ecological optimum were obtained through species response analysis (unimodal distribution) related to chlorophyll a concentration. The results obtained using the zooplankton index (ZBI) proposed had significant correlations with eutrophication indicators. Overall, poor and regular water quality were verified in most reservoirs, partially corroborating the zooplankton community index proposed for Brazilian reservoirs. For further progress, the approach presented here must be tested in other regions. In addition, the ecological indices derived from different aquatic communities should be integrated into a composite index.

AB  - Natural processes along with increased industrial production and the irresponsible behavior of mankind have resulted in environmental pollution. Environmental pollutants can be categorized based on their characteristics and appearance into the following groups: physical, biological, and chemical. Every single one of them represents a serious threat to the male reproductive tract despite the different modes of action. Male gonads and gametes are especially vulnerable to the effect of exogenous factors; therefore, they are considered a reliable indicator of environmental pollution. The impact of xenobiotics or radiation leads to an irreversible impairment of fertility displayed by histological changes, modulated androgen production, or compromised spermatozoa (or germ cells) quality. The present article reviews the exogenous threats, male reproductive system, the mode of action, and overall impact on the reproductive health of humans and animals.

AB  - Social and scientific factors are deeply enmeshed in each other within the development and the use of ecological indicators (EI). Yet low research has assessed which factors contribute to selecting ecological indicators on the long-term. This article proposes to study the historical construction of El by examining ecological, political, and social background of specific places where El were developed, in France on lakes and rivers. Our major findings in France were that ecological indicators were never optimised for the present market or political arena. Instead El development was typically recycling previous tools that were elaborated for other purposes by environmentally committed outsiders, without regular funding. We found that regular funding for monitoring an El was only provided when it matched an institution's goal. Beyond the geographically limited relevance of the case studies, these results therefore improve the theoretical framework we deploy when constructing or relying on indicators. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. Philosophically, the term 'river health' is useful because it is readily interpreted by the general public and evokes societal concern about human impacts on rivers. The common goal of achieving healthy rivers unites ecologists and the general public because the value of the ecologists' contributions is clear (and, hence, funded). The difficulty arises in the choice of relevant symptoms because there is a wide variety that can be measured with varying accuracy at a broad range of spatial scales. These indicators may respond to impacts at different time scales, and no single indicator is a 'silver bullet' that reveals river health unequivocally.
   2. In practice, choice of indicator often shows personal bias, technical considerations, and constraints of knowledge. Selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales for these measures is crucial. Although most measurements are spot samples (e.g. concentration, abundance, species richness), assessment of river health based on changes in ecological processes such as post-disturbance recovery rate or nutrient spiralling lengths may be more suitable in some cases.
   3. Problems include validation of the indicator, its response time at a range of scales, and the reliability of its measurement.,Assessment of river health should be accurate, timely (warning of deterioration instead of waiting until the patient is terminal), rapid (so that the response is swift), and inexpensive. The connectedness of running waters with their floodplains and catchments must be explicitly recognized. Hydrological and geomorphological modifications of rivers usually affect their health by severing or impairing the linkages, and the 'cure' may lie in addressing these causes. Often, we need landscape-level data for management because this is the scale where cumulative effects of impacts are evident.
   4. The prognosis is uncertain. We need to explore further the use of integrative measures of river health, and focus on establishing a link between the measure and impaired ecological integrity. Ecosystem-level variables (e.g. estimates of production or respiration) show promise and recent technological advances make these more accessible. Data analytical approaches (e.g. multimetric vs. predictive models) need further debate but must not overlook the importance of high quality and relevant input data. Appropriate choice of indicators, rigorous sampling and analysis, and careful data interpretation must be matched with effective communication to policy-makers and the public. When this occurs, the concept of 'river health' becomes more than just a rhetorical tool.'

AB  - It has now been well over 20 years since the North Sea Piper Alpha disaster in 1988. There have been many lessons learned: some documented others just etched in memory. The event chronicled many significant changes in the offshore industry. The emanating point for most sweeping changes has been the Cullen Report and the UK North Sea industry. This paper reviews some of the critical lessons and identifies many 'secondary' finer points that constitute important learnings. The paper looks at major changes instigated by step changes in safety criticality. It is argued that the 'second tier' modes of failure such as corrosion, materials degradation, environmental cracking, erosion, plant ergonomics, etc. need to be better examined. These mechanisms are dangerous threats to the integrity of deep subsea assets, and it is noted that such root causes of failure as witnessed or predicted have yet to be fully appraised. The authors' use wide experiences and case histories to highlight such concerns, offering rational fit-for-purpose solutions. The industry disconnections between, urgency to build, knowledge transfer, and management of change, are refocused. Powerful advances in risk-based mechanical, process, materials, and corrosion engineering are emphasized and the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) are reasoned for best life-cycle integrity. To keep up with the pace of growth in the deepwater sector, methods of concurrent and inherently safe design have evolved in a world where the practicalities and costs of modification, repair and retrofit are extremely difficult. Hence getting it right at the outset is paramount. Thus the drive for purposeful investment, at design is more justifiable, than the traditional practice of postponing costs (and problems) to operations. In this way the ominous 'gray' zone between the two cost enters is better bridged for reasons of safety and commercial advantage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) appears to impair the pig's small intestine digestive and absorptive capacities and, therefore, may affect the AA digestibilities. A crossover-designed experiment was conducted utilizing two 7-d periods with 8 pigs (30.8 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-type cannulas at the terminal ileum to analyze the effect of HS on both apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility of AA in pigs fed a wheat-soybean meal diet. Subcutaneous skin and ileal lumen temperatures were continuously monitored in 15-min intervals during the entire experiment. After recovery from surgery, all pigs were adapted to the diet and trained to consume the same amount of feed twice a day for 5 d in thermal-neutral (TN) conditions (22 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C). Following adaptation, pigs were divided into 2 groups (4 pigs each); 1 remained in TN conditions, and the other group was exposed to natural HS (24 degrees C to 45 degrees C) for 7 d (period 1). In period 2, the 2 groups switched environments. Ileal digesta were continuously collected for 12 h, starting at 0700 h, on d 6 and 7 of each period. Chromic oxide was used as an indicator of intestinal digesta flow. The subcutaneous and the ileal temperatures were increased between 1.3 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C in HS compared to TN pigs (P < 0.001). The AID of AA (%) for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 90.6, 88.1; His, 88.7, 85.9; Ile, 84.8, 83.9; Leu, 86.9, 84.1; Lys, 86.8, 86.2; Met, 89.8, 89.1; Phe, 86.0, 84.8; Thr, 76.7, 74.3; and Val, 82.8, 81.7, respectively. The SID (%) of AA for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 94.0, 92.0; His, 92.5, 90.2; Ile, 89.5, 88.1; Leu, 90.1, 88.6; Lys, 91.0, 90.1; Met, 94.4, 93.6; Phe, 90.4, 88.9; Thr, 86.0, 83.7; and Val, 88.1, 86.5, respectively. The AID of Arg, His, and Leu was lower (P < 0.01) in HS pigs, and the SID of Arg and His was also lower in HS pigs. Neither the AID nor the SID of the remaining essential AA was affected by HS. In summary, the digestibility of essential AA is differentially affected in pigs exposed to natural HS, and thus, special attention should be given to Arg and His when formulating diets for growing pigs under HS conditions.

AB  - Weight-length relationships were used as a simple method to test differences in condition between several populations of Mediterranean barbel and to examine possible correlations between fish condition and ecological factors. We analysed 14 populations of Mediterranean barbel from two basins with different ecological conditions. Statistical analysis (ANCOVA) showed that there were significant differences (P<0.05) in condition between populations, which could imply differences in habitat characteristics. Oxygen availability and riparian cover seem to be the main ecological factors affecting the condition of this species in the area studied. Therefore, the condition of the Mediterranean barbel may be a good indicator of habitat quality in stream ecosystems.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the restoration of urban river systems because they are affected by multiple point- and diffuse-source impairments. In South Wales, these issues are exemplified by the rivers Taff and Ely, which have a well-documented history of pollution. We developed a network of river-monitoring sites to capture as many sources of impairment as possible and to provide an integrated assessment of basin-wide conditions using established, recently revised and new methods to assess ecological status as required by the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Most of the 34 river sites, except those in upstream areas, had moderate or poor ecological status and low species richness. There were significant correlations between the UK Trophic Diatom Index (TDI), phosphate and nitrate concentrations, but the strongest correlation was with sodium concentrations. Sodium also differentiated best between ecological status classes. The UK TDI, Ecological Quality Ratios and the Indice de Polluosensibilit, Sp,cifique (IPS) correlated strongly, but the IPS reflected chemical conditions less well. There were also possible metal impacts including some upstream sites despite apparently good or high ecological status. These data reveal strong capacity in diatoms for reflecting stressors that affect urban river networks. We recommend (i) further assessments including geographically comprehensive and repeated surveys to underpin local decision-making and (ii) further refinement of the tools currently in use for WFD purposes through the development of specific diagnostic indices or multi-metric methods for a comprehensive assessment of complex catchments affected by multiple impairments.

AB  - The conception of functional adaptation of woody plants in the changing conditions of natural ecotopes and the urban ecosystem is substantiated. The new integrated methods for estimation of the natural environment transformation under the pressure of urbanization are suggested. The objects of our research are 49 species and forms of woody plants inhabiting the urban ecosystem of Lviv, natural and artificial tree stands of Ukrainian regions. Also, we focused our attention on the anthropotransformation of microclimate, soil changing in tree plantations and problems of edaphotopes contamination. The main subject of the original plant studies were the general phenotypic functional changes in the assimilation apparatus of tree species, which can be estimated by the complex of conventional and new indicators of chemical and biochemical composition of leaf dry matter from ecotopes with different living conditions and origin. We investigated the morphological, physiological and biochemical reactions of assimilating organs of woody plants affecting their growth and development in the conditions of the Lviv city and in the natural conditions of forests and parks. As a result of long-term studies of such reactions, we have suggested an original methodological approach to elucidating the levels of phenotypic functional adaptation. Also, the ability of autochthonous and allochthonous (exotic) tree species to adapt their growth and development to new or modified anthropogenic environment has been studied out. The average level of sugars in the leaves during vegetation was considered as a normal level with the maximum at the beginning, and subsequent decrease in the middle while the minimum of content was determined at the end of the growing season. The appropriate character of starch metabolism are displayed by average levels in different species, with the maximum concentration in July and subsequent minimization of their content at the end of the growing season. The naturally determined dynamics of fiber (cellulose) concentrations implies gradual decline in the period from spring to autumn of its proportion in the leaves dry matter at the high level of concentration, similarly as in the native species. The gradual increase in the proportion of all water-soluble carbohydrates about insoluble in adapted native plants was considered as a natural. A small amount of sugars in a ratio with the general concentration of ash in the leaves at the end of the growing season, we consider as auspicious. Suggested by us clusterization of native and exotic tree species concerning of the efficiency of their introduction in different urban plantations, and depending on the degree of anthropogenic ecotope transformation, allows diversely and effectively recommend different tree species and their forms in varied scopes of application. We used indicators of phenotypic functional adaptation while inventorization of Lviv botanical gardens collections has taken place. The informative criteria for assessing the status of plants, selection of resistant local and introduced individuals with high adaptive potential were elicited by mentioned above indices. A comprehensive approach to the study of ecotope qualities is effective for assessing the acclimatization conditions for tree exotics in the botanical gardens of Western Ukraine and for developing agrotechnical measures for their cultivation.

AB  - Introduction: The effects of nutrients on stream conditions within individual streams or small areas have been studied extensively, but the same effects over a large region have rarely been examined due to the difficulty of applying large-scale manipulative experiments. In this study, we estimated the causal effects of nutrients within the Western United States on invertebrate richness, an important biological indicator of stream conditions, by using observational data.
   Methods: We used the generalized propensity score method to avoid the common problem of statistical inference using observational data, i.e., correlation established based on observational data does not imply a causal relationship because the effects of confounding factors are not properly separated.
   Results: Our analysis showed a subsidy-stress relationship between nutrients and invertebrate taxon richness in the whole Western United States and in its sub-ecoregions. The magnitude of the relationship varies among these sub-ecoregions, suggesting a varying nitrogen effect on macroinvertebrates due, in large part, to the varying natural and anthropogenic conditions from ecoregion to ecoregion. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed that causal estimation results using regression can be sensitive to the imbalance of confounding factors.
   Conclusions: Stratifying data into ecoregions with relatively homogeneous environmental conditions or adjusting data by generalized propensity score can improve the balance of confounding factors, thereby allowing more reliable causal inference of nutrient effects. Invertebrates respond to the same nutrient levels differently across different site conditions.

AB  - This study aimed to distinguish natural and anthropogenic environmental changes, mainly in climate and nutrient conditions, during the past cl 700 years in Lake Hamptrask, southern Finland. We used sedimentary assemblages of aquatic organisms and physical properties of the sediment as proxies for the past environmental conditions. The results of diatom-inferred phosphorus reconstruction indicated that the lake was already meso-eutrophic at cl Ad 1400, possibly because the preceding cultivation of the area had increased the lake's nutrient condition. Chironomid-inferred temperatures indicated favourable climatic conditions at the end of the 'Medieval Warm Period', but the temperatures steadily decreased until a significant drop in the values occurred at cl Ad 1700, representing the coldest period of the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) in southern Finland. This cold period was illustrated by major changes in the lake's ecosystem and physical environment. After the LIA, the chironomid-inferred temperatures increased, as expected in the light of modern observations. However, the diatom-inferred phosphorus showed a decreasing trend, which is in contrast to the measured phosphorus values that imply a currently eutrophic condition. The reason for the underestimation may be the predominance of periphytic taxa that are assigned low TP optima in the inference model.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is an important foodborne gastrointestinal pathogen and highly sensitive to environmental stresses. Research has shown that changes in culturability, cell morphology, and viability occur when C. jejuni cells are subjected to stresses. In this study, real-time PCR, ethidium monoazide (EMA) in combination with real-time PCR (EMA-PCR), BacLight bacterial viability staining, and agar plate counting methods were used to quantitatively analyze viable, stressed, and dead C. jejuni strain 81-176. The real-time PCR assay provides highly sensitive and specific quantification of total genome copies of C jejuni culture in different growth phases. Our results also reveal that real-time PCR can be used for direct quantification of Campylobacter genome release into Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) as an indicator of cell lysis. Using EMA-PCR, we obtained a dynamic range of greater than 3 logs for differentiating viable vs. dead cells. The viability and morphological characteristics of the stressed cells after one-week incubation at 25 C, in air, and under nutrient-poor conditions were investigated. Our results indicated that, over 99% of the stressed cells were converted from the spiral to the coccoid form and became non-culturable. However, more than 96% of the coccoid cells retained their membrane integrity as suggested by both the BacLight staining and EMA-PCR analyses. Thus, to detect C jejuni under stress conditions, conventional culturing method in conjunction with EMA-PCR or BacLight staining might be a more appropriate approach. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence of day/night conditions on individual animal/plant species has been widely studied, but diel cycle studies of the entire stream macroinvertebrate community are extremely rare. This study explored potential dissimilarities between daytime and nighttime macroinvertebrate assemblages by extensive fieldwork conducted in the Lemme stream, a natural water course of NW Italy. Here numerous structural and functional metrics (richness, abundance, biomass, indicator taxa, composition, biomonitoring values and feeding groups) were evaluated at the family level. Small- scale environmental variables were investigated to understand possible differences between macroinvertebrate assemblages in the daytime/nighttime. After collecting and identifying 21 459 organisms of 50 taxa, Chironomidae (Diptera) was the most abundant under both day and night conditions. Our findings stressed that similar results and biological information on daytime/nighttime data were obtained. No marked differences could be related to various factors: heterotrophic condition of small- order streams, presence of aquatic predators under night and day conditions, absence of taxa with a specific phototaxis. Of all the environmental variables, velocity was always the most important in both situations, with some differences detected in the importance of the second variable (riverbed substrate diameter). This research, and future studies on different conditions and geographic areas, will contribute knowledge on stream macroinvertebrate diel activity, and provide useful information about efficient sampling strategies.

AB  - Scientific evaluation of cultivated land quality is the premise for ensuring food security and improving land quality. In this research, new evaluation method was developed referring to the Soil Quality Index method, using Xiangzhou District, Hubei province, China, as the studying area. Five first-level indicators including physical and chemical properties, nutrient condition, management condition, health condition and ecological environmental condition of cultivated land were selected for construction of the index system. 28 second-level indicators including topographic position, organic matter, active potassium, effective phosphorus, effective sulfur, effective boron, cadmium concentration, soil runoff nitrogen, soil runoff phosphorus, etc., were selected. Interpolation methods were compared between Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method, Spline method and Ordinary Kriging (OK) method at different evaluation scales to reduce the effect of modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The IDW method at the small scale was finally performed in the evaluation process. The results showed that the average cultivated land quality index was 6.09 in Xiangzhou District. The main limiting factors of cultivated land quality included soil bulk density, organic matter, effective phosphorus, pH, effective boron, effective sulfur, soil runoff nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, land quality improving suggestions were put forward by adopting ecological agricultural engineering and applying suitable organic fertilizer. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to develop effective methods to prevent hydrate formation in underwater gas pipelines. The rapid formation of gas hydrates is promoted by high pressure and low temperature in deep-sea underwater structures, which is one of the most difficult problems in ensuring the operability of the pipeline.
   The main direction of ensuring trouble-free operation of pipelines is to support the processes of using hydrate inhibitors during the operation of hydrocarbon transport facilities, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages. The main aim of the research is to develop a method for evaluating the effectiveness of hydrate inhibitors in production and transport of hydrocarbons in marine conditions. The objects of the research are performance indicators for implementation of hydrate inhibitor use methods with an assessment of the risk associated with hydrate formation, which helps prevent hydrate blockage and ensure equipment integrity.
   Methods. To increase the reliability of the interpretation of methods for the use of hydrate inhibitors, it is proposed to use the OLGA software, which is a tool for modeling the analysis of pumping oil, natural gas, and produced water during multiphase transportation. This modeling tool allows you to visualize key aspects of dynamic events that reflect the reality of hydrocarbon transportation. The OLGA software suite has allowed developing oil and gas fields in deeper waters and further offshore than it was possible without this technology.
   Results. Using OLGA software, it was possible to consider existing methods for preventing hydrate formation and concluded that cold flow technology, as well as the addition of a 10 % methanol solution, are the most beneficial solution for the Arctic compared to other technologies and other concentrations, respectively.

AB  - Streams in the loess hills of northwest Mississippi have undergone dramatic physical changes since European settlement and both physical and water quality processes may play a role in influencing biotic communities of these stream systems. The objectives of this study were to identify the response of macroinvertebrate taxa to water quality and habitat parameters in streams of northwest Mississippi, examine the efficacy of an a priori classification system of stream channel evolution and condition class using macroinvertebrate communities, and examine short-term (<2 yr) temporal variation of macroinvertebrate communities. Separation of sites based on four condition classifications was not distinct. However, best attainable sites did plot together in an ordination analysis suggesting similarity in macroinvertebrate communities for least disturbed sites. Similarly, for stage of channel evolution, sites characterized by lack of bank failure and sinuous fluvial processes had relatively similar macroinvertebrate communities. Ordination analysis also indicated high temporal variation of macroinvertebrate communities. Reference sites (best attainable and stable sites) had more similar communities between years than unstable and impacted sites. Results of this study: (1) suggest total solids, total phosphorus concentration, percent substrate as sand, ammonia concentration, and conductivity were important variables for structuring stream macroinvertebrate communities in northwest Mississippi, (2) identify potential indicator taxa for assessing such streams based on water quality and physical habitat, (3) provide support for current a priori site classifications at the best attainable (least impacted) category relative to the macroinvertebrate communities, and (4) demonstrate that between-year variation is an important factor when assessing streams of north Mississippi and this variability may be related to the degree of stream degradation.

AB  - Relationships between biological and enrichment indicators were explored to demarcate hallmarks of enrichment that can be used in managing eutrophication in large rivers. Biological indicators were sensitive to the measured range of enrichment and generally showed linear responses. However, fish biotic integrity scores, 24-h ranges in dissolved oxygen, and biological oxygen demand all showed strong nonlinear responses coinciding with sestonic chlorophyll concentrations in the range of 20-50 mu g/l. Hallmarks of overt overenrichment were defined as sestonic chlorophyll >= 100 mu g/l, 5-day biological oxygen demand >= 6.0 mg/l, and 24-h range in dissolved oxygen >= 9.0 mg/l. Acceptable levels were defined as chlorophyll <30 mu g/l, 5-day biological oxygen demand <2.5 mg/l, and 24-h dissolved oxygen range <7.0 mg/l. Relationships between nutrient concentrations and sestonic chlorophyll were weak, mainly due to high ambient levels of nutrients. However, total phosphorus concentrations averaged lower at sites showing less overt signs of enrichment, suggesting 130 mu g/l total phosphorus as a management target for presently overenriched waters.

AB  - Most bioassessment programs rest on the assumption that species have different niches, and that abiotic environmental conditions and changes therein determine community structure. This assumption is thus equivalent to the species sorting perspective (i.e. that species differ in their responses to environmental variation) in metacommunity ecology. The degree to which basing bioassessment on the species sorting perspective is reasonable is likely to be related to the spatial extent of a study and the characteristics of the organism groups (e.g. dispersal ability) with which the effects of anthropogenic changes are assessed. Recent findings in metacommunity research have stressed that community structure is determined not only by local abiotic environmental conditions but also by biotic interactions and dispersal-related effects. For example, dispersal limitation may prevent community structure recovery from the effects of a putative stressor, as organisms may not be able to disperse to all sites in a region. Mass effects (i.e. the presence of species in environmentally suboptimal sites due to high dispersal rates from environmentally suitable sites) may, in turn, obscure the effects of a stressor, as dispersal from source sites (e.g. an unaltered site) allows persistence at sink sites (e.g. an anthropogenically altered site). Better bioassessment should thus take both niche- and dispersal-related processes simultaneously into consideration, which can be accomplished by explicitly modelling spatial location as a proxy for dispersal effects. Such an integrated approach should be included in bioassessment programs using general multivariate approaches, predictive modelling, and multimetric indices.

AB  - Ephemeroptera larvae are recognized worldwide for their sensitivity to oxygen depletion in running waters, and are therefore commonly used as bioindicators in many monitoring programmes. Mayflies inhabiting lentic waters, like lakes and ponds, in contrary have been poorly prospected in biomonitoring. For this purpose, a better understanding of their distribution in lentic habitats and of the relations of species presence with environmental conditions are needed. Within this framework, 104 ponds were sampled in Switzerland. The Ephemeroptera are found to be an insect order particularly well represented in the ponds studied here (93% of the lowland ponds). Nevertheless, in terms of diversity, they are relatively poorly represented (mean species number = 1.9). Two species dominated: Cloeon dipterum (Baetidae) and Caenis horaria (Caenidae). The investigations contributed to the updating of the geographical distribution of the species in Switzerland, as many of the observations appear to be from new localities. The trophic state of ponds appears here to be important for Ephemeroptera communities. First, there is a negative relationship between total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and species richness. Second, the presence of Caenis horaria or Cloeon dipterum is dependent on the trophic state. Caenis horaria is most closely associated with low levels of TP concentrations, while Cloeon dipterum appears to be less sensitive, and is most frequently found in hypertrophic conditions. A probable consequence of these relations, is that Baetidae are always present when Caenidae are also present. Contrastingly, Baetidae is observed as the only mayflies family present in several ponds.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is commonly applied to achieve sustainable use of marine resources. For EBM, regular ecosystem-wide assessments of changes in environmental or ecological status are essential components, as well as assessments of the effects of management measures. Assessments are typically carried out using indicators. A major challenge for the usage of indicators in EBM is trophic interactions as these may influence indicator responses. Trophic interactions can also shape trade-offs between management targets, because they modify and mediate the effects of pressures on ecosystems. Characterization of such interactions is in turn a challenge when testing the usability of indicators. Climate variability and climate change may also impact indicators directly, as well as indirectly through trophic interactions. Together, these effects may alter interpretation of indicators in assessments and evaluation of management measures. We developed indicator networks - statistical models of coupled indicators - to identify links representing trophic interactions between proposed food-web indicators, under multiple anthropogenic pressures and climate variables, using two basins in the Baltic Sea as a case study. We used the networks to simulate future indicator responses under different fishing, eutrophication and climate change scenarios. Responsiveness to fishing and eutrophication differed between indicators and across basins. Almost all indicators were highly dependent on climatic conditions, and differences in indicator trajectories > 10% were found only in comparisons of future climates. In some cases, effects of nutrient load and climate scenarios counteracted each other, altering how management measures manifested in the indicators. Incorporating climate change, or other regionally non-manageable drivers, is thus necessary for an accurate interpretation of indicators and thereby of EBM measure effects. Quantification of linkages between indicators across trophic levels is similarly a prerequisite for tracking effects propagating through the food web, and, consequently, for indicator interpretation. Developing meaningful indicators under climate change calls for iterative indicator validations, accounting for natural processes such as trophic interactions and for trade-offs between management objectives, to enable learning as well as setting target levels or thresholds triggering actions in an adaptive manner. Such flexible strategies make a set of indicators operational over the long-term and facilitate success of EBM.

AB  - Identifying early signs of anthropogenic disturbances in protected areas is critical for determining overuse, safeguarding natural beauty, protecting biodiversity, and sustaining resource use and economy. Assessing disturbances to aquatic systems of such areas is challenging due to the low-dose, diffused, and cumulative nature of disturbances; high risk at iconic sites; and difficulty of linking human activities with degradation. Using Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve as an example study to overcome such challenges, we developed an approach that integrated human activities known to impact aquatic systems to calculate a holistic disturbance index for assessing the extent of human uses at scales of entire reserve and individual sub-watersheds. We linked human disturbance index with benthicalgae and macroinvertebrate indicators of individual waterbodies to identify early signs of degradation. We conducted in situ nutrient experiments and intensive sampling of biota at iconic sites with early signs of degradation to provide direct linkage between tourist activities and eutrophication, and to pinpoint mechanisms of how human disturbances have resulted in such degradations. We found that the human disturbance index significantly correlated with benthic algae and macroinvertebrate indicators, and Jiuzhaigou is largely in healthy condition. For the two identified iconic sites with early signs of degradation; intensive tourist activities at observation and rest areas of Five-Color Lake seemed to link to extra amount of nitrogen input into the lake and resulted in overgrowth of phytoplankton and filamentous algae during summer peak tourist months. Extra amount of phosphorus input from tourism activities at Pearl Shoal seemed the cause of changes in substrate colors and of shifts in attached moss and algal communities. Our example study demonstrates that early signs of degradation can be visually observed and should be further assessed by measuring water quality and sensitive biological indicators at high risk areas of a waterbody during summer and peak tourist seasons. Sensitive biological indicators (e.g., intolerant diatom and macroinvertebrates) are better indicators than nutrient concentrations because of rapid assimilation of nutrients by algae and macrophytes. Our assessment approach and findings of studying Jiuzhaigou have broad applications to other protected areas for determining overuse, and hence for making science-based policy and taking adequate management actions to prevent overuses.

AB  - Poor water quality in urban streams places at risk the health of urban residents and the integrity of urban environments, ultimately leading to the "urban stream syndrome." In response to growing concerns regarding urban streams in Uruguay, we evaluated the spatiotemporal variation in water quality parameters in two urban streams, the Ceibal and La Curtiembre streams, over 12-18 months. A proposal for an Urban Water Quality Index (UWQI) was developed based on national water quality standards for two stream classes to assess variability in overall stream condition over time. Both streams displayed extremely high levels of fecal coliform concentrations in mid-downstream sites and relatively high levels of total dissolved phosphorus and ammonia well above the national standards of 0.025 mg/L and 0.02 mg/L, respectively. Nitrate was consistently below the national maximum of 44.3 mg/L, calling to question the adequacy of this standard for designated uses. Over 40% of samples had oxygen levels below the national standard of 5 mg/L, and a dead zone (average 1.5 mg/L) was detected in the downstream reach of the La Curtiembre stream. Despite differences in land use and urban context, monthly observations of nutrients and coliforms indicated high levels of contamination in mid-downstream reaches, which could present a health risk for the populations in Paysandu and Salto. This study highlights the degradation of urban streams in two major cities in Uruguay and the need for a comparative diagnosis of stream condition as a basis for decision-making regarding urban development and water resources.

AB  - Antagonistic and synergistic substances are important for interactions between micro-organisms associated with human body surfaces, either in healthy or in diseased conditions. In the present study, such compounds produced by Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (By) were detected in vitro and the antagonistic ones were partially characterized. Among 11 G. vaginalis strains tested, all showed antagonistic activity against at least one of the 22 indicator bacteria assayed. Interestingly, for some of these strains, antagonism reverted to synergism, favouring one of the indicator strains (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) when the growth medium was changed. Partial characterization of antagonistic substances suggested a bacteriocin-like chemical nature. Depending on growth conditions, G. vaginalis isolated from women with BV produced antagonistic or synergistic compounds for other bacterial components of the vaginal ecosystem. This is the first report to our knowledge of the production of antagonistic and/or synergistic substances by G. vaginalis. This ability may be a pivotal factor in understanding BV and the ecological role of this bacterium in the vaginal environment.

AB  - The assessment of water quality has changed markedly worldwide over the last years, especially in Europe due to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Fish was considered a key-element in this context and several fish-based multi-metric indices have been proposed. In this study, we propose a multi-metric index, the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index (EFAI), developed for Portuguese estuaries, designed for the overall assessment of transitional waters, which could also be applied at the water body level within an estuary. The EFAI integrates seven metrics: species richness, percentage of marine migrants, number of species and abundance of estuarine resident species, number of species and abundance of piscivorous species, status of diadromous species, status of introduced species and status of disturbance sensitive species. Fish sampling surveys were conducted in 2006, 2009 and 2010, using beam trawl, in 13 estuarine systems along the Portuguese coast. Most of the metrics presented a high variability among the transitional systems surveyed. According to the EFAI values, Portuguese estuaries presented a "Good" water quality status (except the Douro in a particular year). The assessments in different years were generally concordant, with a few exceptions. The relationship between the EFAI and the Anthropogenic Pressure Index (API) was not significant, but a negative and significant correlation was registered between the EFAI and the expert judgement pressure index, at both estuary and water body level. The ordination analysis performed to evaluate similarities among North-East Atlantic Geographical Intercalibration Group (NEAGIG) fish-based indices put in evidence four main groups: the French index, since it is substantially different from all the other indices (uses only four metrics based on densities); indices from Ireland, United Kingdom and Spain (Asturias and Cantabria); the Dutch and German indices; and the indices of Belgium. Portugal and Spain (Basque country). The need for detailed studies, including comparative approaches, on several aspects of these assessment tools, especially in what regards their response to anthropogenic pressures was stressed.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance has contributed to widespread geomorphic adjustment and the degradation of many rivers. This research compares for river reaches of varying condition, the potential for seed banks to support geomorphic river recovery through vegetation regeneration. Seven river reaches in the lower Hunter catchment of south-eastern Australia were assessed as being in poor, moderate, or good condition, based on geomorphic and ecological indicators. Seed bank composition within the channel and floodplain (determined in a seedling emergence study) was compared to standing vegetation. Seed bank potential for supporting geomorphic recovery was assessed by measuring native species richness, and the abundance of different plant growth forms, with consideration of the roles played by different growth forms in geomorphic adjustment. The exotic seed bank was considered a limiting factor for achieving ecological restoration goals, and similarly analysed. Seed bank native species richness was comparable between the reaches, and regardless of condition, early successional and pioneer herbs, sedges, grasses and rushes dominated the seed bank. The capacity for these growth forms to colonise and stabilise non-cohesive sediments and initiate biogeomorphic succession, indicates high potential for the seed banks of even highly degraded reaches to contribute to geomorphic river recovery. However, exotic propagules increasingly dominated the seed banks of moderate and poor condition reaches and reflected increasing encroachment by terrestrial exotic vegetation associated with riparian degradation. As the degree of riparian degradation increases, the resources required to control the regeneration of exotic species will similarly increase, if seed bank-based regeneration is to contribute to both geomorphic and ecological restoration goals.

AB  - 1. Habitat heterogeneity has many implications in ecological assessment studies. On one hand it provides varying niches for organisms, increasing diversity. On the other hand, the inherent spatial variability of structurally complex systems may overlap with ecological condition making it difficult to disentangle the effects of perturbation. This study investigated the combined and single effects of habitat and pond condition on the macroinvertebrate assemblages of 35 ponds located in north-west Spain and spanning a range of water quality and habitat characteristics.
   2. Macroinvertebrate communities and several environmental variables were sampled in the summer of 2004 or 2003. Samples were collected from four dominant habitats (vegetated shores, shores without vegetation, submerged vegetation, bare sediments) following a time-limited sampling. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and two-way crossed ANOSIM were used to investigate the taxonomic and functional differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure among habitats (four types) and pond conditions (optimal, good, moderate, poor, very poor). To investigate the individual and combined effects of pond condition and habitat on several diversity measures GLM models were used. In addition, the accuracy of two sampling designs - stratified and multihabitat - was compared using the CVs of seven macroinvertebrate attributes.
   3. Results showed that macroinvertebrate communities differed significantly, albeit weakly, among habitat types and pond condition categories. In particular, the abundance of several Chironomidae genera., rarefied richness and Shannon index decreased both in perturbed systems and bare sediments, whereas no marked differences occurred between shores and submerged vegetation.
   4. We suggest that a multihabitat approach together with the use of community attributes not (or slightly) affected by habitat type will provide more comparable results across ponds than a stratified approach or observation of the whole community, especially in ponds where degradation leads to habitat loss.

AB  - Accounting for components of fishing mortality, including post-release mortality (F-r ), is necessary for robust assessments of the effects of fishing. Forty-eight blue (Prionace glauca) and 35 silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformes) were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags to monitor F-r rates from pelagic longline vessels in the western tropical Pacific Ocean. There is a paucity of F-r studies at low latitudes and identifying factors that significantly explain F-r is critical for understanding fishing mortality. Mean F-r rates were 0.17 [95% CI 0.09-0.30] for blue shark and 0.20 [95% CI 0.10-0.36] for silky shark. When it occurred, F-r was acute with 87% of mortalities within 2 days of release. Several prognostic operational, environmental, biological and handling variables were evaluated to assess their influence on survival outcomes. Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, logistic regression, accelerated failure time and Cox proportional hazards models to screen variables, the only significant prognostic or risk variable was health condition at haulback. There was close correspondence (similar to 83% accuracy) between condition at capture and survival outcomes. Reliable methods to classify at-vessel condition represent an inexpensive and simple metric for estimating both F-r and at-vessel (F-c) mortality rates. Examining F-c rates in detail in longline fisheries using capture information on depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen that may act in synergy with condition code and hooking duration is a research priority. Results suggest that a large proportion of shark survive following release and that F-r rates can be increased by improving the haulback condition of captured sharks.

AB  - Increasingly environmental management seeks to limit the impacts of human activities on ecosystems relative to some 'reference' condition, which is often the presumed pre-impacted state, however such information is limited. We explore how marine ecosystems in deep time (Late Jurassic) are characterised by AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), and how the indices responded to natural perturbations. AMBI is widely used to detect the impacts of human disturbance and to establish management targets, and this study is the first application of these indices to a fossil fauna. Our results show AMBI detected changes in past seafloor communities (well-preserved fossil deposits) that underwent regional deoxygenation in a manner analogous to those experiencing two decades of organic pollution. These findings highlight the potential for palaeoecological data to contribute to reconstructions of pre-human marine ecosystems, and hence provide information to policy makers and regulators with greater temporal context on the nature of 'pristine' marine ecosystems.

AB  - Seagrass beds are increasingly impacted by human activities in coastal areas, particularly in tropical regions. The objective of this research program was to study seagrass beds characteristics under various environmental conditions in the French Antilles (FA, Caribbean Sea). A total of 61 parameters, from plant physiology to seagrass ecosystem, were tested along a gradient of anthropogenic conditions, distributed across 11 sites and 3 islands of the FA. A selection of 7 parameters was identified as relevant for the monitoring of seagrass meadows in the framework of public policies. They combined "early warning indicators" (e.g. nutrients and some trace metals) and long-term responding parameters (e.g. shoot density) adapted to management time scales. The ecological status of seagrass meadows was evaluated using a PCA. This work is a first step towards monitoring and management of seagrass meadows in the FA.

AB  - 1. Biological indicators are used to measure the biological health of ecosystems. Resource managers may uncritically assume that such indicators give unbiased estimates of true biological condition, but this assumption is largely untested. Use of biased indicators could lead to ineffective and potentially damaging management.
   2. We used a simulation model to compare estimated indicator values objectively with true impairment. We used the model to progressively alter the densities of 155 stream invertebrate taxa as functions of stress and taxon-specific sensitivities to stress. We applied the model to large samples collected from five reference-quality sites. After each stress event, we randomly collected 100, 300 and 600 fixed-count subsamples from the remaining assemblages and recorded the densities of all taxa in both the large sample and the fixed-count subsamples. We then examined how well two indicators, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and sample taxa richness, detected the simulated impairment when derived from fixed-count subsamples.
   3. NMDS ordinations of artificially impaired samples, and samples from reference and impaired sites, showed that the simulated impairments were realistic. NMDS further showed that impairment trajectories were evident for subsamples of 100, 300 and 600 individuals. However, the discrimination of stress levels within ordination space greatly improved with increasing sampling effort. The ordination also showed that increasing stress could cause assemblages at some sites to resemble unstressed assemblages at other sites.
   4. Taxa-richness indicators were much more problematic. Estimates of taxa richness from 100- and 300-count samples often substantially underestimated true taxa loss and frequently indicated taxa gain. Apparent gains in taxa richness occurred because stress caused changes in evenness that compensated for, or even overrode, the effect of true taxa loss. Estimates of taxa loss derived from 600-count subsamples also underestimated true taxa loss, but these estimates were strongly correlated with true taxa loss.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Bioassessements that rely on richness-based indicators derived from small fixed-count subsamples may substantially underestimate true biological impairment. Simulation models provide an objective means to evaluate how well different types of biotic indicators measure true biological impairment in aquatic and other types of ecosystems.

AB  - Exploratory analysis of biological communities and their environmental factors requires specialized tools to identify associations among variables and generate hypotheses about their causal relationships. Despite the ubiquity of multivariate data in ecology, the visualization and interpretation of such data can be challenging. This study introduces the application of parallel coordinates to ecologists, illustrating the utility of this tool to visualize and explore different types of multivariate data. We demonstrate this tool with two case studies in Canada to (i) explore water-quality associations with benthic macroinvertebrate indicators of stream condition in the St. Lawrence drainage basin, and (ii) identify environmental conditions that contribute to invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) proliferation across inland lakes of Ontario. We offer a novel demonstration of how parallel coordinates provide a practical alternative to current tools in the ecologist's toolbox for visualizing and exploring multivariate data, identifying hypotheses about causal relationships, and communicating science via interactive, web-based applications.

AB  - Because of their biological and ecological characteristics terrestrial isopods are considered as bioindicators of ecosystem health and several studies have shown that their distribution and abundance are influenced by environmental factors, such as weather, soil texture, composition and vegetation structure. However, few quantitative data are available on the relationship between single species of terrestrial isopods, meteorological variables and coastal zonation. This study aims to clarify relationships between terrestrial isopod populations, coastal zones and weather conditions of a protected area in Sicily. The terrestrial isopods were sampled using pitfall traps, and we verified the association between each species abundance and three different (lower, medium and upper) coastal zones. Furthermore, we analyzed correlations between isopod abundances and meteorological conditions (temperature and precipitation). The results showed a close relationship between some isopod species and coastal zone types, as well as a positive correlation of most of the species abundances with temperature and a negative one with precipitation.

AB  - Large-scale surface mining in southern West Virginia significantly alters headwater stream networks. The extent to which mining interacts with other stressors to determine physical, chemical, and biological conditions in aquatic systems downstream is unclear. We conducted a watershed-scale assessment of Pigeon Creek, an intensively mined watershed of the Tug Fork drainage in Mingo County, West Virginia. Our objectives were to: 1) develop landscape-based indicators of mining and residential development, 2) quantify the interactive effects of mining and residential development on in-stream conditions, and 3) identify landscape-based thresholds above which biological impairment occurs in this watershed. Macroinvertebrate community structure was negatively correlated with intensity of mining and residential development. Correlation analysis and partial Mantel tests indicated that mining (% of total subwatershed area) caused acute changes in water chemistry (r = 0.55-0.91), whereas residential development (parcel density) strongly affected both physical habitat (r = 0.59-0.81) and macroinvertebrate community structure (r = 0.59-0.93). The combined effects of mining and development on in-stream biotic conditions were additive. Sites affected by equivalent levels of both stressors had lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera richness than sites affected by either stressor alone. Biological impairment thresholds occurred at similar to 25% total mining (equivalent to a specific conductance of similar to 250 mu S/cm) and at parcel densities of similar to 5 and 14 parcels/km(2). Our results provide a tool that can be used to predict downstream ecological response to proposed mining given pre-existing watershed conditions. Our study suggests that effective management of impacts from new mine development must address nonmining-related impacts in this region.

AB  - Seventeen indices were selected to structure a new water ecological health assessment system, consisting of water quality, ecological system, and ecological landscape, for evaluation of small rivers in Shanghai, China. There are 200 samples taken from 56 rivers distributed in ten districts from 2014 to 2015 in Shanghai, which were selected to constitute the study case, and the mean value of each indicator was used in the evaluation. According to various features, including natural geographical condition, social development level, etc., these rivers were classified as one of three types: central urbanization watercourse (CW), new town watercourse (NW), and village watercourse (VW). The results showed that the investigated rivers were at a medium health level, ranging from 1.79 to 3.59, with the average being 2.95. The ecological health of streams in rural areas is better than that of CW rivers and NW rivers. This study is expected to provide accurate statistics and appraisal for the improvement of river health.

AB  - Benthic organisms, in particular bivalves, were shown to be a reliable model for assessment of ecological pressures (including pollution, climate changes, etc.) on marine ecosystems. Studies on bivalves as bioidicators in the Bulgarian Black sea waters are restricted only to the black mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.). The aim of the present study was to perform a pilot assessment of the oxidative status of the Striped Venus Clam (Chamelea gallina L.) from two representative sandbank habitats along the southern Bulgarian Black sea coast. Our data demonstrated the presence of adaptive responses of the studied clam specimens to the environmental conditions in their habitat. The measured oxidative stress indicators displayed a variation in activity both seasonally and between the sampling sites. The different biomarkers we studied can be potentially used to evaluate environmental "health" of their habitat and effects of exposure to chemical contaminants and environmental stress, including also multi-biomarker approaches.

AB  - Differential sensitivities to the cell wall stress caused by Congo red (CR) have been observed in many fungal species. In this study, the tolerances and sensitivities to CR was studied with an assorted collection of fungal species from three phylogenetic classes: Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes, three orders, and eight families. These grouped into different ecological niches, such as insect pathogens, plant pathogens, saprotrophs, and mycoparasitics. The saprotroph Aspergillus niger and the mycoparasite Trichoderma atroviride stood out as the most resistant species to cell wall stress caused by CR, followed by the plant pathogenic fungi, a mycoparasite, and other saprotrophs. The insect pathogens had low tolerance to CR. The insect pathogens Metarhizium acridum and Cordyceps fumosorosea were the most sensitive to CR.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying cell protection from cryoinjury are not yet fully understood. Recent biological studies have addressed cryopreserved cell survival but have not correlated the cryoprotection effectiveness with the impact of cryoprotectants on the most important cell structure, the nucleus, and the freeze/thaw process. We identified changes of cell nuclei states caused by different types of cryoprotectants and associate them with alterations of the freeze/thaw process in cells. Namely, we investigated both higher-order chromatin structure and nuclear envelope integrity as possible markers of freezing and thawing processes. Moreover, we analyzed in detail the relationship between nuclear envelope integrity, chromatin condensation, freeze/thaw processes in cells, and cryopreservation efficiency for dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, trehalose, and antifreeze protein. Our interdisciplinary study reveals how changes in cell nuclei induced by cryoprotectants affect the ability of cells to withstand freezing and thawing and how nuclei changes correlate with processes during freezing and thawing. Our results contribute to the deeper fundamental understanding of the freezing processes, notably in the cell nucleus, which will expand the applications and lead to the rational design of cryoprotective materials and protocols.

AB  - Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide widely used to control pests in agriculture even though evidence of harmful side effects in non-target species has been reported. A comprehensive study on the effects of dietary administration of Regent (R) 800WG (80 % fipronil) in European sea bass juveniles was carried out under two temperature regimes: a) natural conditions, and b) 3 degrees C above the natural temperature (an increase predicted for the NW Mediterranean by the end of this century). Fipronil was added to the fish food (10 mg fipronil /Kg feed) and the effects were studied at several time points including right before administration, 7 and 14 days after daily fipronil feed and one-week after the insecticide withdrawal from the diet (depuration period). A wide array of physiological and metabolic biomarkers including feeding rate, general condition indices, plasma and epidermal mucus metabolites, immune response, osmoregulation, detoxification and oxidative-stress markers and digestive enzymes were assessed. General linear models and principal component analyses indicated that regardless of water temperature, fipronil resulted in a significant alteration of several of the above listed biomarkers. Among them, glucose and lactate levels increased in plasma and decreased in epidermal mucus as indicators of a stress response. Similarly, a depletion in catalase activity and higher lipid peroxidation in liver of fipronil-exposed fish were also indicative of an oxidative-stress condition. Fipronil induced a time dependent inhibition of Cytochrome P450-related activities and an increase of phase II glutathione-S-transferase. Moreover, fipronil administration was able to reduce the hypo-osmoregulatory capability as shown by the increase of plasmatic osmolality and altered several digestive enzymes including trypsin, lipase, alpha amylase and maltase. Finally, analyses in bile and muscle confirmed the rapid clearance of fipronil but the persistence of the metabolite fipronil-sulfone in bile even after the 7-day depuration period. Altogether, the results reveal a notable impact of this compound on the physiological condition of the European sea bass. The results should be considered in future environmental risk assessment studies since fipronil could be hazardous to fish species, particularly those inhabiting estuarine ecosystems exposed to the discharge of agriculture runoffs where this pesticide is mainly used.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) was developed as a tool for quantifying the conservation value of natural areas based on their plant species composition and richness. Floristic Quality Assessment is based on Coefficients of Conservatism (C values) assigned to each plant species in a region or state. Each species i, is assigned a value C-i, on a scale of 0-10 by expert botanists, based on its fidelity to undegraded natural areas. A criticism of Floristic Quality Assessment is the subjective nature of these C values. Our objective was to determine if C values of individual species are indicative of the C values of species with which they co-occur. If subjectively assigned species' C values carry meaningful information about plant assemblages and the conservation value of particular habitats, then individual species should tend to co-occur with species of similar C. We tested this hypothesis using occurrences of 1014 species in 388 forests and wetlands across Illinois, USA. Using a null model approach, we found that species co-occurred with species of similar C far more often than would be expected by chance; affirming the predictive ability of subjectively assigned C values. Furthermore, we quantified the extent to which each species was under-or overvalued relative to its co-occurring species assemblages to assess if any species C values were misassigned. Woody plants and perennial herbs, as groups, were undervalued as ecological indicators, i.e. their C values were too low. Several non-native species, which, by convention, are assigned a C of zero, were over- or under-valued relative to native species with a C of zero. Based on species occurrences across hundreds of sites, our results indicated that, despite their subjective basis, C values carry considerable ecological information, such that a given species can be used to predict the C values of its co-occurring assemblage. However, some species C values appeared less accurate than others. Our methodological approach could be applied in other states or regions to validate and refine C value assignments.

AB  - Economics has long taken precedence over the environment in both governmental and business decision making, with the System of National Accounts and the indicator GDP coming to represent much that is wrong with the current environmental conditions. Increasing recognition of the environmental damage human activity causes and that human well-being depends on biodiversity and ecosystems means that new systems to measure and sustainably manage the world are needed. Integrating the environment into national accounts has been suggested as a way to improve information but so far impact on decision making is limited. This outlook needs to change. Using examples from Australia and Botswana, we show how integrating information on biodiversity, resource use and the economy via accounting can help create a new decision-making paradigm and enable a new policy framing with spending on biodiversity conservation and sustainability seen as an investment, not a cost.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to develop a highland Andean streams ecological assessment tool for managers to determine the biological quality in this broad area of South America. Sampling was conducted during the dry season at 123 sites in eight watersheds of high Andean streams from south of Peru to North of Ecuador. The sites were at elevations above 2000 m a.s.l., and ranged in anthropogenic disturbance from none or little (reference) to highly disturbed. Using the physicochemical, hydromorphological and aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage attributes of the reference sites, two different elevation bioregions were identified (from 2000 to 3500 m a.s.l. and those sites at altitudes higher than 3500 m a.s.l.). Differences between these two bioregions were related to the change in altitude of the most relevant environmental factors, i.e., temperature, oxygen content of the water and the extent of forested vegetation in the basin and in the riparian zone. These features were paramount to having different macroinvertebrate assemblages as demonstrated by an MDS analysis of our data. Two versions of the multi-metric index IMEERA were developed (the acronym comes from the Spanish name 'Indice Multimetrico del Estado Ecologic para Rios Altoandinos') that corresponded to the two bioregions. In the lower altitude bioregion (Bosque river type, IMEERA-B index), the pressure gradient was driven by the organic pollution and the hydromorphological degradation. While in the higher elevation bioregion (Paramo and Puna river types; IMEERA-P river type), the gradient was driven by the organic pollution and the habitat heterogeneity. The IMEERA B index includes six macroinvertebrate metrics using its richness, habit characteristics and tolerance/intolerance to disturbances (EPT taxa, % clingers, % climbers, intolerant taxa, ABI and % tolerant taxa). The IMEERA P index was calculated using four metrics corresponding to macroinvertebrate richness and its tolerance/intolerance to disturbances (total taxa, intolerant taxa, ABI and % tolerant taxa). The index was validated with a set of independent data from the headwaters of Guayllabamba River in Ecuador. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioindication is the process of determining the behaviour of foreign, usually harmful substances in ecological systems, using biological indicators. It is found that under the conditions obtaining in Germany roedeer are very good bioindicators of environmentally determined residues and much better suited to investigations of this kind than are farm animals or plants. The short-term and long-term behaviour of heavy metals. persistent organochlorine compounds and radioisotopes in the environment can be followed very well in roedeer. Determination of the drop in lead contamination of the environment as the result of implementing legislation is given as an example of this, using trend analysis of deer livers. The marked ability of high chlorinated PCBs to accumulate in biological food chains. the influence of agricultural measures on the radiocaesium contamination of game and, in general of foods and the long-term behaviour of radio-caesium contamination in game from undisturbed forest ecosystems contaminated by fall-out are described and discussed.

AB  - Indicators of landscape condition should be sensitive and specific to environmental change and provide early warning detection of ncipient changes. We assessed a suite of five spectral metrics derived from Landsat 5 TM imagery spanning a decade (1996-2007) to quantify ecosystem condition in the ridge-slough mosaic of the Everglades (South Florida, USA). These included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the same index using green instead of red band as the visible reference (NDVIg), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the simple ratio of NIR and red bands (SR) and the moisture stress index (MSI). Mean and variance from pure ridge or slough pixels (i.e., those >30 m from a mapped patch edge) were quantified for twentyfour 2 x 5 km blocks across a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition. Metrics were compared with field measures of landscape condition from block-scale soil elevation surveys, which capture dramatic spatial gradients between conserved and degraded locations. Elevationbased measures of landscape condition, validated as diagnostic in previous work, included soil elevation bi-modality (BISE), a binary measure of ecosystem condition, and the soil elevation standard deviation (SDSE), a continuous measure of condition. Spectral metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs.lagging) of the relationship with elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 3 metrics (mean ridge NDVI and NDVIg, mean ridge SR). In prediction of variance SDSE, the standard deviation of our VIs was more informative than the mean, and measures from sloughs more informative than ridges. The strongest predictions are variance in slough NDVIg and SR, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in slough biomass is most informative for predicting the status of soil elevation variance. None of the vegetation metrics were leading indicators of change; a multivariate model using three VIs selected based on consistent performance across years (variance in Slough SR, slough NDVIg, and ridge NDWI) substantially improve predictions of SDSE and yielded more plausible prediction maps. These findings suggest that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede visible changes in vegetation reflectance. While this constrains predictions of incipient ecosystem change, the reasonable performance of spectral metrics indicates that efficient monitoring of ridge-slough landscape health is possible as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.

AB  - This study aimed at testing the suitability of cell membrane integrity in the lichen Evernia prunastri (L) Ach. as sensitive indicator of nitrogen (N) stress, to set up a rapid and effective method for monitoring biological effects of acute N pollution. Lichen samples were incubated in solutions of potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate at different concentrations, and cell membrane damage, expressed in terms of increased electrolyte leakage, was measured after 0, 24, 48 and 96 h. Cell membrane damage was observed in E. prunastri in the presence of high or very high N concentrations, irrespective of the compound supplied. Since the mycobiont represents the large majority of a lichen biomass, it is reasonable to assume that ion leakage mainly occurred from fungal cells. Although in biomonitoring studies the photobiont is usually regarded as the most sensitive partner of the lichen symbiosis, our findings suggest that the mycobiont is most affected in the case of N-excess, and that this feature can be used as suitable indicator of acute N stress episodes.

AB  - The Florida Everglades have been subjected to decades of human disturbance directly and indirectly related to freshwater management. As a result, intensive efforts directed at restoring water quality in the region have been congressionally mandated. Long-term hydrological monitoring of the Florida Bay Estuary has significantly improved scientific understanding of physical environmental processes within the southern portion of Everglades National Park. Linking environmental processes to ecosystem dynamics, however, requires a relevant metric of biological activity that 1) is representative of ecosystem interactions, 2) can be measured at the same temporal and spatial scales of hydrological data collection, and 3) is at sufficient resolution to provide an understanding of organismal, population, and community-level changes. Through changes in physiology, behavior, or ecology, fishes may respond to acute and chronic changes in their habitats. Passive acoustic detection of sonic fishes may provide an opportunity to link physical and ecosystem processes in estuarine systems. Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta, family Batrachoididae) are a mid-trophic-level species with a widespread distribution throughout Florida Bay and the broader Gulf of Mexico. Advertising males call in both reproductive and agonistic contexts and exhibit high degrees of nest fidelity. As a result, their calls can be reliably used as an indication of animal presence, as well as behavioral state and reproductive condition. By investigating toadfish call occurrence across three hydrological monitoring stations in Florida Bay, we determined that Gulf toadfish have highest probability of acoustic occurrence at sites with lower salinity (Dunn's test, p < 0.01), and that Gulf toadfish calling significantly changed with variation in salinity regimes at their nesting locations. For every one unit increase in salinity the probability of toadfish acoustic occurrence decreases by 16% (95% C.I. 7%-23%). This study indicated significant behavioral and acoustic heterogeneity over relatively short distances (7-30 km) within Florida Bay, and demonstrates that local environmental conditions are related to calling behavior in addition to seasonal or broader climatic conditions. Given that a great deal is known about the behavior, physiology, and life history of toadfishes, evidence that Gulf toadfish consistently responded to salinity between and within sites lends strong initial support for the use of Gulf toadfish calling behavior as an acoustic indicator of estuary conditions and environmental change in estuaries targeted for ecological restoration.

AB  - Monitoring changes in the nutritional status of wild populations is crucial to understanding how species respond to natural or human-mediated variations in food availability and quality. It is a fundamental step for decision making in wildlife management. Many studies on nutritional ecology still tend to rely on the use of single indicators. Nonetheless, nutrition has multiple interdependent facets that should be combined to better understand how organisms interact with their environment through feeding. Here, data from a large-scale cross-sectional survey conducted between 2010 and 2013 were used to examine the influence of environmental conditions and management practices on the variation of faecal nitrogen content (FN, index of dietary quality) and kidney fat index (KFI, indicator of nutritional condition) in red deer Cervus elaphus in the Mediterranean ecosystems of Iberia. Variations in the nutritional indicators in relation to sex, age, faecal fibre contents and faecal counts of lungworm larvae were also analysed. Our results showed that FN levels were statistically and positively correlated with vegetation primary productivity (P = 0.003). In contrast, faecal fibre fractions were significantly and negatively correlated with FN concentrations (P = 0.024 for hemicellulose, P < 0.0001 for cellulose and lignin). Moreover, a negative, marginally significant relationship was found between FN and the average altitude of the study areas (P = 0.055). The KFI was statistically higher in females than in males (P < 0.0001) and increased with increasing FN levels (P = 0.01). Fat stores were also statistically and positively correlated with vegetation productivity (P = 0.001) and with the amount of supplementary food provided (P = 0.04). The effect of high-quality diets on deer kidney fat deposits was gradually lower as the population density increased (P = 0.02). This result was more marked in non-food-supplemented populations. Both FN and KFI were statistically higher during the winter in relation to the autumn (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.005, respectively). This study shows that FN can be used to monitor and predict changes in the dietary quality, and the KFI in the nutritional status, in red deer in Mediterranean environments, reliably. Since both indicators showed different sensitivity to intrinsic, ecological and management determinants, this research also highlights their value and complementary use when studying populations of large wild herbivores.

AB  - In many critical industries such as nuclear, chemical and petrochemical industries, bi-material components in the form of clad plates are used due to their superior environmental and mechanical properties. During the service life of these bi-material components, cracks or crack-like defects may develop in the clad layer and penetrate into the substrate. The assessment of the integrity of such a cracked as well as complex structure would be an important task. Hence, this study is aimed at applying the recently developed European Structural Integrity Assessment Procedure (SINTAP) to a through thickness centre cracked clad steel wide plate to validate the procedure for this type of bi-material structure. Based on the available input data, various assessment levels as well as two different assessment routes, namely crack driving force (CDF) and failure assessment diagram (FAD), can be used for predicting the failure loads. In principle both routes should provide similar results and this has been verified by having very similar results for both SINTAP routes. Furthermore, the degree of conservatism has been reduced by using higher analysis levels of SINTAP.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are chronically exposed to radionuclides as well as other pollutants. Increased concentrations of pollutants in aquatic environments can present a risk to exposed organisms, including fish. The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of tritium, in the context of natural environments, on the health of fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas. Fish were exposed to tritium (activity concentrations ranging from 2 to 23,000 Bq/L) and also to various concentrations of several metals to replicate multiple-stressor environments. Fish were exposed for 60 days, then transferred to the tritium background site where they stayed for another 60 days. Tritium, in the forms of tritiated water (HTO) and organically bound tritium (OBT), and a series of fish health indicators were measured in fish tissues at seven time points throughout the 120 days required to complete the exposure and the depuration phases. Results showed effects of environmental exposure following the increase of tritium activity and metals concentrations in water. The internal dose rates of tritium, estimated from tissue HTO and OBT activity concentrations, were consistently low (maximum of 0.2 mu Gy/h) compared to levels at which population effects may be expected (>100 mu Gy/h) and no effects were observed on survival, fish condition, gonado-somatic, hepato-somatic, spleno-somatic and metabolic indices (RNA/DNA, proteins/DNA and protein carbonylation (in gonads and kidneys)). Using multivariate analyses, we showed that several biomarkers (DNA damages, MN frequency, gamma-H2AX, SFA/MUFA ratios, lysosomal membrane integrity, AChE, SOD, phagocytosis and esterase activities) were exclusively correlated with fish tritium internal dose rate, showing that tritium induced genotoxicity, DNA repair activity, changes in fatty acid composition, and immune, neural and antioxidant responses. Some biomarkers were responding to the presence of metals, but overall, more biomarkers were linked to internalized tritium. The results are discussed in the context of multiple stressors involving metals and tritium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Turkey's wetlands that represent a very diverse set of ecosystems are subject to considerable risks of biodiversity loss arising from the changes in their hydrology. Maintaining the full spectrum of naturally occurring flows in many rivers is almost impossible in Turkey's economically competing watersheds. Environmental flow assessments may still represent a compromise between water resources development and river ecology maintenance. In the presented study, changes in the water regimes observed in the period 1960-2000 are investigated together with concurrent ecological conditions for over 35 wetlands belonging to different ecological regions. The results, which are presented with indicator-based risk figures to potentially correlate biodiversity loss to decreases in environmental flows in course of time, broadly indicate that substantial risks are estimated in Turkey in terms of environmental flows for wetland systems. Few exceptions appear in the north-east in accordance with the recent climate change predictions indicating precipitation increase trends in the region.

AB  - Years of population growth and urban expansion have affected ecologically forested areas outlying Mexico City. To control the growth and the negative impact on natural areas, the Conservation Land act of 1987s declared protection of non-populated forest areas. However, this initiative has been overshadowed by the growing demand of affordable housing. The expansion of housing in protected areas has been coupled with unclear guidelines from local authorities in restricting domestic growth. This study focuses on the Magdalena River micro-basin, which is key to freshwater provisioning to Mexico City. The objective of this research is to show the socio-ecological effects of urbanization and the lack/misguidance of local governance on the Magdalena River. Ecological quality was assessed through identifying hydro-morphological quality and bioindicators such as macroinvertebrates and macroalgae. This information was paired with social data collected through an archival study of historical literature, and interviews with residents who are both lawfully and unlawfully living within protected areas. The results show that the ecological quality of the Magdalena River is undergoing significant changes because of an influx of nutrients and external alterations made to the riparian zone. Pollution from housing, restaurants, and trout farms are the factors most directly related to the changes. Additionally, we encountered little to no federal/local policy aimed at controlling inputs and altercations to the river. Our study has shown that urbanization within the micro-basin negatively alters the biological diversity. The growth further facilities the increase of fecal bacteria posing a risk to human health. Social data from interviews and the literature review showed the ecological importance of the area to the local people. In the past there have been two cases of restoration efforts made by the municipal government, but their intentions for restoration ultimately failed. In both efforts were poorly planned and were not communicated with local people nor did they include local participation. As a consequence, the locals have a general distrust of the external stakeholder. Apart from local development misinformation and unwelcome restoration intervention, there is a long history of governmental authorities incurring acts of corruption and bribery. Many unauthorized settlements are unaware or have not been educated about the environmental impact they are having on ecosystems and are often overlooked or excluded when it comes to creating policy. In conclusion, local participation and approval is essential to the creation of a successful management plan, thus it is important governmental officials seek their involvement. Conservation land within the micro-basin is insufficient to protect the ecological integrity of ecosystems as both landowners and local authorities are facilitating unsustainable practices that transit between the vision on paper of a sustainable city and the lack of concrete facts to achieve it.

AB  - Managed pine forests cover nearly 130,000 km(2) of the Southeastern U.S. and are important to the economic and ecological sustainability of the region. These stands are typically fertilized twice - at establishment and mid-rotation - to enhance timber production during a 25-year rotation. In Florida, Best Management Practices (BMPs) limit fertilizer application rates and require special management zones (SMZs) to reduce nutrient pollution. Recent adoption of numeric nutrient criteria (NNC) for streams and lakes in Florida has raised concerns that forest fertilization, even in compliance with BMPs, may result in excess nutrient loads and degrade stream ecological condition, particularly directly following fertilizer applications. We examined nutrient export dynamics and stream biota in two medium size watersheds (21 and 34 km(2), respectively) dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in north Florida following fertilization. Over 54 months, we monitored stream discharge, nitrogen (TN, TKN, NO3-N, NH4-N), and phosphorus (TP, orthoP), as well as stream biota (benthic macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, periphyton and vascular plants) prior to and following watershed-scale fertilization. We condensed four years of scheduled fertilization into a single year, resulting in nutrient inputs substantially larger than typical. Because flow variation strongly controlled nutrient concentrations, we assessed pre- and post-fertilization concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships, which remained unchanged. Annual mass export of N and P also remained unchanged, suggesting landscape retention of additional loads. Likewise, we observed no systematic change in biological indicators. These results suggest forest fertilization at BMP rates is unlikely to increase stream nutrient export, supporting the contention that fertilized pine forests in the southeastern coastal plain are protective of statewide goals for water quality and stream biotic integrity.

AB  - Plant-pollinator interaction networks may be more informative than the diversity of species in the evaluation of the effects of environmental change. Considering that networks vary with the integrity of ecosystems, their changes may help to predict the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity and ecological processes. This characteristic highlights its use as environmental quality indicator. However, to employ interaction networks as ecological indicators it is necessary to identify the most sensitive metrics and understand how and why they vary with environmental changes. This review aimed to identify, in empirical studies, which network metrics have been evidenced as being more sensitive to changes in environmental quality. We analyzed published empirical studies, that applied the network approach on environmental quality gradients. In addition to the network metric behavior, we studied the interactions between them and possible causes of their variation. The available empirical data indicated that degree, nestedness and connectance did not have a simple, linear or unidirectional response to habitat degradation. Conversely, the metrics interaction asymmetry, d' (reciprocal specialization index of the species) showed the most consistent responses to environmental change. The role of the species changed, ranging between generalists and specialists under different conditions. In addition, specialist species with morphological and behavioral constraints were lost in worse environmental quality situations. The identity of interacting species and their role in the network, with a further specification of groups and interactions most affected, are the properties with greater potential to indicate changes in environmental quality. Most of the available studies focused on metrics at the network level, but several studies and this review indicate that the patterns at the network level can be better understood in the light of metrics analyzed at the species level. Our results provide information that enrich the network analysis, highlighting the need to consider important features that are often neglected. Discussions and information compiled here are important for deciding how to look at empirical data and what to look for, as well as to indicate some caveats when interpreting data on plant-pollinator interactions with a complex network approach. Network metrics can be good indicators of environmental quality if the underlying ecological causes of the numerical changes are carefully analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of landscape condition should be selected based on their sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to provide early warning detection of those changes. We assessed the performance of a suite of spatial-pattern metrics selected to quantify the condition of the ridge-slough landscape in the Everglades (South Florida, USA). Spatial pattern metrics (n = 14) that describe landscape composition, geometry and hydrologic connectivity were enumerated from vegetation maps of twenty-five 2 x 2 km primary sampling units (PSUs) that span a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition across the greater Everglades ecosystem. Metrics were assessed in comparison with field measurements from each PSU of landscape condition obtained from regional surveys of soil elevation, which have previously been shown to capture dramatic differences between conserved and degraded locations. Elevation-based measures of landscape condition included soil elevation bi-modality (BisE), a binary measure of landscape condition, and also the standard deviation of soil elevation (SDsE), a continuous measure of condition. Metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs. lagging) of the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and these elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 4 metrics (slough width, ridge density, directional connectivity index DCI, and least flow cost LFC). More significant relationships (n = 8 metrics) were observed with SDsE, with the strongest associations for slough density, mean ridge width, and the average length of straight flow, as well as for a suite of hydrologic connectivity metrics (DCI, LFC and landscape discharge competence LDC). Leading vs. lagging performance, inferred from the curvature of the association obtained from the exponent of fitted power functions, suggest that only DCI was a leading metric of the loss of soil elevation variation; most metrics were indeterminate, though some were clearly lagging. Our findings support the contention that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede changes in landscape pattern, and offer insights that will enable efficient monitoring of the ridge-slough landscape as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.

AB  - Water catchments are functional geographical areas that integrate a variety of environmental processes and human impacts on landscapes. Integrated assessments recognize this interdependence of resources and components making up water catchments and are vital for viable long-term natural resource management. This paper couples eco-hydrological modelling with remote sensing, landscape ecological analyses and GIS to develop a series of indicators of water catchment health as part of a geographical audit of environmental health and change at regional scales.
   Indicators are simple measures that represent key components of the system and have meaning beyond the attributes that are directly measured. A suite of indicators, many capable of measurement from remote sensing data sources, are described that represent state (condition) and trend (changes across space and time) and focus on the physical, biological and chemical properties of water catchments, as well as their ecological function (stability, resilience, and sensitivity). Models implemented in GIS allow indicators to be combined within water catchments by setting them within a specific geographic context and integrating the descriptions of environmental variability across the geographic area. This spatial integration is necessary to place individual, site-specific indicators within a broader geographic context; the models allow this context to reflect the ecological and hydrological functioning of the water catchment. Scale and other geographic effects associated with integration are managed using an approach that partitions the landscape into a hierarchical series of nested functional units.
   Methods from image analysis, landscape ecological analysis, spatial interpolation, and numerical process modelling are integrated within a GIS (ArcView) to provide a single environment within which to conduct the study. Results are described from the catchment of the upper Yellowstone River in the Rocky Mountains, USA, an area of about 14 000 km(2). The river source is in Yellowstone National Park. The catchment is subject to a number of land-use issues notably those associated with changing patterns and types of land use including forestry, irrigated agriculture, range management, wildfire, mining, summer and winter recreation, and residential development, which are associated with a number of land-use conflicts and impacts.

AB  - Successful restoration of wetland ecosystems requires knowledge of wetland hydrologic patterns and an understanding of how those patterns affect wetland plant and animal populations. Within the Everglades, Florida, USA restoration, an applied science strategy including conceptual ecological models linking drivers to indicators is being used to organize current scientific understanding to support restoration efforts. A key driver of the ecosystem affecting the distribution and abundance of organisms is the timing, distribution, and volume of water flows that result in water depth patterns across the landscape. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are one of the ecological indicators being used to assess Everglades restoration because they are a keystone species and integrate biological impacts of hydrological operations through all life stages. Alligator body condition (the relative fatness of an animal) is one of the metrics being used and targets have been set to allow us to track progress. We examined trends in alligator body condition using Fulton's K over a 15 year period (2000-2014) at seven different wetland areas within the Everglades ecosystem, assessed patterns and trends relative to restoration targets, and related those trends to hydrologic variables. We developed a series of 17 a priori hypotheses that we tested with an information theoretic approach to identify which hydrologic factors affect alligator body condition. Alligator body condition was highest throughout the Everglades during the early 2000s and is approximately 5-10% lower now (2014). Values have varied by year, area, and hydrology. Body condition was positively correlated with range in water depth and fall water depth. Our top model was the "Current" model and included variables that describe current year hydrology (spring depth, fall depth, hydroperiod, range, interaction of range and fall depth, interaction of range and hydroperiod). Across all models, interaction between range and fall water depth was the most important variable (relative weight of 1.0) followed by spring and fall water depths (0.99), range (0.96), hydroperiod (0.95) and interaction between range and hydroperiod (0.95). Our work provides additional evidence that restoring a greater range in annual water depths is important for improvement of alligator body condition and ecosystem function. This information can be incorporated into both planning and operations to assist in reaching Everglades restoration goals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Informal trails created or perpetuated by visitors is a management challenge in many protected natural areas such as Yosemite National Park. This is a significant issue as informal trail networks penetrate and proliferate into protected landscapes and habitats, threatening ecological integrity, aesthetics, and visitor experiences. In order to develop effective strategies for addressing this problem under an adaptive management framework, indicators must be developed and monitoring protocol must be established to gather timely and relevant data about the condition, extent, and distribution of these undesired trail segments. This article illustrates a process of developing and evaluating informal trail indicators for meadows in Yosemite Valley. Indicator measures developed in past research were reviewed to identify their appropriateness for the current application. Information gaps in existing indicator measures were addressed by creating two new indices to quantify the degree of informal trailing based on its land fragmentation effects. The selected indicator measures were applied to monitoring data collected between 2006 and 2008. The selected measures and indices were evaluated for their ability to characterize informal trail impacts at site and landscape scales. Results demonstrate the utility of indicator measures in capturing different characteristics of the informal trail problem, though several metrics are strongly related to each other. The two fragmentation indices were able to depict fragmentation without being too sensitive to changes in one constituent parameter. This study points to the need for a multiparameter approach to informal trail monitoring and integration with other monitoring data. Implications for monitoring programs and research are discussed.

AB  - Estuaries in urban regions present unique environmental management challenges. Ecosystems in urban estuaries are typically impacted by habitat loss and degradation, watershed modification, and nonpoint and point sources of many chemicals. Restoring such systems requires an understanding of the relative contribution of various stressors to overall ecological conditions and an understanding of shifting patterns of stress over time. In this article, we present the results of a multiparameter environmental assessment of a quintessential urbanized waterway: the lower Passaic River in the vicinity of Newark, New Jersey, USA. To provide the foundation for effective management decision making, we quantified baseline conditions (habitat losses and degradation), chemical concentrations in sediment and biota relative to published toxic effect levels, direct toxicity of sediments to benthic organisms, and food-web mediated risks to fish-eating birds. Habitat losses have been severe (greater than 85% of wetlands, nearly 100% of the total length of tidal and nontidal tributaries, and 100% of natural shoreline habitat have been lost), resulting in substantial habitat constraints on biota. Despite this, biological communities are present in the lower Passaic. In general, concentrations of toxic chemicals in surface sediments have fallen with time, and natural recovery processes are proceeding. Chemical concentrations remain high enough to impair survival of amphipods, but not amphipod growth or polychaete growth or survival as measured in laboratory bioassays using field-collected sediment. Fish and blue crab body burdens of some metals, PCBs, and the pesticide, DDT, are at concentrations sufficiently high to exceed toxicity thresholds. The resident fish-eating bird-the belted kingfisher-is at exposure risk from some metals, PCBs, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzo furans (PCDD/Fs). Migratory waders-the herons and egrets-are not at risk from chemical exposure. These complex findings suggest that restoring the lower Passaic River to ecological health is a correspondingly complex task. Habitat constraints must be eased for biotic components of the ecosystem, and chemical effects must be reduced for those organisms that are present. Only a coordinated, multidisciplinary restoration program will succeed in this challenging environment.

AB  - Bird populations are fundamental elements of forest biodiversity and play a very important role in maintaining the ecological balance and normal functions of forest ecosystems, so that they are an indicator of sustainable management taken into account at European level. Consequently, the existence or setting up by management measures of the most favourable conditions for diverse assemblages of birds is one of the objectives of sustainable forest management. For this purpose the paper aims to assess the ecological conditions offered by broadleaved stands from the northern Romania for the avian populations. The parameters considered were the stands layers, the composition and spatial distribution of forest shrubs, the stand density, the biological potential of forest species, stand age and stand ecological dynamic, landscape parameters. Using these parameters as partial favourability indices, a simple method for assessing the ecological conditions offered to bird populations based on a Total Favourability Index (TFI) is proposed for practical forest management purposes. According to this index, in the case study of the northern broadleaved managed stands, the ecological favourability for birds is medium.

AB  - Hypoxia is a growing concern in aquatic ecosystems. Historically, scientists have used the P-crit (the dissolved oxygen level below which an animal can no longer oxyregulate) to infer hypoxia tolerance across species. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the P-crit is positively correlated with temperature in the mayfly, Neocloeon triangulifer. Cross-temperature comparisons showed a modest (r = 0.47), but significant (p < 0.0001) association between temperature and P-crit despite relatively large interindividual variability (Coefficient of Variance (CV) = 39.9% at 18 degrees C). We used the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes EGL-9 (an oxygen sensing gene and modulator of HIF-1a activity) and LDH (a hypoxia indicator) to test whether oxygen partial pressure near the P-crit stimulates expression of hypoxia-responsive genes. Neither gene was upregulated at oxygen levels above the estimated P-crit however, at or below the P-crit estimates, expression of both genes was stimulated (similar to 20- and similar to 3-fold change for EGL-9 and IDH, respectively). Finally, we evaluated the influence of hypoxic exposure time and pretreatment conditions on the mRNA expression levels of hypoxia-responsive genes. When larvae were exposed to a gradual reduction of DO, hypoxic gene expression was more robust than during instantaneous exposure to hypoxia. Our data provide modest support for traditional interpretation of the P-crit as a physiologically meaningful shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in N. triangulifer. However, we also discuss limitations of the P-crit as a proxy measure of hypoxia tolerance at the species level.

AB  - The aim of the present work was the assessment of the environmental status of marine biota along the Sicilian ionic coast (Italy). Due to its complex habitat requirements, the fish fauna is a crucial indicator of the ecological integrity of aquatic systems at different scales, from micro-habitat to catchment. Besides environmental contaminants, biomarkers of oxidative stress answer to the Water Framework Directive's challenges for improved detection of the impacts of chemical compounds on aquatic organisms. Highly consumed seafood species (Solea solea, Mullus barbatus, Sardina pilchardus and Scomber scombrus) were taken at the Gulf of Catania (Sicily). Levels of metals/metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V, Zn) were estimated in muscle tissue as well as oxidative stress parameter such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) derivatives in liver. The total metals/metalloids load indicated as Metal Pollution Index (MPI, unitless) were the following: 0.258 in S. pilchardus, 0.203 in S. scombrus, 0.123 in M. barbatus and 0.071 in S. solea. The greatest contribution was given by As (mean range 2.670-9.748 mg/kg wet weight) and Zn (mean range 2.169-4.736 wet weight) levels. Hg, Ni and Zn presented mean levels progressively higher, with increasing trophic position. From a chemical point of view, the analyzed species were healthy for human consumption and the risk to develop chronic systemic and carcinogenic effects was low; nevertheless, it has highlighted an oxidative stress condition.

AB  - Biotic indicators have been widely used to monitor wetland health. However, few studies have explicitly evaluated if plant diversity could serve as a useful community-level indicator of wetland stability, especially when wetlands are confronted with anthropogenic perturbations. Based on three-year record of wetland plant species abundance in Napahai plateau wetland, Shangri-la under the influence of varying anthropogenic perturbation types, our study tests the impact of such perturbations on plant richness and the relationship between ecosystem temporal stability and plant richness, and further assesses the effectiveness of using plant diversity indicator to probe ecosystem temporal stability of Napahai plateau wetland and the potential mechanisms. The results showed that anthropogenic perturbations could have contributed significantly to realistic variation in plant diversity, and further demonstrated that ecosystem temporal stability was positively related to realistic variation in plant diversity. In particular, communities with high levels of diversity might have better capacity to dampen perturbation impacts than communities with low levels of diversity, and statistical averaging could have played an important role in causing greater stability in more diverse communities. Also, asynchrony might have a stabilizing effect on community stability, and diversity could have stabilized communities through both species asynchrony and population stability propagation. Therefore, our results suggest that plant diversity could be used as a useful indicator of the stability conditions of plateau wetland ecosystems confronted with anthropogenic perturbations, and the preservation of plant communities at sufficient abundance and diversity is necessary for maintaining healthy plateau wetlands and for sustaining their essential ecosystem functions and services.

TI  - Destruction of spores on building decontamination residue in a commercial autoclave
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a commercial autoclave for treating simulated building decontamination residue (BDR). The BDR was intended to simulate porous materials removed from a building deliberately contaminated with biological agents such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) in a terrorist attack. The purpose of the tests was to assess whether the standard operating procedure for a commercial autoclave provided sufficiently robust conditions to adequately destroy bacterial spores bound to the BDR. In this study we investigated the effects of several variables related to autoclaving BDR, including time, temperature, pressure, item type, moisture content, packing density, packing orientation, autoclave bag integrity, and autoclave process sequence. The test team created simulated BDR from wallboard, ceiling tiles, carpet, and upholstered furniture, and embedded in the BDR were Geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicator (BI) strips containing 10(6) spores and thermocouples to obtain time and temperature profile data associated with each III strip. The results indicated that a single standard autoclave cycle did not effectively decontaminate the BDR. Autoclave cycles consisting of 120 min at 31.5 lb/in(2) and 275 degrees F and 75 min at 45 lb/in(2) and 292 degrees F effectively decontaminated the BDR material. Two sequential standard autoclave cycles consisting of 40 min at 31.5 lb/in(2) and 275 degrees F proved to be particularly effective, probably because the second cycle's evacuation step pulled the condensed water out of the pores of the materials, allowing better steam penetration. The results also indicated that the packing density and material type of the BDR in the autoclave could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the decontamination process.

AB  - Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) are among the most threatened ecosystems globally in spite of their high strategic value for sustainable development due to the key role played by these forests in hydrological cycle maintenance and as reservoirs of endemic biodiversity. Resources for effective conservation and management programs are rarely sufficient, and criteria must be applied to prioritise TMCF for conservation action. This paper reports a priority analysis of the 13 main regions of TMCF distribution in Mexico, based on four criteria: (1) forest quality, (2) threats to forest permanence, (3) threats to forest integrity, and (4) opportunities for conservation. Due to the diverse socio-environmental conditions of the local communities living in Mexican TMCF regions, their associated social characteristics were also evaluated to provide a background for the planning of conservation actions. A set of indicators was defined for the measurement of each criterion. To assign priority values for subregions within each main region, an international team of 40 participants evaluated all the indicators using multicriteria decision-making analysis. This procedure enabled the identification of 15 subregions of critical priority, 17 of high priority, and 10 of medium priority; three more were not analysed due to lack of information. The evaluation revealed a number of subjects that had hitherto been undetected and that may prove useful for prioritisation efforts in other regions where TMCF is similarly documented and faces equally severe threats. Based on this analysis, key recommendations are outlined to advance conservation objectives in those TMCF areas that are subjected to high pressure on forest resources. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine seasonal variation in energy balance components and to evaluate the biophysical control of evapotranspiration in a preserved Caatinga area, under intense drought conditions. The experiment was conducted in 2012, using the eddy covariance system, installed at 16.9 m above soil surface. In addition, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, net radiation, soil heat flux, and soil temperature were measured. Data on the sensible and latent heat fluxes were processed with the Alteddy software and analyzed on daily and seasonal scales. Using the latent heat flux data, the evapotranspiration rates were determined, as well as the indicators of their sensitivity to environmental conditions: decoupling factor, and aerodynamical and surface resistances. The net radiation showed a strong seasonality, with behavior dependent on solar radiation. The partition of the energy balance components revealed that the occurrence of intense drought maximizes the destination of the available energy to sensible heat flux, and that evapotranspiration under this condition is specifically dependent on the vapor pressure deficit and on the surface resistance.

AB  - Tracking the incremental and combined effects of large-scale ecosystem restoration programs is scientifically and socioeconomically challenging; this is especially true for ongoing management and restoration programs in the northern Gulf of Mexico and adjacent areas following the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster. When implemented, monitoring programs for large-scale ecosystems typically monitor overall system health and/or the progress toward individual restoration project goals. However, being able to demonstrate successful "individual restoration projects" does not necessarily equate to providing cost-effective benefits at the large-scale ecosystem level, especially when the area and complexity of the system is, large. More than $16 billion is available for ecosystem restoration related activities associated with multiple Deepwater Horizon settlements (i.e., Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Trustee Council, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation). Restoration activities conducted under the NRDA settlement are intended to restore injured resources to conditions that would have existed in the absence of the spill and to compensate the public for lost use of injured resources. Other restoration activities funded by the settlements are designated to restore the Gulf Coast economy, culture and environmental health by addressing a multitude of other ecological and economic injuries in the Gulf ecosystem not directly caused by the spill. Although the collective funding for restoration activities is large, unprecedented, and has the potential to begin making progress toward reducing adverse long-term environmental stressors, it is insufficient to fully address all stressors to restore ecological health in the vast Gulf ecosystem. This creates a unique challenge for restoration program managers who in addition to demonstrating the success of individual projects, need to demonstrate that overall restoration funds were spent wisely and produced significant synergistic benefits to preserve and restore the Gulf ecosystem. This will be especially important as settlement funds are exhausted and resource managers seek public funding to continue restoration and conservation efforts.
   We evaluated approaches for integrating the monitoring of individual project outcomes in order to also monitor the combined program progress across all Gulf oil disaster restoration programs based on (1) lessons learned from other large-scale restoration programs; (2) integrated restoration goals and objectives from multiple Gulf restoration programs; (3) common stressors, and potential interactions with varying restoration and conservation target categories and their associated types of projects; and (4) the applicability of monitoring at both the project and program level. We identified a suite of 10 performance metrics or indicators that are applicable to multiple project types and restoration entities in the Gulf using restoration indicators that are highly applicable across restoration categories at both the project and system level. Utilizing a small set of indicators that can be measured across multiple resource and project types creates an opportunity to build a core set of metrics into individual project monitoring plans in a way that is cost-effective, efficient and consistent. Our approach represents one way to track the impacts of restoration activities at a scale larger than the project level in the Gulf, while recognizing the scientific, political and economic challenges associated with restoring the Gulf ecosystem in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster.

AB  - Commercially-exploited fish populations are not only shaped by fishing pressure, but also by the dynamics of their environment. By quantifying the influence of environmental variability, fisheries management advice can be improved and uncertainties reduced. To this end, we developed statistical models of the response of Scotian Shelf silver hake stock metrics to variability in zooplankton community composition and phenology over the past 18 years and in the physical environment since 1985. Dominant modes of variability in these pelagic habitat indicators were characterized using principal component analysis, and the relationships of silver hake condition, abundance, and recruitment to pelagic habitat variability were assessed using generalized additive models. Condition was largely modulated by the onset and duration of the spring bloom, which controls food availability. In contrast, adult abundance was governed by composition of the zooplankton community and bottom-water temperature, which dictates the distribution of silver hake. Finally, recruitment was affected by both thermal conditions and food availability. Our results presented here form the basis for qualitative assessment of ecosystem attributes and the influence on silver hake stock productivity.

AB  - Human activity surrounding the Laurentian Great Lakes basin has significantly degraded coastal wetland habitats, resulting in severe marsh bird population declines and reduced coastal resilience to changing environmental conditions. Given the need to conserve remaining coastal wetlands for wildlife and people, we developed a spatial prioritization to identify the most important U.S. Great Lakes coastal wetlands for 14 marsh bird species. We modeled occurrence and relative abundance of each species using boosted regression trees, a machine learning algorithm, to relate standardized monitoring data to ten remotely-sensed environmental covariates. We then used Zonation conservation planning software to rank every wetland cell based on its importance for the suite of marsh bird species. Evaluation of the drivers of marsh bird occurrence and abundance revealed that open water, herbaceous wetland, latitude, longitude, and impervious surface were the most important predictors across focal species. The high-priority wetlands for marsh birds (defined as grid cells ranked in the top 20%) occurred along the shores of eastern Lake Ontario, western Lake Erie/St. Clair, Saginaw Bay, Green Bay, northern lakes Michigan and Huron, and western Lake Superior. Overall, less than half (42%) of high priority coastal wetlands across the Great Lakes basin are currently under some level of protection, with Lake Ontario priority wetlands being the least protected (25%). Our findings represent an opportunity to improve coastal wetland conservation in a region where wetland loss and degradation continue to threaten marsh bird populations and the integrity of one of the world's largest freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of macroinvertebrate community-based multimetrics to assess the ecological health of 38 rivers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa. The study area comprised of head-water to lowland rivers determined by their hydro-morphology. Of the 40 tested metrics, only 11 core metrics were finally selected because of their ability to distinguish between reference and impaired sites, correlation strength with environmental variables and their reliability. Nine out of the selected metrics had strong correlations with environmental variables and these were total number of taxa, total number of Diptera taxa, total number of Plecoptera individuals, percentage of Ephemeroptera Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, percentage of Odonata taxa, total number of Trichoptera individuals, total number of Gastropoda individuals, total number of Oligochaeta individuals and total number of Coleoptera individuals. This study showed increasing chemical deterioration along longitudinal gradients of the rivers in KZN. We found that macroinvertebrate community metrics could detect nutrient pollution, organic pollution and physical habitat degradation in the rivers of KZN. We recommend more studies and validation of macroinvertebrate community-based metrics in the assessment of rivers in KZN, because they are relatively cheap and easy to use. The use of macroinvertebrate community metrics could be an effective alternative assessment method in the case of the lowland rivers where the lack of quality data often has negative impacts on the use of the biotic indices (South African Scoring System (SASS), Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) and Macroinvertebrate Response Assessment Index (MIRAI)).

AB  - Building resilience to major economic, social, and ecological crises such as armed conflict and natural disasters is seen as critical to maintaining system integrity. Although studies of system survival can be used to gauge whether or not social systems are resilient, this can only be conducted in retrospect. Contemporary measures of resilience rely on proxy measures that one can argue build capacity for resilience, but are not direct proxies for resilience itself, except in highly subscribed conditions. This leads us to our key research questions: Can the resilience of a system be measured contemporaneously by those within a social system? What can we learn from past efforts to understand the resilience of social systems by those living through their transformations?
   To answer these we examine Europe in the second half of the 14th century, during the outbreak and spread of the Plague through the continent. Through an examination of academic research relying on contemporary accounts during this period, we examine the indicators Europeans used at the time to understand changes in their social-ecological systems. We find a time lag between quantitative indicators of system resilience and the systemic shocks introduced by the Plague. However, narratives from the time suggest that those who experienced the epidemic were trying to develop personal understandings of the social changes around them and collective understandings of how to respond to these crises, both in advance of collecting easily comparable data that could be used for broader administrative purposes. The progression from individual narratives, to common understandings, and finally to comparable data is likely a common process that occurs as those within a social-ecological system make sense of a shift of the system from one arrangement to another.

AB  - We examined how geographic distribution of birds and their affinities to three geomorphic wetland types would affect the scale at which we developed indicators based on breeding bird communities for Great Lakes coastal wetlands. We completed 385 breeding bird surveys on 222 wetlands in the US portion of the basin in 2002 and 2003. Analyses showed that wetlands within two ecoprovinces (Laurentian Mixed Forest and Eastern Broadleaf Forest) had different bird communities. Bird communities were also significantly different among five lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) and among three wetland types (lacustrine, riverine, barrier-protected). Indicator values illustrated bird species with high affinities for each group (ecoprovince, lake, wetland type). Species with restricted geographic ranges, such as Alder and Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax alnorum and E. traillii), had significant affinities for ecoprovince. Ten bird species had significant affinities for lacustrine wetlands. Analyses on avian guild metrics showed that Lake Ontario wetlands had fewer long-distant migrants and warblers than other lakes. Numbers of short-distant migrants and total individuals in wetlands were higher in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest ecoprovince. Number of flycatchers and wetland obligate birds were not different among provinces, lakes, or wetland type. One potential indicator for wetland condition in Great Lakes wetlands, proportion of obligate wetland birds, responded negatively to proportion of developed land within 1 km of the wetland. We conclude that, although a guild approach to indicator development ameliorates species-specific geographic differences in distribution, individual species responses to disturbance scale will need to be considered in future indicator development with this approach.

AB  - We have investigated the parameters affecting the magnitude and polarity of the electric charges carried by biological particles in the airborne state. A recently developed experimental setup through which we analyzed the electric charges imposed on airborne particles by a means of induction charging (Mainelis et al. (Aerosol Sci. Technol. 2001, submitted for publication)) was utilized for this research. In this study, the microorganisms were aerosolized under controlled conditions and an electric mobility analyzer extracted particles of specific electric mobility. The extracted microorganisms were then analyzed by an optical particle size spectrometer. The amount of electric charge carried by airborne microorganisms was found to depend on the dispersion method and can be more than 10,000 elementary electric charges. This finding contrasts with the low electric charge levels carried by non-biological particles. Our data show that repeated pneumatic dispersion of sensitive bacteria affects their structural integrity, which, in turn, changes the magnitude of electric charges carried by these bacteria. We have concluded that the amount of electric charge carried by aerosolized bacteria may be used as an indicator of mechanical stress. It was also found that the electrical conductivity and the pH level of a bacterial suspension increase during aerosolization from a Collison nebulizer. Thus, these two parameters may be used as indicators of the mechanical stress, injury and loss in viability, endured by bacteria during aerosolization, i.e., measuring the electrical conductivity and pH level of bacterial suspensions may be a simple and convenient method for monitoring the "wear and tear" of the bacteria suspended in deionized water.

AB  - Setting ecological goals for restoring fish communities in larger rivers is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the natural reference conditions. The lowland river Vecht has become highly regulated since 1850. Since the 1970s, measures have been taken to improve water quality followed by the construction of fishways along weirs in the 1990s to rehabilitate migration. We aim to assess the degree of deviation of the current fish community in the river from its pre-regulation state. The assessment is based on a comparison with the less impacted river Biebrza in Poland as a geographical reference, involving a semi-quantitative stepwise reconstruction based on available historic evidence. Electrofishing was used to describe the current quantitative species compositions of the fish communities in the rivers Vecht and Biebrza and historical records of the Vecht region were used to crosscheck the reconstructed fish community around 1850 after correcting for zoogeographical differences. Despite various rehabilitation measures, the deviation from the natural reference is still large. Currently, perch Perca fluviatilis and bream Abramis brama are much more abundant, and bleak Alburnus alburnus, white bream Blicca bjoerkna and most rheophilic species are far less abundant, than before. The main reasons for this deviation appears to be the present quality of the habitats and, for some species, the poor connectivity with the sea as well as with small tributaries. The approach used should be widely applicable to derive natural references, assess rehabilitation success or improve the ecological assessment of integrity as imposed by the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - The publication of the Water Framework Directive by the European commission in 2000 has promoted the development of many multimetric biological indices to assess the ecological status of European waterbodies. These ecological assessments are based on the measurement of deviations between a metric's (characteristic of assemblages) observed values (obtained by sampling) and a metric's expected values in the absence of anthropogenic stressors (reference conditions). In addition, the confidence in the ecological status evaluation provided by the different biological indices is required. Numerous sources of uncertainty due to sampling variability or operator bias, for example, are often considered on observed metric values, whereas uncertainty associated with expected metric values are seldom discussed. In this study, we developed a methodology based on Monte-Carlo methods to assess the uncertainty associated with the establishment of reference values for multimetric predictive indices. This was done by randomly generating reference values and propagating the uncertainty throughout the computation of the index. This methodology can be applied to a wide variety of indices as long as it is possible to make assumptions about the statistical distributions of some of the index's numerical components (e.g. coefficients of the statistical models, metric values). The European Lake Fish Index was used to illustrate the methodology and show how this method can provide valuable information on the confidence in the ecological status defined by the index. These results also revealed that the degree of uncertainty varied between the ecological classes, which were highest for the "Moderate" class and lowest for the "Poor" and "High" classes for the ELFI.

AB  - Stated preference surveys often provide ambiguous descriptions of ecological commodities, yielding welfare estimates that have unclear interpretations and cannot be linked to measurable outcomes. This paper proposes guidelines to promote ecological content validity in survey scenarios and defensible use of ecological information for welfare analysis. These guidelines are illustrated through an application to migratory fish restoration. Content validity is evaluated vis-a-vis norms for communication of ecological changes in the ecological literature. Findings suggest that less structured treatment of ecological commodities may lead to an omission of information that is relevant to respondents and essential for valid welfare estimation.

AB  - A Decalogue summarizing the experience over 30 years in biomonitoring is provided by the authors with two main focuses, the use of macroinvertebrates as biological indicators, and the design of systems to evaluate the ecological status in rivers and streams. After a general introduction and a summary of the origins of biomonitoring in Spain, the authors examine the papers on this topic published in the Limnetica journal. The authors use the data of such papers to illustrate the points that have to be taken into account in order to design biomonitoring programs, and summarized these ideas in a Decalogue. The Decalogue contents all required steps to produce a proper biomonitoring system that will be normative compliant with the specifications of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The 10 parts of the Decalogue are: 1) how to establish a sampling network; 2) human and material resources available for sampling; 3) definition of the river typologies; 4) how to establish the reference conditions; 5) sampling protocols to be used; 6) biological metrics to be applied; 7) setting the threshold between the different quality classes and its relationship with the pressures; 8) ecological quality maps and output system by using the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio); 9) quality standards and control; 10) setting the quality objectives and definition of the adequate measures to recover water quality issues. In the Limnetica journal since 1981, a total of 641 papers on aquatic ecology have been published, 42% were on rivers and 18 % specifically in biomonitoring. Most of the published papers in biomonitoring used macroinvertebrates (88 %), while less than 20 % used the reference condition and/or river typology approach to set the quality classes thresholds. However, despite the existence of the WFD since the year 2000, many papers published in Limnetica after 2002 (at this year a Limnetica's special issue on biomonitoring in Mediterranean streams was published), do not met the requirements of this Directive. Today, given the experience gained in the implementation of the WFD any biomonitoring system developed in Europe must be comparable to the existing ones and especially with the common intercalibration metric (ICM). The Decalogue present the necessary steps for a system to be compliant with the WFD regulations.

AB  - Given limited funding, natural resources decision making is riddled with tradeoffs, including which species or landscapes to prioritize for management action. Florida's Everglades wetland is home to numerous indicator species, some of which are endangered. But with a multitude of species comes differing hydrologic requirements to yield appropriate foraging and breeding conditions for each. The Everglades ecosystem is highly managed, with water being moved across the landscape to meet the habitat and reproductive needs of species of concern. Predictive modeling can help water managers understand potential consequences to targeted water conditions. EverForecast is a novel spatially explicit, hydrologic, and ecological operational forecast developed to inform conservation management decisions. Not only does EverForecast provide probable near-term water conditions, but also predicted species responses to those hydrologic conditions. Using examples from two focal regions of the Everglades, we show the magnitude of impacts to a suite of species and an almost 70% decline in suitable conditions for one species when prioritizing water management to meet the needs of another species. Although EverForecast is a relatively new decision support tool, its hydrologic outputs are already commonly used to make water management recommendations because it provides near-term hydrologic forecasts that scientists and managers need for water operations decision making. Because species management decisions have historically been made to target a single species at a time, it may take longer for full utility of EverForecast's ability to quantify tradeoffs among species to become integrated into decision making.

Each indicator was associated with some facet of hydrologic, biogeochemical, and/or habitat functioning and to channel condition, riparian zone condition, or both. Variation in the condition of the indicators among reference reaches provided a framework for developing narratives that could be used to partition and score the condition of the indicators from 0 (severely altered) to 100 (relatively unaltered). The developed narratives were the basis for creating a scoring approach for assessing stream condition at the reach scale (100-m long x 60-m wide segment). This approach was designed to be a rapid, field-based assessment method (< 1 h/site) that could be applied by resource professionals with several days of training in the method. Although most alterations to riparian reaches usually affect both channels and riparian zones together, the ability to score channel and riparian zone condition separately is useful for diagnosing problems and suggesting viable restoration options at the reach scale. The assessment method is also useful for comparing the condition of reaches relative to one another, thus offering guidance for prioritizing restoration efforts at a watershed scale.

AB  - This study uses the directional output distance function, a multi-output economic production frontier model, to value the physical tradeoffs between agricultural production and wetland condition in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region Nanticoke River watershed. We combine detailed ecological indicator data to measure wetland condition with satellite imagery land use data on agricultural production in the watershed. Our estimation procedure adapts the bootstrap methods originally developed by Simar and Wilson (1998) for nonparametric efficiency estimates to the quadratic directional output distance function. We find substantial variation in tradeoff values across the watershed, which could be used to target wetland conservation efforts in the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In plant ecology, biochemical analyses of bryophytes and vascular plants are often conducted on dried herbarium specimen as species typically grow in distant and inaccessible locations. Here, we present an automated in silico compound classification framework to annotate metabolites using an untargeted data independent acquisition (DIA)-LC/MS-QToF-sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH) ecometabolomics analytical method. We perform a comparative investigation of the chemical diversity at the global level and the composition of metabolite families in ten different species of bryophytes using fresh samples collected on-site and dried specimen stored in a herbarium for half a year. Shannon and Pielou's diversity indices, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA), ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test, and the Fisher's exact test were used to determine differences in the richness and composition of metabolite families, with regard to herbarium conditions, ecological characteristics, and species. We functionally annotated metabolite families to biochemical processes related to the structural integrity of membranes and cell walls (proto-lignin, glycerophospholipids, carbohydrates), chemical defense (polyphenols, steroids), reactive oxygen species (ROS) protection (alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids), nutrition (nitrogen- and phosphate-containing glycerophospholipids), and photosynthesis. Changes in the composition of metabolite families also explained variance related to ecological functioning like physiological adaptations of bryophytes to dry environments (proteins, peptides, flavonoids, terpenes), light availability (flavonoids, terpenes, carbohydrates), temperature (flavonoids), and biotic interactions (steroids, terpenes). The results from this study allow to construct chemical traits that can be attributed to biogeochemistry, habitat conditions, environmental changes and biotic interactions. Our classification framework accelerates the complex annotation process in metabolomics and can be used to simplify biochemical patterns. We show that compound classification is a powerful tool that allows to explore relationships in both molecular biology by "zooming in" and in ecology by "zooming out". The insights revealed by our framework allow to construct new research hypotheses and to enable detailed follow-up studies.

AB  - We sought to determine the effectiveness of experimental disturbances for assessing resilience and stability in a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. To do this, we applied disturbances of different intensities along a gradient of sediment deposition that doubled as a gradient of known stress, being associated in previous studies with numerous measures of plant vigor and soil condition. Using this gradient as a standard, we postulated a priori that areas receiving sediment were less stressed than areas which received no sediment, and therefore would be more stable and recover more rapidly after experimental disturbances.
   For the vegetation, we found that our estimates of resilience and stability were strongly and positively affected by sediment deposition, and therefore agreed with our a priori estimates. After lethal disturbance (herbicide application), vegetation in plots not receiving sediment failed to recover, and the affected marsh turned into a mudflat and remained so during the period of observation (>2 years). In contrast, plots receiving high and moderate amounts of sediment recovered rapidly after lethal disturbance (8-11% recovery month(-1) to 50% of control levels [dependent variable was a composite variable describing vegetation]). After non-lethal disturbance (trimming at the soil surface) all study plots recovered, with rate of vegetative recovery being directly associated with degree of sediment deposition. For edaphic parameters, there no was effect of disturbance, and thus these parameters appeared to be resistant to vegetation removal. These parameters appeared to be more powerfully affected by other factors, such as water level fluctuations and sediment addition.
   We conclude that experimental disturbances accurately assessed stress along a known stress-gradient. They also provided additional information about the underlying stress in the system. In particular, it was intriguing that in stressed areas S. alterniflora grew in elevated "hummocks" which appeared unable to send rhizomes into denuded areas or to recover after root death. Because recovery after experimental disturbances depends on a variety of plant-soil processes, we suggest that this recovery can be used as a bio-indicator of ecosystem condition that provides insight into important underlying determinants of structure and function.

AB  - Anthropogenic transformations of habitat conditions in moderate climate peatlands frequently cause a decrease in the number of sites of occurrence and the size of the population of many valuable plant species, including the boreal relic Betula humilis. The objective of this paper was an attempt to relate the specifics of the occurrence of the glacial relic Betula humilis in the peatlands of Central-Eastern Poland, which developed under moderate climate conditions, to the conditions of the natural environment identified through research into the physical and chemical parameters of the groundwater, as well as botanical research into its habitat. The study results confirm that shrub birch has a broad range of ecological tolerance to the majority of the studied factors and can therefore be an indicator of habitat transformation. Important environmental factors affecting its abundance are water relations and the contribution of calcium hydroxide and phosphorus fractions. A condition favouring the proper functioning of individuals of the studied species is TP values lower than other obtained values, in the following range: 0.08-0.32; P-PO4: 0.1; TN: 2.2-21.2; N-NH4: 0.1-0.46; DOC: 24.6-55.9 (mgdm(-3)), as well as higher than average pH values, in the following range: 5.34-5.95; Ca: 5.67-28.1; Mg: 0.56-2.41 (mgdm(-3)) and EC: 72.1-142.3 (mu Scm(-1)).

AB  - Innovative management strategies for nutrient enrichment of freshwater are important in the face of this increasing global problem, however many strategies are not assessed over long enough time periods to establish effectiveness. Paleolimnological techniques using diatoms as biological indicators were utilized to establish ecological reference conditions, environmental variation, and the effectiveness of lanthanum-saturated bentonite clay (brand name: Phoslock (R)) applied to reduce water column phosphorus (P) concentrations in four waterbodies in Ontario, Canada, and eastern Australia. In sediment cores from the two Canadian sites, there were short-lived changes to diatom assemblages, relative to inferred background conditions, and a temporary reduction in both measured and diatom-inferred total phosphorus (TP) before returning to pre-application conditions (particularly in the urban stormwater management pond which has a high flushing rate and responds rapidly to precipitation and surface run-off). The two Australian sites (a sewage treatment pond and a shallow recreational lake), recorded no reduction in diatom-inferred TP. Based on our pre-application environmental reconstruction, changes to the diatom assemblages and diatom-inferred TP appeared to be driven by larger, climatic factors. While laboratory tests involving this product showed sharp reductions in water column TP, management strategies require detailed information on pre-application environmental conditions and variations in order to accurately assess the effectiveness of new technologies for lake management.

AB  - Managing climate impacts to natural resources in protected areas can be hampered by lack of monitoring data, poor understanding of natural resource responses to climate, or lack of timely condition assessments that can inform management actions. Here we demonstrate the utility of water balance as a tool for understanding natural resource responses to climate by developing case studies focused on stream flow, vegetation production, and wildfire ignition at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (GSDNP), U.S.A. The efficacy of water balance to predict these responses stems from the explicit integration of climate with site conditions that modify the effects of climate. This in turn results in estimates of water availability, water use, and water need that are proximal drivers of aquatic and terrestrial natural resource conditions. The water balance model successfully forecasted stream flow (r(2) = 0.69, P < 0.001); determined the critical water needs for maintaining annual vegetation production in different vegetation types spanning a large environmental gradient (r(2) = 0.18-0.71); and predicted proportion of historic wildfire ignitions in forest (r(2) = 0.96-0.99) and non-forest (r(2) = 0.96-0.97) vegetation types. Collectively, these case studies demonstrate practical approaches to translate climate data into assessments of natural resource condition that inform long-term planning and near-term strategic actions needed for conservation of protected areas.

AB  - With their species diversity, their population abundance and their integrator characters, higher plants represent useful tools to solve problems concerning the environment analysis and management. As they are good bioindicators, plants integrate many environmental parameters and can help to reveal the misworking of the ecosystems. Within this framework, a recent and complete survey of the phanerogamic flora of the Brussels area was carried out by the method of the Aoristic,grid-map based on 1 km - squares. A comparison with earlier data has allowed us to appreciate the consequences of half st century of human activities on plant diversity in the urban ecosystem. The basic aim is to present a method of diagnosis and mapping that has been used, so as to turn the descriptive information about the biological environment of the area into a series of guidelines for land-use regulation and management within the city.
   Ellenberg's indicator values were used to express the relationship of flora to soil nitrogen, moisture content, reaction, light and temperature. Considering the biological characteristics of new floristic components and plants which have become rare or disappeared, it was possible to draw conclusions about the alterations in environmental conditions in Brussels. Our results show that the number of species did not differ significantly from 1940 until now. However, considerable changes have appeared during this period: there is a clear increase in the number of alien species; the flora of the Brussels area is becoming more nitrophilous and tolerant to shade, while it does not differ with respect to soil moisture, reaction and temperature.
   Human activities have disturbed the distribution and abundance of many species, inducing a decline or disappearance of some of them, principally those which are associated with cropland, with marshland and woodland. On the other hand, numerous species have recently appeared in the city, many of which are aliens. The comparison between indigenous and alien species has revealed that their occurrence depends upon their ecological requirements: alien species are more tolerant of nitrogen, light, drought, heat and alkaline soils.
   The response of the flora to human impact is clearly demonstrated. Such sensitivity has obvious implications for both conservation and management. Circumstances, where Brussels plant monitoring is carried out permitting the avoidance of potential disaster and the saving of valuable biological resources, are developed. Arguments for the conservation of wild plants in cities also lead to some remarks concerning nature conservation practices in Brussels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper is aiming at testing the National Methodological Framework for assessment ecosystem condition and ecosystem services on the local scale. In a pilot case study an assessment of the condition of Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lypski) ecosystems in Strandzha Mountain was carried out. The main conclusion to emerge is that the studied Oriental beech ecosystems in Strandzha Mt were in a good structural-functional condition. They have preserved a high potential to provide ecosystem services. As a whole, the developed National approach of assessment the condition of ecosystems presented a satisfactory ad hoc picture of the ecosystems' condition of Oriental beech ecosystems. Gaps in the data sets and lack of time series data on main condition indicators were the main constrains in the assessment process at the local scale.

AB  - Ecological indicators likely constitute the mainstream tools in assessing the quality of aquatic ecosystems as they condense composite biological information into single measures, easier to handle for environmental managers and more understandable for non-scientific users. However, sampling settings can influence the performance of most indices, and their use is often constrained to specific habitat types. Average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)) may represent promising tools in overcoming sampling bias, and potentially applicable to a wide range of environmental contexts. In marine systems, such metrics showed higher sensitivity than classical indices in discriminating among perturbed and unperturbed conditions, though a number of studies found Delta(+) and Lambda(+) also varying along natural gradients, suggesting a lower ability to discern human-driven variations from natural variability than what expected. Here, analyzing existing data sets from previous impact assessment studies, we test the response of Delta(+) and Lambda(+) in detecting the effects of different sources of anthropogenic disturbance on marine mollusks and polychaetes from Mediterranean soft sediments and hard substrates. Our results showed that neither classical univariate analyses on Delta(+) and Lambda(+) values nor their associated statistical framework were able to discern among perturbed and unperturbed sites, highlighting a low sensitiveness of such metrics in detecting assemblage variations related to anthropogenic disturbance. Delta(+) and Lambda(+) are based on presence/absence data, and assume impacts being likely to induce variations in taxonomic structures of assemblages. As a consequence, they could experience reduced discrimination power when impacts mostly affect relative abundances of organisms rather than assemblage composition, or drive species replacement within higher taxa. Our results also showed that habitat type could strongly affect taxonomic relatedness of species within assemblages, and that this effect can vary among different organisms, suggesting that the departures from expectation of Delta(+) and Lambda(+) values might not be always univocally attributable to human perturbations, since possibly depending on habitat effects. Taxonomic distinctness indices can provide useful additional information on taxonomic diversity of assemblages, crucial to better address the wide concept of biological diversity. However, the effectiveness of such measures in disclosing the effects of human disturbance is still unclear, requiring further investigations especially on their potential application in defining the ecological status of coastal rocky systems.

AB  - Apart from other biological methods, the mapping of submerged macrophytes is an important instrument for longterm monitoring of the quality of running waters. This type of monitoring is particularly suitable to lotic systems with lower dynamic discharge patterns resulting in a wide diversity of macrophytes. Submerged macrophytes react equally to processes of eutrophication and oligotrophication (acidification of waters) caused by man. Their high ability to persist, compared to other groups of organisms, allows for a highly integrative bioindication statement. The overall statement and high local precision achieved with a mapping of macrophytes comply with the increasingly important assessment of the integrity of the ecological system of running waters.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive commits partner countries to evolve uniform protocols for monitoring the environmental condition of natural water bodies, crucially integrating biological and ecological criteria from the associated ecosystems. This has encouraged considerable research on the development of bioindicator-based systems of water quality monitoring. A critical step towards this end is providing evidence that the proposed bioindicator system adequately reflects the human pressures to which a specific water body is submitted. Here we investigate the utility of pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry, a fast, non-destructive and increasingly popular bioindicator-based method, in assessing water quality based on the widespread Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, an important constituent of submersed benthic vegetation. Specifically, we evaluated the ability of PAM to discriminate between sites along a pre-established gradient of anthropogenic pressures and the consistency and reliability of PAM parameters across spatial scales. Our results show that the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), representing the structural photosynthetic efficiency of the plant, responds significantly to the degree of site-level anthropogenic pressure. However, Fv/Fm values in our study increased with increasing pressure, in striking contrast with other studies that report declines in Fv/Fm values with increasing stress. A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that our study sites were influenced by multiple diffuse stressors (characteristic of most coastal waters) that could potentially interact with each other to influence Fv/Fm values in often unpredictable ways. The photosynthetic variables calculated from rapid light curves (ETRmax, maximum electron transport rate; alpha, initial slope of the curve; I (k), saturating irradiance), which represent an instant picture of the photosynthetic activity of the plant, were unable to clearly discriminate between sites subject to different anthropogenic pressures due to considerable small-scale variability. Taken together, these results suggest that even though PAM fluorometry may be a good candidate tool for monitoring water bodies in terms of costs and applicability, considerably more needs to be understood about how its parameters respond to real-world stressors, particularly when they act in concert with each other. With our present understanding of seagrass photosynthetic responses to anthropogenic stress, it would be ill advised to employ PAM as anything but a complementary tool to validate environmental stress derived with other, more robust methodologies.

AB  - We investigated the relationships, at a local level, between fish condition and environmental variables in Gobius cobitis juveniles. The relationships between 14 ecological variables of shallow areas of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (water temperature, water salinity, depth, submerged vegetation richness, submerged vegetation cover, submerged vegetation volume, substrate size, substrate heterogeneity, fish species richness, potential competitor fish species abundance and biomass, G. cobitis abundance and biomass, G. cobitis biomass/abundance ratio) and fish condition were analysed. The mass-length relationship of juveniles was used to test differences in fish condition between 12 sampling sites. The ecological variables that accounted for most of the variation in fish condition were related to both inter- and intraspecific fish competition.

AB  - The discrepancy between laboratory or controlled conditions ecotoxicity tests and field data on wildlife chronically exposed to ionising radiation is presented for the first time. We reviewed the available chronic radiotoxicity data acquired in contaminated fields and used a statistical methodology to support the comparison with knowledge on inter-species variation of sensitivity to controlled external gamma irradiation. We focus on the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and effects data on terrestrial wildlife reported in the literature corresponding to chronic dose rate exposure situations (from background similar to 100 nGy/h up to similar to 10 mGy/h). When needed, we reconstructed the dose rate to organisms and obtained consistent unbiased data sets necessary to establish the dose rate - effect relationship for a number of different species and endpoints. Then, we compared the range of variation of radiosensitivity of species from the Chernobyl-Exclusion Zone with the statistical distribution established for terrestrial species chronically exposed to purely gamma external irradiation (or chronic Species radioSensitivity Distribution - SSD). We found that the best estimate of the median value (HDR50) of the distribution established for field conditions at Chernobyl (about 100 mu Gy/h) was eight times lower than the one from controlled experiments (about 850 mu Gy/h), suggesting that organisms in their natural environmental were more sensitive to radiation. This first comparison highlights the lack of mechanistic understanding and the potential confusion coming from sampling strategies in the field. To confirm the apparent higher sensitive of wildlife in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, we call for more a robust strategy in field, with adequate design to deal with confounding factors.

AB  - The natural flow paradigm suggests that components of the natural streamflow regime and variability should be managed to maintain important ecosystem functions and services. Mountain rivers can exhibit extreme flow variability and provide critical aquatic habitat and ecosystem services but can be severely impacted by hydroelectric power (HEP) development and operations that will likely increase in the future. The hydrologic modification from HEP operations in the Upper San Joaquin River Basin, California, was evaluated across 15 river and stream locations throughout the basin. Flow modifications in Bear Creek, an otherwise unimpacted high-elevation subbasin, were evaluated in detail using a number of hydrologic metrics, including Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), environmental flow components of IHA, flow duration curves, ecodeficit and comparisons using equivalence testing. The uncertainty of the metrics based on confidence intervals was also evaluated for unimpaired (upstream) and existing (impaired or downstream) conditions. Results showed that metrics for median values changed considerably for most locations under impaired conditions, but the direction and extent of change varied depending on the location and flow metric. Metrics for variability (coefficients of dispersion) changed even more. Most metrics showed that flow modifications in Bear Creek were substantial, including decreases in high flows and increases in most low-flow metrics. However, some flow variability metrics increased because of large flood flows during several years overwhelming and bypassing the dam/diversion structure. Uncertainty in metrics varied considerably throughout the basin but generally increased for impaired conditions. Uncertainty should be explicitly considered when evaluating hydrologic modification from HEP in mountain watersheds. A number of metrics should be used depending on objectives and spatial scale, including a subset of key IHA metrics across multiple sites and other methods to provide detailed information on flow modification in conjunction with other environmental flow assessment techniques at key locations.

AB  - Freshwater classification according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is based on estimation of the deviation between biological elements found on river stretch in comparison with communities detected in the same river type under reference conditions (undisturbed and near-natural habitats). We present analyses to describe macrophyte development in pristine lowland rivers and to reveal the variation among various stream types. The study is based on a country-wide survey of Poland with a dataset of 642 sites on 367 water courses. Surveyed rivers covered the whole lowland area of Poland. Field surveys were conducted using the Polish macrophyte approach, which enabled calculation of several macrophyte metrics. Firstly, a numerical index MIR (Macrophyte Index for Rivers) was computed, which reflects river degradation, especially eutrophication. Furthermore, five diversity metrics were calculated. Each survey, in addition to macrophyte assessment, was supplemented by a complex suite of environmental records. Reference conditions were defined using four criteria: (1) catchment land use, (2) hydromorphological features, (3) water quality and (4) biological assessment. The selected reference lowland rivers included 40 sites. To classify plant data, two-way indicator species analysis Twinspan was used. This resulted in distinguishing four end-clusters which were heterogeneous according to plant composition: organic rivers and three types of siliceous rivers (small with sandy substrate, small with stony substrate and large rivers). The differentiation of environmental factors between river types was confirmed by a variance analysis (ANOVA). Furthermore, the environmental database was explored with principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA principal components were analysed against river types with the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Finally botanical differences between identified river types have been detected, using botanical metrics the share of different macrophyte groups and relationships with particular species were defined.

AB  - Few researchers have assessed the important management questions regarding the sensitivity of indicators of aquatic ecosystem condition and the specificity with which anthropogenic development activities are described. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge as to the potential of structural and functional indicators to generate complementary knowledge about ecological condition that can be used to inform watershed management. We assessed 20 metrics of ecological structure and function at 19 riverine sites across the Red River watershed in the summer of 2010 using a gradient approach to test predictions that: (1) indicator sensitivity would vary with the specificity at which landscape development is described (i.e., coarse - land use [e.g., agriculture], medium - specific human activities [e.g., crop cultivation] and fine management practices [e.g., crop rotation]); and (2) structural and functional indicators respond to different types and specificity of anthropogenic development. Evaluation of indicators revealed that indicator sensitivity was frequently greater for assessment of specific human activities (i.e., wastewater treatment, crop cultivation or livestock production), than for broad land-use categories (i.e., agriculture or urban). Structural and functional indicators were often associated with different types of anthropogenic development suggesting additive rather than redundant assessment information. Structural indicators were almost exclusively associated with crop cultivation and agricultural land cover. In contrast, functional indicators were generally associated with gradients of wastewater treatment and urban land cover. Our results demonstrate that aquatic ecosystem assessment programs would benefit from considering the specific anthropogenic development activity to be assessed and managed in order to evaluate and select the most sensitive indicators of stream condition. Furthermore, combined use of structural and functional indicators in aquatic monitoring program appears to improve detection of anthropogenic impacts in a multiple stressor environment.

AB  - According to the guidelines of the European Water Framework Directive, assessment of the ecological quality of streams and rivers should be based on type-specific reference conditions. Moreover to support biological indicators an hydromorphological analysis is also requested for each river type. The rationale for including an habitat assessment in biomonitoring study is that a biological community can be influenced by habitat quality just as water chemistry.
   In the present work benthic macroinvertebrates were analysed in a specific river type of Central Italy (small-sized streams, volcanic-siliceous), to identify taxa assemblages at the mesohabitat scale and to test how common measures of benthic community used in biomonitoring differ between riffles and pools in order to evaluate if differences may influence water quality classification.
   Macroinvertebrates were collected in 10 selected streams, covering the whole quality range present in the geographic area from 'reference sites' to human-impacted sites, along a pool-riffle sequence following a multihabitat sampling protocol.
   We compared assemblage of macroinvertebrates found in different mesohabitats using principal component analysis (PCA). Similar site grouping was obtained in riffle, pool and abiotic analysis.
   The measures of diversity and abundance were used as replicates in ANOVA analysis to test differences between pools and riffles within the groups of sites. There were no significant differences in terms of taxa richness and total abundance.
   When we compared the abundance of each taxon we found significant differences only in the group of reference sites with 18 taxa (about 25%) that showed a significant habitat preference.
   Our findings support that macroinvertebrates assemblages reflected primarily the environmental conditions and differences at mesohabitat scale are strongly correlated to hydromorphological condition and are maximized in reference sites. However such differences do not influence the ecological status assessment in this typology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental release and biosafety of transgenic Bt crops have attracted global attention. China has a large area of saline-alkali land, which is ideal for large-scale production of Bt transgenic rice. Therefore an understanding of the fitness of Bt transgenic rice in saline-alkaline soils and the ability to predict its long-term environmental effects are important for the future sustainable use of these crops. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the fitness of cry1Ab/c transgenic rice in both farmland and natural ecosystems. Transgenic cry1Ab/c rice Huahui1, for which a national biosafety certificate was obtained, was grown on normal farmland and saline-alkaline soils in a glass greenhouse. The expression pattern of exogenous Cry1Ab/c protein, and vegetative and reproductive fitness of rice were assessed. The expression of the exogenous Cry1Ab/c protein in the transgenic rice grown on saline-alkaline soil was lower than that in the strain grown on farmland soil. Under both the soil conditions, vegetative growth abilities, as evaluated by tiller number and biomass, and reproductive growth abilities, as measured by filled grain number and filled grain weight per plant, showed a significantly higher fitness cost for Huahui1 than that for the parental rice Minghui63 grown under the same soil conditions. In saline-alkaline soil, the fitness cost of Huahui1 was moderately higher than that of Minghui63. Therefore, the ecological risk of cry1Ab/c transgenic rice is not expected to be higher than that of parental rice Minghui63 if the former escapes into natural saline-alkaline soil. The results of the present study provide a scientific basis to improve environmental safety assessment of the insect-resistant transgenic rice strain Huahui1 before commercialization.

AB  - Since European settlement (ca. 1824 CE), the subtropical inshore reefs of Moreton Bay have undergone rapid deterioration in water quality from changes in land-use practices, resource exploitation and rapid population growth, spurring marine managers to assess the drivers of ecological shifts. However, the short temporal-scale of most studies is an inadequate baseline for understanding the severity and magnitude of biological response. We present millennial-scale records employing palaeoecological and quantitative multivariate techniques within a concise chronological framework to analyse benthic foraminiferal community structure of reefs in Moreton Bay, Queensland. Well-constrained, UM-dated, millennial-scale records from sediment cores were used to document the long-term response of foraminifers to natural environmental variability. The temporal and spatial distribution patterns of foraminifers reveal long-term marginality throughout the similar to 7400 years of Holocene history, prior to European settlement. While specific faunal response to the effects of relative ENSO-climate and sea level fall are difficult to disentangle, the earlier phases of reef development are already represented by marginal taxa indicating possibly an earlier response to a decline in conditions. Overall, long-term consistency in conditions favoured two types of low diversity reef assemblages: 1) high density of small, heterotrophic and opportunistic species and 2) low density of photosymbiotic foraminiferal assemblages. Comparison of foraminiferal community composition between the Holocene and the present day indicates overlap in species composition supporting long-term marginality, particularly in the Western Bay. Such combined palaeoecological and recent studies can benefit long-term initiatives for monitoring present and future water quality conditions in the Bay's reef habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sandy beaches constitute high natural value ecosystems which have been worldwide a target for growing human activities and ensuing pressures in the last decades, which caused ecological damages on these environments and led to its environmental quality decline. However, little is known about the responses of these ecosystems to distinct stressors and pressures, and holistic and integrated coastal management actions that protect beach environments and their ecological processes are yet to be developed. The aim of this viewpoint article is to present and discuss the utility of using a population approach to macrofaunal key species as a helpful tool for the assessment, management, and sustainable use of sandy beaches. The role of macrofaunal key species as indicators of environmental changes and of ecological quality condition is discussed and illustrated by some practical examples from the literature. The population is presented as a highly relevant ecological unit in management and one of the easiest ones to use, responding more rapidly to disturbances in the ecosystem than the most complex units. In this context, bio-ecology and population dynamics models are presented as tools and their potential, to improve the way we assess and manage ecological quality conditions of beach ecosystems aiming at its sustainable use, are discussed. Also, the advantages and drawbacks of the use of these tools in the population approach are evaluated. Monitoring, assessment and management practices focusing on beach key species bioecology as ecological indicator hold large potential in nowadays fast changing scenario, and should be encouraged as a function of their identifiable responses to manmade and natural disturbances.

AB  - The intensification of dry seasons is a major threat to freshwater biodiversity in Neotropical regions. Little is known about resistance to drying stress and the underpinning traits in Neotropical freshwater species, so we don't know whether desiccation resistance allows to anticipate shifts in biological diversity under future climate scenarios. Here, we used the aquatic invertebrates that live in the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads, to examine the extent to which desiccation resistance of species measured in the laboratory predicts community response to drought intensification in nature. We measured desiccation resistance in 17 invertebrate species (> 90% of the biomass usually found in bromeliads of French Guiana) by recording the median lethal time (LT50) of experimental populations exposed to controlled conditions of residual moisture. In the field, we placed rainshelters above tank bromeliads to emulate drought scenarios ranging from the ambient norm to IPCC scenarios and extreme events, and we recorded the response of functional community structure. LT50 ranged from 4.18 to 19.06 days, and was related to cuticle content and dry body mass. Among other functional indicators that represent strategies to optimize resource use under stressful conditions (e.g., habitat use, trophic specialization), LT50 was the best predictor of community structure responses along a gradient of emulated drought intensities. Therefore, species' LT5Os measured under laboratory conditions can be used to forecast aquatic community response to drying stress in nature. Anticipating how species will cope with drought has never been more important for environmental managers to support climate change adaptation. We show that desiccation resistance in freshwater invertebrates is a key indicator of potential population size and local-global range shifts, and this could be especially true in the Neotropics where species have narrow physiological tolerances for climatic variation.

AB  - Due to the great number of ports along the European coast, defining the ecological potential of heavily modified water bodies (HMWBs) by the presence of ports is crucial in the development of river management plans. Numerous approaches have dealt with the assessment of the ecological status of natural water bodies, but there are few which specifically cover HMWBs. This contribution proposes pragmatic approaches to define the ecological potential of port areas. Besides being coherent with the hydromorphological alterations, the methodologies developed ensure the functioning of the ecosystem while recognizing that the communities and conditions found in HMWBs are highly determined by the major hazards associated to port activities. The main output is a versatile site-specific approach able to identify the best possible indicators and reference conditions (maximum ecological potential; MEP) to evaluate the ecological potential in port areas. The implementation at the port of Santander stressed the importance of considering water, sediments and biological indicators to evaluate the ecological potential, confirming sediments as the main testimony of the contaminant episodes.

AB  - Ecological risk assessments are, in part, based on results of toxicity tests conducted under standard exposure conditions. Global climate change will have a wide range of effects on estuarine habitats, including potentially increasing water temperature and salinity, which may alter the risk assessment of estuarine pollutants. We examined the effects of increasing temperature and salinity on the toxicity of common herbicides (irgarol, diuron, atrazine, and ametryn) to the phytoplankton species Dunaliella tertiolecta. Static 96-h algal bioassays were conducted for each herbicide under four exposure scenarios: standard temperature and salinity (25 degrees C, 20 ppt), standard temperature and elevated salinity (25 degrees C, 40 ppt), elevated temperature and standard salinity (35 degrees C, 20 ppt), and elevated temperature and elevated salinity (35 degrees C, 40 ppt). The endpoints assessed were algal cell density at 96 h, growth rate, chlorophyll a content, lipid content, and starch content. Increasing exposure temperature reduced growth rate and 96-h cell density but increased the cellular chlorophyll and lipid concentrations of the control algae. Exposure condition did not alter starch content of control algae. Herbicides were found to decrease growth rate, 96 h cell density, and cellular chlorophyll and lipid concentrations, while starch concentrations increased with herbicide exposure. Herbicide effects under standard test conditions were then compared with those observed under elevated temperature and salinity. Herbicide effects on growth rate, cell density, and starch content were more pronounced under elevated salinity and temperature conditions. To encompass the natural variability in estuarine temperature and salinity, and to account for future changes in climate, toxicity tests should be conducted under a wider range of environmental conditions.

AB  - On the basis of analyzing the ecological problems of the Northwest Pacific region, we suggest environmental objectives, the attainment of which is to ensure a good marine environment status in the region which is a necessary condition for sustainable nature management. We discuss the operational goals and quantitative criteria and indicators as required for monitoring the current status of ecosystems as well as the progress in achieving the objectives. An analysis is made of experience in using a similar approach in the European Union. It is shown that there is a difference of the environmental status monitoring techniques in the Northwest Pacific region where cooperative efforts on rationalization of nature management are not supported legislatively. In dealing with this problem, a special role would be played by regional and international cooperation, specifically within the United National Environment Programme in the Northwest Pacific region, contributing to a harmonization of the national monitoring systems. The need for international cooperation is also dictated by the irregularity of natural and socioeconomic conditions in the region, which makes the development of unified assessment methods difficult.

AB  - Increasingly, government and corporate policies on ecological compensation (e.g., offsetting) are requiring "net gain" outcomes for biodiversity. This presents an opportunity to align development with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework's (GBF) proposed ambition for overall biodiversity recovery. In this perspective, we describe three conditions that should be accounted for in net gain policy to align outcomes with biodiversity recovery goals: namely, a requirement for residual losses from development to be compensated for by (1) absolute gains, which are (2) scaled to the achievement of explicit biodiversity targets, where (3) gains are demonstrably feasible. We show that few current policies meet these conditions, which risks undermining efforts to achieve the proposed Post-2020 GBF milestones and goals, as well as other jurisdictional policy imperatives to halt and reverse biodiversity decline. To guide future decision-making, we provide a supporting decision tree outlining net gain compensation feasibility.

AB  - Unicellular free-living microbial eukaryotes of the order Arcellinida (Tubulinea; Amoebozoa) and Euglyphida (Cercozoa; SAR), commonly termed testate amoebae, colonise almost every freshwater ecosystem on Earth. Patterns in the distribution and productivity of these organisms are strongly linked to abiotic conditions-particularly moisture availability and temperature-however, the ecological impacts of changes in salinity remain poorly documented. Here, we examine how variable salt concentrations affect a natural community of Arcellinida and Euglyphida on a freshwater sub-Antarctic peatland. We principally report that deposition of wind-blown oceanic salt-spray aerosols onto the peatland surface corresponds to a strong reduction in biomass and to an alteration in the taxonomic composition of communities in favour of generalist taxa. Our results suggest novel applications of this response as a sensitive tool to monitor salinisation of coastal soils and to detect salinity changes within peatland palaeoclimate archives. Specifically, we suggest that these relationships could be used to reconstruct millennial scale variability in salt-spray deposition-a proxy for changes in wind-conditions-from sub-fossil communities of Arcellinida and Euglyphida preserved in exposed coastal peatlands.

AB  - Modern hybrids of sunflower show a pronounced response to changes in agrometeorological conditions of their growing. The research was carried out during 2013-2015 under conditions of insufficient moisture in the Southern steppe of Ukraine. Field and mathematical-statistical methods were used. A comparative assessment of levels of ecological stability was made for 7 sunflower hybrids (the company "Pioneer"). The application of plasticity and stability analysis by the Eberhard-Russell method allows carrying out an integrated assessment of new hybrids in terms of their adaptability to growing conditions and a reaction norm of genotypes to cultivation technology. In the dry steppe zone the sunflower realizes 45% of its genetic yield potential. The highest yield of the studied hybrids was observed in 2013 when, despite the unfavourable hydrothermal index of the year, the minimum relative air humidity during the flowering period was optimal (61.8%). A certain number of genotypes are characterized by the average group value of the plasticity index of yield (i.e. close to 1), namely: PR64LE19, PR64LE71, PR64LE11, PR64A71. Stability ranges from 0.29 in the hybrid PR64LE11 to 32.51 in the hybrid PR64LE19. The hybrids PR64LE71 and PR64LE19 change their ecological plasticity under varying growing conditions. The hybrid PR64F66 is less responsive to varying environments than the whole set of hybrids on average but, compared to others, exhibits average stability. The best results were shown by the hybrids PR64F50 and PR64A89, since they are more sensitive to varying environments and more stable than other hybrids. Growing hybrids of different levels of intensity, genetically and biologically diverse, allows the effective exploitation of agroecological potential of different zones.

AB  - A major part of the mechanisms that affects species distribution is related to environmental conditions. Within a stream channel the accumulation of substrates like litter, mots, stones, gravel and sand create habitats that act as shelter and/or food source to aquatic communities, in this way supporting, or not, the establishment of different species. Based on this fact we verified the structure of aquatic insect communities in organic and inorganic habitats within Cerrado streams. Tested for differences on genera richness (i), individual abundance (ii) and genera composition (iii) and also (iv) verified if there are any indicator genera, which are faithful and specific to organic or inorganic habitats. Sampled organic (litter) and inorganic (sand and gravel) substrates in five sections of three streams and collected individuals of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata and Heteroptera (EPTOH). Community composition differed between habitats, with organic ones having higher richness and abundance, besides being the only habitat that presented faithful and specific genera (six). It is argued that this difference may be caused due to shelter and food supply provided by organic substrates.

AB  - As part of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in 1991, the field efficacy of six 'research' indicators was examined in the estuarine systems of the Gulf of Mexico. The utility of these indicators was tested by examining those responses at both ends of multiple environmental gradients; namely, under minimally impacted conditions (reference) and heavily impacted conditions (by hypoxia, industrial discharges, agricultural runoff). In addition, the geographic effects of location (east and west of the Mississippi River) were examined. Numbers and frequencies of pathologies, abundance of splenic macrophage aggregates, and vertebral abnormalities showed response patterns that suggest wider field testing along full gradients rather than simply the extremes of the gradient are warranted. Selected blood proteins showed some promise but logistical constraints in estuarine environments may limit its utility Concentrations of selected organic compounds in bile showed no differences in this study between references and contaminated sites. Molecular bioindicators are discussed with regard to their potential utility as indicators of ecosystem conditions. Of these potential indicators, the use of vitellogenin assays as a measure of reproductive impairment and frequency of shell disease in selected crustaceans as an indicator of immunological aberrations deserve further examination.

AB  - Consequences of anthropogenic climate change directly affect freshwater ecosystems and their aquatic biological communities. Diatoms are amongst the most sensitive organisms to hydric stress, making them good indicators of preceding hydrological conditions. We assume that river types with low runoff and associated high temperature and mineralization host the most tolerant diatoms to climate change. We performed a cluster analysis with reference sites throughout Spain, based on their physiographic and hydrological characteristics. We obtained seven end-groups spread in the three existing ecoregions, onto which we estimated the indicator diatom taxa (IndVal). Brackish and aerophilic diatom were indicator taxa in mineralized and low discharge rivers. We simulated the impact of climate change on the river types, to conclude that under the RCP 8.5, the most impacted of all types would be the mineralized rivers. We predict higher homogenization in the diatom assemblages' composition, with higher proportion of planktonic taxa, and a potential increase of terrestrial and aerophilic diatoms, as the best adapted to the harsh conditions imposed by runoff reduction. Formulating clear predictions of climate change effects should rely on planned, long-term monitoring including accurate hydrological and biological data.

AB  - Sustainable exploitation of coastal ecosystems is facilitated by tools which allow reliable assessment of their response to anthropogenic pressures. The Infaunal Quality Index (IQI) and Multivariate-AMBI (M-AMBI) were developed to classify the ecological status (ES) of benthos for the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The indices respond reliably to the impacts of organic enrichment in muddy sand habitats, but their applicability across a range of pressures and habitats is less well understood. The ability of the indices to predict changes in response to pressures in three distinct habitats, intertidal muddy sand, maerl and inshore gravel, was tested using pre-existing datasets. Both responded following the same patterns of variation as previously reported. The IQI was more conservative when responding to environmental conditions so may have greater predictive value in dynamic habitats to provide an early-warning system to managers'. Re-calibration of reference conditions is necessary to reliably reflect ES in different habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Union has adopted several environmental directives, strategies, recommendations, and agreements that require a shift from local-or regional-based regulations to more ecosystem-based, holistic environmental management. Over the next decade, environmental management in Europe is likely to focus more on biological and ecological conditions rather than physical and chemical conditions, with ecosystem health at the center of regulation and management decision making. Successful implementation of this new ecosystem management and strategic assessment process in Europe will require the integration of regulatory and technical information and extensive collaboration from among European Union member countries, between agencies, and across disciplines to an unprecedented degree. It will also require extensive efforts to adapt current systems of environmental assessment and management to the basin and ecosystem level, across media and habitats, and considering a much broader set of impacts on ecosystem status than is currently addressed in most risk assessments. This will require the understanding, integration, and communication of economic, ecological, hydrological, and other processes across many spatial and temporal scales. This article discusses these challenges and describes some of the research initiatives that will help achieve integrated ecosystem management in Europe.

AB  - The Global Network of Mountain Observatories (GNOMO) is an international initiative seeking to increase communication and collaboration and align methodologies to assess commonalities and differences across the world's mountain landscapes. Oriented toward sustainable mountain development, GNOMO requires the integration of social and natural sciences, as well as a diverse array of stakeholder perspectives. This paper highlights challenges associated with integrating social sciences because of the inherent paradigmatic differences within the social sciences. The value orientations of mountain researchers, as well as the divergent societal and institutional values regarding mountains, create a need for new approaches to observing mountain landscapes. A framework is presented to organize complex information about mountain social-ecological systems based on human conditions (from vulnerability to wellbeing), environmental actions (from degradation to stewardship), and environmental conditions that vary across time, space, and scales. A multiparadigmatic, multimethod approach is proposed to combine theory-driven quantitative indicators, qualitative perspectives from diverse knowledge standpoints, and critical inquiries into power relationships to fully represent dynamic mountain systems.

AB  - The assessment of crown condition is an annually repeated core activity within the 'Intensive Forest Monitoring Programme' (Level II monitoring) at selected plots. As the intensive monitoring focuses on a better understanding of direct and indirect effects of air pollution at the ecosystem level, a considerable number of parameters are collected. This allows the analysis of numerous relationships which may determine tree-crown condition with respect to different ecological situations and their temporal variation. This article describes possibilities for integrated evaluations of crown condition data within the German Level II programme. Besides descriptions of defoliation and mortality rates over time, relationships among defoliation, and stand and site characteristics and sampling circumstances are explored. Autocorrelative properties of defoliation data are also described. The results reveal that the date of the field assessment is influential in three out of four species, while the dominance structure has effects in Scots pine and oak. Temporal variation of defoliation reveals strong plot-specific characteristics with limited possibilities for generalisations. Species-specific temporal auto-correlation structures were detected. Within integrated approaches, the 'federal state' variable gains high coefficients of determination; however, alternative models incorporating significant ecological factors also reveal plausible explanations. Interactions between predictors complicate the statistical approaches. This is also true for models that include temporal aspects of defoliation and indicators of climatic drought stress. Methodological limitations and significant interpretations are discussed. Statistical evaluations are restricted mainly by the low number of cases, limiting the number of predictors within multiple models. In the future, both a consequent processing of the collected data according to relevant questions and the application of advanced statistical models will be needed.

AB  - Several experimental studies support the effectiveness of lichen diversity as an indicator of environmental change. On the contrary, the potential of functional trait values of epiphytic lichens as indicators of environmental conditions is still poorly documented. Comparisons of lichen diversity across diverse regions may be problematic due to high levels of floristic variation related to differences in environmental conditions (e.g. climate and substrate availability and types). Species' functional traits may prove to be a user-friendly tool for large-scale and long-term ecological monitoring. This paper explores the use of functional traits of epiphytic lichen species as indicators of environmental conditions: we tested the susceptibility of the three easily discernible functional traits (growth form, reproductive strategy, and photobiont type) to environmental factors related to climate, human disturbance, and stand structure. Lichen diversity and associated species traits were recorded in 14 plots within the Italian ForestBiota network representing the four main forest types of Italy. For each plot, several predictors of forest structure, climatic features, and human-related disturbances were recorded. A forward variable selection method, based on permutations and parametric tests, was used to evaluate the response of lichen diversity and functional traits. Of the three species traits, growth form was the most responsive and was a reliable indicator for evaluating and comparing the responses of epiphytic lichens to climate, human disturbance, and stand structure-related conditions in forest ecosystems across diverse regions. However, further research is needed to better clarify the potential of lichen traits in bioindication. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Taxonomic composition, the presence of disturbance-sensitive species and abundance are attributes for monitoring the status of marine angiosperms; a biological quality element required for assessment of environmental condition under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), Their relevance for defining the ecological status of UK water bodies and the establishment of reference conditions for these attributes are described.
   Founded on quantitative measurements of these attributes, a set of metrics has been developed for monitoring and assessment of the only truly marine angiosperms, seagrass. The proposed metrics are presented and tested against a variety of littoral and sublittoral UK seagrass beds. In combination they express the cumulative response of marine angiosperms to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paleolimnological study used ostracodes assemblages, element concentrations, organic and inorganic carbon content, organic C:N ratios, and stable isotope values in valves of the ostracodes Cytheridella ilosvayi as paleoindicators and is the first such investigation from a mid-elevation site in southern Mexico. We provide a similar to 7600-year (9540-1970 BP) environmental history from karst Lake Ocotalito (920 m a.s.l.), which lies in the Lacandon Forest of Chiapas, Mexico. A 5.4-m sediment core was retrieved from a water depth of 23 m. The main factor that shaped ostracodes species assemblages throughout the Holocene was lake level. A total of six species were identified, and the benthic Cytheridella ilosvayi was dominant. Less abundant species included nektobenthic taxa Cypridopsis okeechobei, Heterocypris putei, and Potamocypris sp. and benthic species Darwinula stevensoni and Pseudocandona sp. Wet conditions, high lake levels (>15 m), and low ostracodes abundances characterized the period between similar to 9540 and similar to 7820 BP. From similar to 7750 to 6460 BP, indicators point to stable conditions and intermediate lake levels (similar to 15 m). Greatest ostracodes abundance and diversity occurred from similar to 6200 to similar to 4030 BP, during which mainly drier conditions were inferred, interrupted by short, humid periods. Lower abundances and low Sr and delta O-18 values characterized the period from similar to 3810 to similar to 1970 BP and indicate higher lake levels, that is, wetter conditions. Throughout this period, however, a slight trend toward drier conditions was observed. Comparison with paleolimnological studies in other karst lakes from the region suggests mid-altitude aquatic ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate fluctuations than lakes in the lowlands. For instance, stable isotope records from the Lake Ocotalito core display greater ranges. This, however, may simply reflect inter-lake differences in sensitivity, controlled by lake-specific hydrologic factors. The record from Lake Ocotalito fills an important gap in our knowledge of past biotic diversity, paleoclimate, and paleoenvironmental conditions in the northern Neotropics.

AB  - Phytocoenoses in environmental contact zones reveal in more detail modern trends in the genesis of ecosystems of any range of their organization. Phytocoenoses formed under the extrazonal conditions within definite environmental zones (plant types) play a role of informational models of environmental changes. Such communities can serve as indicators of existing processes and of occurred changes for last decades as well as reflect trends of spontaneous and anthropogenic dynamics of plants formation under definite physical-geographic conditions on a concrete territory. We revealed ecological geographic composition of plants species in taiga-steppe communities reflecting modern structural-dynamic organization of plants at one Pre-Baikalian site, which is contrast by its environmental conditions. It reflects the peculiarities of phytocoenoses formation at the contact of light-coniferous taiga and extrazonal steppe of Lake Baikal western shore.

AB  - A difficult challenge in ecological risk assessment can be determining what constitutes the "background" or ground-state condition for a site. This is because off-site conditions may not reflect to any relevant degree the history of the site itself and may therefore not be appropriate as benchmarks. One of the more important concerns is that underestimates may be made regarding contaminant-related impacts on-site because observations may indicate that community or population quality onsite equals or surpasses that observed off-site. In other cases, overestimates of the degree of contaminant impact may be made if environmental resources on-site are highly managed or devoid of natural communities. As such, management decisions may be confounded by artifacts of non-toxicant-related human influence and will not necessarily appropriately address the contaminant-related issues. Examples of these conditions are discussed herein.

AB  - Assessing landscape patterns in climate vulnerability, as well as resilience and resistance to drought, disturbance, and invasive species, requires appropriate metrics of relevant environmental conditions. In dryland systems of western North America, soil temperature and moisture regimes have been widely utilized as an indicator of resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasive plant species by providing integrative indicators of long-term site aridity, which relates to ecosystem recovery potential and climatic suitability to invaders. However, the impact of climate change on these regimes, and the suitability of the indicator for estimating resistance and resilience in the context of climate change have not been assessed. Here we utilized a daily time-step, process-based, ecosystem water balance model to characterize current and future patterns in soil temperature and moisture conditions in dryland areas of western North America, and evaluate the impact of these changes on estimation of resilience and resistance. Soil temperature increases in the twenty-first century are substantial, relatively uniform geographically, and robust across climate models. Higher temperatures will expand the areas of mesic and thermic soil temperature regimes while decreasing the area of cryic and frigid temperature conditions. Projections for future precipitation are more variable both geographically and among climate models. Nevertheless, future soil moisture conditions are relatively consistent across climate models for much of the region. Projections of drier soils are expected in most of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as the central and southern U.S. Great Plains. By contrast, areas with projections of increasing soil moisture include northeastern Montana, southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, and many areas dominated by big sagebrush, particularly the Central and Northern Basin and Range and the Wyoming Basin ecoregions. In addition, many areas dominated by big sagebrush are expected to experience pronounced shifts toward cool season moisture, which will create more area with xeric moisture conditions and less area with ustic conditions. In addition to indicating widespread geographic shifts in the distribution of soil temperature and moisture regimes, our results suggest opportunities for enhancing the integration of these conditions into a quantitative framework for assessing climate change impacts on dryland ecosystem resilience and resistance that is responsive to long-term projections.

AB  - The high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions of the Southern Ocean were explored with an ecological model (SWAMCO) describing the cycling of C, N, P, Si and Fe through different, aggregated, chemical and biological compartments of the plankton ecosystem. The structure of the model was chosen to take explicitly into account biological processes of importance in the formation and mineralization of carbon biomass in surface waters and in carbon export production. State variables include major inorganic nutrients (NO3, NH4, PO4, SI(OH)(4)), dissolved Fe, two groups of phytoplankton (diatoms and nanoflagellates), bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, microzooplankton, labile DOC and two classes of dissolved and particulate organic polymers with specific biodegradability. The model is closed by export production of particulate organic matter out of the surface layer and, when relevant, by metazooplanton, the grazing pressure of which is described as a forcing function. Parameterization was derived from the current knowledge on the kinetics of biological processes in the Southern Ocean and in other 'HNLC' areas. For its application in the Atlantic sector in spring 1992, the SWAMCO model was coupled 'off-line' to a 1D physical model forced by in situ meteorological and sea-ice conditions. The predictions of the model were successfully compared with chemical and biological observations recorded in the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) during the 1992 cruise ANTX/6 of RV Polarstern. In particular, the model simulates quite well the diatom bloom and carbon export event observed in the iron-enriched Polar Frontal region and the lack of ice-edge phytoplankton blooms in the marginal zone (MIZ) of the ACC area. Model analysis shows that sufficient light and iron concentrations above 0.5 mu mol m(-3) are the necessary conditions for enhancing diatom blooms and particulate carbon export production in the Southern Ocean. Low iron availability prevents diatom growth but is still adequate for nanophytoplankton, the biomass of which is, however, kept to Chi a levels less than 1 mg(-3) due to the loss by the ubiquitous micrograzers. Little carbon export is predicted under iron-limitation conditions. Sensitivity tests conducted on the parameters describing iron and silicon uptake by diatoms reveal the complex nature of Fe and Si limitation in regulating the magnitude and extent of diatom blooms and carbon and opal export production in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are complex ecosystems representing an important source of biodiversity for coastal marine systems, but are subjected to numerous threats from natural and human-based influences. Due to their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions, seagrasses are habitually used in monitoring programmes as biological indicators to assess the ecological status of coastal environments. In this paper we used a non-destructive photo mosaicing technology to quantify seagrass distribution and abundance, and explore benefits of micro-cartographic analysis. Furthermore, the use of photogrammetric tools enhanced the method, which proved to be efficient due to its use of low-cost instruments and its simplicity of implementation. This paper describes the steps required to use this method in meadows of Posidonia oceanica, including: i) camera calibration procedures, ii) programming of video survey, iii) criteria to perform sampling activities, iv) data processing and micro-georeferenced maps restitution, and v) possible study applications.

AB  - Inter-individual variability of tree drought responses within a stand has received little attention. Here we explore whether the spatial variations in soil/subsoil properties assessed through Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) could explain variations in drought response traits among trees.
   We used ERT to compute the percent variation in resistivity (PVR) between dry and wet conditions as an indicator of spatial variability in total available water content. PVR was computed in two different depth ranges (0-2 and 2-5 m) for eleven Quercus ilex stools in a Mediterranean forest stand. PVR values were compared to biological traits, including tree water status (predawn water potential (Psi)), leaf traits (delta C-13, leaf mass area (LMA)), and canopy defoliation measured after intense drought.
   We found significant correlations between PVR and biological variables. For Psi, the nature and strength of the correlations vary according to the level of drought intensity. The correlation between Psi and PVR was positive during well-watered conditions in the upper layer (0-2 m) and during water-limited conditions in the deeper layer (2-5 m). During most severe droughts, however, the Psi was negatively correlated with PVR in the upper layer. Trees with lower PVR in the upper layer were also associated with water use efficiency (higher delta C-13), higher LMA, and a lower level of defoliation after extreme drought.
   Overall, our results indicate that local differences in soil/subsoil properties affect tree response to drought and suggest that less favorable soil/subsoil conditions (lower PVR) can lead to lower water stress during the driest period and to lower defoliation after extreme drought Plausible explanations for this better acclimation include higher stomatal regulation and improved deep soil and subsoil water exploration by trees located in more adverse conditions. We encourage the development of ERT in ecological studies to further explore the interrelated relationships between soil/subsoil, climate, and tree functioning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deserts have been predicted to be one of the most responsive ecosystems to global climate change. In this study, we examine the spatial and demographic response of a keystone endemic plant of the Namib Desert (Welwitschia mirabilis), for which displacement and reduction of suitable climate has been foreseen under future conditions. The main aim is to assess the association between ongoing climate change and geographical patterns of welwitschia health, reproductive status, and size. We collected data on welwitschia distribution, health condition, reproductive status, and plant size in northern Namibia. We used ecological niche models to predict the expected geographic shift of suitability under climate change scenarios. For each variable, we compared our field measurements with the expected ongoing change in climate suitability. Finally, we tested the presence of simple geographical gradients in the observed patterns. The historically realized thermal niche of welwitschia will be almost completely unavailable in the next 30 years in northern Namibia. Expected reductions of climatic suitability in our study sites were strongly associated with indicators of negative population conditions, namely lower plant health, reduced recruitment and increased adult mortality. Population condition does not follow simple latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. The observed pattern of population traits is consistent with climate change trends and projections. This makes welwitschia a suitable bioindicator (i.e. a 'sentinel') for climate change effect in the Namib Desert ecosystems. Our spatially explicit approach, combining suitability modeling with geographic combinations of population conditions measured in the field, could be extensively adopted to identify sentinel species, and detect population responses to climate change in other regions and ecosystems.

AB  - Fish larvae of four SE Brazilian estuaries were investigated to assess if the larval fish assemblages reflect the ecological status of estuaries. All samples were collected in the same water mass to guarantee similar natural water parameters, assuring that major differences among estuaries were related to anthropogenic pressures. Water temperature, oxygen, pH, Chlorophyll a , faecal coliforms, nutrient load and total particulate matter were obtained at each sampling area. A pressure index was used to assess the overall anthropogenic pressures acting in each estuary. Results showed that fish larvae were sensitive to water contamination, reducing the diversity and especially exhibiting a high dominance of few species. Furthermore, this study reinforced the idea that the high sensitivity of fish larvae can increase the accuracy of the environmental assessments when tackling short-time events of hydrological controls (physical barriers and control of the freshwater input), representing an advance in the water ecological quality assessments.

AB  - Spring flux (m/s), defined as spring flow (m(3)/s) divided by the area over which groundwater emerges (m(2)) at a spring, provides a meaningful way to distinguish between fracture and seepage-filtration source geomorphologies for rheocrenes in Wisconsin, USA, and may be useful in distinguishing spring source geomorphologies in other regions as well. For 20 fracture and seepage-filtration springs investigated in this study, the median spring flux for fracture springs is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the median spring flux for seepage-filtration springs, whereas median discharges are similar. Relationships were also found to exist between spring flux and spring habitat characteristics. High spring flux due to focused discharge from a few large fractures, is associated with spatial consistency in water temperature and more heterogeneous substrata near the spring source. Lower spring flux due to the emergence of water from numerous water sources across a spring pool is associated with greater spatial variation in water temperature and more homogeneous substrata near the spring source. Used in association with other environmental conditions, spring flux could be useful in predicting spring habitat conditions where detailed ecological assessments are neither available nor feasible.

AB  - The spatial distribution and structure of nematode assemblages in the area surrounding the harbour of Vado Ligure (Savona, NW Mediterranean) were studied in relation to the influence of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors. Stations were selected following an "anthropogenic gradient" from sites located near the city centre and its harbour to more pristine and distant sites. Sediment quality was determined by considering both sediment granulometric and chemical parameters (hydrocarbons, heavy metals, total organic matter, proteins, carbohydrates) as well as nematode abundance, diversity, life strategies, trophic structure and assemblage composition. A high correlation between environmental characteristics and the nematode response was found. On the basis of the comparison of these results, which identified three distinct sub-areas associated with different levels of environmental quality, a set of nematode indicator genera was selected for the future evaluation of quality status.

AB  - Mutigenerational studies are now of great interest in ecotoxicology and previous studies have shown the importance of conducting multigenerational studies when assessing radiation toxicity in fish. In our study, the first objective was to study the early life stages (embryo-larval stages) and critical functions such as reproduction (which are generally studied in the context of ecological risk assessment (ERA)), in order to assess the sensitivity of zebrafish to ionizing radiation. The second objective was to assess acquisition of phenotypic effects at select life stages over generations. To our knowledge, this was the first time that irradiation of zebrafish (0.05 and 5 mGy.h(-1)) up to generation F2 was maintained with the following two exposure conditions: (1) recovery, only FO genitors were irradiated and the progeny were placed in control condition, (2) irradiated condition, all generations were exposed. Multigenerational irradiation affected Fl parental reproductive capacity (reproductive success) mainly over the first reproductive cycle (104d) and larval survival rate. Unexpected yet significant effects on sex ratio were observed in Fl progeny after parental irradiation (mainly at 5 mGy.h(-1)). These effects were observed for both conditions -irradiated and recovery- suggesting transmitted effects from FO genitors to offspring. All studied life stages were affected by ionizing radiation (IR), suggesting an alteration of vital physiological functions (reproduction and sexual determination). Such results highlight the hypothesis that IR affects population dynamics. In addition, the clear evidence of transmitted effects suggests worsening of effects at the population scale over generations. This approach is closer to environmental conditions to assess wild population fate, and thus highlights the importance of multigenerational studies to support ERA of ionizing radiation in fish.

AB  - The ecological assessment of freshwaters is currently primarily based on biological communities and the reference condition approach (RCA). In the RCA, the communities in streams and lakes disturbed by humans are compared with communities in reference conditions with no or minimal anthropogenic influence. The currently favored rationale is using selected community metrics for which the expected values (E) for each site are typically estimated from environmental variables using a predictive model based on the reference data. The proportional differences between the observed values (O) and E are then derived, and the decision rules for status assessment are based on fixed (typically 10th or 25th) percentiles of the O/E ratios among reference sites. Based on mathematical formulations, illustrations by simulated data and real case studies representing such an assessment approach, we demonstrate that the use of a common quantile of O/E ratios will, under certain conditions, cause severe bias in decision making even if the predictive model would be unbiased. This is because the variance of O/E under these conditions, which seem to be quite common among the published applications, varies systematically with E. We propose a correction method for the bias and compare the novel approach to the conventional one in our case studies, with data from both reference and impacted sites. The results highlight a conceptual issue of employing ratios in the status assessment. In some cases using the absolute deviations instead provides a simple solution for the bias identified and might also be more ecologically relevant and defensible.

AB  - On the basis and in connection with the analysis of geoinformation and cartographic massifs, taking into account environmental and economic (ecological) premises, agrolandscape zoning of the territory of the North Kazakhstan region, the oldest region of bogharic agriculture of Kazakhstan, was carried out. The methodological side of the research was based on statistical and geographic information analysis, as well as landscape, landscape mapping and comparative geographical methods were used. The heterogeneous characteristic of region's relief ( flat north and low hill south) predetermined the landscape heterogeneity of the territory, and fertile black soils and relatively favorable agroclimatic resources determined the total plowing of the territory. The share of arable land (about 50 % of the region's territory) reached an absolute maximum after virgin land development due to frontal plowing, including low-productive land soils complex with alkali soils. In the post-virgin period, despite the excessive interest in soil protection and anti-erosion measures, the cholistic principle field farming organizing and ignoring the fertility of soil differences within a specific arable allocation, predetermined the further extensification of agriculture. This led to the exclusive dependence of the dominant crop yield, spring wheat, on meteorological conditions (primarily precipitation), the greatest direct correlation was found for steppe agrolandscapes (r = 0.78). The need for such zoning is dictated by the transition from a purely extensive zonal system of agriculture, with its inherent chemical and technological intensification, to landscape agriculture. In addition, the comparison of agroclimatic indicators of the region's territory with data for late Soviet period given by V.I. Kiryushin, showed significant changes, mainly favorable to agricultural activities: for example, biological productivity increased from 1983 by 16-27 %. With the help of predictor factors, determining the direction and nature of agricultural use of land, agrolandscape zoning of the territory of the region was carried out with allocation of 5 landscape areas and 11 agrolandscape types of land, based on updated agroclimatic indicators. The determining factors for the allocation of agrolandscape land types under condition of the relative homogeneity of agroclimatic indicators within the landscape area were lithology, relief and soil types, which ultimately determine the contour of the working field of arable allotments. The introduction of zoning results into agronomic practice will increase the economic stability of agriculture, creating the necessary premises for the transition to adaptive landscape agriculture.

AB  - Holistic ecosystem health indices are urgently needed for conserving and managing rapidly dwindling mangrove ecosystems. The appropriate indices should provide consistent outcomes that enable both the assessment of current conditions and assist future planning. The previous approaches mostly focus on the structural condition of trees, with mangrove ecosystems often treated as terrestrial forests. Structural features are too insensitive as representatives of negative internal creeping changes. Some unique mangrove ecosystem attributes can react to anthropogenic pressures much faster than tree or forest structures do, making them more useful as early warning indicators. The development of holistic indicators requires a multidimensional approach engaging specific functions and services underpinning the characteristics of mangrove ecosystems. We present an approach to identify potential variables ranging from assemblage structure to physiological and biochemical variables for reliably indicating mangrove condition. These indicators could then be tested against a range of ecosystem conditions (e.g. disturbance levels) to reveal their response to different degrees of pressures. These variables were first nominated based on the driver-response model relating changes in environmental conditions and ecosystem responses. The nominated variables were then prioritised through an expert questionnaire survey, in which the experts scored every nominated variable on the efficiency, the number of pertinent ecosystem services and the time required them to reflect the impact of the pressure. Sediment properties and elements of forest structure featured strongly in the survey, followed by variables pertaining to biomass, vegetation status and carbon cycling. With respect to community composition, components of the higher trophic levels (e.g. crabs, other macrofauna) were ranked higher by the experts. The mangrove-tree-related variables (e.g. Importance Value Index, IVI), associated biotic components of insects, annelids and moss were ranked lowest. These results provide the basis for establishing a specific framework for mangrove ecosystem assessment.

AB  - Knowledge of site-specific water conditions is important in forestland evaluation and fundamental for a sustainable forest management. In Central Europe, traditional site mapping has followed an integrated ecological approach. The assessment of soil water availability is based on overlaying relief and descriptive soil information. It is a relative system referring to an (hypothetical) equilibrium between relief-dependent soil conditions and the potential natural forest association at a given regional climate. Accordingly, the climatic settings are supposed to be constant and are mostly based on long-term means of precipitation and air temperature. However, long-term climate changes, as well as infrequent climatic extremes have not been considered adequately. Furthermore, the feedback of forest management itself on available soil water cannot be addressed. To overcome these shortcomings, we developed an approach in which the soil hydrological model LWF-BROOK90 is organized in a GIS-frame to simulate the daily water fluxes and soil moisture status. Spatially distributed meteorological input data is generated from long-term station data using special regionalization procedures. Model parameterization for soil physical properties by horizon are derived from detailed forest soil maps using pedotransfer functions. Thus, we obtained data on all components of the water balance depending on climate, aspect, slope, vertical soil properties, and stand conditions in a spatial resolution of 25 m x 25 m. In addition to the common output of site water balance models, additional indicators were implemented to enable the quantification of 'transpiration stress', 'soil drought stress', and 'excess soil water stress'. Soil water evaluation is based on the number of days exceeding defined thresholds of parameter values. The implemented soil water indices were suitable to reflect relevant differences in the soil water conditions between sites whereas focusing on individual and extreme years rather than on long-term averages seems to be more appropriate for assessing water-related tree growth conditions. The next step will be to produce forest site maps based on such 'stress' indicators. The novel approach provides a more objective description of variable soil water conditions than the currently used mapping approach. Furthermore, it makes spatial hydrological data (e.g. groundwater recharge) available for use beyond forest management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the July 2006 issue of Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, a paper by Harwell and Gentile was published assessing the present ecological significance of the impacts from the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). First, this paper compares the major conclusions of Harwell and Gentile and a paper reviewing the current impacts of EVOS by Peterson et al. as published by Science in 2003. Stark differences exist between the conclusions of the 2 papers regarding continuing impacts. Part of the difference appears to be the infusion of different social values or policy goals into each. Normative science is the use or interpretation of data in support of specific values or policies. Examples of values or policies intertwined with science are constructs such as ecosystem health, ecosystem integrity, ecological significance, and recovery. Examination of the environmental risk assessment and toxicology literature reveals that the symptoms of normative science are common and the implications widespread. Separation of science from policy or at a minimum a transparent acknowledgment of the science-policy interaction is clearly necessary in order to obtain a clear picture of the ecological system under investigation.

AB  - Bioindicators, based on a large variety of organisms, have been increasingly used in the assessment of the status of aquatic systems. In marine coastal waters, seagrasses have shown a great potential as bioindicator organisms, probably due to both their environmental sensitivity and the large amount of knowledge available. However, and as far as we are aware, only little attention has been paid to euryhaline species suitable for biomonitoring both transitional and marine waters. With the aim to contribute to this expanding field, and provide new and useful tools for managers, we develop here a multi-bioindicator index based on the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa.
   We first compiled from the literature a suite of 54 candidate metrics, i. e. measurable attribute of the concerned organism or community that adequately reflects properties of the environment, obtained from C nodosa and its associated ecosystem, putatively responding to environmental deterioration. We then evaluated them empirically, obtaining a complete dataset on these metrics along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Using this dataset, we selected the metrics to construct the index, using, successively: (i) ANOVA, to assess their capacity to discriminate among sites of different environmental conditions; (ii) PCA, to check the existence of a common pattern among the metrics reflecting the environmental gradient; and (iii) feasibility and cost-effectiveness criteria.
   Finally, 10 metrics (out of the 54 tested) encompassing from the physiological (delta N-15, delta S-34, % N, % P content of rhizomes), through the individual (shoot size) and the population (root weight ratio), to the community (epiphytes load) organisation levels, and some metallic pollution descriptors (Cd, Cu and Zn content of rhizomes) were retained and integrated into a single index (CYMOX) using the scores of the sites on the first axis of a PCA. These scores were reduced to a 0-1 (Ecological Quality Ratio) scale by referring the values to the optimal (reference) and worst (most degraded) conditions. The ecological status of sites obtained applying CYMOX correlated significantly with the environmental gradient, validating its adequacy to reflect ecosystem health.
   In conclusion, the results presented here suggest that this index can be an adequate alternative for ecological status assessment in water bodies where other species are absent and, specifically, in transitional waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Costa Rica, the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge (MNWLR) contains a unique habitat gradient ranging from primary old growth forests, grasslands, pastures, to various ages of secondary forests. Within these primary old growth forests are extremely dense naturally occurring Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae) patches that often grow with densities up to 2 plants per square meter. A previous study found that anti-fungal activity of this particular plant appears to be altering the fungal community in soils adjacent to these plants. No work has been previously conducted on the possible effects of this plant community on soil faunal communities and if seasonality contributes to changes in soil invertebrate populations along a moisture gradient. Thus, a study was conducted to assess the effects of this specialized plant community on soil invertebrates with respect to season, and if these changes in soil fauna guild structure could prove to be valid candidates as indicators of ecosystem condition with changes in precipitation. In addition, a meta-analysis was done to determine how the bromeliad-associated soil invertebrate communities differ from those in adjacent primary forest soils. Therefore, comparisons were determined from previous primary forest soil invertebrate environmental DNA (eDNA) to the current wet season bromeliad soil invertebrate eDNA. Roche 454 pyro-sequencing was conducted on the 650 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of invertebrates to obtain and characterize soil invertebrate sequence composition. To determine relationships among soil fauna guilds across seasons, relative abundance of the sequences were calculated, and used in conjunction with EcoSim niche overlap and co-occurrence values. From the bromeliad seasonal soil fauna eDNA study, it appears certain invertebrate guilds are driven by moisture as indicated by fluctuations in relative abundance of each invertebrate guild across seasons in bromeliad patch soils, as well as indicated by EcoSim niche overlap values. In particular, Guilds 1, 4, and 5, should warrant further investigation as indicators of habitat condition. The meta-analysis showed that a naturally occurring modified environment (the bromeliad patches), can result in differences in relative abundance and partitioning of a limited resource between invertebrate guild structure. Those guilds associated with microbivorous and complex decomposition activities (i.e. Guilds 3 and 4), are more abundant in primary forest soils than bromeliad patch soils and could potentially used for bioindicators of habitat perturbations.

AB  - The health status of European aquatic environments, including transitional waters such as coastal lagoons, is regulated by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which requires the classification of the water bodies' environmental quality and the achievement of a good ecological status by 2015. In the Venice lagoon, a transitional water body located in the northeastern part of Italy, the achievement of a good ecological status is hampered by several anthropogenic and natural pressures, such as sediment and water chemical contamination, and sediment erosion. In order to evaluate the lagoon's environmental quality according to the WFD (i.e. 5 quality classes, from High to Bad), an integrated Weight-of-Evidence methodology was developed and applied to classify the quality of the lagoon water bodies, integrating biological, physicochemical, chemical, ecotoxicological, and hydromorphological data (i.e. Lines of Evidence, LOE). The quality assessment was carried out in two lagoon habitat typologies (previously defined on the basis of morphological, sediment, and hydrodynamic characteristics) which were selected taking into account the ecological gradient from sea to land, and the differences in anthropogenic pressure and contamination levels. The LOE classification was carried out by using indicators scored by comparing site specific conditions to reference conditions measured in lagoon reference sites, or provided by local, national or European regulations (e.g. Environmental Quality Standards, EQS, for chemicals). Finally, the overall quality status for each water body was calculated by a probabilistic approach, i.e. by reporting the final result as the frequency distribution of quality classes. The developed procedure was applied by using data and information concerning selected LOE and collected from monitoring programs and research studies carried out in the last 15 years in the lagoon of Venice. A set of sampling stations characterized by spatially and temporally coherent information for each LOE was selected, and among these stations, potential reference sites for each water body typology were identified. The quality assessment highlighted that there are specific lagoon areas, especially those located near the industrially developed area, which are highly affected by anthropogenic activities, and that chemical contamination is one of the main pressures affecting ecological status (e.g. macro-benthonic biodiversity) in the Venice lagoon. The integrated quality assessment procedure that was developed provided a new tool supporting decision making, as well as lagoon assessment and management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Population progress is one of the main factors affecting the environment, modifying the natural dynamics of ecosystems. The Camboriu River Basin is located on the southern coast of Brazil and is strongly affected by population growth. This paper aimed to verify the space-time variation in the land use of the Camboriu River Basin by identifying changes in occupation and land use between 1986 and 2017. The rapid environmental assessment protocol was applied using the following parameters: bottom substrate, habitat complexity, backwaters quality, stability of banks, vegetative protection, vegetative cover, vegetative quality, and riparian vegetation presence. The changes in occupation and land use show rapid urbanization with a rise of 9% in 1986 to 24% in 2017. In riparian forest, higher altitude regions of the watershed show better results when compared to lower course regions, which are, thus, reflected in the environmental integrity of the stretches of stream studied. As for the behavior of urban occupation in space, it was verified that it did not occur continuously in comparison with the population, data during the studied period.

AB  - P>Patterns of taxa abundance distributions are the result of the combined effects of historical and biological processes and as such are central to ecology. It is accepted that a taxa abundance distribution for a given community of animals or plants following a perturbation will typically change in structure from one of high evenness to increasing dominance. Subsequently, such changes in evenness have been used as indicators of biological integrity and environmental assessment. Here, using replicated experimental treehole microcosms perturbed with different concentrations of the pollutant pentachlorophenol, we investigated whether changes in bacterial community structure would reflect the effects of anthropogenic stress in a similar manner to larger organisms. Community structure was visualized using rank-abundance plots fitted with linear regression models. The slopes of the regression models were used as a descriptive statistic of changes in evenness over time. Our findings showed that bacterial community structure reflected the impact and the recovery from an anthropogenic disturbance. In addition, the intensity of impact and the rate of recovery to pre-perturbation structure were dose-dependent. These properties of bacterial community structures may potentially provide a metric for environmental assessment and regulation.

AB  - Resacas of the lower Rio Grande River (secondary channels, distributaries, oxbow lakes) are vital freshwater wetlands under intense anthropogenic pressure. Many of these wetlands have their water levels tightly managed and some are being restored. Reliable bioassessment methods to effectively discriminate among resacas of differing ecological status are needed. Common components of bioassessments for aquatic ecosystems include surveys of biological communities, among which the macroinvertebrates are generally considered the most accurate. The macroinvertebrate community of resacas is virtually undocumented and various sampling methods have never been used in parallel. Here we used two popular sampling techniques (benthic corer and dip net), while producing the first portrait of the macroinvertebrate community inhabiting resacas. Despite sampling different invertebrate assemblage subsets, both methods discriminated among studied resacas in a similar manner; however, the corer presents several advantages including: 1) a much higher precision (based on coefficients of variation), 2) more adequate representation of an indicator species (invasive gastropod), and 3) clearer differences in functional feeding groups among resacas which constitutes an additional indicator metric.
